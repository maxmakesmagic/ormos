The Release Notes include information concerning the release of a new *Magic: The Gathering* set, as well as a collection of clarifications and rulings involving that set’s cards. It’s intended to make playing with the new cards more fun by clearing up the common misconceptions and confusion inevitably caused by new mechanics and interactions. As future sets are released, updates to the *Magic* rules may cause some of this information to become outdated. If you can’t find the answer you’re looking for here, please contact us at [**Wizards.com/CustomerService**](http://www.wizards.com/CustomerService).


The “General Notes” section includes release information and explains the mechanics and concepts in the set.


The “Card-Specific Notes” section contains answers to the most important, most common, and most confusing questions players might ask about cards in the set. Items in the “Card-Specific Notes” section include full card text for your reference. Not all cards in the set are listed.

**GENERAL NOTES**


**Release Information**


The *Oath of the Gatewatch* set contains 184 cards (70 common, 60 uncommon, 42 rare, and 12 mythic rare). Some *Oath of the Gatewatch* booster packs also contain *Zendikar Expeditions* cards (see below).


Prerelease events: January 16–17, 2016


Launch Weekend: January 22–24, 2016


Game Day: February 13–14, 2016


The *Oath of the Gatewatch* set becomes legal for sanctioned Constructed play on its official release date: Friday, January 22, 2016. At that time, the following card sets will be permitted in the Standard format: *Khans of Tarkir™*, *Fate Reforged™*, *Dragons of Tarkir™*, *Magic Origins*, *Battle for Zendikar™*, and *Oath of the Gatewatch.*


Go to [**Magic.Wizards.com/Rules**](http://magic.wizards.com/rules) for a complete list of formats and permitted card sets.


Go to [**Wizards.com/Locator**](http://www.wizards.com/locator) to find an event or store near you.




---

**Zendikar Expeditions**


Enlist the land itself in the battle against the Eldrazi with *Zendikar Expeditions*. This special set includes Zendikari versions of exciting lands from throughout **Magic** history.


* There are twenty *Zendikar Expeditions* cards that appear in *Oath of the Gatewatch* booster packs. They have collector numbers 26 through 45. (The first twenty-five cards appeared in *Battle for Zendikar* booster packs.) *Zendikar Expeditions* cards have their own expansion symbol.
* *Zendikar Expeditions* cards are very rare. You can expect to open one only a little more frequently than a premium foil *Battle for Zendikar* mythic rare.
* *Zendikar Expeditions* cards are playable in any Limited event using the booster packs that contained them. In a Sealed Deck tournament, those cards are part of your card pool. In a Booster Draft tournament, you must draft those cards into your card pool.
* However, Zendikar Expeditions cards are not legal in any Constructed format they weren’t legal in before. Appearing in *Oath of the Gatewatch* booster packs does **not** make them legal in Standard.
* All *Zendikar Expeditions* cards are in English, but those cards appear in booster packs of all languages.



---

**New Symbol for Colorless Mana**


The Eldrazi’s transcendence of the five colors of mana reaches its natural conclusion in this set with the introduction of the colorless mana symbol. Denoted in rules documents as {C}, it represents one colorless mana that can be added to your mana pool. It also represents a cost that can be paid only with one colorless mana. The symbol looks like a curved, open diamond shape inside a gray circle.


![](https://media.wizards.com/2015/ogw_239nCi30ks3/en_6iYmYtm8d8.png)



> 
> Dimensional Infiltrator  
> 
> {1}{U}  
> 
> Devoid *(This card has no color.)*  
> 
> Flash  
> 
> Flying  
> 
> {1}{C}: Target opponent exiles the top card of his or her library. If it’s a land card, you may return Dimensional Infiltrator to its owner’s hand. *({C} represents colorless mana.)*
> 
> 
> 


* The {C} in the activation cost of Dimensional Infiltrator’s ability can be paid only with colorless mana. It can’t be paid with green mana, for example. In contrast, the {1} in that cost can be paid with any type of mana: white, blue, black, red, green, or colorless.
* Previous cards that said “Add {1} to your mana pool” or similar will receive errata to say “Add {C} to your mana pool” or similar. Going forward, numerical or variable mana symbols ({1}, {2}, and so on, including {X}) will be used only to denote costs.
* Notably, *Battle for Zendikar* cards that created Eldrazi Scion tokens will receive errata so that the tokens have the ability “Sacrifice this creature: Add {C} to your mana pool.”



---

**New Basic Land: Wastes**


To help players generate the colorless mana they’ll certainly need, this set also includes a new basic land: Wastes.


![](https://media.wizards.com/2015/ogw_239nCi30ks3/en_Hz0whxEhRd.png)



> 
> Wastes  
> 
> Basic Land  
> 
> {T}: Add {C} to your mana pool.
> 
> 
> 


* The mana ability of Wastes doesn’t appear on the printed cards, but it is in its official Oracle text. (A card’s Oracle text (in English) can be found using the Gatherer card database at [**Gatherer.Wizards.com**](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Default.aspx).) The printed cards display a large colorless mana symbol in a design that’s similar to other basic land cards.
* Because Wastes is a basic land, you can include as many of them as you like in your Constructed decks.
* In Limited events (including Sealed Deck and Booster Draft), Wastes must be in your card pool to be included in your deck. You can’t add Wastes to your card pool in the same way that you can add other basic lands.
* Wastes is legal only in formats that include *Oath of the Gatewatch*. Specifically, unless it’s reprinted in a future set, it will rotate out of Standard at the same time as the rest of the set.
* Wastes is not a land type. If something asks you to name a land type, you can’t choose Wastes.



---

**New Ability Word: Cohort**


Cohort is used to highlight activated abilities of some Allies that require you to tap that Ally and another untapped Ally you control. An ability word appears in italics and has no rules meaning.


![](https://media.wizards.com/2015/ogw_239nCi30ks3/en_vodci76jGB.png)



> 
> Munda’s Vanguard  
> 
> {4}{W}  
> 
> Creature — Kor Knight Ally  
> 
> 3/3  
> *Cohort* — {T}, Tap an untapped Ally you control: Put a +1/+1 counter on each creature you control.
> 
> 
> 


* To activate a cohort ability, the Ally with that ability must have been under your control continuously since the beginning of your most recent turn. Informally, it can’t have “summoning sickness.” However, the other Ally you tap can be one that just came under your control. (Note that tapping the second Ally doesn’t use {T} [the tap symbol].)

-----


**New Keyword: Surge**


Surge is a new keyword ability that makes spells better if you or a teammate have cast a spell this turn.


![](https://media.wizards.com/2015/ogw_239nCi30ks3/en_XyMR5zIdDK.png)



> 
> Reckless Bushwhacker  
> 
> {2}{R}  
> 
> Creature — Goblin Warrior Ally  
> 
> 2/1  
> 
> Surge {1}{R} *(You may cast this spell for its surge cost if you or a teammate has cast another spell this turn.)*  
> 
> Haste  
> 
> When Reckless Bushwhacker enters the battlefield, if its surge cost was paid, other creatures you control get +1/+0 and gain haste until end of turn.
> 
> 
> 


The official rules for surge are as follows:


702.115. Surge


702.115a Surge is a static ability that functions while the spell with surge is on the stack. “Surge [cost]” means “You may pay [cost] rather than pay this spell’s mana cost as you cast this spell if you or one of your teammates has cast another spell this turn.” Paying a spell’s surge cost follows the rules for paying alternative costs in rules 601.2b and 601.2f–h.


* For some cards, surge represents only an alternative cost, a discount that applies if you or a teammate has cast another spell this turn. Other cards, like Reckless Bushwhacker, have additional abilities or effects if you paid the surge cost to cast the spell.
* The other spell that you or a teammate cast can be one that’s resolved, one that was countered, or (for instants with surge) one that’s still on the stack.
* If an instant or sorcery spell cast for its surge cost is copied, the copy didn’t have its surge cost paid. Any additional effects that are based on whether the surge cost was paid won’t apply for the copy.
* Casting a spell for its surge cost doesn’t change its mana cost or its converted mana cost.



---

**New Keyword Action: Support**


Support is another way to help out your creatures in the fight against the Eldrazi.


![](https://media.wizards.com/2015/ogw_239nCi30ks3/en_xVXQM8eXoy.png)



> 
> Saddleback Lagac  
> 
> {3}{G}  
> 
> Creature — Lizard  
> 
> 3/1  
> 
> When Saddleback Lagac enters the battlefield, support 2. *(Put a +1/+1 counter on each of up to two other target creatures.)*
> 
> 
> 


![](https://media.wizards.com/2015/ogw_239nCi30ks3/en_iDUJYXeFZS.png)



> 
> Shoulder to Shoulder  
> 
> {2}{W}  
> 
> Sorcery  
> 
> Support 2. *(Put a +1/+1 counter on each of up to two target creatures.)*  
> 
> Draw a card.
> 
> 
> 


The official rules for support are as follows:


701.32. Support


701.32a “Support N” on a permanent means “Put a +1/+1 counter on each of up to N other target creatures.” “Support N” on an instant or sorcery spell means “Put a +1/+1 counter on each of up to N target creatures.”


* You can’t put more than one +1/+1 counter on any one target using the support action.
* Support can target a creature you don’t control.
* If a spell with support has other abilities that target creatures, those abilities and the support ability can target the same creature.



---

**Cycle: Oaths of the Planeswalkers**


After the events on Zendikar, four Planeswalkers unite for the protection of all planes. To signify the formation of the Gatewatch, this set features four legendary enchantments, each representing the oath of one of the four.


![](https://media.wizards.com/2015/ogw_239nCi30ks3/en_fQLCvzkpuG.png)



> 
> Oath of Gideon  
> 
> {2}{W}  
> 
> Legendary Enchantment  
> 
> When Oath of Gideon enters the battlefield, put two 1/1 white Kor Ally creature tokens onto the battlefield.  
> 
> Each planeswalker you control enters the battlefield with an additional loyalty counter on it.
> 
> 
> 


* Each of the Oaths is legendary: if you control more than one of any particular Oath, you choose one to remain on the battlefield and the others are put into your graveyard.
* The “legend rule” checks the full names of legendary permanents. You can control Oath of Gideon and Oath of Chandra at the same time, for example.
* Even if you control a particular Oath, you can cast another of that Oath to take advantage of its enters-the-battlefield ability. It will enter the battlefield, causing its first ability to trigger. You will then choose one to keep, as detailed above, and then its enters-the-battlefield ability will resolve.

**CARD-SPECIFIC NOTES**

> 
> Counter target spell unless its controller pays {1}. You put a 1/1 colorless Eldrazi Scion creature token onto the battlefield. It has “Sacrifice this creature: Add {C} to your mana pool.” *({C} represents colorless mana.)*
> 
> 
> 


* You get the Eldrazi Scion even if the controller of the spell pays {1}.

> 
> 3/2  
> *Cohort* — {T}, Tap an untapped Ally you control: Discard a card. If you do, draw a card.
> 
> 
> 


* Discarding a card is part of the ability’s effect and isn’t optional. As the cohort ability resolves, if you have a card in your hand, you must discard one, even if the card you may have wanted to discard as you activated the ability is no longer in your hand.

> 
> {1}{W}{B}, Sacrifice another creature: Exile target nonland permanent. Activate this ability only if you have at least 10 life more than your starting life total.
> 
> 
> 


* Once you’ve announced either activated ability, it’s too late for anyone to interrupt you by trying to remove the creature you sacrifice.
* Once you’ve legally activated the last ability, it doesn’t matter what happens to your life total.
* Your starting life total is the life total you began the game with. For most two-player formats, this is 20. For Two-Headed Giant, it’s the life total your team started with, usually 30. In Commander games, your starting life total is 40.

> 
> Flying  
> 
> Bearer of Silence can’t block.
> 
> 
> 


* Bearer of Silence’s triggered ability targets only the player, not any creature. For example, the player may sacrifice a creature with hexproof.
* Players can respond to the triggered ability, but once it starts resolving and you decide whether to pay {1}{C}, it’s too late for anyone to respond.

> 
> 
> 


* The last ability causes creatures your opponents control to lose hexproof and indestructible as it resolves. Effects that cause those creatures to gain those abilities after that point will work normally.
* Damage dealt to a creature with indestructible is still marked on that creature. If that creature loses indestructible, and the marked damage is lethal, it will be destroyed. However, if a creature with indestructible is dealt damage by a source with deathtouch and then later loses indestructible, that creature won’t be destroyed.

> 


* You choose which opponent or planeswalker controlled by an opponent the token is attacking as it enters the battlefield. It doesn’t have to be the same opponent or planeswalker that the equipped creature is attacking.
* The token is never declared as an attacking creature. It simply enters the battlefield attacking. This won’t cause any abilities that trigger “whenever a creature attacks” to trigger.

> 
> 
> 


* The ability triggers just once for each life-gaining event, no matter how much life is gained.
* A creature with lifelink dealing combat damage causes a single life-gaining event. For example, if a single creature with lifelink deals combat damage to multiple creatures, players, and/or planeswalkers at the same time (perhaps because it has trample or was blocked by more than one creature), Cliffhaven Vampire’s triggered ability will trigger only once. However, if two creatures you control with lifelink deal combat damage at the same time, the ability will trigger twice.
* In a Two-Headed Giant game, life gained by your teammate won’t cause the ability to trigger, even though it causes your team’s life total to increase.

* A “land creature” is a permanent that’s both a land and a creature.

* Containment Membrane can target and be attached to an untapped creature. It just won’t have any effect until that creature becomes tapped.
* The enchanted creature can still be untapped by other spells and abilities.

* The mana produced by the last ability can’t be spent on a colorless spell unless that spell specifically has the devoid ability.

* All other nonland permanents will already be in their owners’ hands by the time the Octopus token is created. Any triggered abilities or abilities that would have otherwise affected that Octopus won’t be around to matter.

> 
>

* Mana produced by Cultivator Drone may be used to cast any colorless spell, including most artifact spells, face-down spells, and spells with devoid.
* Some triggered abilities include a cost as part of their resolution. For example, Bearer of Silence’s ability says, in part, “When you cast Bearer of Silence, you may pay {1}{C}.” You may use mana produced by Cultivator Drone to help pay that cost. In fact, you could tap two Cultivator Drones to pay the entire cost.

* If you target a land that’s already a creature with Cyclone Sire’s triggered ability, that land creature’s base power and toughness will become 0/0, overwriting its previous base power and toughness. Other effects that modify its power and/or toughness (including the new and any previously-existing +1/+1 counters) will continue to apply.

* You gain the life as soon as Dazzling Reflection resolves, not as the damage is prevented.
* If two Dazzling Reflections targeting the same creature have resolved in the same turn, only one prevention effect will apply the next time it would deal damage. The other effect will apply if the creature would deal damage a second time later that turn.

* If a creature you control becomes a copy of the revealed creature card, it’s neither entering nor leaving the battlefield. Any enters-the-battlefield or leaves-the-battlefield abilities won’t trigger.

* After the creature returns to the battlefield, it will be a new object with no connection to the creature that was exiled.

Any +1/+1 counters on it or Auras attached to it are removed, and any Equipment will no longer be attached.

* Use the new creature’s power and toughness at the time the ability resolves to determine the base power and toughness of Eldrazi Mimic. If that creature is no longer on the battlefield at that time, use its power and toughness when it left the battlefield. (Keep in mind that those values may be negative, for example if a spell like Spatial Contortion giving it +3/-3 is what caused it to leave the battlefield.)
* Eldrazi Mimic’s ability will overwrite any other effect setting its base power and toughness. Such effects that begin to apply after that ability resolves will similarly overwrite the ability. Effects that modify Eldrazi Mimic’s power and/or toughness but don’t set its base power and/or toughness to specific values will apply no matter when they started to apply. The same is true for any +1/+1 counters it may have.

* If one of the targets is a player, you can redirect the damage dealt by Fall of the Titans to a planeswalker that player controls. However, Fall of the Titans can’t be used to deal damage to both a player and a planeswalker he or she controls (unless a separate redirection effect applies).
* Fall of the Titan’s converted mana cost is based on its mana cost of {X}{X}{R}, even if you’re casting it for its surge cost. For example, if you cast Fall of the Titans for its surge cost and choose 4 for X, its converted mana cost will be 9.

* Gift of Tusks overwrites all previous effects that set the creature’s base power and toughness to specific values. Any power- or toughness-setting effects that start to apply after Gift of Tusks resolves will overwrite this effect.
* Gift of Tusks doesn’t counter abilities that have already triggered or been activated. In particular, there is no way to cast this spell to stop a creature’s ability that says “At the beginning of your upkeep,” “When this creature enters the battlefield,” or similar from triggering.
* If the affected creature gains an ability after Gift of Tusks resolves, it will keep that ability.
* Effects that modify a creature’s power and/or toughness, such as the effect of Titanic Growth, will apply to the creature no matter when they started to take effect. The same is true for any counters that change its power and/or toughness and effects that switch its power and toughness.

* You cast the card during the resolution of the enters-the-battlefield ability, not later in the turn. If it’s a sorcery card, ignore the timing restrictions based on it being a sorcery card. Other timing restrictions, such as “Cast [this card] only during combat,” must be followed.
* If you can’t cast the target instant or sorcery card, perhaps because there are no legal targets available, or if you choose not to cast it, it will remain in your graveyard.
* If you cast a card “without paying its mana cost,” you can’t pay alternative costs such as surge costs. You can pay additional costs. If the card has mandatory additional costs, you must pay those.
* If the instant or sorcery card has {X} in its mana cost, you must choose 0 as its value.
* If an instant or sorcery card you cast this way is countered, it will be exiled.
* If an instant or sorcery card you cast this way goes to a zone other than exile or a graveyard, perhaps because one of its abilities says to put it into its owner’s hand, it won’t be exiled. This is true even if the card would be put into a graveyard later that turn.

* A land that becomes a creature may be affected by “summoning sickness.” You can’t attack with it or use any of its {T} abilities (including its mana abilities) unless it began your most recent turn on the battlefield under your control. Note that summoning sickness cares about when that permanent came under your control, not when it became a creature nor when it entered the battlefield.
* This land is colorless until the last ability gives it colors.
* When a land becomes a creature, that doesn’t count as having a creature enter the battlefield. The permanent was already on the battlefield; it only changed its types. Abilities that trigger whenever a creature enters the battlefield won’t trigger.
* An ability that turns a land into a creature also sets that creature’s power and toughness. If the land was already a creature (for example, if it was the target of a spell with awaken), this will overwrite the previous effect that set its power and toughness. Effects that modify its power or toughness will continue to apply no matter when they started to take effect. The same is true for counters that change its power or toughness (such as +1/+1 counters) and effects that switch its power and toughness. For example, if Hissing Quagmire has been made a 0/0 creature with three +1/+1 counters on it, activating its last ability will turn it into a 5/5 creature that’s still a land.

* If a creature has already been legally declared as a blocker, Immobilizer Eldrazi’s ability won’t change or undo that block.

* No player can look at the cards once they’re exiled.
* If your opponent puts one of the face-down exiled cards into your graveyard (for example, to activate an ability of an Eldrazi Processor), choose one of the cards at random. The card is revealed only after the cost is fully paid. That is, your opponent can’t learn what card was chosen and decide to back up (not cast the spell, activate the ability, or so on, as applicable).

* If a creature token an opponent controls dies, it goes to that player’s graveyard as normal before ceasing to exist.
* If Kalitas dies at the same time as creatures your opponents control, those creature cards will be exiled and you’ll get that many Zombies.
* You can’t sacrifice Kalitas to activate the last ability, even if it’s somehow become a Zombie.

* Kozilek’s triggered ability checks to see if you have fewer than seven cards in hand when you cast it. Kozilek is on the stack at this time and not in your hand. If you don’t, the ability won’t trigger at all. If the ability does trigger, it will check again as it tries to resolve. If you have seven or more cards in hand at that time, the ability won’t do anything.
* To activate the last ability, there must be a legal target: a spell on the stack. That target will determine the value of X and the converted mana cost of the card you discard. You can’t activate the ability unless you can match the converted mana cost of a spell on the stack to that of a card in your hand.
* The converted mana cost of a spell doesn’t change, even if it’s been cast using an alternative cost (such as an awaken cost). For example, the converted mana cost of a Sheer Drop (a spell with mana cost {2}{W}) that’s been cast for its awaken cost of {5}{W} is 3.
* If there’s an {X} in the mana cost of the card you discard, that X is 0. Any {X} in the mana cost of the target spell will have whatever value was determined for it as the spell was cast.

* The last ability triggers only if Kozilek’s Return is in your graveyard as you cast the Eldrazi creature spell. That ability will resolve before the Eldrazi creature spell does. In other words, that Eldrazi won’t be on the battlefield yet and won’t be dealt damage by Kozilek’s Return.
* Exiling Kozilek’s Return due to the last ability isn’t the same as casting it as a spell. Cards that say “Counter target spell” won’t work.

> 
> 
> 


* Mirrorpool’s third ability can target (and copy) any instant or sorcery spell, not just one with targets.
* The copy is created on the stack, so it’s not cast. Abilities that trigger when a player casts a spell won’t trigger. The copy will then resolve like a normal spell, after players get a chance to cast spells and activate abilities.
* The copy will have the same targets as the spell it’s copying unless you choose new ones. You may change any number of the targets, including all of them or none of them. If, for one of the targets, you can’t choose a new legal target, then it remains unchanged (even if the current target is illegal).
* If the copied spell is modal (that is, it says “Choose one —” or the like), the copy will have the same modes. You can’t choose different ones.
* If the copied spell has an X whose value was determined as it was cast (like Fall of the Titans does), the copy has the same value of X.
* You can’t choose to pay any additional costs for the copy. However, effects based on any additional costs that were paid for the original spell are copied as though those same costs were paid for the copy, too. For example, if a player sacrifices a 3/3 creature to cast Fling, and you copy it, the copy of Fling will also deal 3 damage to its target.
* For Mirrorpool’s last ability, the token copies exactly what’s printed on the original creature and nothing else (unless that creature is copying something else; see below). It doesn’t copy whether that creature is tapped or untapped, whether it has any counters on it or Auras and Equipment attached to it, or any non-copy effects that have changed its power, toughness, types, color, and so on.
* For example, if a token copies a Plains that’s been affected by a spell with awaken, the token will be just a land, even though the object being copied is currently a land creature. The same is true if the land has an ability that animates it.
* If the copied creature has {X} in its mana cost, X is 0.
* If the copied creature is copying something else when the ability resolves, then the token enters the battlefield as a copy of whatever that creature is copying.
* Any enters-the-battlefield abilities of the copied creature will trigger when the token enters the battlefield. Any “as [this permanent] enters the battlefield” or “[this permanent] enters the battlefield with” abilities of the copied creature will also work.

* A land that becomes a creature may be affected by “summoning sickness.” You can’t attack with it or use any of its {T} abilities (including its mana abilities) unless it began your most recent turn on the battlefield under your control. Note that summoning sickness cares about when that permanent came under your control, not when it became a creature nor when it entered the battlefield.
* This land is colorless until the last ability gives it colors.
* When a land becomes a creature, that doesn’t count as having a creature enter the battlefield. The permanent was already on the battlefield; it only changed its types. Abilities that trigger whenever a creature enters the battlefield won’t trigger.
* An ability that turns a land into a creature also sets that creature’s power and toughness. If the land was already a creature (for example, if it was the target of a spell with awaken), this will overwrite the previous effect that set its power and toughness. Effects that modify its power or toughness will continue to apply no matter when they started to take effect. The same is true for counters that change its power or toughness (such as +1/+1 counters) and effects that switch its power and toughness. For example, if Needle Spires has been made a 0/0 creature with three +1/+1 counters on it, activating its last ability will turn it into a 5/4 creature that’s still a land.

* Reflector Mage’s ability doesn’t stop any player from playing lands (in the case that the returned creature was also a land).
* In several cases, the name of the creature that was returned won’t match the name of that card once it’s back in its owner’s hand. For example, if the card was copying another creature, it will probably have a different name in its owner’s hand and can be cast again before your next turn. The same is true if a double-faced card with its back face up is returned to its owner’s hand this way.
* If the returned creature had no name while it was on the battlefield (likely because the creature was face down), its owner can still cast face-down creature spells with morph or megamorph, or cast the same card face up, before your next turn.

* The player can’t choose to discard two cards unless he or she has at least two cards in hand. Similarly, that player can’t choose to sacrifice a creature or planeswalker unless he or she controls one. This means that if the target opponent doesn’t have two cards in hand and doesn’t control a creature or planeswalker, that player will lose 5 life and then lose 5 life again.

* A spell that can’t be countered can still be targeted by spells or abilities that would counter it. The part of their effect that would counter the spell won’t do anything, but any other effects those spells or abilities may have will still happen, if applicable.
* There’s no functional difference between “can’t be countered” and “can’t be countered by spells or abilities,” but the latter is used for classes of spells that might require a target. Spells with targets can still be countered by the game rules if all of their targets become illegal before they resolve.

* Vampire Envoy’s last ability will trigger if it becomes tapped for any reason, including attacking. However, if it enters the battlefield tapped for some reason, the ability won’t trigger.

* Vile Redeemer’s last ability will count any nontoken creature that died while under your control, even if you weren’t the creature’s owner. It doesn’t matter where the card is as the ability resolves. It doesn’t have to still be in a graveyard.
* Vile Redeemer’s last ability won’t count nontoken creatures that didn’t go to a graveyard because of a replacement effect (for example, a creature that was exiled or went to the command zone instead).

* If you target a land that’s already a creature with Wall of Resurgence’s triggered ability, that land creature’s base power and toughness will become 0/0, overwriting its previous base power and toughness. Other effects that modify its power and/or toughness (including the new and any previously-existing +1/+1 counters) will continue to apply.

* Effects that switch power and toughness apply after all other effects that change power and/or toughness, regardless of which effect was created first.
* Switching a creature’s power and toughness twice (or any even number of times) effectively returns the creature to the power and toughness it had before any switches.
* A land that becomes a creature may be affected by “summoning sickness.” You can’t attack with it or use any of its {T} abilities (including its mana abilities) unless it began your most recent turn on the battlefield under your control. Note that summoning sickness cares about when that permanent came under your control, not when it became a creature nor when it entered the battlefield.
* This land is colorless until the last ability gives it colors.
* When a land becomes a creature, that doesn’t count as having a creature enter the battlefield. The permanent was already on the battlefield; it only changed its types. Abilities that trigger whenever a creature enters the battlefield won’t trigger.
* An ability that turns a land into a creature also sets that creature’s power and toughness. If the land was already a creature (for example, if it was the target of a spell with awaken), this will overwrite the previous effect that set its power and toughness. Effects that modify its power or toughness will continue to apply no matter when they started to take effect. The same is true for counters that change its power or toughness (such as +1/+1 counters) and effects that switch its power and toughness. For example, if Wandering Fumarole has been made a 0/0 creature with three +1/+1 counters on it, activating its last ability will turn it into a 4/7 creature that’s still a land.
