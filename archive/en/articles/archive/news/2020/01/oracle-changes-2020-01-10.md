All That Glitters (Functional)
------------------------------


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Gild)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gild)
Following the mold of Treasure and Food, we've got Gold! The First Iroan Games awards the first predefined Gold token, and older cards have received errata to use this technology. It's a very minor functional difference in that the token now has an artifact subtype where before it had none. For example . . .


**Gild was**:


Exile target creature. Create a colorless artifact token named Gold. It has "Sacrifice this artifact: Add one mana of any color."


**New text**:


Exile target creature. Create a Gold token. *(It's an artifact with "Sacrifice this artifact: Add one mana of any color.")*


The changed golden cards are [Gild](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gild); [King Macar, the Gold-Cursed](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=King+Macar%2C+the+Gold-Cursed); [Curse of Opulence](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Curse+of+Opulence); and [Venarian Gold](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Venarian+Gold).


  

Wait, what?


. . . Is Gold (Functional)
--------------------------


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Venarian+Gold)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Venarian+Gold)
Silly [Venarian Gold](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Venarian+Gold), you didn't get the Gold update. You got the Gadwick update! The same rules that support [Gadwick, the Wizened](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gadwick%2C+the+Wizened)'s triggered ability let [Venarian Gold](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Venarian+Gold) change back to using simpler words.


**Venarian Gold was**:


Enchant creature


When [Venarian Gold](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Venarian+Gold) enters the battlefield, tap enchanted creature and put a number of sleep counters on it equal to the value of X as you cast [Venarian Gold](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Venarian+Gold).


Enchanted creature doesn't untap during its controller's untap step if it has a sleep counter on it.


At the beginning of the upkeep of enchanted creature's controller, remove a sleep counter from that creature.


**New text**:


Enchant creature


When [Venarian Gold](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Venarian+Gold) enters the battlefield, tap enchanted creature and put X sleep counters on it.


Enchanted creature doesn't untap during its controller's untap step if it has a sleep counter on it.


At the beginning of the upkeep of enchanted creature's controller, remove a sleep counter from that creature.


City in a Bottle (Functional)
-----------------------------


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=City+in+a+Bottle)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=City+in+a+Bottle)
Years have passed since we wrote new words for [City in a Bottle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=City+in+a+Bottle). But I looked at it one morning and didn't believe what I saw. It was a state trigger that was meant to trigger a hundred billion times at once—but state triggers can't do that. So I've collapsed it into one state trigger that causes all those things to be sacrificed at once.


**City in a Bottle was**:


Whenever another nontoken permanent with a name originally printed in the *Arabian Nights* expansion is on the battlefield, its controller sacrifices it.


Players can't cast spells or play lands with a name originally printed in the *Arabian Nights* expansion.


**New text**:


Whenever one or more other nontoken permanents with a name originally printed in the *Arabian Nights* expansion are on the battlefield, their controllers sacrifice them.


Players can't cast spells or play lands with a name originally printed in the *Arabian Nights* expansion.


'Tis Nobler in the Mind (Functional)
------------------------------------


Doug Beyer, the Creature Type Czar, has been paying attention to discussion surrounding the new Noble creature type. There were a couple that we missed the first time around that fit the criteria very well—remember, to become a Noble through errata, you should be born to the nobility (not clawing your way up by killing off Blog or Unkful; looking at you Numsgil) and not have a more relevant "job" creature type.


There are really only two changes here: [Crovax](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crovax), who has three cards, is recognized for being very clearly referenced as nobility with no other job. [Earl of Squirrel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Earl+of+Squirrel) has a tribal-relevant creature type thanks to [Persistent Petitioners](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Persistent+Petitioners) (the card, not the kind who send me mail), but being only relevant for one card doesn't stop it from becoming a Noble. Because it is relevant for that one card, though, it gets to stay an Advisor.


* [Ascendant Evincar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ascendant+Evincar): Vampire -> [Vampire Noble](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vampire+Noble)
* [Crovax the Cursed](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crovax+the+Cursed): Vampire -> [Vampire Noble](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vampire+Noble)
* [Crovax, Ascendant Hero](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crovax%2C+Ascendant+Hero): Human -> Human Noble
* [Earl of Squirrel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Earl+of+Squirrel): Squirrel Advisor -> Squirrel Noble Advisor

Of Elves and Pangolins (Functional)
-----------------------------------


Two other cards got less-noble creature type updates.


After many years of being falsely accused of being a Human, [Lady Caleria](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lady+Caleria)'s type is properly updated to show that it's an Elf card.


[Ridgescale Tusker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ridgescale+Tusker) joins a very exclusive club of Pangolins!


* [Lady Caleria](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lady+Caleria): Human Archer -> Elf Archer
* [Ridgescale Tusker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ridgescale+Tusker): Beast -> Pangolin Beast

Teferi's Verbs (Nonfunctional)
------------------------------


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Teferi%27s+Protection)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Teferi%27s+Protection)
This change is so tiny, but I have a feeling it'll be helpful to point it out as not having any functional difference. [Teferi's Protection](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Teferi%27s+Protection) used "have" in the place that we'd normally use "gain." This difference is only stylistic—the rules put no weight on which word is used—so this change is editorial, but to the average player it looks like it may alter something in how the card works. Worry not, it's no change at all.


**Teferi's Protection was**:


Until your next turn, your life total can't change and you have protection from everything. All permanents you control phase out. *(While they're phased out, they're treated as though they don't exist. They phase in before you untap during your untap step.)*


Exile [Teferi's Protection](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Teferi%27s+Protection).


**New text**:


Until your next turn, your life total can't change and you gain protection from everything. All permanents you control phase out. *(While they're phased out, they're treated as though they don't exist. They phase in before you untap during your untap step.)*


Exile [Teferi's Protection](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Teferi%27s+Protection).
