On Thursday, Pro Tour Berlin champion Luis Scott-Vargas joined us on CoverItLive to participate in an interview where viewers at home asked all the questions. Below, you can find the transcript of that interview.


**Luis Scott-Vargas:**   



**Luis Scott-Vargas:**   



**Comment From Guilherme:**  



**Luis Scott-Vargas:**   

Shoota Mcgavin (Shouta Yasooka).


**Comment From Sean:**  

Who are you most afraid to face in Modern?


**Luis Scott-Vargas:**   

Nobody really, we picked Zoo because of its mostly balanced matchups. The worst though is probably Kibler/Finkel's White-Blue (Tzu-Ching Kou's deck).


**Comment From Ithilanor:**  

What's the best/worst pun you've heard today?


**Luis Scott-Vargas:**   

I said that I'd take a [Wild Guess](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Guess) and say my deck's good. (hint: I'm playing [Wild Guess](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Guess)).


**Comment From Glued to **Magic**:**  

Luis Scott-Vargas - What do you think about knowing your opponent's list before the match (and conversely him knowing yours). Does it make a big difference to how you play?


**Luis Scott-Vargas:**   

Yeah, it's huge. Playing around their cards, bluffing your own. It's a really big difference.


**Comment From asharris:**  

What happened to Garvas Elscott?


**Luis Scott-Vargas:**   

He retired.


**Comment From Oliver:**  

What would you play in Vintage right now?


**Luis Scott-Vargas:**   
[Snapcaster Mage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snapcaster+Mage)/[Dark Confidant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dark+Confidant)/Jace blue control.


**Comment From JelgerW:**  

Are you working on recruiting Shouta Yasooka for ChannelFireball?


**Luis Scott-Vargas:**   

Not currently in the works. It's more fun when we have no idea what he's bringing anyway.


**Comment From Ithilanor:**  

Are you surprised that no one played Pod, Storm, or other combo decks in Modern?


**Luis Scott-Vargas:**   

Not really, we didn't expect many of those decks. We did think more Loam would show up.


**Comment From Faith:**  

Luis Scott-Vargas, I just have to say, earlier today on this chat we had the questions: what's your favorite draft archetype in **M13** (to which I answered blue-red lots-of-spells), which **M13** card do you like most (to which I answered Helion crucible) and which player are you rooting for (obviously you). So when I saw your decklist, I felt that the stars had aligned :) Thanks!


**Luis Scott-Vargas:**   

Awesome. I picked [Oblivion Ring](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oblivion+Ring), then [Searing Spear](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Searing+Spear), then right into [Divination](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Divination).


**Luis Scott-Vargas:**   

Needs more [Divination](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Divination)s.


**Comment From Guest**  

Luis Scott-Vargas, is it much harder to predict the meta of 16 top players than 450  

random good players?


**Luis Scott-Vargas:**   

It's different, but both are tricky. We decided to not get too far ahead of ourselves, and just play Zoo...like always. We went 7-1 in modern though!


**Comment From dv8r:**  

What would you play in Modern if you could have seen everyone's else's decklists before this tournament?


**Luis Scott-Vargas:**   

Our [Birthing Pod](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Birthing+Pod) deck. 4 [Kitchen Finks](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kitchen+Finks), Knight of the Reliquary, no combo, just value.


**Comment From Senortangerino89:**  

Luis Scott-Vargas - I know you were tinkering around with [Battle of Wits](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Battle+of+Wits), do you think that  

or one of the other alternate win cards will be viable post rotation?


**Luis Scott-Vargas:**   

Nope.


**Luis Scott-Vargas:**   

They will be a ton of fun though, and I'll keep trying.


**Comment From Pam A:**  

Luis Scott-Vargas, do you think Kai Budde is the best magic player ever?



**Luis Scott-Vargas:**   

Jon Finkel.


**Comment From Kris:**   

What's you favorite card?


**Luis Scott-Vargas:**   

Juzam Djinn.


**Luis Scott-Vargas:**   

Pairings are up, wish me luck!
