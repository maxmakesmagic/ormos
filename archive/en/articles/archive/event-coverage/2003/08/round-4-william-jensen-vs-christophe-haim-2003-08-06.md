### Game 1

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/worlds03/a901.jpg)Haim started with [Careful Study](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Careful+Study), discarding [Unsummon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Unsummon) and putting [Basking Rootwalla](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Basking+Rootwalla) into play. A [Mongrel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mongrel) came out on turn two, and Jensen played [Compulsion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Compulsion). [Quiet Speculation](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Quiet+Speculation) put [Ray of Revelation](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ray+of+Revelation) and a pair of [Deep Analysis](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deep+Analysis) into Haim's graveyard, and the Ray was flashed back right away to get rid of [Compulsion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Compulsion). On the next turn he gained some cards by flashing back an Analysis, and attacked for five with his [Mongrel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mongrel) and Rootwalla. Jensen cast [Renewed Faith](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Renewed+Faith) to get a little more breathing room, and tapped out to play his own Analysis. A turn later, [Moment's Peace](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Moment%27s+Peace) kept Jensen's life total at a comfortable level, as Haim played a second [Mongrel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mongrel).

[Wrath of God](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wrath+of+God) drew a [Mana Leak](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak) out of Haim, but Jensen had his own, and the three creatures on the board headed to the graveyard. With Jensen tapped out, Haim cast [Upheaval](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Upheaval), played an island, and cast [Careful Study](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Careful+Study), discarding a [Roar](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Roar) and a land. Haim rebuilt with a pair of [Werebear](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Werebear)s, but Jensen had two copies of [Moment's Peace](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Moment%27s+Peace) to keep things under control. Haim tapped out for [Deep Analysis](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deep+Analysis), and Jensen played [Wrath of God](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wrath+of+God) to kill the 4/4 Bears. [Roar of the Wurm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Roar+of+the+Wurm) was flashed back to give Haim a threat to work with, but Jensen had a graveyard filled with a few [Moment's Peace](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Moment%27s+Peace) to spare. One was flashed back and [Mana Leak](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak)ed, allowing the Wurm to deal six damage and bring Jensen down to seven. A [Mongrel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mongrel) followed, and Haim had an island up, representing [Circular Logic](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Circular+Logic).

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/worlds03/a903.jpg)Jensen simply drew, played a land, and ended his turn. Haim flashed back [Deep Analysis](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deep+Analysis) and attacked with the [Mongrel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mongrel) and Wurm, so Jensen used [Cunning Wish](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cunning+Wish) to get [Wing Shards](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wing+Shards). Haim used [Mana Leak](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak) to counter one copy, but still lost both his creatures in the exchange, and seemed distraught by the mistake. He played a [Werebear](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Werebear), shaking his head as Jensen cast [Mirari's Wake](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mirari%27s+Wake). A second and third Wake followed, along with [Compulsion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Compulsion). [Moment's Peace](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Moment%27s+Peace) kept Haim's attacks in check, and Jensen cycled [Decree of Justice](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Decree+of+Justice) to get three 4/4 [Soldier](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soldier)s- Haim conceded right away.

Jensen- 1 Haim- 0

### Game 2

Jensen mulliganed down to five, and Haim started with [Nimble Mongoose](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nimble+Mongoose), and a second turn [Werebear](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Werebear). A [Careful Study](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Careful+Study) and another [Werebear](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Werebear) made his position even better, but he couldn't get threshold. Jensen sacrificed [Krosan Verge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Krosan+Verge), untapped, and played [Compulsion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Compulsion). A second [Careful Study](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Careful+Study) got Haim the seven cards he needed into his graveyard, and the attack brought Jensen down to four life. Haim didn't have any lands untapped that represented countermagic, so [Wrath of God](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wrath+of+God) would have resolved without a problem. However, it didn't show up, and the match went to a third game.

Jensen- 1 Haim- 1

### Game 3

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/worlds03/a902.jpg)Haim once again had a first turn [Nimble Mongoose](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nimble+Mongoose), and continued his curve with a [Mongrel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mongrel). [Careful Study](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Careful+Study) put a pair of Rootwallas into play, and Haim now had a quick, small army out attacking for significant damage every turn. He didn't pump the Rootwallas or cast any other spells, staying back on untapped lands for countermagic. Jensen got more mana into play with the help of [Krosan Verge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Krosan+Verge), and slowed things down with [Moment's Peace](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Moment%27s+Peace). [Quiet Speculation](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Quiet+Speculation) got Haim two [Deep Analysis](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deep+Analysis) and [Ray of Revelation](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ray+of+Revelation), while Jensen continued to draw lands.

Thanks to [Deep Analysis](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deep+Analysis), Haim had plenty of resources to work with, while Jensen cast his second [Moment's Peace](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Moment%27s+Peace) to stay alive. [Chastise](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chastise) targeted the [Mongrel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mongrel) on the following attack, bringing Jensen to one life point. [Moment's Peace](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Moment%27s+Peace) had to be flashed back on the next attack, and Jensen found his third soon after. He was doing a good job of staying alive, but needed to draw an answer or a threat. Haim attempted to go for the win with [Upheaval](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Upheaval), leaving one floating, but Jensen had [Mana Leak](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak). The third [Moment's Peace](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Moment%27s+Peace) was flashed back next, and Jensen couldn't find an answer.

**Final Result:** Jensen- 1 Haim- 2
