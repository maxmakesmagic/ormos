Our ["Selecting *Eighth Edition*"](http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=mtgcom/vote8e/home) promo is cruising along nicely. Thousand of people are voting, and that's great news! If there's one thing I like to see, it's people getting involved.


Here's what's happening: Each set of polls will be left up for about two weeks, which means there will be two card choices and two art choices available for voting at any given time. That way, if you forget to check in one week, you won't have missed anything.


The voting breakdown was as follows:




|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Which card should be in Eighth Edition? |  |  |
| Two-Headed Dragon | 6573 | 83% |
| Crimson Hellkite | 1317 | 17% |
| Total | 7890 | 100% |



|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Which Thorn Elemental art should be in Eighth Edition? |  |  |
| Urza's Destiny | 5978 | 79% |
| Seventh Edition | 1556 | 21% |
| Total | 7534 | 100% |

Talk about a mandate from the masses. In order to make things interesting, the next vote won't be so cut-and-dried. I present to you two four-mana permission spells, each with a tantalizing mechanic:


[Dismiss](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dismiss), from the *Tempest* expansion, is what is known as a cantrip -- a card that replaces itself when it resolves. [Rewind](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rewind), from *Urza's Saga*, is graced with the "free mechanic" -- you get to untap four lands when it resolves, meaning you spent a net zero mana. Both cards were quite popular in their time, and it will be interesting to see which one ends up in *Eighth Edition*.


For the art choice, you get to choose between two different versions of the black common [Gravedigger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gravedigger) -- one illustrated by Dermot Power from the *Tempest* expansion, and one by James Bernardin from *Seventh Edition*.


I was asked about the ability to change your password by a player at Canadian Nationals. We do support the ability to change passwords (if you aren't a fan of random strings of letters); just click on "User Profile" in the little box in the upper right of the [front page](http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=mtgcom/welcome). And hey, once you've registered for this, you're free to vote and submit for You Make The Card as a little side bonus.


I'll be back next week with another update… until then, remember to cast your vote in ["Selecting *Eighth Edition*"](http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=mtgcom/vote8e/home).
