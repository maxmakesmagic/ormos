**Card of the Day - mercredi 31 mai 2006**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Voidslime)#### Voidslime


*Dissension* rare. When R&D ran its first survey to see which cards were most popular with the players, only Grand Arbiter Augustin IV managed to top Voidslime. The other three (from third to fifth) were Windreaver, Avatar of Discord, and Coiling Oracle.

![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Novijen,%20Heart%20of%20Progress)#### Novijen, Heart of Progress


*Dissension* uncommon.Early in *Dissension* design the three guildhalls had keyword abilities. The Simic land was actually just a land that tapped for colorless, but had Graft 1 as well, letting you improve one of your creatures +1/+1 for free. When the idea for the cycle was scrapped and the current version came about, the reason for adding the colored activation was to make sure the ability only worked for decks with access to Simic mana, since the original land had seemed so strange in non-Simic decks. 
 


**Card of the Day - lundi 29 mai 2006**

*Apocalypse* common. Blue is the king of bounce, but Green gets to do some bouncing of its own when it comes to sending opponents' lands to the tops of their decks. Green has examples as old as Stunted Growth and Fallow Earth, not to mention new cards from more recent sets like Rootrunner and Uproot.
 


**Card of the Day - vendredi 26 mai 2006**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Psychic%20Drain)#### Psychic Drain


*Ravnica* uncommon. While green and white often have several different ways to gain life, black most typically does it by "draining" opposing creatures (or mages). Inspired by the milling focus of the Dimir guild, Psychic Drain is the first card to explore draining a different resource, in this case the library. 
 


**Card of the Day - jeudi 25 mai 2006**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Shackles)#### Shackles


*Exodus* common. Throughout much of the game's history designers have explored different ways to offset some of the disadvantages inherent in enchant creature cards. One common answer is the opportunity to return the enchantment to hand should the enchanted creature be about to perish. The ability to return or reattach to different creatures is also an interesting one in that it has different uses depending on whether the enchantment is beneficial or detrimental to the creature it enchants. 
 


**Card of the Day - mercredi 24 mai 2006**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Squandered%20Resources)#### Squandered Resources


*Visions* rare. The saying "Great minds think alike" certainly applied to this card. After an argument over who had actually designed this card way back when, members of R&D went back in the file to find out the original designer of Squandered Resources. The answer turned out to be "all of them" as three different people had submitted the same idea for that set! 
 


**Card of the Day - mardi 23 mai 2006**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Gold%20Myr)#### Gold Myr


*Mirrodin* common. During *Mirrodin* design the Myr were actually gnomes. Gnomes were introduced to **Magic** during *Legends* with Quarum Trench Gnomes. But, starting with Clockwork Gnomes in *Homelands*, the gnome creature type became associated with artifact creatures. Since then, seven artifact gnomes have been printed, to just the one non-artifact gnome. Since gnomes-only-as-artifacts doesn't actually make much sense, the Myr were created instead so that gnomes didn't always have to continue being artifacts. 
 


**Card of the Day - lundi 22 mai 2006**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Aurification)#### Aurification


*Onslaught* rare. Jokingly named "A Little Mercy" during design in reference to *Urza's Legacy* rare No Mercy, the difference is that white often encourages creatures to stop wanting to attack rather than just killing them. (For more on this, see the Card of the Day from May 17, 2006.) 
 


**Card of the Day - vendredi 19 mai 2006**



![](https://web.archive.org/web/20210624224852im_/https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Lightning%20Bolt)#### Lightning Bolt


*Fourth Edition* common. One of the rarest **Magic** cards is a set of "misprint" Lightning Bolt foils with no text. Intended for special promotional use, the foil Lightning Bolts were printed on Japanese *Urza's Legacy* and *Urza's Destiny* sheets as a test to make sure they were coming out correctly. Though they weren't intended to show up in boosters some slipped through, making them incredibly rare. 
 


**Card of the Day - jeudi 18 mai 2006**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Boomerang)#### Boomerang


*Ninth Edition* common. This card is so associated with bounce that other bounce spells are often referred to as Boomerangs. While most people probably think of the curved thrown weapon known for returning to its thrower when hearing the name of this card, "Boomerang" can also mean an act or utterance that backfires on its originator. 
 


**Card of the Day - mercredi 17 mai 2006**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Swords%20to%20Plowshares)#### Swords to Plowshares


*Ice Age* uncommon. Many of white's single-creature "removal" spells focus on convincing the creature to simply not want to fight anymore, with the flavor that white is often about showing opposing creatures a better way rather than just killing them off. Though Swords to Plowshares actually does remove the creature from the game, many of white's other spells in this flavor leave the creature behind but uninterested in combat, such as Pacifism or Faith's Fetters. 
 


**Card of the Day - mardi 16 mai 2006**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Jackal%20Pup)#### Jackal Pup


 *Tempest* uncommon. This card, originally called Jackal Familiar, got an illustration that issomewhat... passive: a little girl apparently about to feed her puppy. Needless to say, the *Tempest*  team was a little disappointed with the art, and used the flavor text to poke fun at it. To make matters worse, Jackal Pup turned out to be one of the most aggressive cards in **Magic**'s history. 
 


**Card of the Day - lundi 15 mai 2006**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Fires%20of%20Yavimaya)#### Fires of Yavimaya


*Invasion* uncommon. One of the best tempo-generating cards ever printed, it has the distinction of being the first card in Multiverse that a newly hired Randy Buehler had posted about. He was man enough in his article last year during *Invasion* Week to admit to posting the following: 

 RB 11/11: I still doubt whether this will see enough constructed play to justify printing a super sealed card. recommend 2RG. 



**Card of the Day - vendredi 12 mai 2006**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Plated%20Spider)#### Plated Spider


*Urza's Destiny* common. What makes a spider a spider has been getting a lot of public attention lately. While mechanically the ability to block fliers is probably what most players would link to the creature type, there is also a strong history of having higher toughness than power. Aside from newcomer Aquastrand Spider (who is a mutant, after all), only Root Spider and Plated Spider of the 15 spiders printed so far have equal power and toughness. The biggest anomaly (literally!) is Goliath Spider, which actually has a higher power than toughness. 
 


**Card of the Day - jeudi 11 mai 2006**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Updraft)#### Updraft


*Ice Age* uncommon. Jump and Flight are two cards from **Magic**'s earliest days that have seen *many*  variations over the years. Both had the same mana cost despite the fact that Flight was permanent, part of the story being that Jump was a surprise, which helped offset it's one-shot nature. Updraft added a cantrip draw to the Jump effect, but added a mana as well. By the time *Stronghold* had arrived, Leap added a card draw to Jump but offered it at the same mana cast as the original!
 


**Card of the Day - mercredi 10 mai 2006**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Death%20Bomb)#### Death Bomb


*Planeshift* common. This card was part of an experiment to see just how bad creature removal could get before players would stop playing it in Limited formats. Thanks to its instant speed and single colored mana in the cost during a block where color fixing (and splashing) was paramount, this card still saw plenty of play! 
 


**Card of the Day - mardi 9 mai 2006**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Downdraft)#### Downdraft

 Some players think of the *Weatherlight* set as being the first appearance of the *Weatherlight* airship, as shown in the art of Downdraft. But the *Weatherlight* crew storyline actually began as early as *Mirage*; the ship's captain, Sisay, was quoted in the flavor text of Cerulean Wyvern and Teremko Griffin, and her Ring appeared in *Visions*. 
 


**Card of the Day - lundi 8 mai 2006**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Booster%20Tutor)#### Booster Tutor


*Unhinged* uncommon. This card was originally designed for the unreleased *Unglued 2* set, and features art originally commissioned for that set. The DCI promo version of this card features new art.
 


**Card of the Day - vendredi 5 mai 2006**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Dovescape)#### Dovescape


*Dissension* rare. The first version of this card actually made one token per noncreature spell, where that token's power and toughness were equal to the spell's converted mana cost. It was changed to the version you know because it was too much of a pain keeping track of the sizes of each of the different tokens in play once this thing started firing. 
 


**Card of the Day - jeudi 4 mai 2006**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Grand%20Arbiter%20Augustin%20IV)#### Grand Arbiter Augustin IV


*Dissension* rare. This card, which is getting a lot of attention as is, went through several incarnations during its design. The original version reduced blue and white spells by one colorless mana each, like the current version, but increased green, red, and/or black spells by one each. So, if you wanted to point a Darigaaz's Charm at this guy, you had to spend ![3 Mana](https://magic.wizards.com/images/Symbols/Symbol_3_mana.gif)![Black Mana](https://magic.wizards.com/images/Symbols/black_mana.gif)![Red Mana](https://magic.wizards.com/images/Symbols/red_mana.gif)![Green Mana](https://magic.wizards.com/images/Symbols/green_mana.gif). Ouch!
 


**Card of the Day - mercredi 3 mai 2006**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Azorius%20Ploy)#### Azorius Ploy


*Dissension* uncommon. White and Blue have had abilities like this as enchantments, such as Sandskin or Gaseous Form. But, as an instant ability, they mirror each other. White tends to prevent damage to creatures, and Blue now tends to prevent damage by creatures (in the form of the shrink ability, like Dizzy Spell). 
 


**Card of the Day - mardi 2 mai 2006**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Trial%20//%20Error)#### Trial // Error


*Dissension* uncommon. The Trial side actually began DIS design as a card all on its own, before split cards had been added to the set. The concern was that it didn't do quite enough on its own, so it was a perfect candidate once gold split cards were added to the set, where the added versatility means each side can be slightly less powerful than a full card on its own. 
 


**Card of the Day - lundi 1 mai 2006**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Azorius%20First-Wing)#### Azorius First-Wing


*Dissension* common. *Dissension* features some subtle ways in which the enemy Rakdos and Azorius guilds are opposed. In this one, Rakdos is the guild to get cards like Seal of Doom and Seal of Fire, but Azorius gets a flier with protection from enchantments.
