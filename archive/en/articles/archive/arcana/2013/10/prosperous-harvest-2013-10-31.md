M**agic** and I go back a long ways. I have very fond memories of casting [Prosperity](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Prosperity) when it was printed in *Visions*. That's one of the pieces of art from **Magic**  which is indellibly inked into my mind.

To me, [Prosperity](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Prosperity) is perhaps the first card I can remember where I realized that I could "mill" my opponents out by making them draw cards as well as simply using [Millstone](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Millstone) like effects. Those sort of revelations are quite powerful as they open a whole new aspect of the game up to you,

After being printed in both *Visions* and *Sixth Edition*, Prosperity returned in the introductory product *Portal* with new art, this time by Phil Foglio, showing two people living "the good life."

And now it is back again in *Commander* (2013 Edition) with a beautiful piece of new art by [Nic Klein](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&artist=%5B%22Nic%20Klein%22%5D).

[Prosperity](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Prosperity) | Art by [Nic Klein](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&artist=%5B%22Nic%20Klein%22%5D)


If you look at that art as it is blown up you can realize that the mage is strolling down a path of solid silver, and those trees aren't in some autumnal seasonâ€”they are actually gold bearing gold fruit! Now that's a prosperous harvest!
