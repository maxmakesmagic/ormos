Yesterday [we revealed the full contents](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/feature/duel-decks-speed-vs-cunning-2014-08-18) of [*Duel Decks: Speed vs. Cunning*](http://magic.wizards.com/en/game-info/products/card-set-archive/duel-decks-speed-vs-cunning), including a number of preview cards planned for *Khans of Tarkir*. But what might pass by people's new-card radar is the new art for two popular cards: [Repeal](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Repeal) and [Goblin Bombardment](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Bombardment).

But let's take a closer look at the new art and figure out what's going on.

[Repeal](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Repeal) | [Anthony Palumbo](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&artist=%5b%22Anthony+Palumbo%22%5d)


According to the art description, what we're seeing here is a demon being sent back to wherever it is demons come from. The monks inside are the ones [Repeal](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Repeal)ing the demon with blue light coming out of his chest. Neat.


Meanwhile, the art on [Goblin Bombardment](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Bombardment) from *Tempest* is an old-school favorite, but the new version is a pretty cool update.

[Goblin Bombardment](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Bombardment) | [Dave Kendall](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&artist=%5b%22Dave%20Kendall%22%5d)


Here, instead of seeing goblins loading themselves into siege weaponry just before being fired, we see a flaming goblin being hurled off a cliff, seemingly at a distant enemy.


Can't wait to get your hands on these new versions of classic cards? [*Duel Decks: Speed vs. Cunning*](http://magic.wizards.com/en/game-info/products/card-set-archive/duel-decks-speed-vs-cunning) releases September 5.
