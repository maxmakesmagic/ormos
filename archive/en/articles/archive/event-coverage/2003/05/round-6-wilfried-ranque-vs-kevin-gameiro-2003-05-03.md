Both of these players were on four wins and a draw going into the round, and so were attempting to make it into day two with an undefeated record. Ranque is of course by far the better known player, Kevin hasn't even played a Pro Tour, but yet he's ahead of many more highly regarded players today.

### Game 1

![Smokespew Invoker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Smokespew+Invoker)Kevin made a second turn [Elvish Warrior](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elvish+Warrior) and third turn [Crypt Sliver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crypt+Sliver). These were held at bay by Wilfried's 4/4 [Embalmed Brawler](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Embalmed+Brawler). Ranque made a [Mistform Seaswift](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mistform+Seaswift) but held it back to block when Gameiro played [Elven Riders](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elven+Riders). Kevin was badly flooded as well. He didn't play a single spell after the [Elven Riders](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elven+Riders), and could only sit and watch as Wilfried got up to eight mana with a [Smokespew Invoker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Smokespew+Invoker) in play. At that point Kevin conceded. "I don't think I can lose against that deck," Wilfried told me. To back up his argument he revealed [Bane of the Living](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bane+of+the+Living), an [Infest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Infest), and a pair of [Noxious Ghoul](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Noxious+Ghoul)s.Wilfried Ranque 1 â€“ Kevin Gameiro 0

### Game 2

Once again Kevin's early drops of [Wirewood Savage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wirewood+Savage) and [Elvish Warrior](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elvish+Warrior) were held at bay by an [Embalmed Brawler](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Embalmed+Brawler). Kevin got to six mana and made [Anurid Murkdiver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Anurid+Murkdiver). Ranque attacked with Brawler, [Sootfeather Flock](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sootfeather+Flock), morph and [Festering Goblin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Festering+Goblin). Kevin didn't put much thought into his blocks and just blocked [Festering Goblin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Festering+Goblin) with [Elvish Warrior](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elvish+Warrior). Ranque gave the -1/-1 to the Murkdiver and then unmorphed [Bane of the Living](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bane+of+the+Living) for 2.

This [Wrath](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wrath)ed all of Kevin's team, and he drew two further lands to complement the two he had in hand before dying to the [Embalmed Brawler](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Embalmed+Brawler) and [Bane of the Living](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bane+of+the+Living)

**Final Result:** Wilfried Ranque defeats Kevin Gameiro 2-0
