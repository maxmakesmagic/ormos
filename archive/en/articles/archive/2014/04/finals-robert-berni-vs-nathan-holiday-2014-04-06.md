For Robert Berni, his appearance in the final match of Grand Prix Phoenix 2014 was a chance to claim what was lost in Grand Prix Kansas City 2013, where his chances at a trophy were dashed by eventual winner Seth Manfield in their Semifinal match. 


For Nathan Holiday, Grand Prix Phoenix 2014 was a chance for him to add another trophy to his collection. The Grand Prix San Diego 2013 Champion had already earned one Constructed title, and a win in Phoenix would cement his place among the United States' best Grand Prix Constructed competitors. 



 The two faced off with relatively classic takes on Black and Blue Devotion, respectively. In a tournament where many were ready with splashes and new tech, it came down to a match between two decks that are synonymous with the post-*Theros* Standard metagame. Which one would win in this classic showdown?




**The Games**




 Holiday spent his second and third turn deploying [Cloudfin Raptor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloudfin+Raptor), then growing it with a [Judge's Familiar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Judge%27s+Familiar) with [Tidebinder Mage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tidebinder+Mage). A [Bident of Thassa](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bident+of+Thassa) threatened to over-take the game, despite Berni's best efforts at controlling the board with a hand of multiple [Bile Blight](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bile+Blight)s. [Domestication](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Domestication) on [Nightveil Specter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nightveil+Specter) cleared the path for another swing with his only remaining creature, a [Judge's Familiar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Judge%27s+Familiar).




 While Berni had spot-removal to answer most of Holiday's creatures, including for his own stolen [Nightveil Specter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nightveil+Specter), it was too slow and not enough, as Holiday continued to fuel his hand with cards courtesy of his [Bident of Thassa](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bident+of+Thassa). A [Master of Waves](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Master+of+Waves) made things elementary, and Berni was more than willing to move to a second game.
