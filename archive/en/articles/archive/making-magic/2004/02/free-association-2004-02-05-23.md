 Working in R&D since '95, Mark became Magic head designer in '03. His hobbies: spending time with family, writing about Magic in all mediums, and creating short bios. 






To make things [fun](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/mr110.asp?origin=fun), some sections have no links to lead to them. This means that these sections can only be gotten to through a [random](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=magic/mr110.asp) link (you see, some links send you to a random page rather than a pre-selected one). It seemed only fitting to explain this on a link that was itself isolated and not linked to. (Oddly, the one about the Greased Weasel has a link.)
