* Six *Tenth Edition* boosters,
* A pack of 40 *Tenth Edition* basic lands,
* A Tenth Edition Spindown life counter (only available in this fat pack), and

Kev Walker's panorama depicts [Reya Dawnbringer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reya+Dawnbringer) and two [Serra Angel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Serra+Angel)s taking on the [Lord of the Pit](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lord+of+the+Pit)—a classic battle of the forces of good versus a singular master of evil. The panorama art is tiled across the two card boxes in such a way that they line up when placed next to each other.
