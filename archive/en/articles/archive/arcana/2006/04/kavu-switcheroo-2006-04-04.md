When the Phyrexians invaded Dominaria in the *Invasion* Block timeline, [Multani, Maro-Sorceror](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Multani%2C+Maro-Sorceror) awakened the ancient race of the kavu to help defend Yavimaya.


The kavu came in all shapes, sizes and habitats. Although most of the kavu kept territories in Dominarian forests and mountains, the art of *Planeshift's* 
[Mire Kavu](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mire+Kavu) shows an unusual swamp-dwelling kavu about to overpower a Phyrexian.

Note that [Mire Kavu](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Mire%2BKavu). The next set, *Apocalypse*, did indeed bring a kavu capable of flight, but [Captain Sisay](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Captain+Sisay)'s quote was very nearly *not* prophetic. 



[Kavu Glider](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kavu+Glider), in line with *Apocalypse's* themes of enemy color combinations, is a red creature that can gain flying with the expenditure of blue mana. But its art was originally commissioned for another card, a non-kavu creature called "Patagia Pyrosaur" that was never printed.

In the original illustration for "Patagia Pyrosaur," the creature was shown spitting fire, but the fire was removed and replaced with a tongue for the purposes of its new kavu identity.
