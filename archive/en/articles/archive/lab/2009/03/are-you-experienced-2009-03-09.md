![](https://media.wizards.com/legacy//mtg/images/daily/ftl/ftl29_rancorrisingfireball.jpg)Hello all, and welcome back to my diabolical laboratory after a bit more of a break between columns than the usual one week. I'm sad to say that my usually reliable Apple computer had one of its rotten moments, which are few and far between. My article for last Wednesday, which was set to go a couple of days before, was one of the many casualties in the "Grand Document Deathdate," as I am calling it. Thus, I couldn't be ready in time and had to take a blank week.

But enough of this melancholy topic, I say! It's Timmy Week, baby! A week celebrating the joy of the big spell, which may or may not be a giant [Fireball](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fireball); the glorious rush of a [Craw Wurm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Craw+Wurm) rumbling across the battlefield for 8 (because it's got a [Rancor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rancor) on it, of course!); and most of all, the pure and untainted fun of **Magic**.

Now I know what you're all thinking: "This is the Johnny column! How can a mad scientist possibly channel the spirit of power gaming?" While I'm as miffed as any combo enthusiast about Johnny not getting his own week (although, Timmy is often contextually followed by his fellow player psychographics ...), I enjoy tapping out for [Verdant Force](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Verdant+Force) as much as anyone. *Conflux* still has that new set shimmer to it, so let's see what Timmytastic marvels lie within.
