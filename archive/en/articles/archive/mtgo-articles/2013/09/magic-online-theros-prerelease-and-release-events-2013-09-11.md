**Magic Online** *Theros* Prerelease events begin on October 4, 2013, at 10:00 AM PDT and will run through the weekend. When Prerelease events conclude on Monday morning, October 7, at 10:00 AM, *Theros* will go on sale in the **Magic Online** Store. *Theros* Release Event queues (Sealed Deck and Draft) will begin at the same time the set goes on sale so players wonâ€™t have to wait before jumping into a draft!


As part of the *Theros*  Prerelease Events, you have the opportunity to choose your Hero's Path as part of participating in certain events. Your Hero's Path comes with an avatar and a promo card you can use in events.


We've [changed our Release Events](#release) as well, with lower entry requirements for the 16-Player Sealed Deck queues, improved prizes for the Premier Release Top 8 Sealed Deck events, and hourly 64-player Top 8 Premier Draft events!

Prerelease: Pick Your Hero's Path

You have been chosen by the gods of *Theros*  to stand among heroes! To begin building your myth you will have a choice. During *Theros*  Prerelease you must choose your Hero's Path based on one of **Magic**'s mana colors.


Your Hero's Path will be used as part of the entry for *Theros*  Prerelease Sealed Deck Queues. Players can purchase their Hero's Path, which is untradeable, from the **Magic Online** Store for $5.00 USD from 1:00 PM PDT on Wednesday, October 2, until 10:00 AM PDT on Monday, October 7.


For Prerelease, players will receive a tradeable avatar that corresponds to their chosen Hero's Path, which they can set as their user avatar in **Magic Online**. Also included with their Hero's Path will be one of five different *Theros*  Prerelease premium foil promo cards.


Hero's Path Choices



|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Hero's Path | Avatar | Promo Card |
| Honor |  | The Protector | Celestial Archon |
| Wisdom |  | The Philosopher | Shipbreaker Kraken |
| Ambition |  | The Avenger | Abhorrent Overlord |
| Battle |  | The Warrior | Ember Swallower |
| Might |  | The Hunter | Anthousa, Setessan Hero |


Once a player has chosen and purchased a Hero's Path, that player can use it and 20 Event Tickets to enter the *Theros*  Prerelease Sealed Deck Queues. Players will receive five Theros booster packs and one seeded booster pack that match their chosen Hero's Path.


Prerelease Events will consist of two parts: the *Theros*  Prerelease Sealed Deck Queue and the *Theros*  Swiss Draft Queue. Both events will be available for the duration of the *Theros*  Prerelease.


Only the Sealed Deck events will require a Hero's Path to join. Unused Hero's Path entry objects may be refunded within 30 days by sending a request to [customer service](http://wizards.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/1094/kw/refund).

We have made a few changes to *Theros*  Release Events that we think improve the play experience.


The Release Sealed Deck Queues are now lower cost to enter than other Sealed Deck events, and we have adjusted the prizes in accordance with the lower entry requirements. These events are great for players looking to build their *Theros*  collections.


Our *Theros*  Release 64-Player Top 8 Premier Drafts will start every hour on the hour beginning October 11, giving players a more exciting play experience in these very popular events.


We've improved prizes for Premier Release Top 8 Sealed Deck events and extended awards through 64th place. Now more players will receive booster packs. We have also changed the number of players in the event to a minimum of 129 and a maximum of 212. This makes for a more consistent time frame for Swiss events, followed by a Top 8. Plus, you will have opportunities to enter sixteen *Theros*  Premier Release Top 8 Sealed Deck events each week of Release, running Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. These replace other Premier events that would normally run during this period.


Because of [upcoming changes](#championship) for the *Theros*  Championship, Release Events will not grant invitations. More information on the Championship changes will be announced on October 7.

***Theros*  Championship**  

The *Theros*  Championship will be a completely reimagined event. We are moving the *Theros*  Championship to later in the *Theros*  cycle, closer to when *Born of the Gods*  releases, and the new *Theros*  Championship will operate independent from *Theros*  Release Events. The *Theros* Release 64-Player Top 8 Premier Draft and Release Premier Top 8 Sealed Deck Events will no longer qualify players for the *Theros*  Championship.


Look for more information in the News and Updates article on October 7.


Using an account other than your own, allowing any other player to use your account, selling your account, and other similar actions are all violations of the [**Magic Online** User Agreement](http://wizards.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/1358/~/magic-online%3A-user-agreement-and-software-license). If you play in **Magic Online**  events, win, and expect to get your prize, be very, very sure you are playing on your own account. We do not recognize excuses, such as "I and a friend jointly own the account," "It's my brother's account but he gave it to me," or similar. The only exception is an adult may authorize a single dependent child age 13-18 to play on an account that the adult has established.
