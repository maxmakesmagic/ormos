The demise of control has been greatly exaggerated. Though it's not going to be the runaway success of the tournament, it has a solid place at the table, and if you don't plan to face it, you might just lose to it. This is exactly what No. 5 Ivan Floch and No. 6 Stanislaw Cifka thought. So many pros have said they didn't think control was anything, showing up with a solid control deck was a surprise. Floch used that to his benefit. Their big, scary Blue-Black deck was full of creature removal and card advantage. But he wasn't the only one who got the control memo.



 2010 Player of the Year, Brad Nelson, had a control plan too. But unlike Floch, he had the whole thing in his sideboard. What starts as a Red-White aggressive deck with [Hordeling Outburst](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hordeling+Outburst), [Goblin Rabblemaster](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Rabblemaster), and [Lightning Strike](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Strike)s, turns into a deck with [Suspension Field](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Suspension+Field)s, [End Hostilities](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=End+Hostilities), and [Chained to the Rocks](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chained+to+the+Rocks).



Though this is a great plan against most midrange decks, it's the worst against a big Blue-Black Control deck. Nelson admitted that his deck is gas against just about everything in the format, except for a giant control-y beast like Floch's.




*5th-ranked Ivan Floch and Brad Nelson's match-up represent the classic clash of control against aggro.*
