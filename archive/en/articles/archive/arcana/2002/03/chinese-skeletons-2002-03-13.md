The Chinese government has strict control over the media in their country, and **Magic** card art is no exception. Along with overtly sexual or violent illustrations, human skeletons are not permitted on the cards.

In order to comply to these strict regulations, art often has to be completely redone, but in some cases the original can be altered enough to pass. The above example shows how the [Unworthy Dead](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Unworthy+Dead) from *Urza's Saga* were given some flesh and muscle to cover their exposed bones for the Chinese version.

The redone Unworthy Dead art was then used *again* for the Chinese *Sixth Edition* 
[Drudge Skeletons](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Drudge+Skeletons). As a rule, art is never used twice on *different* cards, but when the government gets involved, rules sometimes need to be broken. (The English *6E* Skeletons is to the right; altering that art was probably too daunting a task under the deadlines.)
