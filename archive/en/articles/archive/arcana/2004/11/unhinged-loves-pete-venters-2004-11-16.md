Here's the art for an upcoming *[Unhinged](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=magic/expansion/unh)* card illustrated by Pete Venters. As you might realize, it's full of elements from other **Magic** cards -- cards that were *also* illustrated by Pete Venters.


  
*Art by Pete Venters -- Like, lots of it*



There's [Baron Sengir](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Baron+Sengir) and [Shauku, Endbringer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shauku%2C+Endbringer) hitting it off right in front (with [Cabal Archon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cabal+Archon) playing matchmaker). Can you spot all the other references to [Pete Venters](http://gatherer.wizards.com/default.asp?term=pete_venters&fields=%7Cartist&format=Allsets&color=All&output=summary&sort=name&first=1)-illustrated cards?
