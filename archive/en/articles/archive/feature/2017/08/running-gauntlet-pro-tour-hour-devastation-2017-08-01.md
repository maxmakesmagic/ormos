 Better known as NumotTheNummy, Kenji is a lover of all things Magic. A "legendary streamer," you can almost always find him playing Magic Online over at his Twitch channel. When he's not playing Magic, Kenji enjoys long walks on the beach, romantic comedies, and devouring the hopes and dreams of the innocent. 






Another Pro Tour come and gone—which means another rendition of Running the Gauntlet! You know the drill; I've picked out a few of the best-performing and coolest decks to be played at the Pro Tour and taken them for a spin of my own. Ramunap Red might have been the breakout deck of the tournament, but that doesn't stop me from trying out some other great strategies as well! Take a look below to see what decks I've chosen this time around.

As always, the Pro Tour is its own tournament, one that shapes the landscape of decks after it comes to resolution. You have to remember that it is also entirely a standalone beast, which means the best decks at the Pro Tour are the best decks *for that tournament*. This holds true for [Pro Tour *Hour of Devastation*](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/pthou) as well. While Ramunap Red had an absurd conversion rate to Day Two and for the Top 8 as well, you can still try out a plethora of different strategies that are viable and potentially more to your liking.


Whether you're casting one-mana 1/1s with haste or seven-mana artifacts, hopefully you've enjoyed this little gauntlet and everything else to have come from Pro Tour *Hour of Devastation*.
