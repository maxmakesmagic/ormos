Teruya Kakumae, who won GP Kobe in 2014, had drafted a very fast Mardu deck and used it to destroy his previous two opponents to reach the finals of GP Auckland. His opponent, Maitland Cameron, who made Top 4 at GP Sydney in 2014, had drafted a slower, mid-range Abzan deck that had ground out two wins. It was time to see who's fate it was to take the trophy.

Cameron started off awkwardly with a mulligan to six. Kakumae led off with an un-raided [War-Name Aspirant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=War-Name+Aspirant). Cameron continued to play lands without casting creatures. Kakumae, in opposition, kept the pressure on, first with a morph, then a raided [Bellowing Saddlebrute](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bellowing+Saddlebrute).


Cameron failed to find his [End Hostilities](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=End+Hostilities) by Turn Six. At that point he recognised he couldn't recover and conceded.



**Kakumae 1 - Cameron 0**



Both players kept their seven cards, with Cameron on the play. Cameron led off with a swamp and a [Typhoid Rats](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Typhoid+Rats), perfect to slow down Kakumae's aggressive deck. It was followed by a [Sultai Emissary](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sultai+Emissary), another card suited to slowing the game down.

Kakumae summoned a [Typhoid Rats](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Typhoid+Rats) of his own and the two vermin traded. Kakumae continued to play creatures, but Cameron again found himself stranded without mana, stuck on two lands. Kakumae cast a [Jeskai Student](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jeskai+Student), followed by a Morph that flipped to reveal a [Ponyback Brigade](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ponyback+Brigade), bringing with it three goblin 1/1s.


Cameron hoped to find something to slow Kakumae down, but instead found himself discarding cards at the end of his turn. A [Noxious Dragon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Noxious+Dragon) and a second [Ponyback Brigade](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ponyback+Brigade) from Kakumae and Cameron offered the hand. In under ten minutes, Kakumae had won GP Auckland.
