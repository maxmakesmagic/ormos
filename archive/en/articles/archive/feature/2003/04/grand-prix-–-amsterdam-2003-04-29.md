**HOW TO REACH RAI AMSTERDAM**

**Excellent accessibility**The RAI Exhibition and Congress Centre is the perfect venue for exhibitions, conferences, seminars and other events. This is partly due to its excellent accessibility, both from within the Netherlands and from abroad, on public and private transport alike.

Amsterdam RAI has its own railway station and is less than ten minutes’ travelling time by train from Schiphol Airport. Although the RAI Exhibition and Congress Centre is located on the outskirts of Amsterdam, the city centre with its attractive canals, pavement cafés, tourist attractions and a wide range of entertainment is just fifteen minutes away by public transport. The express trams are ideal for longer journeys within the city boundaries, and the ordinary trams stop right in front of the RAI and provide a quick and convenient service to all parts of Amsterdam.

And last but not least, Amsterdam RAI has its own harbour on the side of the complex that borders on the park. This provides a direct connection to Amsterdam’s extensive canal network.

**By air**  
 You can reach Amsterdam RAI from Amsterdam Airport Schiphol by car or public transport in less than 15 minutes. Schiphol Airport is one of Europe's biggest airports and offers passengers a high standard of service. This includes digital service. Your relaxed business trip starts with a visit to Schiphol.nl. This website provides up-to-date information about flights (Schiphol Travel Update), transport to Amsterdam Rai (Schiphol Travel Taxi), booking a ticket and booking a rental car (Reisbureau Schiphol TravelPort), and also about exclusive and inexpensive shopping (See Buy Fly Pre order). For information about the business facilities at the airport and all kinds of useful travel tips as well as additional information and services, quickly make your way to [Schiphol.nl!](http://www.Schiphol.nl)

**By Tram & Bus**  
 If you arrive at Amsterdam Central Station (CS), you can take the Amstelveen express tram 51 (travelling time: 12 minutes, exit at the Amsterdam RAI station) or tram 4 (travelling time: 30 minutes, exit at the RAI Europaplein). If you are travelling by train to the Amstel station, you can take the Amstelveen express tram 51 (travelling time: 5 minutes) or the bus (route 15, 69 or 169), which will bring you to the RAI within 10 minutes. In this case you should get off at RAI Europaplein. From Amsterdam Sloterdijk station, the best way to reach the RAI is with express tram 50.

**By Train**  
 The intercity trains from Roosendaal/Belgium connect at Schiphol with trains going to the Amsterdam RAI station. At Schiphol you can change trains on the same platform. The fastest way to reach the RAI if you are coming from Arnhem/Germany, is to take the train to Amsterdam Duivendrecht station. Here you can change trains for the Amsterdam RAI station. There is also direct train connection with the Amsterdam RAI station from Rotterdam, the Hague, Leiden, Weesp, het Gooi and the Flevo polders.
