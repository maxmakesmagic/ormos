**Upcoming *Kaladesh* Streamer Showdown on October 7**


If you've never seen a Streamer Showdown before, they come in two eight-player pods that feature some of the best streamers in the community brawling with the latest *Magic Online* sets, Cubes, and Flashback Drafts. If you're trying to improve your game, *Magic Online* streamers are some of the best players out there—and some of the best teachers, too. Even if you're already a *Magic* pro, throw your support behind one of the competitors and cheer them on from their Twitch chat!

**The Year of Modern Flashbacks Continues with *New Phyrexia***


It's 2016: The Year of Modern Flashbacks! If you want to build up a collection for Modern, these Flashback Drafts add everything you draft to your collection once the event is over. Even if Modern isn't your thing, you can enjoy a leisurely Draft through the planes of the past with rotating formats each week!


Full *Scars of Mirrodin* Block Drafts kick off after the September 28 downtime. Get the full schedule [here](http://magic.wizards.com/en/MTGO/content/magic-online-limited-events#YearOfModernFlashbacks) and mark your calendar for the formats you're most excited about!

**Updating *Magic Online* Operating System Requirements**


Unfortunately, an infrastructure update on September 21 makes Windows Vista SP2 incompatible with *Magic Online*—the [requirements page](http://magic.wizards.com/en/content/download) has been updated to reflect this change. In order to resolve this issue, you’ll need to upgrade to Windows 7 or higher.

**Qualifier Point Switchover Incoming**


Now that 2016 *Magic Online* Championship Series (MOCS) Qualifier Events are wrapping up, we'll begin the transition into awarding Qualifier Points (QPs) for the 2017 MOCS. QPs for the 2016 MOCS will be removed from collections during the Wednesday, October 5, downtime. In the meantime, QPs for the 2016 season can be sorted within the Collection Scene by applying the "Qualifier Points" filter.


For the 2017 MOCS, we’ll be using a generic Qualifier Point that doesn’t list a particular season on it (like we’ve been using “Season 1” for 2016. Since there is only one Qualifier Point object as of October 5, we’ll be removing “Qualifier Points” as a collection filter with that downtime. The new Qualifier Point object can be found in the “Tickets” filter.

**Upcoming Modern MOCS Monthly Event on October 1—**Last Chance to Use 2016 QPs****


A *Magic Online* Championship Series (MOCS) Modern Monthly Event is coming up on October 1! Players who have at least 35 Qualifier Points (QPs) in their account are eligible to participate. The series will contain 12 Monthly Events, each of which qualify top players for one of the four Playoff Events. These Playoff Events qualify top players for the *Magic Online* Championship, a Pro Tour, and the Pro Tour Challenge event at that Pro Tour.


Monthly and Playoff Events also award top players MOCS Leaderboard Points for the current quarter and for the year as a whole. Players of sufficient standing on the MOCS Leaderboard(s) will also qualify for Playoff Events later in the 2016 *Magic Online* Championship Series as well as the *Magic Online* Championship.


We look forward to seeing you on October 1 for the final Monthly Event! Learn more about the 2016 *Magic Online* Championship Series [here](http://magic.wizards.com/en/content/2016-magic-online-championship-series).
