If you're getting antsy to play *Scars of Mirrodin*, then here's good news: the [Launch Parties](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/events/releases) start this Friday and run the whole weekend!


Obviously, the main lure is the fun of playing **Magic**. But there's also a special promo card that you get just by showing up and playing! While supplies last, that is.

That's right, it's a special shiny promo [Steel Hellkite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Steel+Hellkite)! It doesn't look that shiny there, so we went for an angle that's a little more ... *dramatic*.

October 1-4. *Scars of Mirrodin* Launch Parties. Be there!
