Some of you may not know this, but I'm a big fan of Goblins in **Magic**. For example, I have one primary Commander deck I've kept together for several years, while all others come and go, and that is my [Kiki-Jiki, Mirror Breaker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kiki-Jiki%2C+Mirror+Breaker). Given how much I enjoy Goblins as my tribe in **Magic**, I thought it was time I tested you all to see just how you do on a little Goblin quiz.


**1.** How many cards in **Magic** have the Goblin subtype?


* [222](#)  - Sorry, there are 222 red Goblins in **Magic**, but there are quite a few non-red Goblins in **Magic**.
* [275](#)  - Oops, this is how many Goblin creatures there are in **Magic**, but *Lorwyn* block introduced non-creature spells with the Goblin subtype.
* [281](#)  - Correct!
* [307](#)  - Sure, if you count Changelings you're correct, but really who counts Changeling creatures for this?

2. What Goblin in the *Return to Ravnica* block has flying?


[[Reveal]](#)

3. Outside of limited From the Vault box sets, what is the only Goblin printed as a mythic rare?


[[Reveal]](#)


![Warren Instigator](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Warren%20Instigator)![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/Handlers/Image.ashx)


4. After red, which color has the most Goblins in it?


* [Green](#)  - This is the third most prevalent!
* [White](#)  - Nope, aside from the occasional Boros cross over, there is almost never a white Goblin.
* [Blue](#)  - While not unheard of, Goblins don't exactly lend themselves to the blue section of the color pie.
* [Black](#)  - Correct! Again, *Lorwyn* really showed this the most but they are far from the only sets where you'll see Goblins in Black. Goblin Spike Jester for example!

5. Who is the greatest Goblin of all time?


* [Kiki-Jiki](#)  - Unquestionably correct! You win! You are the best!
* [Krenko](#)  - Nope, you might think so but I can assure you that you are wrong.
* [Squee](#)  - Sure, some might think so, but they're wrong.
