Day 1 Coverage



The ultimate masters of the day are Charles Wong, Vikram Kudva, and Richard Liu. Each armed with decks they were unsure about, they traipsed through the fields of Day 1 and came out the other end unscathed.


That's seems the hallmark of *Ultimate Masters* Day 2 Coverage Sealed. The set is so balanced for Limited, it's difficult to have "the perfect" Sealed deck. Instead, you are two or three cards away from the perfect deck in a few different directions. You just have to navigate which archetype to fill out.


Though those three navigated the tides the best, many players are chomping at the boat to take those top spots away. Shuhei Nakamura, Paul Rietzl, Jason Chan, Andrew Elenbogen, Ben Hull, Huang Hao-Shan, and Jeff Cunningham (yes, *that* Jeff Cunningham) are just behind them at 8-1. All of them could easily take out the top players and crown themselves Grand Prix Vancouver Champion. We'll find out tomorrow!
