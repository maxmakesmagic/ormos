Our *Onslaught* previews will begin on September 9th, with a new installment of the "Orb of Insight" and lots of cool articles. Posters and ads for the set should start popping up in shops everywhere soon (if they haven't already), but for those of you that don't get out to the card shop much, here's a shot of the poster and the "window cling."


Feel free to speculate all you want... we'll be here with the skinny on the 9th.
