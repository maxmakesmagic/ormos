GRAND PRIX VANCOUVER 2014 - QUARTERFINALS ROUND-UP
==================================================



 Posted in [NEWS](/en/articles)
 on January 29, 2014 










By a strange twist of fate, three of the four quarterfinal matches are the same matchup: Blue-White Control against Mono-Blue Devotion. Here's a brief rundown of how they went.


### Alexander Hayne vs. Eugene Hwang

*Eugene Hwang*
In the first game, Hwang had Hayne under early pressure, but Hayne managed to keep up with a string of answers. He resolved a small [Sphinx's Revelation](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sphinx%27s+Revelation), but was still down to 7 life facing Thassa and [Mutavault](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mutavault)s. The Revelation was a good one. [Detention Sphere](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Detention+Sphere) stopped Thassa, and [Jace, Architect of Thought](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace%2C+Architect+of+Thought) took the sting out of the [Mutavault](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mutavault)s. Next up was [Elspeth, Sun's Champion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elspeth%2C+Sun%27s+Champion) to provide a string of blockers and take over combat. Hwang's last gasp came a turn or two later with an overloaded [Cyclonic Rift](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cyclonic+Rift), but Hayne was ready with [Dissolve](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dissolve). His soldier tokens marched to victory.

*Alexander Hayne*

Hwang resolved a turn-three [Nightveil Specter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nightveil+Specter) on the play and Hayne didn't have an immediate answer on two lands and a guildgate. The Specter stole a [Dissolve](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dissolve) from Hayne's deck, but that was no good against [Supreme Verdict](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Supreme+Verdict). Hwang tried to build up a base of devotion in play but each time Hayne would be ready with another [Supreme Verdict](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Supreme+Verdict). Hwang kept the pressure up, but soon Elspeth was hitting the field and Hwang couldn't get past her.


### Alexander Hayne defeats Eugene Hwang 2-0


 


### Robert Gillespie vs. Adam Ruprecht

*Robert Gillespie*

Ruprecht's draw in game one was long on land and short on threats. He could only stare forlornly at his two Bidents of Thassa, one in hand, one in play, and a big stack of island. Gillespie meanwhile was resolving a big [Sphinx's Revelation](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sphinx%27s+Revelation) and then [Elspeth, Sun's Champion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elspeth%2C+Sun%27s+Champion).


### Gillespie 1 - Ruprecht 0

*Adam Ruprecht*

In the second game, [Judge's Familiar](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Judge%27s+Familiar) got thassa on board past [Essence Scatter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Essence+Scatter), but Ruprecht just couldn't keep any creatures on the board to go with her. [Frostburn Weird](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Frostburn+Weird) fell to [Last Breath](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Last+Breath). [Syncopate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Syncopate) stopped [Bident of Thassa](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bident+of+Thassa). Not even an anemic [Master of Waves](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Master+of+Waves) for two was allowed to stay in play. And then the dynamic duo showed up: [Jace, Architect of Thought](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace%2C+Architect+of+Thought) and [Elspeth, Sun's Champion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elspeth%2C+Sun%27s+Champion). Ruprect played it out to the bitter end, and then congratulated Gillespie on advancing to the semifinals.

*Mike Vasovski* 

Vasovski's Blue-White was a little slow, so as it matched answers to Sundholm's threats, he was also taking a lot of damage. He finally managed to [Detention Sphere](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Detention+Sphere) away Thassa and then [Supreme Verdict](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Supreme+Verdict) a turn later. However, he was very low on life, and Sundholm had [Mutavault](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mutavault)s, stealing the game before a big [Sphinx's Revelation](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sphinx%27s+Revelation) could turn the tide.


### Sundholm 1 - Vasovski 0


Sundholm mulliganed to six and started slowly with just a third-turn Thassa and then a [Frostburn Weird](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Frostburn+Weird) without a fourth land. Vasovski went for [Jace, Architect of Thought](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace%2C+Architect+of+Thought) and plussed it, but Sundholm had [Tidebinder Mage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tidebinder+Mage) in hand. Thassa and the Weird attacked, and with a pump Jace was in the graveyard.

*Peter Sundholm*

Vasovski played a second Jace and this one served up cards, but crucially, no [Supreme Verdict](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Supreme+Verdict). Sundholm's team dispatched the second Jace and dealt damage to Vasovski. Again no Wrath for Vasovski, but [Archangel of Thune](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Archangel+of+Thune). Sundholm swung all out. The [Archangel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Archangel) stepped in front of the Weird, and Sundholm fully pumped it to trade. Thassa was turned off, for the time being. A turn later Sundholm dropped [Frostburn Weird](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Frostburn+Weird) and hit with Thassa, then lost a counter war over [Azorius Charm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Azorius+Charm). Unfortunately for Vasovski, he had no way to stop her hitting play again, and though [Elspeth, Sun's Champion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elspeth%2C+Sun%27s+Champion) could provide board control, Thassa would let [Mutavault](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mutavault)s slip through for lethal. He soon conceded.
