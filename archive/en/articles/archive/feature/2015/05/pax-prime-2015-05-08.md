PAX Prime doesn't start till August 28, but it's already time to get excited.



This year's PAX Prime is going to feature a whole new approach for *Magic*, and a host of new events.



The biggest, of course, is that the World Championship—the pinnacle of *Magic* achievement—will be held at PAX Prime. And if you have a badge, you can be there for every moment, every twist and turn, right up until the final turn.



Additionally, we'll have a multitude of play opportunities, our *Magic* panel (where we might reveal a few secrets about *Battle for Zendikar* ), and the ever popular *Magic* PAX Party, where we'll celebrate all that is *Magic*…and maybe boogie down for a song or seven.



How will we fit all of this awesome in to a single PAX?



We're taking over the Annex.



This year, for the first time, all of *Magic*'s activities are going to take place in one…well…place. We've used the Annex before as a play location for *Magic*, but this year we're expanding to make the Annex *the* central hub for all that is *Magic*. That means the World Championships, the party, the panel, absolutely *everything* will take place in the Annex this year. That does mean we won't have a booth in any of the halls, but it also means you'll have one stop for all your *Magic* wants and, yes, needs at PAX Prime this year.



So if you want to be part of all the action August 28–31 in Seattle, [head over to the PAX site](http://www.paxsite.com/) for more information.
