![Mikokoro, Center of the Sea](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Mikokoro%2C+Center+of+the+Sea)We've already described on magicthegathering.com how the world design of Kamigawa was informed by considerable research by R&D into Japanese myth and culture. 

 Today we look at one example from a John Avon-illustrated, card-drawing land in *Saviors of Kamigawa*: **[Mikokoro, Center of the Sea](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mikokoro%2C+Center+of+the+Sea)**.

Mikokoro is the crystalline outcropping in the center of the frame. See those ropes and zigzag strips hanging from the peaks? Let's take a look at the art description to learn more about them. 

The art description of [Mikokoro, Center of the Sea](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mikokoro%2C+Center+of+the+Sea) reads:


> *Show an island off the coast that consists of a single immense boulder of uncut crystal or diamond that juts out from the sea. The boulder is strung with shimenawa, huge ropes that designate a sacred site in Shinto. Perhaps the clouds have parted and a sunbeam hits the boulder from above, accentuating its holiness and power.*

Those ropes are called *shimenawa*. In Shinto tradition, they are often made from straw and strung with zigzag strips of white paper called *gohei*. 

And *gohei* you may have seen before... or have you already long-forgotten the term since *Champions*?
