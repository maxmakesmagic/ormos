Walking the Planes went to the World *Magic* Cup! In this episode, we learn about the unusual interests of Hong Kong *Magic* players, which countries can rage like a Goblin, and what pure joy looks like when a team brings home victory for a nation. Bringing a lighthearted spin on serious competition, WTP and the World *Magic* Cup honor players from all over the globe!
