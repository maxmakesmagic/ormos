### THE WEEK THAT WAS


2014 Hall of Fame Ballot Boxing
===============================



![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/styles/auth_small/public/images/person/authorpic_briandavid-marshall.jpg)

Brian David-Marshall

Brian David-Marshall is a New York–based game designer who has been involved with Magic since 1994, when he started organizing tournaments and ran a Manhattan game store. Since then, he has been a judge, a player, and one of the longest-tenured columnists on DailyMTG.com, as he enters his second decade writing for the site. He is also the Pro Tour Historian and one of the commentators for the Pro Tour.


July 4, 2014
 









*Dear Hall of Fame selection committee voter,*


*Here is your official ballot for the 2014 Magic Pro Tour Hall of Fame election.*





That is the greeting to the ballots that were just sent out to the newly consolidated selection committee that is made up of commentators, tournament officials, key Wizards personnel, and all *Magic* players in good standing with more than 150 lifetime Pro Points. This year's ballot, which is the first to use the new threshold of 150 lifetime points to be eligible for induction, is considerably smaller than it was last season.


I am going to walk through the ballot year by year and give you a brief overview of the careers of these Hall of Fame–eligible players. I will start with players new to the ballot, meaning their Pro Tour careers began during the 2003–2004 season, and I will work backwards year by year to discuss players who remain on the ballot from previous seasons. If a player has appeared on fewer than 10% of the ballots for three years, the player removed from future ballots. Players can reactivate their eligibility by acquiring 4 Pro Points in the season leading up to a ballot.

**Scott Johns—164 Lifetime Pro Points**


American Scott Johns is the last remaining candidate from the inaugural ballot for the Pro Tour Hall of Fame. Johns is a Pro Tour Champion as a member of Potato Nation, alongside Mike Turian and Gary Wise, and has appeared in the Top 8 a total of five times—tied for the most on this ballot. He finished in the Top 64 more than half the time he played over 27 appearances, with seventeen. He had two Grand Prix Top 8 finishes without a win. After his playing days, Johns ran multiple *Magic* websites and eventually was the first editor-in-chief for DailyMTG.com.










June's *Magic* Player of the Month—#MTGPoM




While the members of the selection committee grapple with the nearly 40 people on this year's Hall of Fame ballot, I need your help to sort out who will win the title of June *Magic* Player of the Month. You can use the hashtag [#MTGPoM](https://twitter.com/hashtag/mtgpom) on Twitter and Facebook to discuss who you think should be the winner. You can pick from the candidates below or write one in who you feel has been overlooked. Feel free to direct your comments to me at [@Top8Games](https://twitter.com/Top8Games) or [@MagicProTour](https://twitter.com/MagicProTour). I will announce the winner in next week's column.

Grand Prix Manchester saw Fabizio Anteri make the fourth Grand Prix Top 8 over the last two seasons. It also saw the Venezuelan, living abroad in Europe, win his second Grand Prix in as many tries. The format for the event was Block Constructed and Anteri exploited the knowledge from Pro Tour *Journey into Nyx* to win with his BUG Control deck.

If it feels like Standard has gotten a little hotter over the back half of June, that is in no small part due to Igor Gorbunov setting the GP Moscow field afire with his Boros Burn deck.

Canadian Tyler Blum won the Rat Race of Grand Prix Chicago playing mirror matches centered around [Pack Rat](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pack+Rat) in the quarters, semis, and even the finals.

Mike Sigrist has been playing *Magic* along the East Coast of the US for a long time and there was a huge cheer when the PTQ grinder won the first GP trophy of his long career.

It would take nothing less than a win for France's Jérémy Dezani to pass Reid Duke in the race for Player of the Year. The Pro Tour *Theros* winner had already capped out on strong GP finishes, but he mustered a win at Grand Prix Milan—pushing past three players in the Top 4 who are all on the Hall of Fame ballot this year to do so.

Tom Ross fanned the flames of Standard with his winning Boss Sligh list from the StarCityGames Invitational. His lean, mean, red machine ran only 17 Mountains and did not dally around with white mana. [Rubblebelt Maaka](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rubblebelt+Maaka) and [Blinding Flare](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blinding+Flare) are just the kinds of unexpected cards we have come to expect from Ross.

Rookie of the Year frontrunner Jared Boettcher had a pretty sweet month of June, with a Top 8 finish at Grand Prix Chicago—putting a little more distance between himself and the rookie field—and also finished in the Top 4 of the SCG Invitational.
