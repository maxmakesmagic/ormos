One of the cool side programs at [Pro Tour Magic 2015](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/ptm15) this past weekend was to have artists [Eric Deschamps](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&artist=[%22Eric+Deschamps%22]) and [Cynthia Sheppard](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&artist=[%22Cynthia+Sheppard%22]) create an exclusive piece of art featuring M15-focal character Garruk Wildspeaker! Between rounds, players and spectators alike could spin a wheel to randomly determine a new visual element to include in the piece, from Fblthp to a rainbow.


Here is a look at the piece as it progressed from initial sketch to final piece:
