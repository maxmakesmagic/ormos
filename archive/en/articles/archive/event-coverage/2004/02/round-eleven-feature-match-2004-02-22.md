Now living in Europe, but from Argentina, he is one of the top players from South America on the Pro Tour circuit. Helio is much closer to home - a mere 600 km away - but with the same score in this tournament: 9-1. There is still along way to go, but so far they are in the fast lane to the Top Eight. A win here will make it a lot easier for one of them.

### Game 1

Felix took two trips to Paris because his first hand was very slow and his second one didn't have a land. His third land was... well, promising; so he kept it, and found another one to play turn two [Grimclaw Bats](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grimclaw+Bats). Barbero opened with [Goblin Replica](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Replica) that he promptly sacrificed to play Vulshok War-Boar.

Helio found an [Island](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island) and played [Wall of Blood](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wall+of+Blood). On the following turn he found a [Mountain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mountain) and it seemed he could start forgiving his deck. Slowly he inched forward, hiding behind his [Wall of Blood](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wall+of+Blood).

Jose tried to rule the skies with [Spire Golem](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spire+Golem) but the Portuguese came right back with [Cobalt Golem](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cobalt+Golem). Apparently he was back from a double mulligan but Barbero had other ideas. He played [Granite Shard](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Granite+Shard) and [Fractured Loyalty](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fractured+Loyalty) to make the [Wall of Blood](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wall+of+Blood) highly unstable.

The Shard stole the Wall and the War-Boar was finally free to enter the Red Zone safely. A gang block got rid of Barbero's [Spire Golem](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spire+Golem) but he wasn't about to be slowed down. He played [Bosh, Iron Golem](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bosh%2C+Iron+Golem).

At six Helio Felix smiled and scooped.

Helio 1 - Jose 0.

### Game 2

Felix came out with turn-two Talisman, turn three [Grimclaw Bats](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grimclaw+Bats) and [Alpha Myr](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Alpha+Myr) before Barbero even made his first play (turn three Krak-Clan Stoker). Jose then dropped his [Granite Shard](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Granite+Shard) and started icing Helio's creatures.

The Portuguese fought back with Chiterring Rats, trading it for [Vulshok Berserker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vulshok+Berserker) while the South American was stuck at four lands. The Portuguese found an [Island](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island) and swung with his Bats at full throttle (pumping them three times to drop his opponent to ten) before dropping [Neurok Spy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Neurok+Spy).

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gpmad04/r11fm1_2.jpg)Barbero played [Pulse of the Fields](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pulse+of+the+Fields) and Helio misread it, tapping his last mana to prevent it from returning unnecessarily. That meant Barbero could safely kill his Bats with [Granite Shard](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Granite+Shard).

[Electrostatic Bolt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Electrostatic+Bolt) ate up the Stoker but Jose found [Viridian Longbow](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Viridian+Longbow) to equip his [Leonin Elder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leonin+Elder). Now Felix's two toughness creatures were also within risk. The Portuguese hit a land pocket and fell pray to Jose Barbero's sniping tag team.

Final result: Jose 2 - Helio 0.
