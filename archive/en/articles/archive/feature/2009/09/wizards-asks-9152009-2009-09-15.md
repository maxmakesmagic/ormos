*What's your favorite artifact in **Magic**?*

![82](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/mtgcom/authorpics/authorpic_stevewarner.jpg)**Steve Warner:** [Helm of Obedience](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Helm+of+Obedience) was probably my favorite artifact card ever. I was always a big fan of using my opponents' decks against them (tai chi style), so I would use [Control Magic](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Control+Magic)s and [Steal Artifact](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Steal+Artifact)s along with Helm in order to take their stuff and kill them. 

![Helm of Obedience](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Helm+of+Obedience)  
The best part of the Helm was that it didn't matter if they were running creatures or not. If they didn't have any creatures, you just milled them forever. [Helm of Obedience](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Helm+of+Obedience) was also very fun with tricks to untap the Helm and set it off multiple times before the first use of its ability resolved, trying to get multiple creatures.
