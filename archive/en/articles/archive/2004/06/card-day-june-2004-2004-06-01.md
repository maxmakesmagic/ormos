**Card of the Day - mercredi 30 juin 2004**


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Urza's%20Bauble)#### Urza's Bauble


 *Ice Age* uncommon. The *Ice Age* cantrips originally granted the card immediately. This broke Urza’s Bauble since all decks would have 4, so all cantrip card draws were given a delay in that set. 


**Card of the Day - mardi 29 juin 2004**


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Mana%20Crypt)#### Mana Crypt

 Promotional card. Mana Crypt is the only card to ever be restricted or banned that didn’t appear in any expansion or core set. 


**Card of the Day - lundi 28 juin 2004**


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Iron%20Star)#### Iron Star


 *Alpha* uncommon. Despite their poor reputation, Iron Star and Wooden Sphere were both in constructed decks that made top 8 at Worlds 1995. 


**Card of the Day - vendredi 25 juin 2004**


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Decree%20of%20Justice)#### Decree of Justice


 *Scourge* rare. One of the few cards that can produce angel tokens (like Angelic Favor), Decree of Justice is also remarkable for its ability to produce two different types of creature tokens. 


**Card of the Day - jeudi 24 juin 2004**


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Silver%20Seraph)#### Silver Seraph


 *Judgment* rare. At 6/6, Silver Seraph is tied with Akroma, Angel of Wrath as largest angel in **Magic**. (Though if you had both in play with threshold, the Akroma would win the tie!)


**Card of the Day - mercredi 23 juin 2004**


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Guiding%20Spirit)#### Guiding Spirit


 *Visions* rare.  
Guiding Spirit has the distinction of being the smallest angel. (Angelic Curator and Angelic Page are spirits.)


**Card of the Day - mardi 22 juin 2004**


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Lightning%20Angel)#### Lightning Angel


 *Apocalypse* rare.  
 The only red angel in **Magic**, Lightning Angel is also the only tri-colored angel. 


**Card of the Day - lundi 21 juin 2004**


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Serra%20Angel)#### Serra Angel


 *Eighth Edition* rare.  
 Only one other angel has appeared in as many sets. (Fallen Angel, as long as you count the *Beatdown* box set.)


**Card of the Day - vendredi 18 juin 2004**


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Engineered%20Explosives)#### Engineered Explosives


 *Fifth Dawn* rare.  
 The designers strongly wanted to have a sunburst “X” spell. This one, inspired by Powder Keg, was the best of the bunch.


**Card of the Day - jeudi 17 juin 2004**


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Skyreach%20Manta)#### Skyreach Manta


 *Fifth Dawn* common.  
 Called Blazon' Pterodactyl in design, the name refers to Emblazoned Golem, which inspired the sunburst mechanic. 


**Card of the Day - mercredi 16 juin 2004**


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Lunar%20Avenger)#### Lunar Avenger


 **Fifth Dawn** uncommon.   
 As the name hints, this card was inspired by Urza's Avenger from *Antiquities*. 


**Card of the Day - mardi 15 juin 2004**


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Baton%20of%20Courage)#### Baton of Courage


 *Fifth Dawn* common.  
 The second “baton” printed in **Magic**, this is the only sunburst card that can be played at instant speed. 


**Card of the Day - lundi 14 juin 2004**


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Arcbound%20Wanderer)#### Arcbound Wanderer


 *Fifth Dawn* uncommon.  
 Modular was otherwise *Darksteel*-only, but the team included one card in *Fifth Dawn* since it interacts so well with sunburst.


**Card of the Day - vendredi 11 juin 2004**


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Myr%20Moonvessel)#### Myr Moonvessel


 *Darksteel* common.   
 Named “Uno-Eins” in playtesting, it means “one” in two languages. The name is similar to Su-Chi (“four” in two languages). 


**Card of the Day - jeudi 10 juin 2004**


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Myr%20Quadropod)#### Myr Quadropod


 *Fifth Dawn* common.  
 Though originally part of a cycle, only this card made it into the set. The original ability required blue mana. 


**Card of the Day - mercredi 9 juin 2004**


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Myr%20Matrix)#### Myr Matrix


 *Darksteel* rare.  
 Called Gnome Maker in design (one guess why), the original version gave all Gnomes +1/+1 and made them indestructible. 


**Card of the Day - mardi 8 juin 2004**


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Myr%20Servitor)#### Myr Servitor


 *Fifth Dawn* common.  
 Called Robo-Roach during playtesting, Myr Servitor was loosely inspired by Brood of Cockroaches. 


**Card of the Day - lundi 7 juin 2004**


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Coretapper)#### Coretapper


 *Darksteel* uncommon.   
 Of all the Myr cards printed in *Mirrodin* Block, only Coretapper doesn't have the word "Myr" in its name. 


**Card of the Day - vendredi 4 juin 2004**


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Yawgmoth's%20Will)#### Yawgmoth's Will


 *Urza's Saga* rare.   
 Many contend that this is the single most powerful Magic card ever printed. 


**Card of the Day - jeudi 3 juin 2004**


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Yawgmoth's%20Bargain)#### Yawgmoth's Bargain


 *Urza's Destiny* rare.   
 Intended as a fixed Necropotence, the original version turned in by the design team cost ![Black Mana](https://magic.wizards.com/images/Symbols/black_mana.gif)![Black Mana](https://magic.wizards.com/images/Symbols/black_mana.gif)![Black Mana](https://magic.wizards.com/images/Symbols/black_mana.gif) but required 2 life per card. 


**Card of the Day - mercredi 2 juin 2004**


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Eye%20of%20Yawgmoth)#### Eye of Yawgmoth


 *Nemesis* rare.   
 The effect from Eye of Yawgmoth was inspired by the *Tempest*  card Altar of Dementia. 


**Card of the Day - mardi 1 juin 2004**


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Yawgmoth's%20Agenda)#### Yawgmoth's Agenda


 *Invasion* rare.   
 The first translation of this card's title to Japanese actually meant something along the lines of "Yawgmoth's Dayplanner."
