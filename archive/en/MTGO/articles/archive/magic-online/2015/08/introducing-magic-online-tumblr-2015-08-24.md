It's tough to answer every question that we get about *Magic Online*. There's a lot of scheduling required before we publish an article, so it makes it hard to respond to hot topics as they come up. Twitter is a great place for an open dialogue with players, but we're stuck with only 140 characters to answer with—not great for complex questions.


We wanted to make a place where you could ask questions and see what's on the minds of other players too so, a few weeks ago, we launched the [Official *Magic Online* Tumblr](http://wizardsmtgo.tumblr.com/)!


The *Magic Online* Tumblr is maintained by two folks on the *Magic Online* team—Robert Schuster answers questions from the perspective of MTGO R&D while Lee Sharpe gives insight into how we run events. They were kind enough to [introduce themselves]( http://wizardsmtgo.tumblr.com/post/125380573609/the-magic-online-tumblr-begins) via a Tumblr post too:

The Tumblr has been running for a few weeks now and they've already covered a wide variety of topics.


Lee has given some [helpful tips](http://wizardsmtgo.tumblr.com/post/125808658764/ive-had-a-mtgo-account-for-a-while-but-rarely) about *Magic Online* hotkeys:

Robert has given [shout outs]( http://wizardsmtgo.tumblr.com/post/125463308834/today-is-a-good-day-for-a-mtgo-stream) to some great *Magic Online* streamers (check out [LoadingReadyRun](http://www.twitch.tv/loadingreadyrun) if you haven't already).

It's not all helpful advice and development stories—some [truly bizarre things]( http://wizardsmtgo.tumblr.com/post/126487519264/what-has-been-the-most-entertaining-mtgo-bug-to) have been born from the Tumblr, baby Giddeons for example:

Big thanks to [chandra-nalaar](http://chandra-nalaar.tumblr.com/post/126445675096) for the illustration. She really captured the fatherly love in Gideon's eyes.


If you have a question that you've been itching to get the answer to and want it broadcast to the masses, [head over to the Tumblr](http://wizardsmtgo.tumblr.com/) and [ask us anything](http://wizardsmtgo.tumblr.com/ask) that's on your mind!
