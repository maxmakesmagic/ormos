A simple image can tell a devastating story.

**[Echoing Truth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Echoing+Truth)**, the blue instant in the cycle of Echoing cards, returns a permanent, and all the other permanents in play with the same name, to their owners' hands. What is the most powerful use of [Echoing Truth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Echoing+Truth) you could imagine?

What about returning two enormous Affinity creatures after all the artifacts in play have been removed? Like, say, using it on a pair of **[Furnace Dragon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Furnace+Dragon)**s?

If you compare the two images below, you can see that the creatures on Greg Staples' illustration of [Echoing Truth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Echoing+Truth) are, in fact, [Furnace Dragon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Furnace+Dragon)s ([Furnace Dragon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Furnace+Dragon) illustrated by Matthew D. Wilson).
