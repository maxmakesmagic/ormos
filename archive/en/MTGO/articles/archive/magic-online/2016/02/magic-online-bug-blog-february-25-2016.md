Known Issues List Updates
=========================


In this week's bug blog, we've added several new known issues as well as a list of fixes that went out with the February 17 *Magic Online* deployment.


The Known Issues List below has been updated, so refer to that for the most up-to-date statuses on *Magic Online* known issues. If you want to see the history of fixed known issues, refer to the [archive](http://magic.wizards.com/en/content/magic-online-fixed-known-issues-archive).




Oath of the Gatewatch Known Issues
----------------------------------





**Gameplay**


* Cardset | When a player casts [Kozilek, the Great Distortion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kozilek%2C+the+Great+Distortion), its triggered ability incorrectly triggers if the casting player has seven or more cards in hand. Upon resolution, the player will not draw cards if he or she already has seven or more cards in hand.
* Cardset | If a creature enchanted by [Visions of Brutality](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Visions+of+Brutality) fights another creature (say, due to some [Unnatural Aggression](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Unnatural+Aggression)), and is dealt lethal damage this way, the enchanted creature incorrectly does not deal damage to its controller.
* Cardset | If a player controls multiple [Endbringer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Endbringer)s, only one will untap during other players’ untap steps as intended.
* Cardset | In certain circumstances, [Chandra, Flamecaller](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chandra%2C+Flamecaller) incorrectly exiles creature tokens created by [Kalitas, Traitor of Ghet](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kalitas%2C+Traitor+of+Ghet).
* Cardset | Cards that ask players to choose a basic land type incorrectly include the option to choose [Wastes](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wastes). If a player attempts to choose [Wastes](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wastes), he or she will be asked to choose a basic land type again. [Wastes](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wastes) are basic lands, but are not a basic land type.
* Cardset | [Crumble to Dust](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crumble+to+Dust) incorrectly causes the player to search the library of the land’s controller, not owner.
* Cardset | If [Kozilek's Pathfinder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kozilek%27s+Pathfinder) loses its abilities (perhaps it was given a [Gift of Tusks](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gift+of+Tusks)), creatures previously affected by its activated ability will incorrectly be able to block it.
* Cardset | [Reality Smasher](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reality+Smasher)'s triggered ability incorrectly triggers once for each time a spell targets it. For example, if a player's opponent casts [Agony Warp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Agony+Warp), choosing [Reality Smasher](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reality+Smasher) for both targets, the triggered ability will trigger twice instead of once.
* Cardset | Several prompt boxes are incorrect or uninformative. Affected cards include [Kalitas, Traitor of Ghet](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kalitas%2C+Traitor+of+Ghet), [Harvester Troll](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Harvester+Troll), and [Devour in Flames](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Devour+in+Flames).
* Cardset | The mana abilities of [Wall of Roots](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wall+of+Roots) and [Kozilek's Translator](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kozilek%27s+Translator) cannot be activated while paying the mana cost of a spell or ability. Players can still activate these abilities at any time that player has priority.



---






Kamigawa Flashback Draft Known Issues
-------------------------------------





* Cardset | [Hankyu](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hankyu)'s second ability does not cause the equipped creature to deal damage as intended.



---






Newly Added Known Issues
------------------------





**Gameplay**


* Cardset | Abilities that reduce mana costs are not correctly being applied to additional costs (such as buyback or multikicker).
* Cardset | If [Kozilek's Pathfinder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kozilek%27s+Pathfinder) loses its abilities (perhaps it was given a [Gift of Tusks](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gift+of+Tusks)), creatures previously affected by its activated ability will incorrectly be able to block it.
* Cardset | If a double-faced planeswalker from *Magic Origins* is selected as a player’s commander, when the creature attempts to exile itself and return to the battlefield transformed into a planeswalker, it will instead arrive in the command zone and stay there.
* Cardset | [Goldmeadow Harrier](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goldmeadow+Harrier) incorrectly prevents players from submitting or playing with a Pauper deck.
* Cardset | [Hallowed Moonlight](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hallowed+Moonlight) (and [Containment Priest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Containment+Priest)) incorrectly exile the double-faced *Magic Origins* planeswalkers instead of allowing them to return to the battlefield as a planeswalker when they attempt to return to the battlefield transformed.
* Cardset | If a creature enchanted by [Visions of Brutality](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Visions+of+Brutality) fights another creature (say, due to some [Unnatural Aggression](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Unnatural+Aggression)), and is dealt lethal damage this way, the enchanted creature incorrectly does not deal damage to its controller.
* Cardset | If a player attempts to sacrifice a pile of Eldrazi babies (Scions or Spawn) at once, only one of those tokens will be sacrificed.
* Cardset | [Narset, Enlightened Master](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Narset%2C+Enlightened+Master)'s triggered ability does not allow players to cast split spells (such as [Fire & Ice](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fire+%2F%2F+Ice)).
* Cardset | [Phyrexian Devourer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phyrexian+Devourer) doesn't actually gain +1/+1 counters from its activated ability, no matter how many cards it devours.
* Cardset | [Reality Smasher](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reality+Smasher)'s triggered ability incorrectly triggers once for each time a spell targets it. For example, if a player's opponent casts [Agony Warp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Agony+Warp), choosing [Reality Smasher](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reality+Smasher) for both targets, the triggered ability will trigger twice instead of once.
* Cardset | The mana abilities of [Wall of Roots](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wall+of+Roots) and [Kozilek's Translator](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kozilek%27s+Translator) cannot be activated while paying the mana cost of a spell or ability. Players can still activate these abilities at any time that player has priority.

**Client**


* Draft | If a player logs back in after being disconnected during a draft, the timer will incorrectly display as 00:00 for the next pick, regardless of how much time that player actually has to make a selection.
* General | Windows 10 may display an error message that *Magic Online* is an unrecognized application while downloading the client. In order to successfully download the client, click the “More Info” link, then “Run Anyway.”
* Trade | Clicking on the empty space in the Will Receive area does not deselect cards in that area.



---






Fixes Deployed February 17
--------------------------





**Game Play**


* Cardset | Players resolving [Infernal Tutor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Infernal+Tutor) may now properly deliberately fail to find a card when they have one or more cards in their hand.
* Duel Scene | Mana will once again be automatically consumed from a player’s pool in most circumstances. Mana will not be consumed if any of the mana has a rider associated with it, if the spell has a variable or alternate means of paying its cost (such as delve or convoke), or if the spell cannot be cast for exactly the mana in the player’s pool.
* Duel Scene | The functionality of the “No Possible Play: Yield All” option, associated with the keyboard shortcut F8 by default, has been restored.
* Duel Scene | Mana abilities of permanents that do not include a tap symbol no longer appear to cause the permanent to tap. Notably, this includes [Kozilek's Translator](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kozilek%27s+Translator).
* Duel Scene | Keyboard shortcuts, such as “OK” (default: F2) or “Yield Until End of Turn” (default: F6), no longer sometimes cause blocking assignments to be reset.
* Duel Scene | Using the "undo" keyboard shortcut (default: Ctrl+Z) during the declaration of blockers once again works as expected.
* Duel Scene | While a player is required to choose multiple permanents, using the "undo" keyboard shortcut (default: Ctrl+Z) no longer reduces the number of permanents that player has to choose.
* Cardset | Spells that return multiple permanents from different zones to players' hands (such as [Rise & Fall](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rise+%2F%2F+Fall) or [Æther Tradewinds](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=%C3%86ther+Tradewinds)) now work as expected.
* Duel Scene | Creatures that produce mana upon their death, such as [Cathodion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cathodion) or [Su-Chi](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Su-Chi), will now provide players an opportunity to use that mana even if the player hasn’t set a stop for the step or phase in which the creature dies.
* Cardset | If [Winds of Qal Sisma](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Winds+of+Qal+Sisma) resolves while its controller also controls a creature with power 4 or greater, the Winds will now correctly protect planeswalkers from combat damage.
* Cardset | [Shrine of Boundless Growth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shrine+of+Boundless+Growth)'s activated ability now generates mana as expected.
* Commander | If a player generates mana outside of his or her commander’s color identity, that mana is no longer turned into colorless mana. This update brings the Commander format on *Magic Online* in line with the January 2016 rules change. Rejoice, sunburst and converge cards!
* Cardset | [Viscerid Drone](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Viscerid+Drone) once again requires the sacrifice of a Swamp to activate either of its abilities.
* Cardset | Prompt box text associated with several cards has been corrected, including [Loam Larva](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Loam+Larva), [Archangel of Strife](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Archangel+of+Strife), and [Devour in Flames](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Devour+in+Flames).
* Cardset | Spells that require a specific color of mana to be spent on X, such as [Drain Life](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Drain+Life), once again enforce that requirement.
* Cardset | Players can again choose to exile two cards from any single graveyard, not just their own, to activate the ability of [Night Soil](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Night+Soil).
* Cardset | [Chorus of the Conclave](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chorus+of+the+Conclave) static ability that allows a player to pay additional mana when casting a creature has been returned to expected functionality.
* Cardset | If [Auratouched Mage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Auratouched+Mage) leaves the battlefield before its triggered ability resolves, the Aura will now be properly put into the player’s hand.
* Cardset | Players are once again required to pay all additional costs for [Primitive Justice](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Primitive+Justice).
* Cardset | Tokens created by [Forbidden Orchard](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forbidden+Orchard) no longer incorrectly appear to have flying.
* Cardset | Spells and abilities that allow a player to change the target(s) of a spell or ability, such as [Spellskite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spellskite)'s activated ability, can no longer be used to add a target to some spells and abilities. Notably, this includes *Oath of the Gatewatch*'s support mechanic.
* Cardset | If a creature enchanted by [Spectra Ward](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spectra+Ward) loses all abilities, that creature will now correctly lose the protection granted by [Spectra Ward](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spectra+Ward). A remaining display bug may cause the blue text indicating the protection ability to remain on the creature, but the card will function correctly.
* Cardset | [Oath of Chandra](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oath+of+Chandra)'s second triggered ability now correctly sees planeswalkers that entered the battlefield earlier in the turn even if that object is no longer a planeswalker when the ability would trigger. [Sarkhan, the Dragonspeaker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sarkhan%2C+the+Dragonspeaker) is relieved.
* Cardset | [Wicker Warcrawler](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wicker+Warcrawler) now receives the expected -1/-1 counter when it attacks or blocks.
* Cardset | A commander destroyed by [Necromantic Selection](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Necromantic+Selection) and returned to the command zone with the commander replacement effect can no longer be returned to the battlefield with [Necromantic Selection](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Necromantic+Selection)'s ability.
* Cardset | [Echoing Decay](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Echoing+Decay) affects only the one target creature when cast on a face-down creature. Face-down creatures have no name, and thus cannot share a name with anything.
* Cardset | [Tempting Wurm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tempting+Wurm) no longer tempts *Magic Online* into allowing the opponent to put cards onto the battlefield from another player’s library or hand.
* Cardset | [Heroes' Podium](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Heroes%27+Podium) no longer provides a power and toughness boost to legendary creature cards in zones other than the battlefield.
* Cardset | A creature sacrificed with [Bloodfire Infusion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodfire+Infusion)'s activated ability now correctly deals damage to each other creature.
* Cardset | Neither [Atarka, World Render](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Atarka%2C+World+Render) nor [Silumgar, the Drifting Death](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Silumgar%2C+the+Drifting+Death) will now trigger their own abilities if, when they attack, they are no longer Dragons.
* Cardset | [Aven Mindcensor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aven+Mindcensor)'s third ability now interacts appropriately with all search effects.
* Cardset | Players can no longer start the game with [Gemstone Caverns](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gemstone+Caverns) on the battlefield if they’re playing first and have a Leyline or other start of game action in addition to the Caverns.
* Cardset | [Phantasmal Image](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phantasmal+Image) now properly displays its gained triggered ability in blue text (“When this creature becomes the target…”) when copying a creature, making it more clear that it will be sacrificed if targeted.
* Cardset | A visual indicator is now present when [Spellskite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spellskite) redirects a spell or ability that targeted multiple permanents with the same name. When prompted to change targets, players should be alert for a green glow around the current target.
* Cardset | Each [Endbringer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Endbringer) now properly untaps during other players’ untap steps. Except Shauku.
* Cardset | If a permanent would be destroyed, but has multiple Auras with totem armor on it, an Aura chosen by the creature’s controller will now be correctly destroyed instead.
* Cardset | Players are no longer incorrectly allowed to choose [Wastes](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wastes) when prompted to choose a basic land type. “Wastes” is not a land type; it is a basic land card without a basic land type.
* Cardset | Players can no longer choose a value of X higher than 0 when casting a spell with [Goblin Dark-Dwellers](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Dark-Dwellers)'s triggered ability.
* Cardset | Players can no longer tap noncreature permanents to pay the cost of [Sky Hussar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sky+Hussar)'s forecast ability.





Temporary Workarounds for Known Issues
--------------------------------------





We're hard at work whittling down the Known Issues List. In the meantime, we've found temporary solutions that may help alleviate certain problems that players are experiencing. Refer to the table below to see if there is a suggested temporary workaround for an issue that you are experiencing.


**Game Play**




|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Issue Description | Temporary Workaround |
| Duel Scene | Cards that search for multiple cards at once don’t show the cards properly in the Revealed Cards area. | The cards are properly identified in the game log.
   |
| Duel Scene | It is visually difficult to tell which set of blockers an attacking player is ordering when ordering multiple sets of multiple blocking creatures. | You must start by ordering blockers for the left most attacking creature, then hit OK to move on to the next attacking creature to the right.
   |
| Duel Scene | Both players show as waiting for opponent, one player times out. | If a player suspects this is happening, logging out and back in may resolve the problem. |

| Cardset | Harbinger of the Tides’s casting options are displayed incorrectly. Players can still pay Harbinger of the Tides’s alternative casting cost by selecting the lower “Cast” option from the menu that appears when the card is clicked. |
| Cardset | [Hunting Wilds](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hunting+Wilds), when kicked, incorrectly does not untap the Forest cards put onto the battlefield during its resolution.

| Cardset | If a permanent enters the battlefield as a copy of a permanent that had a choice made as it entered (such as [Door of Destinies](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Door+of+Destinies) or [Painter's Servant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Painter%27s+Servant)), the copy correctly allows the controller to make a new choice, but the abilities of the copy that refer to that choice do not function correctly. |
| Cardset | If a player casts [Winds of Qal Sisma](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Winds+of+Qal+Sisma) while controlling a creature with power 4 or greater, the damage prevention effect will fail to prevent combat damage dealt to planeswalkers. |
| Cardset | If a player controls multiple [Endbringer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Endbringer)s, only one will untap during other players’ untap steps as intended. |
| Cardset | If a player controls multiple [Endbringer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Endbringer)s, only one will untap during other players’ untap steps as intended. |
| Cardset | If a player attempts to sacrifice a pile of Eldrazi babies (Scions or Spawn) at once, only one of those tokens will be sacrificed. |
| Cardset | If a player selects a permanent to sacrifice to an Annihilator trigger, but then deselects that permanent, the player will sometimes incorrectly be required to sacrifice an additional permanent. |
| Cardset | If [Kozilek's Pathfinder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kozilek%27s+Pathfinder) loses its abilities (perhaps it was given a [Gift of Tusks](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gift+of+Tusks)), creatures previously affected by its activated ability will incorrectly be able to block it. |
| Cardset | If a double-faced planeswalker from *Magic Origins* is selected as a player’s commander, when the creature attempts to exile itself and return to the battlefield transformed into a planeswalker, it will instead arrive in the command zone and stay there. |
| Cardset | In a Commander game, mana abilities that produce mana based on their controller’s commander’s color identity, such as that found on [Commander's Sphere](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Commander%27s+Sphere) or Command Tower, incorrectly produce no mana when tapped. |
| Cardset | In certain circumstances, [Chandra, Flamecaller](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chandra%2C+Flamecaller) incorrectly exiles creature tokens created by [Kalitas, Traitor of Ghet](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kalitas%2C+Traitor+of+Ghet). |
| Cardset | In certain circumstances, [Chandra, Flamecaller](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chandra%2C+Flamecaller) incorrectly exiles creature tokens created by [Kalitas, Traitor of Ghet](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kalitas%2C+Traitor+of+Ghet). |
| Cardset | [Infernal Tutor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Infernal+Tutor) doesn't allow the player to fail to find a card when they are not hellbent. |
| Cardset | [Lightning Storm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Storm)'s activated ability will sometimes let the wrong player change the target. To mitigate this issue, we suggest letting the [Lightning Storm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Storm) activated ability resolve before activating it another time. |
| Cardset | [Mass Polymorph](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mass+Polymorph) incorrectly does not count exiled creature tokens when determining how many creature cards to put onto the battlefield. |
| Cardset | Myriad Landscape’s activated ability incorrectly allows a player to put two basic lands that do not share a land type onto the battlefield. |
| Cardset | [Narset, Enlightened Master](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Narset%2C+Enlightened+Master)'s triggered ability does not allow players to cast split spells (such as [Fire & Ice](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fire+%2F%2F+Ice)). |
| Cardset | [Oracle of Mul Daya](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oracle+of+Mul+Daya) reveals one too many cards from the top of the library after casting [Genesis Wave](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Genesis+Wave) or similar spells. |
| Cardset | [Phyrexian Devourer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phyrexian+Devourer) doesn't actually gain +1/+1 counters from its activated ability, no matter how many cards it devours. |
| Cardset | Players are unable to drag-and-drop cards to split them into piles when prompted to do so by a card like [Fact or Fiction](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fact+or+Fiction). Cards can no longer be dragged from one pile to another in these scenarios, but players can move cards to another pile by single-clicking on the card. |
| Cardset | [Reality Smasher](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reality+Smasher)'s triggered ability incorrectly triggers if it is targeted more than once by a spell with multiple targets (such as [Agony Warp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Agony+Warp)). |
| Cardset | Several prompt boxes are incorrect or uninformative. Affected cards include [Kalitas, Traitor of Ghet](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kalitas%2C+Traitor+of+Ghet), [Harvester Troll](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Harvester+Troll), and [Devour in Flames](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Devour+in+Flames). |
| Cardset | Several prompt boxes are incorrect or uninformative. Affected cards include [Kalitas, Traitor of Ghet](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kalitas%2C+Traitor+of+Ghet), [Harvester Troll](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Harvester+Troll), and [Devour in Flames](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Devour+in+Flames). |
| Cardset | Some spells that return multiple permanents from different zones to players' hands (such as [Rise & Fall](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rise+%2F%2F+Fall) or [Æther Tradewinds](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=%C3%86ther+Tradewinds)) only return one permanent. Notably, this does not affect any cards in *Battle for Zendikar* or *Oath of the Gatewatch*. |
| Cardset | Spells that require a specific color of mana to be spent (such as [Drain Life](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Drain+Life)) incorrectly allow any color of mana to be spent. |
| Cardset | Spells that target [Thunderbreak Regent](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thunderbreak+Regent) more than once incorrectly trigger [Thunderbreak Regent](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thunderbreak+Regent)'s ability twice. |
| Cardset | Stone Haven Outfitter’s triggered ability incorrectly triggers when a creature is destroyed if an Equipment had previously been destroyed while equipping that creature. |
| Cardset | The additional cost ability of [Chorus of the Conclave](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chorus+of+the+Conclave) does not function. |
| Cardset | [The Chain Veil](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=The+Chain+Veil) does not allow Planeswalkers that enter the battlefield after activating [The Chain Veil](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=The+Chain+Veil) to use their abilities twice. |
| Cardset | The game log does not display the third choice of a [Confluence](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Confluence). |
| Cardset | The mana abilities of [Wall of Roots](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wall+of+Roots) and [Kozilek's Translator](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kozilek%27s+Translator) cannot be activated while paying the mana cost of a spell or ability. Players can still activate these abilities at any time that player has priority. |
| Cardset | The prompt text for the second mode of [Grab the Reins](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grab+the+Reins) incorrectly omits the option to target a player. This incorrect prompt box also appears when the spell is entwined as the second targeting step. This is a text display issue only, and players that are legal targets do appear with the typical white glow indicating they can be targeted. |
| Cardset | Tokens created by [Forbidden Orchard](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forbidden+Orchard) incorrectly appear to have flying. This is a display issue only. The tokens don’t actually fly. |
| Cardset | Triggered abilities of Equipment with a trigger condition of “whenever equipped creature dies” can incorrectly trigger when a noncreature card is destroyed. This occurs when the noncreature card was a creature with that Equipment attached during the previous turn. For example, if a player uses Sarkhan, the Dragonspeaker’s first loyalty ability, then equips him with a [Skullclamp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skullclamp), the [Skullclamp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skullclamp) will remain equipped for that turn. If [Sarkhan is destroyed during the following turn, Skullclamp’s ability will inappropriately trigger.](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=386650) |
| Cardset | Under rare circumstances, a player who controls two creatures that can’t attack alone (such as [Bonded Construct](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bonded+Construct)) but must attack with one of them will be able to attack with only that creature rather than being required to attack with both. Under even more rare circumstances, that creature will instead turn on its controller and attack that player on the next turn. We recommend that players keep their [Bonded Construct](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bonded+Construct)s on tight leashes. |
| Cardset | [Villainous Wealth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Villainous+Wealth)'s prompt box text incorrectly suggests that the caster must cast all appropriate exiled spells. This is a display issue only. The [Cancel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cancel) button allows the player to continue without casting remaining spells. |
| Cardset | [Void Winnower](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Void+Winnower) incorrectly prohibits players from casting spells that have both an even converted mana cost and a variable in the mana cost. For example, a player whose opponent controls a [Void Winnower](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Void+Winnower) is incorrectly prohibited from casting [Rolling Thunder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rolling+Thunder) or [Nourishing Shoal](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nourishing+Shoal), even if the value chosen for X would result in a spell with an odd converted mana cost. Even if a player cannot even, they should be able to odd. |
| Cardset | When a player casts [Kozilek, the Great Distortion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kozilek%2C+the+Great+Distortion), its triggered ability incorrectly triggers if the casting player has seven or more cards in hand. Upon resolution, the player will not draw cards if he or she already has seven or more cards in hand. |
| Cardset | When a player casts [Kozilek, the Great Distortion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kozilek%2C+the+Great+Distortion), its triggered ability incorrectly triggers if the casting player has seven or more cards in hand. Upon resolution, the player will not draw cards if he or she already has seven or more cards in hand. |
| Cardset | When a user destroys [Auratouched Mage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Auratouched+Mage) before its triggered ability finishes resolving, a facedown card will be added to the owner's hand. |
| Cardset | When [Entreat the Angels](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Entreat+the+Angels) is on the stack with 0 chosen for X, the blue text that typically indicates the value of X does not appear. |
| Duel Scene | Cards that search for multiple cards at once don’t show the cards properly in the Revealed Cards area. These cards are properly identified in the game log. |
| Duel Scene | Creatures that enter the battlefield with counters based on the number of creatures in the graveyard (for example, [Undergrowth Scavenger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Undergrowth+Scavenger)) do not count themselves if they are put onto the battlefield directly from the graveyard. |
| Duel Scene | Emblems display with an extra border. |
| Duel Scene | If a player’s spell or ability causes his or her own cards to be revealed, those cards are incorrectly not added to the player’s own Revealed Cards area. The player’s opponent should still see the revealed cards correctly. |
| Duel Scene | Intermittently and in certain scenarios, keyboard shortcuts (such as F2 or F6) can cause blocking assignments to be reset. This can cause players to unintentionally not block any attacking creatures. Players are encouraged to verify their blocking decisions when using these keyboard shortcuts. |
| Duel Scene | It is visually difficult to tell which set of blockers an attacking player is ordering when ordering multiple sets of multiple blocking creatures. |
| Duel Scene | Mana abilities of permanents that do not include a tap symbol still appear to cause the permanent to tap. This is a display issue only, and is corrected when the game advances to the next step or phase. |
| Duel Scene | Players who activate Liliana of the Veil’s first loyalty ability when their opponent has only one card in hand are unable to take any actions except passing priority after that ability resolves. This effect ends when the player has passed priority once. |
| Duel Scene | Spells with multiple targets (such as [Silumgar's Command](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Silumgar%27s+Command), [Agony Warp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Agony+Warp), etc.) sometimes lack visual indicators to show what is happening to each target.  |
| Duel Scene | The “No Possible Play: Yield All” function, commonly mapped to the F8 keyboard shortcut, no longer works as intended. |
| Duel Scene | The prompt text where the card states "Choose up to X target... X is currently [#]." States 'zero' when the last valid target is clicked.  |
| Duel Scene | Under certain rare scenarios, attacking creatures will display on the opponent’s side of the battlefield. Resizing the *Magic Online* game window resolves this display issue. |
| Duel Scene | When a player plays a Ravnica shock land (such as [Hallowed Fountain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hallowed+Fountain)) off the top of the library with [Courser of Kruphix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Courser+of+Kruphix), the new top card of the library is incorrectly revealed before the player decides whether to pay 2 life. |
| Duel Scene | When affects like [Parallax Wave](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Parallax+Wave) and [Exhume](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Exhume) end and creatures return to the battlefield, if one of those creatures was a [Containment Priest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Containment+Priest) then all other creatures are Exiled.  |
| Duel Scene | When casting with Convoke, creatures used for the ability have a green highlight for some turns after casting the spell. |
| Duel Scene | When colorless mana is added to a player's mana pool as a result of a creature dying in combat (e.g. [Cathodion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cathodion), Su-chi), the user is unable to spend that mana if no stop is set. |
| Duel Scene | While paying the mana cost for a card with delve, players cannot remove cards from the delve selection without canceling the casting process and starting over. |
| Duel Scene | Zooming in on a card exiled by a land with hideaway shows an additional basic Swamp. This is a visual-only bug, players cannot play the Swamp using hideaway. Right-clicking on the exiled land will display it correctly. |
| General | When the "No Possible Play: Yield All" function is active, tapping [Mishra's Workshop](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mishra%27s+Workshop) when it's the only land the player controls will automatically end the turn even if the mana could be spent.  |

| Fixed Gameplay Known Issues |
| Cardset | Players resolving [Infernal Tutor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Infernal+Tutor) may now properly deliberately fail to find a card when they have one or more cards in their hand. —fixed 2/17 |
| Duel Scene | Mana will once again be automatically consumed from a player’s pool in most circumstances. Mana will not be consumed if any of the mana has a rider associated with it, if the spell has a variable or alternate means of paying its cost (such as delve or convoke), or if the spell cannot be cast for exactly the mana in the player’s pool.—fixed 2/17 |

| Cardset | Spells that return multiple permanents from different zones to players' hands (such as Rise & Fall or [Æther Tradewinds](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=%C3%86ther+Tradewinds)) now work as expected.—fixed 2/17 |
| Duel Scene | Creatures that produce mana upon their death, such as [Cathodion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cathodion) or [Su-Chi](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Su-Chi), will now provide players an opportunity to use that mana even if the player hasn’t set a stop for the step or phase in which the creature dies.—fixed 2/17 |
| Cardset | If [Winds of Qal Sisma](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Winds+of+Qal+Sisma) resolves while its controller also controls a creature with power 4 or greater, the Winds will now correctly protect planeswalkers from combat damage.—fixed 2/17 |
| Cardset | [Shrine of Boundless Growth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shrine+of+Boundless+Growth)'s activated ability now generates mana as expected.—fixed 2/17 |
| Commander | If a player generates mana outside of his or her commander’s color identity, that mana is no longer turned into colorless mana. This update brings the Commander format on *Magic Online* in line with the January 2016 rules change. Rejoice, sunburst and converge cards!—fixed 2/17 |
| Cardset | [Viscerid Drone](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Viscerid+Drone) once again requires the sacrifice of a Swamp to activate either of its abilities.—fixed 2/17 |
| Cardset | Prompt box text associated with several cards has been corrected, including [Loam Larva](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Loam+Larva), [Archangel of Strife](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Archangel+of+Strife), and [Devour in Flames](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Devour+in+Flames).—fixed 2/17 |
| Cardset | Spells that require a specific color of mana to be spent on X, such as [Drain Life](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Drain+Life), once again enforce that requirement.—fixed 2/17 |
| Cardset | Players can again choose to exile two cards from any single graveyard, not just their own, to activate the ability of [Night Soil](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Night+Soil).—fixed 2/17 |
| Cardset | [Chorus of the Conclave](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chorus+of+the+Conclave) static ability that allows a player to pay additional mana when casting a creature has been returned to expected functionality.—fixed 2/17 |
| Cardset | If [Auratouched Mage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Auratouched+Mage) leaves the battlefield before its triggered ability resolves, the Aura will now be properly put into the player’s hand.—fixed 2/17 |

Notably, this includes *Oath of the Gatewatch*'s support mechanic.—fixed 2/17 |
| Cardset | If a creature enchanted by [Spectra Ward](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spectra+Ward) loses all abilities, that creature will now correctly lose the protection granted by [Spectra Ward](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spectra+Ward). A remaining display bug may cause the blue text indicating the protection ability to remain on the creature, but the card will function correctly.—fixed 2/17 |
| Cardset | [Oath of Chandra](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oath+of+Chandra)'s second triggered ability now correctly sees planeswalkers that entered the battlefield earlier in the turn even if that object is no longer a planeswalker when the ability would trigger. [Sarkhan, the Dragonspeaker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sarkhan%2C+the+Dragonspeaker) is relieved.—fixed 2/17 |
| Cardset | [Wicker Warcrawler](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wicker+Warcrawler) now receives the expected -1/-1 counter when it attacks or blocks.—fixed 2/17 |

| Cardset | [Echoing Decay](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Echoing+Decay) affects only the one target creature when cast on a face-down creature. Face-down creatures have no name, and thus cannot share a name with anything.—fixed 2/17 |
| Cardset | [Tempting Wurm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tempting+Wurm) no longer tempts *Magic Online* into allowing the opponent to put cards onto the battlefield from another player’s library or hand.—fixed 2/17 |
| Cardset | [Heroes' Podium](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Heroes%27+Podium) no longer provides a power and toughness boost to legendary creature cards in zones other than the battlefield.—fixed 2/17 |
| Cardset | A creature sacrificed with [Bloodfire Infusion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodfire+Infusion)'s activated ability now correctly deals damage to each other creature.—fixed 2/17 |

When prompted to change targets, players should be alert for a green glow around the current target.—fixed 2/17 |

| Cardset | Players are no longer incorrectly allowed to choose [Wastes](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wastes) when prompted to choose a basic land type. “Wastes” is not a land type; it is a basic land card without a basic land type.—fixed 2/17 |
| Cardset | Players can no longer choose a value of X higher than 0 when casting a spell with [Goblin Dark-Dwellers](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Dark-Dwellers)'s triggered ability.—fixed 2/17 |

| Client Known Issues |
| Collection | Land cards that use the multicolor land frame but do not have mana symbols in their rules text do not appear when filtering to display colorless cards. These lands do appear when filtering for land cards, however. |
| Deckbuilding | While creating a deck during a Limited event, if a player has sorted a deck and then moved individual cards (for example, moving a [Clutch of Currents](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Clutch+of+Currents) to the 5 CMC column), using the Add Lands button incorrectly re-sorts the deck automatically. |
| Draft | If a player logs back in after being disconnected during a draft, the timer will incorrectly display as 00:00 for the next pick, regardless of how much time that player actually has to make a selection. |
| Duel Scene | Challenging a player directly does not allow the player to set Wins Per Match or Match Clock options. 
  |
| Duel Scene | In certain rare scenarios, a bug may cause a game to restart. If this occurs, errors in the restarted game may cause cards to appear with incorrect watermarks, lands not appearing on the battlefield, or other visual issues. If you experience this issue, please contact Game Support. |
| Duel Scene | When face down cards are given an activated ability, the art displays incorrectly on the stack when that ability is activated.
  |
| General | In certain rare circumstances, the window that displays at the end of an event does not display all prizes that the player has earned. This is a display issue only. All prizes are correctly added to players’ collections in these situations. |
| General | Under rare circumstances, the Game Details window will display buttons to replay matches instead of a round timer or standings. As a temporary workaround, logging out and back in resolves the issue. |
| General | When objects are added to a player’s collection, the window displaying these objects incorrectly defaults to sorting them alphabetically and not by type of object. This keeps booster packs earned as prizes from being immediately seen.  |
| General | Windows 10 may display an error message that *Magic Online* is an unrecognized application while downloading the client. In order to successfully download the client, click the “More Info” link, then “Run Anyway.” |
| League | When rejoining a Constructed League, the "View Your Previous Decks" button is temporarily incorrectly inactive between opening the Entry Requirements dialog box and the next time the League Details window is opened.  |
| Limited Scene | While building a Limited deck, if a player sorts the deck under construction by converted mana cost, clicking the “Add Lands” button will return each card to the appropriate pile even if the player individually moved them to another pile. |
| Multiplayer | Dropping out of a game does not concede the game if the player is not the first one to drop out. 
  |
| Play Lobby | Clicking the Play button in an event lobby does not take the player to the next available tournament.
  |
| Sideboard | Extra cards are sometimes added to a player's deck in addition to their choices when sideboarding. 
  |
| Trade | After clicking the Submit button in a trade, if a player adds or removes cards from the trade, the trade is still incorrectly submitted from his or her trade partner’s side. Toast messaging—messages that pop up on your screen to alert you—does display in this scenario warning players that the trade proposal has changed, and each player will have an opportunity to confirm the trade before it is performed. |
| Trade | Clicking on the empty space in the Will Receive area does not deselect cards in that area. |
| Trade | The Search Tool is not present in the Other Products tab of a trade.  |
