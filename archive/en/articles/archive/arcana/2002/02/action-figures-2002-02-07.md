THE FIRST-EVER **MAGIC: THE GATHERING**
ACTION FIGURES BREAK THE MOLD

*The Most Popular Characters From the World's Number-One Trading Card Game Inspire New 3-D Collectibles for Fans and Players*

February 4, 2002 (Renton, Wash.) -- Wizards of the Coast Inc., a subsidiary of Hasbro Inc. (NYSE:HAS) and global leader in the hobby game industry, announced today plans to release limited quantities of the first collectible **Magic: The Gathering®** action figures in fall 2002. Based on popular iconic characters and top creatures from the best competition-based strategy game ever created, **Magic®** Action Figures are chiseled into dynamic poses that mimic their actual cards in high detail from sculpture and paint perspectives.

Each action figure will also include a randomly inserted *Seventh Edition™* card from the **Magic** trading card game (TCG), which was invented by Richard Garfield and first released in 1993. The **Magic: The Gathering** game is the most widely played TCG, with an active base of more than six million players in 52 countries and 80,000 official tournaments each year. In the **Magic** game, players become the game designers, choosing from thousands of creatures with unique battle abilities, building decks and crafting strategies. With the regular release of expansions, no two games are ever alike, delivering unmatched play value.

The creatures and characters chosen to be the first **Magic** action figures are among the most celebrated of the thousands that have been introduced on game cards over the last nine years. The [Serra Angel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Serra+Angel), [Lord of Atlantis](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lord+of+Atlantis), [Sengir Vampire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sengir+Vampire), and [Erhnam Djinn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Erhnam+Djinn) action figures will solidify the legendary popularity of time-honored cards that are still highly sought after by collectors, professional tournament players and casual players alike. The [Kamahl, Pit Fighter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kamahl%2C+Pit+Fighter) action figure will reinforce the rapid popularity of the card of the same name, which first appeared in the *Odyssey™* expansion, released in October 2001.

Another action figure will add new dimensions of celebrity and empowerment for one professional **Magic** player. The [Shadowmage Infiltrator](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shadowmage+Infiltrator) action figure is based on a card designed by the 2000 **Magic** Invitational champion, Jon Finkel. The action figure bears resemblance to both Finkel and his card, which was also included in the *Odyssey* expansion.

The fall release marks a new product category for the **Magic: The Gathering** product line. It is also the second game innovation this year, after the release of **Magic Online,**  that will provide players and fans with a fresh and heightened way to experience the game. Players and fans will finally have something solid to collect and display that represents coveted cards, reputed game-play strategies, and heroes or foes featured throughout the **Magic** novels.

The **Magic: The Gathering** TCG is printed in nine languages. There are approximately 80,000 **Magic** tournaments hosted annually by the DCI™ players' organization, the governing authority for all officially sanctioned **Magic** tournaments.

A dedicated **Magic Online** website will launch later this year.
