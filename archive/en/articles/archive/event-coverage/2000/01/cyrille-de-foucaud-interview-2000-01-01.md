![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/EURO01/971.jpg)Cyrille de Foucaud has been around for a long time. Starting his Magic playing with Alpha at GenCon on the day the game was released, Cyrille has been playing the game for over eight years now and has seen it go through many changes. We sat down with him in the hopes of gaining some insight into how the game has changed.


  
**Sideboard:** During your match with Bram Snepvangers, you mentioned that you were at GenCon, the day Magic was released to the public. Tell us about your initial impressions of the game


**Cyrille de Foucaud:** The first thing I thought was 'what is this funny game?' I thought it would be a lot of fun, not too serious, a lot of fun to play with friends. Wizards just gave out the starters, and at the end of GenCon, everyone was playing Magic everywhere: On the stairs, on the tables, under the tables. All the professionals stopped working and started playing, and because GenCon is an international Convention, everyone took their cards back home, and the game was everywhere.


**Sideboard:** When did it become apparent to you that Magic was more than just a fun game?


**Cyrille de Foucaud:** When Arabian Nights was released, the cards started gaining in value. With the cards becoming valuable, stores started holding tournaments, and people started playing to win instead of just for fun. That made me realize that it might become competitive like chess. I won the first tournament in France, playing in a bar, with a forty-card combo deck that always killed on the first turn: Twister, Lotus, Recall and Fireball were the only cards in it. The deck was very good because there was no land in the deck, so I was able to abuse the no-land mulligan rule. We started playing for money and big cards. In the first Duelist, there's an article about a guy who won 7 Lotuses and 10 Moxes and a bunch of other big cards in one game. That was me. 


**Sideboard:** So, have you made a lot of money of the cards then?


**Cyrille de Foucaud:** No, I've never sold a card.


**Sideboard:** What happened to those Lotuses then?


**Cyrille de Foucaud:** I gave some of them away and still have six or seven of them. I have around 300,000 cards.


**Sideboard:** ???


**Cyrille de Foucaud:** I know, it's a lot. I was the editor-in-chief of *Lotus Noir,* the French Duelist, for around five years, so Wizards gave me a lot of those cards.


**Sideboard:** So who did you play with back then?


**Cyrille de Foucaud:** We created the first team ever, before PCL, before all that s-t, with Bertrand Lestree, Marc Hernandez, and Clementine Bagieu and myself.


**Sideboard:** You guys did pretty well, right?


**Cyrille de Foucaud:** Yeah. I came third at the first World Championships, Marc came second the next year and Bertrand came second at the first Pro Tour. Clementine was the only woman to play in both of the first two Pro Tours and she made top 32 in New York. She didn't really like Magic, but she liked Magic players (He said with a wink and a smile).


**Sideboard:** Do you ever miss playing with Marc and the others?


**Cyrille de Foucaud:** No, not really. They are still my friends though.


**Sideboard:** Now, you've continued to play through all the years, but not too much, right.


**Cyrille de Foucaud:** I only play around a tournament a month, but I keep up with the game. I read the internet a lot. I don't feel like I need to win (though I like to win a lot), so I'm probably a little less intent than some more competitive players. I have a very difficult job and its very time consuming, so I don't have as much time as some of the kids. I have a house, a girlfriend, a snake and a life outside of Magic.


**Sideboard:** But now, here you are at the European Championships representing Switzerland. What prompted your move?


**Cyrille de Foucaud:** I have four different citizenships, so I can pick and choose, and this year I played in the Swiss Championships. I still live in France though.


**Sideboard:** You did pretty well with your choice, didn't you?


**Cyrille de Foucaud:** Yeah. Everybody thinks that nationals in small countries are easier, but in fact it doesn't make much of a difference, there are always good players. I came fourth, so I qualified for World Championships. Unfortunately, I had to concede the final match as I had to catch my plane.


**Sideboard:** Are you going to Toronto?


**Cyrille de Foucaud:** For sure, but I'm afraid of the food.


**Sideboard:** Nah, the food is good. Thanks very much for your time Cyrille, and good luck at the World Championships.
