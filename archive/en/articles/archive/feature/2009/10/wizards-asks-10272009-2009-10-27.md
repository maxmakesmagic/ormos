*What was your most memorable misplay?*

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/mtgcom/authorpics/authorpic_tomlapille.jpg)**Tom LaPille:** My most memorable misplay comes from a Kamigawa Block Constructed PTQ. I was playing a green-blue legend deck that splashed red for [Godo, Bandit Warlord](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Godo%2C+Bandit+Warlord). I made it to the Finals of the tournament, where I played against a deck that was very similar to mine except it did not have a red splash. 

The first game went very long, and I won it uneventfully. Late in the second game, I had a [Godo, Bandit Warlord](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Godo%2C+Bandit+Warlord) that found me [Tatsumasa, the Dragon's Fang](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tatsumasa%2C+the+Dragon%27s+Fang). [Godo, Bandit Warlord](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Godo%252C%2BBandit%2BWarlord) was my only creature on the table, but equipped he would be an 8/8 that got to attack twice every turn, which made my opponent's board of [Sakura-Tribe Elder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sakura-Tribe+Elder) and an Illusion token from [Meloku the Clouded Mirror](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Meloku+the+Clouded+Mirror) look a bit silly. He played a [Kodama of the North Tree](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kodama+of+the+North+Tree) the next turn, so his 8 power worth of creatures could team up to take out my 8/8 [Godo, Bandit Warlord](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Godo%252C%2BBandit%2BWarlord), but happily, I had [Okina, Temple to the Grandfathers](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Okina%2C+Temple+to+the+Grandfathers) to get past it.

| Godo, Bandit Warlord | Tatsumasa, the Dragon's Fang |

I equipped [Tatsumasa, the Dragon's Fang](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Tatsumasa%252C%2Bthe%2BDragon%2527s%2BFang) to [Godo, Bandit Warlord](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Godo%252C%2BBandit%2BWarlord) and attacked. My opponent blocked with [Sakura-Tribe Elder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sakura-Tribe+Elder) so as not to take 8 damage. I attacked again. My opponent blocked with Kodama and the Illusion. This confused me. Why would he block with 7 power of creatures? Does he have [Okina, Temple to the Grandfathers](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Okina%252C%2BTemple%2Bto%2Bthe%2BGrandfathers) for the [Kodama of the North Tree](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kodama+of+the+North+Tree)? No, because I have [Okina, Temple to the Grandfathers](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Okina%252C%2BTemple%2Bto%2Bthe%2BGrandfathers), and [Kodama of the North Tree](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kodama+of+the+North+Tree) has shroud anyway. Seven power against my 8 toughness doesn't even force me to use [Okina, Temple to the Grandfathers](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Okina%252C%2BTemple%2Bto%2Bthe%2BGrandfathers) to save my [Godo, Bandit Warlord](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Godo%252C%2BBandit%2BWarlord). What in the world is going on here?

![Sakura-Tribe Elder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Sakura-Tribe+Elder)I couldn't figure it out, so I allowed damage to resolve. My opponent gleefully informed me that [Godo, Bandit Warlord](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Godo%252C%2BBandit%2BWarlord) was dead. Apparently [Sakura-Tribe Elder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sakura-Tribe+Elder)s also deal 1 damage (even if they were sacrificed, at the time). That, combined with the 7 that [Godo, Bandit Warlord](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Godo%252C%2BBandit%2BWarlord) just took, was enough to kill him. I stared at my untapped [Okina, Temple to the Grandfathers](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Okina%252C%2BTemple%2Bto%2Bthe%2BGrandfathers) and frowned, and put [Godo, Bandit Warlord](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Godo%252C%2BBandit%2BWarlord) into the graveyard. My opponent then drew and played a [Keiga, the Tide Star](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Keiga%2C+the+Tide+Star) onto the empty board that would kill me next turn.

Now, rather than be in a commanding position, I was going to need something awesome to not die immediately. At the end of my opponent's turn I activated my [Sensei's Divining Top](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sensei%27s+Divining+Top), which did not give me an answer, but found me a [Sakura-Tribe Elder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sakura-Tribe+Elder). I drew it, used Top again to check the new card I would get to see after drawing the Elder, and saw a blank. I played the Elder, used it to shuffle, and looked at my top three again. A [Meloku the Clouded Mirror](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Meloku+the+Clouded+Mirror) was mercifully waiting for me. I tapped the Top to draw it, played it, used my plentiful land to make a ton of Illusions, and won the game easily from there, qualifying me for my first Pro Tour. Hooray!

This misplay was memorable for me because it was my first PTQ winâ€”I was happy to qualify, but I was disappointed that I put myself in a position where I had to get lucky to win. It was also memorable for many other Ohio Valley area players, as there was a crowd of around twenty people watching our match! I got grief about this misplay for a few years.
