With what was likely the most inventive deck in the top eight, Nagoya native Yuusei Gotou has been crushing all weekend long. After emerging from swiss with only a single loss, he has made it to the finals of Grand Prix Kobe without dropping a game. His "No Affinity" deck--an artifact based deck with all Affinity cards absent--has been slamming in with [Tarmogoyf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf)s and Ensouled Artifacts continuously in Kobe.


His opponent, Teruya Kakumae, had been gotten to the finals thanks to his White-Red Burn deck. The player from Osaka incinerated opponent after opponent with a flurry of burn spells--[Shard Volley](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shard+Volley), [Lightning Bolt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt), [Lava Spike](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lava+Spike) et al. He hoped to burn one final opponent this weekend and be left standing with the trophy.


The Games


Teruya Kakumae's first play of the finals was a [Vexing Devil](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vexing+Devil). Instead of taking 4, his opponent, Yuusei Gotou, spent a [Galvanic Blast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Galvanic+Blast) on the pesky 4/3.


Gotou played a [Tarmogoyf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf), forcing Kaukumae to spend a [Rift Bolt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rift+Bolt) to remove it. Kakumae played an Eidolon of Great Revel and passed it back to Gotou.

Without his heavy hitter and out of cards, Gotou was resigned to attacking a point at a time with his [Blinkmoth Nexus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blinkmoth+Nexus). By comparison, Kakumae's hand was full of Burn Spells. He used a [Shard Volley](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shard+Volley) and [Grim Lavamancer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grim+Lavamancer) activation to rid Gotou of his pair of [Ornithopter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ornithopter)s and then started going for Gotou's throat.



[Lava Spike](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lava+Spike), [Skullcrack](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skullcrack) and [Shard Volley](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shard+Volley) went to Gotou's dome and Kakumae took the first game of the finals.


**Kakumae 1-0 Gotou**


Gotou's sideboard came out to play with a first turn [Sunbeam Spellbomb](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sunbeam+Spellbomb). The Spellbomb entered the fray on the following turn when Gotou enchanted it with [Ensoul Artifact](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ensoul+Artifact). He followed up his attack with a [Tarmogoyf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf).

Gotou quickly dropped Kakumae to 7 with his army. Though Kakumae was able to remove the [Tarmogoyf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf), Gotou attacked again with his 5/5 [Sunbeam Spellbomb](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sunbeam+Spellbomb) and cleared his way to the third game with a [Galvanic Blast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Galvanic+Blast).



**Kakumae 1-1 Gotou**


Kakumae started the third game of the finals with a [Vexing Devil](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vexing+Devil). Gotou took the opportunity to take four damage rather than let the 4/3 onto the battlefield. Kakumae was then able to land an [Eidolon of the Great Revel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eidolon+of+the+Great+Revel) on his second turn.

When Gotou wanted to recreate his combo from the last game--[Sunbeam Spellbomb](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sunbeam+Spellbomb) and [Ensoul Artifact](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ensoul+Artifact)--he was forced to fall to 12. When Kakumae played a [Vexing Devil](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vexing+Devil) on his third turn, Gotou thought for a while before falling to 8 to stop the Devil from entering the battlefield.



This was a mistake. After an attack with Eidolon of Great Revel, Kakumae used a pair of [Lava Spike](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lava+Spike)s to finish Gotou off and become Grand Prix Kobe Champion.
