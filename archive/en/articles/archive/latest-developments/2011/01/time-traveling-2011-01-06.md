Tom LaPille makes things. Some of the things he makes are card sets, like Dark Ascension and Born of the Gods. Sometimes he makes stories, too. Sometimes he makes unexpected things, like 16th-century Japanese clothing. He's probably making something right now. 






Next Monday is the release date for *Masters Edition IV*, a **Magic Online**-only set built only from pre-*Mirage* cards and cards from *Portal* and Starter sets. Primarily, *Masters Edition IV* cards come from Limited Edition Beta, *Arabian Nights*, and *Antiquities*. The set is a trip back in time, made entirely of cards built before modern development, but condensed into a set that is meant for drafting and meets modern standards of Limited play.

![](https://media.wizards.com/images/magic/daily/ld/ld124_future.jpg)  
*Masters Edition IV* is the second *Masters Edition* set development I have led. My experience with *Masters Edition III* gave me a big leg up on developing this set, as I had an idea of what pitfalls I would need to fill in, jump over, or run around. However, I also had a leg up from my fantastic development team, which I'm going to tell you about right now.

Zac Hill
![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/mtgcom/authorpics/authorpic_zachill.jpg)Zac is a recent addition to the **Magic** development team. Due to our long pipelines, you haven't seen a ton of his direct work yet other than *Duel Decks: Elspeth vs. Tezzeret*. However, he contributes a ton to Future Future League playtesting, and "Action"—his first development team—isn't too far away. Of course, you may also know of him from his prolific **Magic** writing or from his Top 8 finish at the most recent Pro Tour–Honolulu, which happened just before he joined Wizards.

Alexis Janson
![](https://media.wizards.com/legacy/magic/images/mtgcom/authorpics/authorpic_alexisjanson.jpg)Alexis burst onto the **Magic** scene by winning the first Great Designer Search, which earned her a contract position in **Magic** Ramp;D. She parlayed that into a **Magic Online** coding position, and the team she leads now is responsible for much of **Magic Online**'s back-end functionality, including card coding. She has also served on several design and development teams. I was excited to work with her on this project for several reasons; she has an encyclopedic knowledge of old **Magic** cards, she has a perspective that is both unique and intelligent, and she was the one who I would have to convince that we should actually try to code bizarre old cards like [Word of Command](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Word+of+Command)!

Erik Lauer
![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/mtgcom/authorpics/authorpic_eriklauer.jpg)Erik was the lead designer of *Masters Edition IV*. This is not Erik's usual gig, of course—he's a developer just like I am, and an experienced one at that. He recently ended an amazing run of having been on every main set development team from *Eventide* to *Mirrodin Besieged*. Despite this, he was the one who built the plan for *Masters Editions II*, *III*, and *IV*, and served as lead designer for all three. I love working with Erik He was also kind enough to write us [this week's feature](https://mail.hasbro.com/owa/redir.aspx?C=3f4375861f3e4086aa6f86aa9fc72442amp;URL=http%3a%2f%2farchive.wizards.com%2fMagic%2fMagazine%2fArticle.aspx%3fx%3dmtg%2fdaily%2ffeature%2f124) article about his design of all three.

Judging by the forums from Erik's article this week, some of you may be scratching your head at something I said in that last paragraph. *Masters Edition IV* needed a lead designer? All the cards were already made! What gives?

I'm going to borrow a metaphor from **Magic** Ramp;D director Aaron Forsythe. Two different buildings built with the same steel and glass can produce totally different experiences. A luxury office building is serious, sober, productive, and busy. A luxury apartment building is inviting, homey, friendly, and warm. These feelings are not due to the materials; they are the architect's vision coming to life. Although the materials are the same, the building is different.

![](https://media.wizards.com/images/magic/daily/ld/ld124_riven.jpg)  
The same is true for the *Masters Edition* sets. Pre-*Mirage* cards are the only materials we had to work with, but that doesn't mean that the set was ready to be built without work. Someone had to walk in, look at the materials, and decide what kind of building could be made with them. That person was Erik. In the case of *Masters Edition III*, Erik envisioned a Limited format in which mana-intensive legendary creatures from *Legends* and creatures with horsemanship from *Portal Three Kingdoms* were the best routes to victory, and gave me his best guess at a card file that delivered on this idea. As the lead developer, it was my job to make sure that the file did what he wanted it to do. I leave it to you, the players, to decide whether I delivered on that. However, when Luis Scott-Vargas excitedly talks on a YouTube draft video about how [Riven Turnbull](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Riven+Turnbull) is one of the best cards in his deck, I feel confident that Erik gave me a cool idea, and that I made sure that idea came through in the cards.

Now, let's talk about *Masters IV*. We had three main goals, and I'll go through them one at a time.

It Feels Like a Trip Back in Time

The bulk of the cards in *Masters Edition IV* come from the three first **Magic** sets to ever be released, and many of the same cards that dominated kitchen tables in **Magic**'s earliest days are the cards that will dominate *Masters Edition IV* draft tables. You'll be hoping to open cards like [Force of Nature](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Force+of+Nature), [Shivan Dragon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shivan+Dragon), and [Mahamoti Djinn](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mahamoti+Djinn), and when you play them, you'll be hoping that they don't fall to a [Terror](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Terror) or a [Swords to Plowshares](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swords+to+Plowshares). The uncommon creatures you'll hope to see in your packs are [Sengir Vampire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sengir+Vampire)s, [Air Elemental](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Air+Elemental)s, and [Juggernaut](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Juggernaut)s. Perhaps if you're fortunate, you'll have [Counterspell](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterspell)—not *a* counterspell, *the*[Counterspell](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterspell)-to stop your opponent's key card.

Each *Masters Edition* set reaches back in time, and *Masters Edition IV* reaches back the farthest. If you were around for the very beginning of **Magic**, you'll probably enjoy the flood of memories coming back. If you weren't, here's your chance to catch up.

It's Fun to Draft
Although the overall experience of the set is nostalgic, there are aspects of **Magic**'s history that aren't so exciting to revisit. One of those aspects is early Limited play, which was really quite bad. *Mirage* was the first set developed with Limited in mind, and *Masters* sets are built out of cards made before that. This is our opportunity to apply modern development technology to those cards, and apply it we did.



|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  |  |

Modern **Magic** sets have themes, and this one is no different. Although Limited Edition Beta and *Arabian Nights* were not mechanically themed, *Antiquities* was decidedly an artifact set, and *Masters Edition IV* is as well. You won't be scrambling to get enough artifacts for metalcraft in your deck, as we didn't have mechanics like that back then. However, you can expect to be attacking and blocking with [Obsianus Golem](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Obsianus+Golem), [Primal Clay](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Primal+Clay), and [Clockwork Avian](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Clockwork+Avian), and your [Divine Offering](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Divine+Offering)s, [Crumble](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crumble)s, and [Artifact Blast](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Artifact+Blast)s will do good work for you. 

If you really want to maximize *Masters Edition IV*'s artifact theme, though, I suggest you turn your eye to the basic land slot. Unlike every other **Magic** set in recent memory, you won't find a basic land there. You'll find an Urza land.

![](https://media.wizards.com/images/magic/daily/ld/ld124_3Cards1.jpg)  
These lands inspired players to build decks full of high-mana cards when *Antiquities* released, and similar decks were powerful while *Eighth Edition* and *Ninth Edition* were legal in Standard. You now have the chance to build those decks in Draft. I don't expect more than one or two drafters at a table to put together a dedicated Urza land deck, but if you happen to be in one of those seats, you may find yourself casting [Obsianus Golem](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Obsianus+Golem)s on turn three or pumping [Dragon Engine](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragon+Engine)'s stats to 7/3.

Also, just like modern sets, *Masters Edition IV* has as much of the detail tuning that we put into modern sets as the card pool allows. I don't want to spoil everything here, because exploration of a brave new world is part of the fun of a new **Magic** set, but I'll give an example. Several powerful creatures in the set have the ability to regenerate, including [Clay Statue](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Clay+Statue), [Sedge Troll](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sedge+Troll), and [Living Wall](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Living+Wall). There are also less powerful regenerators, like [Drowned](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Drowned) and [Diabolic Machine](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Diabolic+Machine). We wouldn't do that, of course, without including ways to deal with regenerators. [Lim-Dûl's Cohort](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lim-D%C3%BBl%27s+Cohort) does a decent amount of work in this area, but my favorite bit of texture in the set is [Gravebind](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gravebind).

[![](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Gravebind)](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gravebind)  
[Gravebind](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gravebind) is a common in *Masters Edition IV*. It would be quite a bad card in most Limited environments. I guarantee you that it is not bad in this set. How good is it? Well, I'm really not sure, but I know I was usually happy to play my first one in any black deck, and I enjoyed ambushing [Clay Statue](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Clay+Statue)s when my opponent thought it was safe to attack into my creatures. Of course, [Gravebind](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gravebind) is by no means the only place that our modern development technology helped us make *Masters Edition IV* better, and I invite you to look for other oft-ignored cards like it that can give you a leg up on the competition while you're drafting.

It Gets Old Cards onto Magic Online
*Masters Edition IV* contains a ton of powerful and quirky cards that have never been seen on **Magic Online** before. Many of these are powerful, and help complete the online Legacy or Classic card pool. Things like [Maze of Ith](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Maze+of+Ith), [Sinkhole](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sinkhole), [Library of Alexandria](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Library+of+Alexandria), [Mishra's Workshop](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mishra%27s+Workshop), [Fastbond](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fastbond), and several other restricted cards fall into this category. We want the **Magic Online** card pool to line up with paper as much as it can over time, and these cards are important to the Constructed formats lining up. However, that's not the only reason to bring cards back. There are plenty of cards in pre-*Mirage* sets that aren't important to Constructed formats, but were casual hits, or do something that no other **Magic** card does. For example, [Leeches](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leeches) is the only card in **Magic** that removes poison counters, and [In The Eye of Chaos](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=In+The+Eye+of+Chaos) has an effect that no other card matches. Those cards need to get online too, and that's what we did.

Another thing that *Masters Edition IV* got to do that I'm happy about is to get old-school art on **Magic Online**. It would be strange to omit cards like [Atog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Atog), [Armageddon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Armageddon), or [Counterspell](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterspell) from a set based on **Magic**'s earliest cards, but rather than see this as a problem, I saw it as an opportunity to release those cards using their original art. In the real world, I loved playing with *Antiquities*[Atog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Atog)s and Japanese black-bordered *Fourth Edition*[Counterspell](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterspell)s, and people more ambitious than me went out of their way to get things like *Portal*[Armageddon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Armageddon)s and *Arabian Nights*[Cities of Brass](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cities+of+Brass). *Masters Edition IV* gives **Magic Online** players the chance to play with old-school versions of those cards, some of which are in black borders for the first time.

As a bonus, I'll address some frequently asked questions.

*Why are there 105 rares?*

![](https://media.wizards.com/images/magic/daily/ld/ld124_105Rares.jpg)  
As stated before, one of the goals of the *Masters Edition* sets is to get tons of old cards onto **Magic Online**. Unfortunately, there aren't a lot of pre-*Mirage* cards that work as commons with modern development technology, so lots of the goofy cards we wanted to get online had to exist at higher rarities. With [Sinkhole](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sinkhole), [Mishra's Workshop](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mishra%27s+Workshop), [Maze of Ith](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Maze+of+Ith), ten restricted cards, and all ten dual lands all in the set, we felt that there was enough room to fit plenty of cards we wanted in.

*Why were some cards previewed as mythic rare?*

In the design file, all ten of the cards that are restricted in Vintage were mythic rares. This gave us ten mythic rares and ninety-five rares. I thought this was a good idea that would let the restricted cards be exciting to open even though you only needed one of them, but very late in the process someone realized that a much lower percentage of packs would contain a mythic rare than in paper sets. There was enough concern about messaging this that the restricted cards were demoted, and there are now 105 rares.

*Why are all ten dual lands in the set?*

We want Legacy to be accessible in the long term for **Magic Online** players. Part of making that possible is keeping the cards that make Legacy mana bases work available over time. We included the dual lands again in this set with this goal in mind.

*Why aren't the Power Nine in the set?*

![](https://media.wizards.com/images/magic/daily/ld/ld124_power9.jpg)  
This wasn't my call, so I'm not going to answer. Instead, I'll pass you to Worth Wollpert, who had this to say on the [**Magic Online** forums](http://community.wizards.com/go/forum/viewcategory/75846/Magic_Online).
