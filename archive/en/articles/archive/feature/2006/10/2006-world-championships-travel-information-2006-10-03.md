 With the Eurotunnel service, you can now drive from London to Paris, with your car neatly on the shuttle train. If driving from elsewhere in Europe, once you're in France modern auto routes will get you to Paris quickly, if rather expensively.

 - From Strasbourg: highway A4 - 4h30  
 - From Lyon: highway A6 - 4h30  
 - From Marseille: highway A7-A6 - 7h30

 - From Bordeaux: highway A10 - 5h45  
 - From Nantes: highway A11 - 4h

**By Bus**  
 Euroline buses run from Paris to cities all over Europe. Long-haul bus travel within France isn't really an option, however.
