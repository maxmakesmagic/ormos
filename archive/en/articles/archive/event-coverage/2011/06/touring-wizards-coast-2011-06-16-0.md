Before Thursday's utter carnage in the Modern format, the Community Team toured the Wizards of the Coast building.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/mtgoccup11/663.jpg)*How sweet! The Community Team got Mike Robles a birthday gift!*


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/mtgoccup11/664.jpg)*I was wrong. This is sweet!*


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/mtgoccup11/666.jpg)*There is sweet stuff located all throughout the WotC offices. This is a display just outside the reception desk on the fourth floor.*


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/mtgoccup11/667.jpg)*Magic in a bottle?! Delicious!*


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/mtgoccup11/670.jpg)*Checking out the dragon guarding the fourth floor spawned a decently long discussion about just how the heck it got in the building. Most people agree that they lured it in with promises of delicious cake.*


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/mtgoccup11/673.jpg)*Imagine, if you will, Whiffy dressed up as the Jester. Three years running, people just thought he was dressing up as a clown for Halloween.*


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/mtgoccup11/679.jpg)*This is like the Vatican of Wizards.*


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/mtgoccup11/681.jpg)*Check out the sick contents of Mike Robles's desk! Can you name all the gamer memorabilia?*


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/mtgoccup11/682.jpg)*The things discussed at the WotC offices are nothing if not important!*


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/mtgoccup11/684.jpg)*Sometimes, you just want to hang with the Rock. Actually, always you just wat to hang out with the Rock.*


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/mtgoccup11/685.jpg)*We've definitely added a few more years to this! Thanks for all your support, Magic Community!*


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/mtgoccup11/688.jpg)*This is where the players check out the player psychographics on the wall and try to figure out where they lie.*


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/mtgoccup11/690.jpg)*I think we found the right one for LSV.*


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/mtgoccup11/692.jpg)*The Community Team gets a glance inside one of the War Rooms in the Pit. What cool future information are they going to come back with?*


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/mtgoccup11/693.jpg)*Behold, the future of Magic.*


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/mtgoccup11/694.jpg)*Oh look! It's new R&D intern Billy Moreno!*


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/mtgoccup11/695.jpg)*And it's the Dave twins, Humphreys and Guskin!*


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/mtgoccup11/696.jpg)*Mark Globus don't want no scrubs.*


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/mtgoccup11/697.jpg)*Needless to say, R&D did not get a love note from Giant Growth.*


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/mtgoccup11/699.jpg)*One last moment with the guys who make the cards before we head off on our tour!*


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/mtgoccup11/701.jpg)*Mark Globus, Magic Senior Producer, and our tour guide through the infamous Pit.*


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/mtgoccup11/704.jpg)*People always seem to love to check out the uncut Beta sheet, mostly because it's gorgeous!*


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/mtgoccup11/705.jpg)*I mean seriously, look at this rare sheet!*


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/mtgoccup11/707.jpg)*Whiffy taking some pictures with his new babies.*


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/mtgoccup11/708.jpg)*Everyone really seemed to enjoy their trip through the Digital Games department! I wonder why...*


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/mtgoccup11/711.jpg)*Oh hai, Worth! Worth Wollpert, in addition to facing off against the Community later in the day, was part of the team that answered all the questions the Commuity had about Magic Online.* 


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/mtgoccup11/712.jpg)*Getting a nice group shot in front of the dragon has become a tradition at the Community Cup. Thankfully, no one was eaten.*


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/mtgoccup11/716.jpg)*Um...nevermind.*
