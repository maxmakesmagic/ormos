The Daily *Magic* Update is a roundup of everything *Magic* you should know on March 29, 2016. Today's Update is brought to you by yet more set reviews. [Set reviews for all formats](#format).


Today's Must
============


1. [Draws and Concessions: A Better Alternative](http://www.channelfireball.com/articles/draws-and-concessions-a-better-alternative/) | ChannelFireball | Brian Braun-Duin

Braun-Duin follows up [his proposal to make draws worth 0 points](http://www.channelfireball.com/articles/a-draw-should-be-worth-0-points/) with a new idea, one that has already generated nearly as much discussion as the first one since being posted yesterday evening. This one has [a lively Reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/4cf2ay/bbd_draws_and_concessions_a_better_alternative/), so tune in if you want to be part of the discussion.


After Those, Read, Watch, or Listen to These
============================================


1. [*Shadows over Innistrad* Set Review—White, Artifacts, and Lands (Videos](http://magic.tcgplayer.com/db/article.asp?ID=13188&writer=Conley+Woods&articledate=3-29-2016)) | TCGPlayer | Conley Woods

Another entrance in the set review party, this time Conley Woods is up to bat sporting a [series of videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLxg8UAfS2YJYQzHXNlB2B75JqBk86oOlC) that will focus on deck building, using *Magic Online* to show off the shells of a few decks the brew-master is eying.


<https://www.youtube.com/embed/h5wwXZo55P4?list=PLxg8UAfS2YJYQzHXNlB2B75JqBk86oOlC>


1. [Why Mishra's Workshop, Lodestone Golem, and the Status Quo in Vintage are Necessary](http://www.eternalcentral.com/why-mishras-workshop-lodestone-golem-and-the-status-quo-in-vintage-are-necessary/) | Jaco | Eternal Central

Not everyone thinks [Lodestone Golem](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lodestone+Golem) or [Mishra's Workshop](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mishra%27s+Workshop) should be further restricted in Vintage, and this author is among them. He takes a reasoned approach to the issue, and then also tackles what he calls "the blessing and the curse of *MTGO*, Magic pros, and social media," or, basically, that all of this restricting talk is due to a small but very visible portion of the community.


1. [Keep or Mulligan with Guest Thiago Saporito](http://www.channelfireball.com/articles/keep-or-mulligan-with-guest-thiago-saporito/) | ChannelFireball | Paulo Vitor Damo da Rosa

Mulligans are hard. I don't mulligan enough. Other people mulligan more than they need to. Almost no one does it right all the time. But you can get closer with this series from Brazilian super-duper star Paulo Vitor Damo Da Rosa, this week with guest Thiago Saporito.


Though there's no way in a million years I would mulligan that first hand. At least the [No. 1](https://twitter.com/OwenTweetenwald/status/714684752943558656) and [No. 4](https://twitter.com/paulrietzl/status/714816878191902729) players in the world agree with me.


1. [MtA Episode 166: Shadows over WINnistrad](http://www.magictheamateuring.com/mta-episode-166-shadows-over-winnistrad/) | Magic the Amateuring | Maria Bartholdi and Meghan Wolff

In advance of Prerelease weekend (you have already preregistered at [a local store](http://locator.wizards.com/), right?), Maria and Meghan bring Judge Rob on the program to explain the mechanics of *Shadows over Innistrad*, so your Prerelease experience can be rules-hassle free. Or maybe just a little bit hassle-free. New cards can be confusing, man.


1. Format-Specific Set Reviews

We have two offerings today in our format-specific set reviews category. Perhaps, to start, I could interest you in a lovely Commander vintage? Maybe in the white, blue, and black yield?


* [Commander Review: *Shadows over Innistrad* Part 1 (White, Blue, Black)](http://www.mtggoldfish.com/articles/commander-review-shadows-over-innistrad-part-1-white-blue-black) | MTGGoldfish | Tomer Abramovici

If that isn't to your liking, or if you'd like something off the tasting menu, we also have a delicious and light Pauper option.


* [Pauper and Shadows](http://www.gatheringmagic.com/alexullman-032916-pauper-and-shadows/) | Gathering Magic | Alex Ullman

If neither of those is to your liking, Luis Scott-Vargas also just released his very popular Limited set review, now [in blue](http://www.channelfireball.com/articles/shadows-over-innistrad-limited-set-review-blue-cards/). Season to taste, as this one can take a while to finish.


What to Watch Tonight
=====================


1. [Live Set Review with Evan Erwin and Brad Nelson](https://www.twitch.tv/evanerwin)

When both Evan and Brad were at StarCityGames.com, their set reviews were among the most beloved reviews on the internet. Despite Evan moving on from SCG, they weren't going to let that particular enjoyable feature wither and die, so instead they upped the ante with a live show. The show will run two nights on [Evan's Twitch channel](https://www.twitch.tv/evanerwin), with the following schedule:


* White, blue, and black: Tuesday, March 29, at 9 p.m. ET (6 p.m. PT)
* Red, green, artifacts, multicolor, and land: Wednesday, March 30, at 9 p.m. ET (6 p.m. PT)

What People Are Talking About
=============================


1. [Is Prerelease okay for a young, inexperienced player?](https://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/4cdmuc/is_prerelease_ok_for_a_young_inexperienced_player/)

The top comment says everything. Prereleases seem like big deals—and they kind of are, since it's the first time you get to play with the product and there's a festive atmosphere around them—but they're big deals meant to be fun and exciting events with learning moments. That's why we publish a [Prerelease Primer](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/feature/shadows-over-innistrad-prerelease-primer) for every set and why we keep adding new teaching content to it.


So if you're new to the game, go to a Prerelease! And if you're an old hand at the game, bring a new player along or make sure to take an extra moment to help someone just starting out this weekend. Prereleases are for everyone.


1. [Mar. 31 (Thursday)—AMA with *Shadows over Innistrad* Lead Designer Mark Gottlieb!](https://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/4cbq6d/mar_31_thursday_ama_with_shadows_over_innistrad/)

This is mostly just a heads up that this is happening. Mark Gottlieb will be on Reddit this Thursday to talk all things *Shadows over Innistrad*, and probably answer a few other questions if he's feeling frisky.


Deck of the Day
===============


1. [Vintage Workshop](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/mtgo-standings/vintage-daily-2016-03-28)

So I'm not going to pretend to know the different flavors of Workshop decks. I know there's Aggro Shops and Martello Shops and other flavors, but I honestly can't keep them straight in my head. All I know is that they're at [the center of discussion](#vintage) for Vintage players wondering what, if anything, should be restricted come April 4.


Well, at the very least, we should know what deck they're talking about. This deck below, played by Pedroj to a 4-0 record in a [Vintage Daily](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/mtgo-standings/vintage-daily-2016-03-28), is one version of Shops. All of the decks in question are prison-style decks that try to keep opponents from casting, well, much of anything, while utilizing the huge boost of mana from [Mishra's Workshop](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mishra%27s+Workshop). [Lodestone Golem](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lodestone+Golem), [Sphere of Resistance](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sphere+of+Resistance), [Thorn of Amethyst](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thorn+of+Amethyst), [Chalice of the Void](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chalice+of+the+Void), and [Trinisphere](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=194979)—often backed up by [Strip Mine](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Strip+Mine)/[Wasteland](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wasteland) and [Crucible of Worlds](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crucible+of+Worlds)—make it hard for opponents to cast their spells. Then some artifact creatures clean up.


The reason [Lodestone Golem](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lodestone+Golem) is the center of much of the talk is because it does double duty—it helps lock out opponents while also providing a fast clock. With [Mishra's Workshop](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mishra%27s+Workshop) and the Moxen, it even comes down pretty easily on turn one. Since [Thorn of Amethyst](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thorn+of+Amethyst) can't attack, it at least gives opponents the opportunity to not die while not casting their spells.
