![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/ptosa02/a920.jpg)Alan Comer, one of Magic's foremost Mad Geniuses, is looking more reserved than usual this weekend. His ordinarily tempestuous hairstyle has been hemmed in, and he wears a look of grim determination only sometimes broken by his trademark goofy grin. After winning his first round, he squares off against France's affable roue, Olivier Ruel. Ruel has brought mono-black to the table, while Comer is with green-blue Compulsion. Though Comer is too humble to say so himself, he will soon be seen on the front page of Sideboard.com with a weekly Deck Clinic column.

Olivier won the coin flip and chose to play. He started strong, with a belated turn-three [Nantuko Shade](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nantuko+Shade) against Comer's board of [Compulsion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Compulsion). It hit for six while Comer dug for answers. His Compulsion put two [Basking Rootwalla](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Basking+Rootwalla)s into play, but he chose to let another attack of the Shade through. [Cabal Coffers](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cabal+Coffers) meant it hit for eight.

He chumped the Shade, and prevented a [Chainer's Edict](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chainer%27s+Edict) with [Circular Logic](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Circular+Logic). He made a Mongrel and on Ruel's next attack busted out a surprise [Arrogant Wurm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arrogant+Wurm), attempting to take down the Shade. Ruel just shrugged and showed Comer [Laquatus's Champion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Laquatus%27s+Champion). 

Ruel 1 - Comer 0

Ruel had no turn-two play again in the second game, but Comer's incredible opening hand failed to pay dividends when a turn-three [Careful Study](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Careful+Study) turned up no land. Ruel almost felt bad destroying his island with [Rancid Earth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rancid+Earth).

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/ptosa02/a918.jpg)While Comer continued to draw non-land cards, Ruel hit five swamps and cast [Mind Sludge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mind+Sludge). "Only five? You mean I get to keep some of these cards?", asked Comer in mock-joy. Even that dissipated when Ruel Sludged again.

Comer drew an island, a tiny victory. Ruel tapped five and showed him a [Haunting Echoes](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Haunting+Echoes). "I think I'll just go home.", said Comer, scooping up his cards.

**Final Result:** Olivier Ruel defeats Alan Comer 2-0
