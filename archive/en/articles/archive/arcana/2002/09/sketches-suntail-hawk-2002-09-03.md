This week's Sketches looks at the *Judgment* common [Suntail Hawk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Suntail+Hawk) by Heather Hudson.

### 1. Art Description

These are the instructions given to the artist:

"This is a white card and should show a fantasy hawk in flight on the hunt." Quite simple.

### 2. Sketch

This is the preliminary sketch submitted by Heather. When looking at the sketch, you can easily see the large horn-like ears on the hawk, which you may not have noticed when looking at the card.

### 3. Final Art

Here is a large version of the final piece. 

### 4. Card

Finally, here is the card as you all know it today.
