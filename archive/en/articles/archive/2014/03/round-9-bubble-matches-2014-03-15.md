 Stybs has played Magic the world over, writing and drafting as part of the event coverage team and slinging Commander everywhere his decks will fit. 





The end of the first day of a Grand Prix is a tenuous time for many players. The line between returning for a shot at the Top 8 on Day 2 is usually firm at no more than two losses. That means the last round is where players make their final stands – a few to remain undefeated but, for most, just earning the right to return for battle on Day 2.


While we couldn't cover everybody, we scouted across the matches on "the bubble" to see how a few familiar faces fared when it was all put on the line.

**Magic Online** Community Cup member, and longtime online streamer, Kenji Egashira was thrilled to make the cut but Conley Woods was much more reserved: "I barely made it, but we got there." Others that moved on to drafting included multiple Grand Prix Top 8 competitors Seth Manfield, Harry Corvese, and Dan Jordan.


 


Not everyone's story turned out as well. 2nd-ranked Reid Duke fell in the last round, as did both Pro Tour *Born of the Gods* Top 8 competitors Patrick Dickmann and 22nd-ranked Chris Fennell. Lucas Siow too lost his win-and-in, narrowing the field of Canadian competitors by one more.

For some the story wasn't as simple as winning or losing. Jamie Parke was in the middle of an opponent's appeal, and when a ruling can make or break a game for making Day 2 tensions run high. (Parke ended up defeating his opponent to return.)


 


For Matt Costa and Christian Calcano, it was do or die against each other.

Fans of either player should note the battlefield was often quite full between them every time we passed by.

That's Costa wielding a [Setessan Oathsworn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Setessan+Oathsworn) with five +1/+1 counters and bestowed by [Nyxborn Shieldmate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nyxborn+Shieldmate). Calcano had bestowed [Nyxborn Triton](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nyxborn+Triton) on [Chorus of the Tides](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chorus+of+the+Tides). While Calcano won that game it was Costa who eventually found the two wins needed to take the match.


 


Can any of these players rattle off a run for Top 8? It's almost anyone's time to shine tomorrow, and that's just a few short hours away until we can find out.
