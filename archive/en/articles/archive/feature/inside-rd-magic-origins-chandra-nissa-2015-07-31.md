Five Planeswalkers, five origin stories. *Magic Origins* chronicles the growth of five iconic Planeswalkers through the cards, and this edition of Inside R&D dives into the stories of the set, the Planeswalkers, and designing the cards that tell their tales.

Today, we conclude this season's Inside R&D segments with the origins of two Planeswalkers: Chandra and Nissa.


Chandra Nalaar's origins began on the artificer's plane of Kaledesh. A tragedy tied to her natural gifts led her Planeswalker's spark to ignite—taking her to Regatha, where she learned how to channel her gifts.

Nissa Revane, the young seer from Zendikar, develops her abilities at home. Her journey to explore what darkness lies beneath the surface of her home plane leads to her spark's ignition—and to a land very different from her own.
