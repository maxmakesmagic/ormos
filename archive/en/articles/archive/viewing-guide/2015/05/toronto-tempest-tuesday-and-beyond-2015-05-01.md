First up is [Grand Prix Toronto](http://magic.wizards.com/en/content/fact-sheet-grand-prix-toronto-2015). This two-day Standard event is taking place in the downtown area for the first time, and is sure to be an exciting display of Standard's latest metagame developments. Following last week's Regional Pro Tour Qualifiers, will any new decks emerge…or will old archetypes remain supreme?



Join Marshall Sutcliffe, Randy Buehler, Jacob Van Lunen, Rashad Miller, Richard Castle, and Rusty Kubis for live video coverage of GP Toronto. It all starts on the [*Magic* Twitch Channel](http://www.twitch.tv/magic) Saturday at 1 p.m. local time (ET)/10 a.m. PT/5 p.m. UTC. Coverage of Day Two begins Sunday at 9 a.m. local time (ET)/6 a.m. PT/1 p.m. UTC.

And on Tuesday, catch Week 2 of the Standard Super League, hosted by Randy Buehler and Luis Scott-Vargas!



Week 1 was all about Owen Turtenwald and his rampage through the bracket. After quickly dispatching Andrew Cuneo in the quarterfinals, Turtenwald advanced to combat Tom Ross, who was unable to stop Turtenwald's Abzan assault. Then, in the finals, he battled through Gerry Thompson's Sidisi-Whip deck, making Owen the leader in points after the first week.



Will Turtenwald's devastating performance with Abzan Aggro influence the deck selection for the other competitors this week, or will players show up with their choices from Week 1 and trust that the bracket will kinder to them in Week 2? Tune in to the [*Magic* Twitch Channel](http://www.twitch.tv/magic) on Tuesday at 6 p.m. PT/9 p.m. ET/1 a.m. UTC to find out!
