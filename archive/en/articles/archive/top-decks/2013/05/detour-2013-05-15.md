With the Pro Tour coming up on the American West Coast [this weekend](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/tcg/events.aspx?x=mtg/event/protour/dragonsmaze13), a greater-than-normal number of top players chose to take a detour to Portland, Oregon, for last weekend's [Modern Grand Prix](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/magazine/article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/eventcoverage/gppor13/welcome). As fans of the game, we got to enjoy the triumphs and heartache of some of the world's greatest players on a pretty big stage... in anticipation for **Magic**'s greatest stage. 

 Portlandia wasn't the only detour, of course; Modern itself is a detour of sorts from the standard of Standard (and the Pro Tour itself is going to be *Return to Ravnica* Block Constructed). In this foray back to Modern we got to see Pro Tour Champions and Hall of Famers battling with some of their favorite strategies, although it was Sam Pardee and his Melira-Pod deck that took down the whole event.
