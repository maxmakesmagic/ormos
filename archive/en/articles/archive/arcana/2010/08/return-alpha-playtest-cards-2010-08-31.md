You know, it's been awhile since we took a look at **Magic**'s earliest collectibles: the Alpha playtest cards. And there are still some fascinating tidbits in there. So let's get moving!

This, of course, is [Mox Jet](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mox+Jet). And like some of the [other cards](/en/articles/archive/alpha-playtest-art-2008-08-28), it had jokey clip art. The joke is enhanced in this case by including a dialogue balloon explicitly commenting on the joke itself!

How would **Magic** be different if [Ancestral Recall](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ancestral+Recall) were called "Ancestral Memory"? Well, probably not much.

You remember [Demonic Attorney](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Demonic+Attorney), right? It looks like this:


![Demonic Attorney](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Demonic+Attorney)
Technically, this is part of one of the few first-turn kills in Alpha ([Swamp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swamp), [Black Lotus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Black+Lotus), [Demonic Attorney](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Demonic+Attorney), opponent concedes rather than ante another cardâ€”okay, it's a bit of a cheat) but the really interesting part is the sentence that got cut from the playtest card. "The game will now count double" didn't really mean anything back before a "match" was defined as "best two out of three games," but it would be fascinating now!

What card could this be? Can you guess? Here's a hint: it's not a unicorn of any sort. Click here to see.


In fact, it's the back of the card! So it could be anything. Maybe even a unicorn, which means that the hint could have been completely wrong. Sorry about that. Anyway, from now on, whenever you see an Alpha playtest card, just know that there's a unicorn on the other side.
