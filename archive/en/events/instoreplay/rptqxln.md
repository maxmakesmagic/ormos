The structure for Regional Pro Tour Qualifiers is modified Swiss-style.


Because Regional Pro Tour Qualifiers award invitations based on total attendance, the number of single-elimination matches that are to be played after the Swiss rounds is determined based on as follows:




|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Attendance | How Many Single-Elimination Matches? |
| Up to 42 Players | Quarterfinals and Semifinals |
| 43-93 Players | Quarterfinals Only |
| 94+ Players | No Single-Elimination Matches |



* Standard Constructed.
* Decklists are required.


* Swiss rounds will be 50 minutes in length.
* Single-elimination playoff matches will have no time limit.
* Number of Swiss rounds based on attendance according to the following chart:



|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Attendance | Swiss rounds | Playoff |
| 9—16 | 4 Rounds | Top 8 |
| 17—32 | 5 Rounds | Top 8 |
| 33—64 | 6 Rounds | Top 8 |
| 65—93 | 7 Rounds | Top 8 |
| 94—128 | 7 Rounds | None |
| 129—226 | 8 Rounds | None |
| 227—409 | 9 Rounds | None |
| 410 or higher | 10 Rounds | None |



* Playoff matches will be best two of three.
* Playoff matches will be single-elimination.
* While there are no time limits in the playoff rounds, players are expected to play at a reasonable pace and finish their matches within 60 minutes.
* Standings after the Swiss rounds will be used to determine final order in the standings for losing players in the quarterfinal and semifinal playoff rounds.
* For the first game of each match in the playoff, the player who finished higher in the Swiss rounds chooses either to play first or to play second. For subsequent games in each playoff match, the usual Play/Draw rule applies (loser of the previous game decides whether to play first in the next game).
* The [*Magic: The Gathering* Tournament Rules](http://wpn.wizards.com/en/document/magic-gathering-tournament-rules) and the [*Magic: The Gathering* Infraction Procedure Guide](http://wpn.wizards.com/en/document/magic-infraction-procedure-guide) are in effect for this event unless specifically overruled by information in this Fact Sheet.
* Players are responsible for bringing their own method of tracking life totals and appropriate counters or tokens.
