Welcome to Amonkhet!


<https://www.youtube.com/embed/cP-2txz0F48>


You've never quite seen a world like Amonkhet before. Inspired by ancient Egypt at its height, and showcasing some of the strongest warriors around, Amonkhet is a mix of serenity and brutality; awe-inspiring pyramids sitting right next to stunning blows in battle. Only the strong can succeed here. Are you up to the challenge?


Because if so, it's time to take you through the five trials—at your friendly local Prerelease, of course!


So where exactly is a Prerelease, and what exactly should you be expecting at one? Read on!


A Pyramid of Prereleases
========================


It doesn't get much better than a Prerelease.


No matter where in the world I am or what time of year it is, I always try to go check out a local Prerelease. And I'm not alone: many veteran *Magic* players will do the same.


Why? Prereleases are some of the most fun you can have playing *Magic*!


You get to sit down, pick up some brand-new cards, and figure out how you want to use them at the same time as everybody else. It's an even playing field in a casual environment—where everybody shares all of that bubbling energy and excitement around a new *Magic* set!


I visited my first Prerelease when I was just eleven and instantly fell in love with them. Fifteen years later, not much has changed!


Prereleases are great because the set is brand new, the footing is fairly equal as everybody plays with the set for the very first time, and you're all just relaxing and having fun exploring the new cards. It's a lot of fun for players old and new alike!


If you're a Sealed Deck veteran, you may want to skip ahead to the next section where I talk about some of the differences you can expect at your local store for *Amonkhet*. But if you're new to the wide world of Sealed Deck or are maybe just looking for a few extra pointers, then read on!


Alright. Let's go over perhaps the most important part: finding a place to play a Prerelease! After all, you can't very well play if you don't know where to go. How might you go about that?


Well, if you don't already have a local shop you frequent, be sure to check out the [store locator](http://locator.wizards.com/) to find one near you! That store may even offer preregistration. Prereleases are some of the most popular events we put on, so be sure to check to see if the store preregisters. The best time to find out an event is full is decidedly *not* when you show up and learn you can't play, so be sure to look ahead.


So, you've found your store. Excellent!


Now it's time to prepare for your trip to Amonkhet. While you will be building your deck for the event with cards you're given when you get there, there's plenty to do beside just that.


Be sure to pack all the supplies you'll need to properly survive the plane! For example, you may still want to bring a Standard deck to play for fun between rounds, a trade binder, pen and paper to keep track of life, and even a water bottle. (You might get thirsty out there in the desert!)


A Prerelease event tends to take about 4–5 hours, so make sure to set aside enough time for the entire event. And you're going to need some fuel with all of that battling, so you may want to bring something like a granola bar or apple as well to snack on. (You may want to check with the local store as well; they might even sell some food there!)


Okay now, let's see. You have a store picked to visit, and you've filled your pack with everything you'll need. You've even read through the recent [*Magic* Story](http://magic.wizards.com/en/products/amonkhet/story), so you're up to date on *Magic* lore. And, of course, you've taken a look at the [*Amonkhet* Card Image Gallery](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/card-image-gallery/amonkhet).


You're all set! Now it's time to actually go and open up some of those cards!


Face your Trials
================


When you head into the Prerelease and sit down to play, you'll be handed this thing of beauty! Check out the sweet deck box for this time around.

Ah, gorgeous, right?


You'll find a couple things inside. For example, this lovely "lazotep" spindown D20 that's a bit different than your standard fare:


![](https://media.wizards.com/2017/images/daily/nwFBYEN479.png)


And, very importantly, you'll also get one of these. Feast your eyes on the card that describes the Five Trials of Amonkhet!


![](https://media.wizards.com/2017/images/daily/43qIOu7Q6L.png)


Hey, look at that, you can complete the Trial of Strength just by playing in the event! That was easy. Prepare to cross that one off! Your reward for this is already included in your prerelease box: that is the lovely "lazotep" spindown D20 we mentioned earlier.


Take a gander at some of those other ones too. This is a good time to note that if you bring a friend to the Prerelease, that counts as completing the Trial of Solidarity! Do so, and you can scoop up a lovely lazotep D4 (a pyramid-shaped die, get it?) for your friendship.


Still, it doesn't hurt to prepare for your Trials. Throughout this week on our social media channels, we're going to be helping you train for the Trials with some Puzzles. If you complete all five Training Puzzles, starting with [the Training Puzzle of Solidarity from yesterday](https://www.facebook.com/MagicTheGathering.apac/posts/1337043716364486), you can bring in your results to receive a premium full-art basic land that I'm sure will be a nice addition to your collection. Check it out in all its glory:

Just like on Amonkhet, completing your Trials is full of rewards! Follow along with them and receive our bounty.


Of course, there is one trial that comes up in every *Magic* Prerelease that's still ever-present, needing to be defeated. And that's . . .


The Trial of Deck Building
==========================


Most important of everything inside your Prerelease pack are the six booster packs that will give you the cards you need to build your Sealed deck, plus your shiny bonus Prerelease card (which could be any rare or mythic rare in the set!)


First things first: crack open those booster packs! Then, you'll have a stack of cards.


So . . . what now?


It's time to build your deck, of course!


Sealed Deck is a little different from normal deck building. You get to build a deck only using the cards in front of you, plus as many basic lands as you'd like. Also, unlike a normal Constructed deck where the minimum deck size is 60, you only have to play 40 cards.


The first thing you're going to want to do is figure out a method to pick which colors you'll be playing. I recommend playing two colors.


Some things that may draw you into specific colors are:


* A really strong rare you're excited about
* Plenty of "removal" cards that can deal with your opponent's creatures
* A lot of playable cards in that color
* A good "mana curve" in that color—meaning lots of creatures of different costs

Ideally, the colors you pick will have all four, but if two or three of those are true, that's plenty good.


Whatever your method, you're going to need to narrow down what you're playing. If you get stuck at the Prerelease, feel free to ask the players around you for help. (You are allowed to do this at a Prerelease—everyone is there to make sure it's a fun event!)


But whatever your method, now you have your colors down. From there, how do you take everything you have and figure out which 22–23 cards you're going to want to put in your deck?


Here's one process that may help!


First, lay your creatures out in mana-cost order. This helps you see what creatures you're going to potentially have to cast at each part of the game. (Don't lay your noncreatures out at this point unless they're cards you are planning to play as soon as you have that much mana—for example, you will generally cast a Watchful Naga on turn three, whereas Pull from Tomorrow isn't usually a turn-three play.)


A good "mana curve" of creatures is crucial to a successful Sealed Deck. You don't want to have a ton of cards at any single spot in the curve. It's important for you to be able to have a good mix so you can play your cheap spells in the early game and your expensive spells in the late game. As a very general rule for Limited, I would look to play something like this:


* 1 mana: 0–2 creatures
* 2 mana: 4–6 creatures
* 3 mana: 3–5 creatures
* 4 mana: 4 creatures
* 5 mana: 3 creatures
* 6+ mana: 1–2 creatures

![](https://media.wizards.com/2016/images/daily/sealed-curve.png)


That's far from hard and fast, but it's a good place to start. Cull your creatures down to these numbers by choosing your favorites.


Now that you have your core creature base figured out, it's time to add in spells! Pick your favorites among your colors to bring your deck to 22 or 23 cards, and then you're good to go from the spell side.


The spells you're going to want the most are what are called "removal spells"—these are the spells that permanently neutralize your opponent's creatures by either dealing damage, keeping them tapped, or just straight-up destroying them. Sealed Deck *Magic* is all about creatures, so you'll want to play most of the cards in your colors that can get rid of your opponent's creatures.


Interested in more tips? Here are a few more things to keep in mind for deck building:


* You can play more than 40 cards, but you really should stick to 40 if you can. Every card you play past 40 just means it's that much less likely you're going to draw that awesome rare you put in your deck!
* The land ratio you're looking at should be about seventeen lands to 23 nonlands. This isn't right 100% of the time, but most Limited decks end up looking like this, and, in general, it's what I would want to have.
* Play a mix of cheap-to-cast and expensive-to-cast cards. If you have all cheap, small creatures, then a single big creature can shut you down. Likewise, if you have all expensive, large creatures, you risk getting run over first. Stick to a mix that focuses on the two-, three-, four-, and five-casting cost creatures. More games of Sealed Deck are won by casting a creature every turn starting on turn two or three than any other way.
* Evasion is important! Often, Sealed Deck games will get into stalls where both players have a lot of creatures and neither player can attack very well. Creatures with abilities like flying ensure that you can break through these creature stalls.

Two-Headed Giant
================


Some stores also support a version of Sealed Deck called Two-Headed Giant (often abbreviated "2HG") where two players team up against other pairs of players. Each pair gets two Prerelease boxes from which the players build their decks.


How does it work?


Well, the simple version is this: You and your teammate work together to build two 40-card decks. Then, you play against another pair of players in a one-game match.


How does this kind of multiplayer play out? It's simple: all your creatures and lands are separate, but you each share the same 30-point life total and take your turns simultaneously—plus you can block for each other, too! To do the best you can, you'll need to work together to overcome the opposition.

Open Dueling
============


If the idea of spending a day playing a tournament doesn't fit into how you prefer to play *Magic*, or if you have a crowded schedule and just want to experience the excitement of *Amonkhet* on your own time, you can get involved in Open Dueling!


You get a ready-to-play 60-card Intro Pack and use it to do battle against others participating in Open Dueling, including players participating in the main tournament who are between rounds! This is a great way to dip your toe into the water if you aren't sure the Prerelease is something you want to do or if you can't commit 5 hours to a Prerelease event. You can just play games in Open Dueling at your own leisure. Plus, it's fun!


Ask your local store about Open Dueling at the Prerelease, and prepare to battle!
