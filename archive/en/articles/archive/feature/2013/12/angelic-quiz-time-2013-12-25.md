Angels have been part of the **Magic** Multiverse since the earliest of days with the well-known Serra Angel. While she might be the most famous Angel in **Magic**, she’s far from the only one. Today’s quiz is all about Angels.

This is my official disclaimer and recognition that I am purposefully ignoring them for the purposes of this quiz, and as such you should too.

Q**1.** What Angel is the mythic rare Angel in ***Magic** 2014* Core Set?


*(Difficulty: Easy)*


[50/50 Hint](#) - Click this to eliminate two wrong answers.


* [Archangel of Thune](#) - RIGHT - [Archangel of Thune](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Archangel+of+Thune) made quite the splash when it was revealed and continues to carry on the tradition of combat-ready Angels in **Magic**.
* [Baneslayer Angel](#) - WRONG - First printed in ***Magic** 2010*  [Baneslayer Angel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Baneslayer+Angel) proved to be quite the powerhouse in competition, where Brian Kibler famously raced [Progenitus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Progenitus) with it.
* [Seraph of the Sword](#) - WRONG - [Seraph of the Sword](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seraph+of+the+Sword) is indeed in ***Magic** 2014* Core Set, but as a rare, not a mythic rare.
* [Adakar Valkyrie](#) - WRONG - [Adarkar Valkyrie](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Adarkar+Valkyrie) was just rereleased in *Modern Masters*, but it did not make an appearance in ***Magic** 2014* Core Set.

Q**2.** Which color is the only color NOT to have a monocolored Angel?


*(Difficulty: Easy)*


[50/50 Hint](#) - Click this to eliminate two wrong answers.


* [White](#) - WRONG - Really? That's what you're going with?
* [Blue](#) - WRONG - Nope sorry. Up until 2012 this was one of the correct answers, but with *Planechase (2012 edition)* it gets its own Angel in [Illusory Angel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Illusory+Angel).
* [Green](#) - RIGHT - While there are a handful of Angels who have green in their casting costs, there are no mono-green Angels.
* [Colorless](#) - WRONG - There are only two colorless Angels, but interestingly there are three artifact Angels.

Q**4.** How many artists have illustrated Serra Angel on tournament-playable [Serra Angel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Serra+Angel) cards?


*(Difficulty: Vorthos)*


[50/50 Hint](#) - Click this to eliminate two wrong answers.


* [2](#) - WRONG - Try again!
* [3](#) - RIGHT - Read more below!
* [4](#) - WRONG - Keep guessing!
* [5](#) - WRONG - Nope, not this one.


The correct answer is three versions are tournament legal. Douglas Shuler's original painting was the face of Serra Angel from Alpha to *Fourth Edition* and remains one of the most well known pieces of art in **Magic**. After sitting out *Fifth* and *Sixth Editions*, Serra Angel returned in *Seventh* and *Eighth Edition* with card art by Mark Zug. Then with *Ninth Edition* Greg Staples's painting became the current face of Serra Angel we know.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/arcana/arc1300_serraangels.jpg)Rebecca Guay illustrated a comic book about Serra Angel which included an *oversized* (and thus not tournament-legal) Serra Angel which she illustrated. The comic book was distributed in 1996 and that oversized Serra Angel has become one of the game's most sought-after oversized cards.

Q**5.** Our final question comes courtesy of my boss Mark Purvis's office. He has the following piece of art hanging on his wall and challenged me to identify it from its art. I wasn't able to do it, how about you?


*(Difficulty: Vorthos++)*


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/arcana/arc1300_q5.jpg)[Hint #1](#) - The artist is the very awesome [rk post](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?action=advanced&artist=+%5B%22rk%20post%22%5D).


[Hint #2](#) - It is an uncommon in *Nemesis*.
