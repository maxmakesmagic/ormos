I'm pleased to announce the launch of **Gatherer** (<http://gatherer.wizards.com>), Wizards of the Coast's new searchable online database of **Magic: The Gathering** card information. The number one thing **magicthegathering.com** readers have asked for over the last few years is an easy way to search through Magic's 7000+ cards, so here it is.

 We present Gatherer today as a kind of "public beta" -- there may still be a few details that need to be ironed out, but as long as the servers hold up for this potentially extremely popular tool, we feel that it's a great boon for most players. 

**You can use Gatherer to:**

* Look up the current wording of a card
* Find cards of a given color or creature type for your theme deck
* Search for cards illustrated by your favorite artist
* Determine format legality of any card
* Track the various printings of a card through **Magic**'s history
* Search all **Magic** flavor text
* Get an export of the Oracle for a given format
* Look at the [*Champions of Kamigawa* spoiler](http://gatherer.wizards.com/default.asp?term=&fields=%7Cname%7Crules%7Ctype&format=ChampionsofKamigawa&color=All&output=summary&sort=name&first=1)

...and many other things.

### Watch the FAQ

The [Gatherer FAQ](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=magic/faq/gatherer) will be the first place to look for information on using the tool. Keep an eye on it: we'll be updating the FAQ as people begin to use it and we know what people want to know. Which brings us to the next point...

### Got Feedback?

We want you to let us know about your experience with Gatherer! Is Gatherer easy to use? Does it let you do the kinds of things you want to do? Did you find an error or problem using Gatherer on your browser? Do you hate the interface or design? Do you love it to pieces? We want to know!

Send your feedback in one of two ways. To the right of the [search interface](http://gatherer.wizards.com), there are links to "Discuss" and to "Send feedback." The former takes you to a message boards thread where you can share your thoughts on the message boards. The latter launches a web form that lets you email us directly. While we may not be able to reply individually, your questions and comments will help shape Gatherer as it evolves to suit your needs.

### Go Play!

So [check out Gatherer](http://gatherer.wizards.com) now! Look up all the goblins! Check out art by Ittoku! Change your output from a summary view to a full spoiler view to a text view! And send in those comments!
