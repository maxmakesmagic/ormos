GIDEON JURA
===========

Unlike most Planeswalkers, Gideon doesn’t hesitate to enter combat. This powerful white mage is driven by loyalty and practices hieromancy, the magic of holy justice.


Gideon’s strong morals and sense of duty have served him well as an agent for the Order of Heliud, an organization that sought to bring law to the plane of Regatha. When the pyromancer Chandra Nalaar became an obstacle to the Order’s goals, they sent Gideon to intercept her on the plane of Kephalai. She was attempting to steal—for a second time—a powerful fire spell with a map to the Eye of Ugin, hidden away on the plane of Zendikar.


Never before had Gideon’s quarry been so crafty, resourceful, and elusive. On Kephalai, Gideon briefly apprehended her, but she escaped. Tracking her down to on the dark plane of Diraden, he then became Chandra’s unlikely ally as the two joined forces to escape the predations of the plane’s vampire ruler, Velrav.


Only on returning to Regatha did Chandra learn that Gideon served the Order and that she would have to surrender to prevent her adopted home from being destroyed. With Gideon’s help, Chandra survived this persecution, giving him reason to question the Order’s true motives. It wasn’t long before she departed again, once more in search of the Eye of Ugin.


After some soul searching, Gideon decided to follow Chandra to Zendikar, believing he could help her stay alive on that treacherous, unpredictable plane. By the time he arrived, Chandra was gone and Zendikar was under siege from the ancient world-eating beings known as the Eldrazi. Now Gideon searches the Multiverse for allies to help him save Zendikar from being consumed.
