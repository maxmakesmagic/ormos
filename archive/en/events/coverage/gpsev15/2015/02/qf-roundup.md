After 15 rounds of Swiss, 8 players had come out on top. I staked out the feature math area to witness all of the quarterfinal matches.



**Nicholas Merrien [Abzan Midrange] vs Alexandre Habert [Sidisi-Whip]**

Game 1 started out with a lot of one-for-one trades as black removal spells flying left and right. Eventually, cards started to stick on board, with [Courser of Kruphix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Courser+of+Kruphix) and [Sorin, Solemn Visitor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sorin%2C+Solemn+Visitor) on Merrien's side and [Sidisi, Brood Tyrant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sidisi%2C+Brood+Tyrant) on Habert's side. The game got long and grindy. If one of the players would draw [Whip of Erebos](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Whip+of+Erebos), then that would probably give them enough of an advantage to pull ahead. Surprisingly enough, despite playing only a single copy as opposed to Habert's three, Merrien was the first one to find the legendary enchantment. Reanimating [Siege Rhino](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Siege+Rhino)s trumped anything that Habert could do, and the first game went tot Merrien.



Game 2 went by a lot faster. Merrien curved [Fleecemane Lion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fleecemane+Lion) into [Anafenza, the Foremost](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Anafenza%2C+the+Foremost); [Siege Rhino](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Siege+Rhino); and [Tasigur, the Golden Fang](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tasigur%2C+the+Golden+Fang). He then followed it up by two copies of [Hero's Downfall](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hero%27s+Downfall). "Whoa, you got everything," Habert remarked before extending his hand in defeat.

**(19) Martin Juza [Jeskai] vs Pierre Sommen [Abzan Aggro]**


**![](https://media.wizards.com/2015/events/gpsev15/qf_sommen-juza.jpg)**



In Game 1, Juza had a pair of mulligans and was on the back foot from the get-go. He tried his best, with [Valorous Stance](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Valorous+Stance) trading for [Siege Rhino](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Siege+Rhino) at an efficient mana point and [Treasure Cruise](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treasure+Cruise) compensating for his mulligans, but at that point it was already too late. As it turned out, [Siege Rhino](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Siege+Rhino) came out ahead on [Mantis Rider](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mantis+Rider).



In Game 2, Sommen had [Thoughtseize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtseize) and [Hero's Downfall](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hero%27s+Downfall) to deal with Juza's early creatures. Juza then transitioned into a late-game plan as he pointed his burn spells at Sommen's creatures rather than his opponent's life total. However, despite having [Treasure Cruise](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treasure+Cruise) to refill his hand, Juza lacked the right answers to the questions Pierre was asking. Two copies of [Rakshasa Deathdealer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rakshasa+Deathdealer) turned out to be particularly hard to deal with, and [Glare of Heresy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glare+of+Heresy) was exceptionally useless. Without the right answers, Juza tried to go for a damage race with [Goblin Rabblemaster](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Rabblemaster). However, it was not to be. Sommen showed the power of [Rakshasa Deathdealer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rakshasa+Deathdealer) in the late game and won the damage race.

**Marcos Cordero Valle [Blue/White Heroic] vs Carlos Ballester Garcia [Green/red Devotion]**


**![](https://media.wizards.com/2015/events/gpsev15/qf_ballestergarcia-corderovalle.jpg)**



Game 1 started with both players keeping relatively risky hands because both knew that their opponent was not playing [Hero's Downfall](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hero%27s+Downfall) or [Bile Blight](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bile+Blight). Ballester Garcia kept a one-lander with [Elvish Mystic](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elvish+Mystic), while Cordero Valle kept a creature-light draw with lots of heroic enablers. After setting up in the early turns, the game played out as a rather close damage race between [Stormbreath Dragon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stormbreath+Dragon) and a huge, unblockable [Battlewise Hoplite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Battlewise+Hoplite). Mainly thanks to Aqeous Form, the first game went to Cordero Valle.



Game 2 featured another risky keep, but this time it was not to be. Cordero Valle kept a one-lander with Mana [Confluence](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Confluence), [Favored Hoplite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Favored+Hoplite), and [Aqueous Form](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aqueous+Form), but Ballester Garcia had the perfect card in [Lightning Strike](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Strike) to stop it. Ballester Garcia then proceeded to pummel his land-light opponent with [Whisperwood Elemental](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Whisperwood+Elemental).



Game 3 started with a stare-down. Cordero Valle had a bunch of heroic creatures in hand, but declined to play them into Ballester Garcia's open mana because he was unwilling to give his opponent a good opportunity to play [Wild Slash](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Slash) or [Lightning Strike](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Strike). Eventually he had to go for it, and he indeed lost his [Favored Hoplite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Favored+Hoplite) to a burn spell. Afterwards, a [Lagonna-Band Trailblazer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lagonna-Band+Trailblazer) stuck around and started to grow bigger. However, Cordero Valle was missing [Aqueous Form](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aqueous+Form), and this become pivotal when Ballester Garcia cast Hornet queen. The heroic creatures were no match for the swarm of bees, and Ballester Garcia was through to the semis.

**Immanuel Gerschenson [Blue/Black Control] vs Marco Carvalho [Green Devotion]**


**![](https://media.wizards.com/2015/events/gpsev15/qf_carvalho-gerschenson.jpg)**



In Game 1, Carvalho had to mulligan down to five cards: 4 lands and [Elvish Mystic](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elvish+Mystic). He made a real game out of it with [Genesis Hydra](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Genesis+Hydra), but Gerschenson had enough creature removal and counterspells to keep up. Eventually, Gerschenson chained [Dig Through Time](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dig+Through+Time) into [Perilous Vault](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Perilous+Vault) and [Ugin, the Spirit Dragon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ugin%2C+the+Spirit+Dragon), and the game was over.



In Game 2, Carvalho got to be on the play and was able to ramp into [Polukranos, World Eater](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Polukranos%2C+World+Eater) and [Genesis Hydra](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Genesis+Hydra). Meanwhile, Gerschenson had mulliganed down to a slow five-card hand and was unable to mount a defense.



In Game 3, Gerschenson had turn-3 Ashiok, [Nightmare](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nightmare) Weaver. It went up to five loyalty, then seven, and then there was a [Hornet Queen](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hornet+Queen) on the blue-black player's side of the board. Carvalho was quickly defeated by his own card.
