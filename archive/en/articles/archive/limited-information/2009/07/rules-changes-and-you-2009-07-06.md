Yesterday, the front page featured Tim Willoughby's [***Magic** 2010* Prerelease Primer](/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/feature/46). Even if you have been to a bunch of tournaments before, I would recommend reading Tim's article. In addition to a general overview of the Prerelease experience, he approaches the rules changes from a very clear, fundamentally sound way, which is something that we can all benefit from.
