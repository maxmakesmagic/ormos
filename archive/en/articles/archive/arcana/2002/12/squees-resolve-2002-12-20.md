![heros resolve](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=heros+resolve)The art from the *Tempest* white card [Hero's Resolve](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hero%27s+Resolve) depicts Gerrard and Orim on the deck of the *Weatherlight*, facing down some carrionettes from the Death Pits of Rath. But the full art includes another character.Even though he was cropped off the card, Squee was in Pete Venter's original painting, cowering between Gerrard's legs. Even though the art in our internal database is the cropped version, we can still show you the version with Squee, from the Tempest storyboard article that appeared in *Duelist* #20.
