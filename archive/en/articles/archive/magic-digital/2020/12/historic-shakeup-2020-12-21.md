Shake up your Historic experience with the aptly named Historic Shakeup event, where we ban some of the format's most played cards to give other sweet cards their turn to shine! In addition to the cards normally banned in Historic, we've banned a handful of other cards to mix things up. Here's the full list of cards banned in Historic Shakeup.


Happy brewing!
