The [color-counting djinns](http://gatherer.wizards.com/default.asp?first=1&last=100&term=djinn&Field_Type=on&setfilter=InvasionBlock&colorfilter=All&typefilter=All&output=summary&sort=color&x=24&y=29) from *Invasion* were based on creatures designed for the never-printed *Unglued 2*. This cycle of *Unglued 2* djinns were a bit of templating away from being ready for print -- they already had punny djinn names, art by Edward P. Beard, Jr., and in some cases flavor text! In honor of *Invasion* Week, today we present the full text and art of these proto-*Invasion* cards. (Click each djinn's card name to see the *Invasion* card it inspired.)
