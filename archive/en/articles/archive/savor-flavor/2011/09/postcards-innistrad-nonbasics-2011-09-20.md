Postcards from Innistrad: The Nonbasics
=======================================



 Posted in **Savor The Flavor**

Sure, lands, whatever. You play one of them per turn. You turn them sideways, and you get some mana, and then you cast the cards you're *really* interested in.

Boo, I say. *Bewww*.

LANDS: UNDERAPPRECIATED.

For the Creative Team, lands are an indispensible visual journey through our currently visited plane. They're the "here" that we "wish you were." That's why we're going to take some time today and visit the locales of Innistrad as travelers.

Now, you might not think of Innistrad as that great for tourists. I mean, they have roadside shrines *every few miles* so that you can *re-bathe* yourself in the blessings of a divine archangel, so that the thirty-seven types of extant supernatural abomination don't all immediately throw the rock-paper-scissors to see which of them gets to *claw out your trachea*.

But thanks to the efforts of our freaking talented artists, Innistrad is candy for the eyeballs. Once you see some of these postcards, you too will wish you were here. Today we'll focus on the nonbasic lands of *Innistrad*. Sometime soon we'll hit the beautiful basics as well.

That's all the nonbasic lands in *Innistrad*, so that's all the locales I'll visit this week. Tune in for the second half of this article in a few weeks, where I'll explore the significance—and show off the pretty art—of *Innistrad's* basic lands too. There are definitely some secrets that aren't obvious from the art of those innocuous-looking basics.

Have a great time at the *Innistrad* prerelease, folks (click the big ol' banner directly below the Letter of the Week for information about the prerelease). Next week: A new entry in the [Planeswalker's Guide to Innistrad](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/magazine/article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/stf/157)!

Today's letter... yeah, I don't know. Maybe this means something to you guys. Weirdest spam I ever got.
