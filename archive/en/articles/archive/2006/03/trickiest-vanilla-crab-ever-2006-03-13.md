The Trickiest Vanilla Crab Ever

For a time during the creation of *Legions*, blue had this vanilla creature in its list of commons:



> 
> [Crag Crab]  
> 
> 5U  
> 
> Creature - Beast  
> 
> 4/4
> 
> 
> 


It was argued inside R&D that even at ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20170413132456im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless5.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161115194122im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/blue.gif), a drawback-free 4/4 was out of flavor for blue for a common card. To rectify this, it lost a point of power and had its mana cost shaved:



> 
> [Crag Crab]  
> 
> 4U  
> 
> Creature - Beast  
> 
> 3/4
> 
> 
> 


After further swapping went on in the set, there was no longer space in *Legions* for [Crag Crab]. But the art had already been commissioned from Ron Spencer:

However, there was room in the set for a new blue *rare* creature. The following creature was proposed, with a tricky morph trigger ability:



> 
> [Bristleback Urchin]  
> 
> 4U  
> 
> Creature - Beast  
> 
> Morph 4U  
> 
> When CARDNAME is turned face up, exchange control of target creature you control and target creature an opponent controls.  
> 
> 3/3
> 
> 
> 


The art from the defunct [Crag Crab] was swapped onto this new creature. It went through a few more revisions -- a "you may" was added to the morph trigger, and the name was finalized -- and it became this card.

**[Chromeshell Crab](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chromeshell+Crab)** -- which combines the creature-swapping abilities of [Phyrexian Infiltrator](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phyrexian+Infiltrator) with the surprise factor of morph -- started out as a vanilla 4/4 and ended up as one of the trickiest blue creatures in the game.
