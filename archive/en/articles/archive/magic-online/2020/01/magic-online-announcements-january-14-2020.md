*Vintage Cube* until January 16
-------------------------------


The *Vintage Cube* is back and will run until January 16! Tabletop Studio's (R&D) Reggie Valk has this to say about the latest update:


*"As December rolls on,* Magic Online *players know what's coming:* Vintage Cube*. If you're unfamiliar,* Vintage Cube *is one of the most powerful cubes you can play, headlined by the Power Nine and other members of the Vintage reserved list. While considering how to update the Cube for this year's December iteration, I decided that this update wasn't going to attempt any major overhauls, just include some of the most powerful cards to be printed this year. Fortunately, there were quite a few!* War of the Spark *brought powerful new planeswalkers that have made a splash even in Vintage, and* Modern Horizons *and* Throne of Eldraine *were no slouches either. Still, the core of the Cube experience remains the same: there's Tinker-fueled artifact decks, Storm combo, and blistering fast mono-red aggro to name a few. Happy cubing! Here's hoping you all get to open a Black Lotus!"*

Banned & Restricted List Update Window
--------------------------------------


On Monday, January 13, R&D made an announcement regarding the banned and restricted list for Modern. *Magic Online* will implement the change at 12 p.m. PT today, a day after the announcement.


While we will no longer ban cards on the Monday of the announcement, the results of a B&R change are the same as they have been: When a card is banned or restricted, players using the newly banned card in a league have until the *Magic Online* effective time to finish their league courses. At that time, any remaining players with newly illegal decks will be removed from the league with their entry option returned to their collection. If a card is unbanned or unrestricted, players can join existing leagues with decks containing those cards after the update.
