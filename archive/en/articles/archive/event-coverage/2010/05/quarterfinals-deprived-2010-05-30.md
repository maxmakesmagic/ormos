### Guillaume Matignon vs. Brad Nelson


It was a battle of masters in the Quarterfinals at Pro Tour–San Juan. ***Magic*** Online titan and part-time mountain man Brad Nelson, fresh off his win at Grand Prix–Washington, faced down Guillaume Matignon, a man who's a fresh face in ***Magic*** but who has won major events in other TCGs.


As Nelson sat down for deck construction, the first words out of his mouth were, "Well, we're making a quick exit here," laughing as he said it. Early in pack 1 he had negotiated himself to a solid red base, but none of the cards coming to him contributed to a game plan he liked. As a result, he wound with a deck based around Eldrazi Spawn that capitalizes on them with [Raid Bombardment](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Raid+Bombardment)s and [Lavafume Invoker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lavafume+Invoker)s. He was far from happy and gave the quote of the tournament: "If I win the PT with this deck, I'm going out and buying a pimp cane."


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/ptsj10/qf3_matignon_nelson.jpg)*Brad Nelson, right, expects a quick exit based on his draft, but Guillaume Matignon doesn't get cocky.*
Matignon, on the other hand, was very pleased with how his draft had gone, and while he shied away from calling his deck anything more than "good," his blue-black deck with levelers, [Venerated Teacher](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Venerated+Teacher)s, and [Training Grounds](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Training+Grounds) looks like a beating.


### Game 1


Matignon chose to play and led out with [Skywatcher Adept](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skywatcher+Adept) and [Lighthouse Chronologist](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lighthouse+Chronologist). After Nelson made an [Overgrown Battlement](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Overgrown+Battlement), Matignon dropped [Venerated Teacher](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Venerated+Teacher) and flew over for two with the Adept. Nelson untapped and tapped three, but it wasn't for [Staggershock](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Staggershock). He cast [Lavafume Invoker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lavafume+Invoker) and passed. Matignon [Vendetta](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vendetta)'d the Wall, put the Adept to max level, and swung in for 7. Nelson declined to block and dropped to 10.


Nelson made a [Prophetic Prism](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Prophetic+Prism) and traded his Invoker for the Teacher on Matignon's next attack, falling to just 5 life. Matignon passed his turn without tapping his blue mana to level his Chronologist, a sure sign of what was to come. Nelson frowned and tapped out for [Emrakul's Hatcher](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Emrakul%27s+Hatcher), and Matignon showed him the [Deprive](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deprive) to send them to Game 2.

### Game 2


Nelson chose to draw for the next game. Matignon opened with [Training Grounds](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Training+Grounds) and [Champion's Drake](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Champion%27s+Drake), needing only a leveler to get things going. Nelson played out his lands and waited. Turn three for Matignon brought an unexciting [Venerated Teacher](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Venerated+Teacher). Nelson still had no play.


Matignon got in for 3 and cast a second Teacher. Nelson made no move on his four lands. Matignon's attack put him at 11, and Matignon passed the turn with no play. Nelson finally got out [Emrakul's Hatcher](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Emrakul%27s+Hatcher), gumming up the ground. Matignon flew over and cast [Zof Shade](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Zof+Shade), an absolute beating with [Training Grounds](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Training+Grounds).


Nelson though for a moment, then swung in with his Hatcher. Matignon obliged him by doubling up with his Teachers, and Nelson cast [Staggershock](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Staggershock), setting up the three-for-one. Matignon attacked with [Zof Shade](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Zof+Shade) and [Champion's Drake](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Champion%27s+Drake), and one of the Spawn distracted the Shade.


Matignon was still stuck with just four land in play. Nelson's [Staggershock](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Staggershock) finished its work by taking out the Drake, and he played [Dread Drone](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dread+Drone). Matignon's [Zof Shade](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Zof+Shade) ate a Spawn, and another fell to [Bala Ged Scorpion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bala+Ged+Scorpion). Matignon had three cards in hand.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/ptsj10/qf3_nelson.jpg)*It's hard out there for Brad Nelson.*


Nelson played land number eight, then cast [Valakut Fireboar](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Valakut+Fireboar) and [Brood Birthing](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brood+Birthing), going up to five Spawn on the battlefield. Matignon had a second Scorpion to kill the Fireboar and his Shade kept up its work. Nelson needed more offense but had only an [Overgrown Battlement](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Overgrown+Battlement).


Matignon played [Guul Draz Assassin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Guul+Draz+Assassin), quickly leveling it twice. Nelson had [Forked Bolt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forked+Bolt) to get rid of it on his turn, and not a moment too soon. [See Beyond](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=See+Beyond) gave Matignon another [Swamp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swamp).


Nelson frowned in thought, eventually playing [Lavafume Invoker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lavafume+Invoker) and [Raid Bombardment](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Raid+Bombardment), with just two Spawn left on the battlefield. One of them dove in front of the Shade, and [Vendetta](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vendetta) took care of the Invoker. Nelson had more goods coming, though, and tapped eight for [Ulamog's Crusher](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ulamog%27s+Crusher). Unfortunately for him, Matignon's shortness on land meant he was long on action, and [Narcolepsy](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Narcolepsy) put the Crusher to bed.


[Skittering Invasion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skittering+Invasion) from Nelson wasn't quite what he wanted, and Matignon laughed that it was taking too long to battle through his 0/1s. His deck must've heard him, because his next play was [Frostwind Invoker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Frostwind+Invoker). Combined with the Shade and [Training Grounds](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Training+Grounds), it was well into lethal damage. Nelson had [Essence Feed](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Essence+Feed), but it wasn't enough.

### Game 3


Nelson put Matignon on the play for Game 3. He watched as Matignon played [Null Champion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Null+Champion) on turn two, then [Training Grounds](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Training+Grounds) on turn three, powering it up to level 2 and hitting for 4. Nelson took for then got rid of it with [Heat Ray](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Heat+Ray). Matignon played [See Beyond](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=See+Beyond) and [Champion's Drake](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Champion%27s+Drake). Nelson went up to five land with [Ondu Giant](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ondu+Giant).


Matignon hit for 1 in the air and then played [Zulaport Enforcer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Zulaport+Enforcer), levelling it once and threatening big damage the following turn. Nelson played [Kozilek's Predator](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kozilek%27s+Predator) and passed, but responded to the Enforcer moving towards level three with a [Staggershock](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Staggershock) on the Drake. The Enforcer brought him down to 11.


Nelson played a [Lavafume Invoker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lavafume+Invoker) and passed with seven lands on the board. Matignon had [Induce Despair](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Induce+Despair) (showing [Bala Ged Scorpion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bala+Ged+Scorpion)) to be rid of it, and the Enforcer took Nelson down to 5. Nelson's monsters brought Matignon to 6, and then [Essence Feed](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Essence+Feed) drained him to 3, putting Nelson out of the range of the Enforcer.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/ptsj10/qf3_matignon.jpg)*What's in my hand? I have it. It's a Deprive for that spell you cast.*
Matignon drew and attacked. He cast [Cadaver Imp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cadaver+Imp) and left two [Island](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island)s untapped. Nelson, asked "You have a [Deprive](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deprive)?" Matignon flashed it. Nelson took a look at his top card, revealing it and the card in hand as lands, then offered his hand in concession.


Guillaume Matignon defeats Brad Nelson 3-0 and advances to the Semifinals!
