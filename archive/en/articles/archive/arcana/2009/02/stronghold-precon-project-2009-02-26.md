Would you like to make an official **Magic** preconstructed deck? Here's the deal: *Stronghold* is going to hit **Magic Online**. And we need *you* to make two of the precon decks!

But here's the catch: you can't do it here. Because "here" is the official **Magic: The Gathering** home. We're too stuffy and corporate in our top hats and monocles. There are two places you can go, with two different challenges.

### PureMTGO.com

[Build and name a *Stronghold* Pauper Deck](http://puremtgo.com/articles/stronghold-precon-project-build-and-name-pauper-theme-deck) at PureMTGO.com. That's two different challenges, really, since there are separate prizes for name and decklist. There are specific rules, but we'd like you to go to PureMTGO and read them there. All you have to know is: *Stronghold* Pauper deck!

### Classic Quarter

[Build and name a *Stronghold* competitive (but fun) deck at ClassicQuarter.com](http://www.classicquarter.com/StrongholdPP.asp). And it has to include [Volrath's Laboratory](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Volrath%27s+Laboratory). Again, for timeline and deck restrictions, head over to Classic Quarter and then start creating!
