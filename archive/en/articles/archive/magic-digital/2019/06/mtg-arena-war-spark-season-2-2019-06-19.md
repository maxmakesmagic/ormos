QUALIFICATION PERIODS
---------------------

If you are within the Top 1000 in either Constructed or Limited at the end of these periods, you will be eligible to participate in the Mythic Qualifier Weekend for Mythic Championship V. If you reach that level in both Constructed and Limited and/or you do so in both Season 1 and Season 2 you will only receive one token to participate.


For more information on qualifying for Mythic Championships, please refer to our [Mythic Championship Qualifiers](https://magic.wizards.com/en/content/esports/mythicchampionshipqualifiers) page.
