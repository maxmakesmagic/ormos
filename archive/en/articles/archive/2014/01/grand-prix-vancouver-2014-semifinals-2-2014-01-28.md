GRAND PRIX VANCOUVER 2014 - SEMIFINALS 2
========================================



 Posted in [NEWS](/en/articles)
 on January 29, 2014 










As No. 18 Alexander Hayne walked into the feature match area, No. 25 Jon Stern held his hand up for the high five and yelled "Free flight to Atlanta!" Hayne smiled wide and slapped his friend's hand. These two friends, both representing Face to Face Games here.


Both these players currently have the leaf of Canada up on the world **Magic** leaderboard, and are likely going to further inch up after these great performances. Though only one of them can make it to the final, both of them seemed fine if it were the other. They just wanted to play some good games.


### Game One


Though Jon Stern's turn-two [Pack Rat](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pack+Rat) hit a [Syncopate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Syncopate) from Alex Hayne, Stern was able to land a third-turn [Underworld Connections](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Underworld+Connections). This was a huge win for the Mono-Black Devotion deck. The deck had to go card-for-card with the Azorius Control deck, which was a hard thing to do when the other deck plays four copies of [Sphinx's Revelation](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sphinx%27s+Revelation) and you do not.


Potential fist-pump number two came when a [Thoughtseize](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtseize) bagged an [Elspeth, Sun's Champion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elspeth%2C+Sun%27s+Champion). Though Hayne was eventually able to use [Detention Sphere](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Detention+Sphere) to take out two concurrent [Underworld Connections](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Underworld+Connections), it was not before Stern was out-drawing Hayne at least 2-to-1. This was an abysmal game-one match-up for Stern, but he was holding his own.

*Alexander Hayne and Jon Stern*

Stern's damage engine was a [Whip of Erebos](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Whip+of+Erebos) and two [Mutavault](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mutavault). This made things difficult for Hayne, and also explained how the totals could be 10-20 in Stern's favor, even though he was constantly damaging himself to draw cards and the like.


Hayne was down to one card—the mulligan had hurt him greatly. On the turn he needed to, he resolved his first [Sphinx's Revelation](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sphinx%27s+Revelation) to make the totals 10-24 and drew five fresh new cards. But the [Mutavault](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mutavault)s were relentless, and Hayne didn't seem to have a way to stop them. Pretty soon it was 6-27, then 2-29.


But then the big-daddy [Sphinx's Revelation](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sphinx%27s+Revelation) happened. Once X on the card was bigger than "6" it becomes really hard to stop Azorius Control, despite the actual life totals. Hayne resolved an [Elspeth, Sun's Champion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elspeth%2C+Sun%27s+Champion), made three blockers, and Hayne was sitting much better. You know a control player is doing well when he says this phrase: "Move to my discard phase."


Jon Stern went into the tank. He cast a pre-combat [Desecration Demon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Desecration+Demon), the eventually sent both [Mutavault](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mutavault)s in. It was 8-27, but the game would quickly spiral upwards, out of his control. The tokens took out a [Mutavault](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mutavault) and maintained Hayne's life total at 8—that giant demon loomed large in the background.


But Hayne had stabilized. This could be short-lived, however. The over thirty life for Stern meant he could just keep drawing cards until the cows came home. He could do exactly what he wanted to do in this match-up—go card-for-card.


Peeking at his hand for all the cards he had drawn, a lot of them were land. In fact, Stern had drawn seventeen of his twenty-six land. And when a [Dissolve](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dissolve) took out Stern's [Pack Rat](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pack+Rat), he was left with only Swamps in his hand. Countering that [Pack Rat](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pack+Rat) was very important for Hayne. He had no way of knowing how many [Gray Merchant of Asphodel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gray+Merchant+of+Asphodel) were in Stern's hand. And with the [Whip of Erebos](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Whip+of+Erebos) in play, there were some odd shenanigans that could ensue, discarding to the [Pack Rat](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pack+Rat) than reanimating.


It was about this time Hayne got an [Elspeth, Sun's Champion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elspeth%2C+Sun%27s+Champion) ultimate emblem. I think an emblem like that should stick with you your whole life, not just the remainder of the game.

A few turns later, when [Thoughtseize](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtseize) revealed three [Supreme Verdict](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Supreme+Verdict)s, an [Ætherling](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=%C3%86therling), a [Last Breath](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Last+Breath), and a [Syncopate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Syncopate), Stern had to assess his line of plays that could win this game. There weren't many. Although Hayne drawing twenty land in a row could be one of them. With a hand like that, nothing really scared Hayne; he had weathered all four [Underworld Connections](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Underworld+Connections), he'd stopped the [Whip of Erebos](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Whip+of+Erebos) reanimating, and Stern had no cards in his hand.


"Now all I have to do is kill you," Hayne joked.


"It shouldn't be hard," Stern said.


"Yeah, but it's going to be long," Hayne opined.


Eventually, after a bunch of turns, Stern packed it in. "Give me back my [Underworld Connections](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Underworld+Connections)." He continued, "It's funny; if that were a Swiss match I would have conceded 40 minutes ago."


Thanks, Jon. Thanks. Forty-five minutes into the match:


### Alexander Hayne 1 – 0 Jon Stern


While Stern was in the bathroom, Hayne said to me, "I really hope for another game like that. Jon's too old to handle it." Hayne laughed at his dagger.


### Game Two


When Jon Stern started off with a [Lifebane Zombie](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lifebane+Zombie) and [Nightveil Specter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nightveil+Specter), Hayne quipped, "Going aggro." Of course, the aggressive streak was not long for this world, as a [Syncopate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Syncopate) hit the Zombie, and a [Dark Betrayal](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dark+Betrayal) took out next turn's [Nightveil Specter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nightveil+Specter). However, Alex Hayne did not answer Jon Stern's turn-five [Pack Rat](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pack+Rat), and with the aid of a discard and a [Mutavault](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mutavault), it took out a [Jace, Architect of Thought](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace%2C+Architect+of+Thought) and stung Hayne for three.


[![](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Sphinx%27s+Revelation)](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sphinx%27s+Revelation)
Hayne calmly untapped and made an [Elspeth, Sun's Champion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elspeth%2C+Sun%27s+Champion) with three accompanying tokens. The totals at 13-18, it was a pretty comfortable score for the six-cost 'walker. On the next defense, Hayne conservatively only used one Soldier token to block, anticipating a Hero's Downfall to kill Elspeth. His supposition was right. After sinking to 10 in combat, Stern sent the Elspeth packing. Hayne had no plays his next turn, and used his remaining tokens to chump block two of the 4/4 [Pack Rat](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pack+Rat)s. Hayne went to 4.


A [Sphinx's Revelation](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sphinx%27s+Revelation) at the end of the turn made the totals 8-17, and gave Hayne four extra chances to pull himself out of this. Aside from the three [Pack Rat](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pack+Rat)s, there were two [Mutavault](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mutavault), and the ever-present threat of [Gray Merchant of Asphodel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gray+Merchant+of+Asphodel), so even a [Supreme Verdict](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Supreme+Verdict) on its own wasn't completely sufficient. The wrath variant did in fact come down and he killed both [Mutavault](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mutavault)s on the next combat with a creature land of his own and a [Last Breath](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Last+Breath). Hayne staved off death for now.


As far as I'm concerned, the turn the Hayne pulled ahead for good was when he activated his [Jace, Architect of Thought](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace%2C+Architect+of+Thought) and flipped over [Sphinx's Revelation](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sphinx%27s+Revelation), [Sphinx's Revelation](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sphinx%27s+Revelation), and [Dissolve](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dissolve). Both Hayne and Stern actually chuckled a little to themselves. Hayne took both Revelations. It was a good turn. Neither player had a board, but Stern had two cards and Hayne had nine. All things considered, I would've been pretty happy to be in Hayne's shoes.


You know, there's an inevitable time when Azorius Control is winning. It's the time when the life totals leader swaps. The whole game Azorius is behind, and then magically, it isn't anymore. Somewhere around the time Hayne cast a [Sphinx's Revelation](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sphinx%27s+Revelation) for six cards and an [Elspeth, Sun's Champion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elspeth%2C+Sun%27s+Champion), Hayne went to 19 life and Stern was at 17. That generally signals the end.


This time was no different.


### Alex Hayne 2 – 0 Jon Stern
