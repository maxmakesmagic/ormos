Both these players are accomplished pro’s looking to add another GP top 8 in their resume. Bram is playing White Weenie splashing blue for [Quiet Speculation](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Quiet+Speculation) and [Circular Logic](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Circular+Logic) and Wilfried is playing a Blue Green Madness deck.  
 They need a win to make top 8 as they’re on 10-2-1 coming into this round.

### Game 1

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gplon02/905.jpg)Bram won the die roll and played first and kept. Wilfried mulliganed twice but got a [Careful Study](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Careful+Study), an [Aquamoeba](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aquamoeba) and an [Arrogant Wurm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arrogant+Wurm) with a Forest and an Island which he played in the first three turns. Bram had a [Patrol Hound](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Patrol+Hound) and a Chaplain to go with his Sacrament while Wilfried’s double mulligan started to show as he couldn’t get his creatures through.

A [Quiet Speculation](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Quiet+Speculation) for [Prismatic Strands](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Prismatic+Strands), [Deep Analysis](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deep+Analysis) and [Battle Screech](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Battle+Screech) put Wilfried even further behind. The only thing keeping him in the game was the fact that Bram couldn’t find a fourth land to cast the Screech in his hand.  
 Ranque, in the meanwhile, drew all lands after his explosive start and when Bram found a fourth mana source six bird tokens quickly did him in.

Bram brought in [Vengeful Dreams](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vengeful+Dreams) and some additional [Prismatic Strands](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Prismatic+Strands). Ranque sideboarded 3 [Psionic Gift](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psionic+Gift), 1 [Howling Gale](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Howling+Gale), 1 [Ray of Revelation](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ray+of+Revelation) and 1 Alter Reailty taking out his worthless Rootwalla’s.

### Game 2

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gplon02/906.jpg) Ranque played first in the second game and kept a hand with two Careful Studies and not much else. He played both on the first two turns and failed to find a single creature while Snepvangers skillfully drew a Plains and an Expanse to go with his all island draw to enable a turn 2 [Spurnmage Advocate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spurnmage+Advocate) and a [Divine Sacrament](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Divine+Sacrament).   
 Ranque showed off some of his sideboard tech, an [Alter Reality](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Alter+Reality) rendering a Sacrament useless and a [Howling Gale](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Howling+Gale) taking out 4 Bird tokens.

Wilfried then drew a Mongrel and stabilized a little as Bram continued to drew nothing much but a bunch of 1/1s. One of them was another [Spurnmage Advocate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spurnmage+Advocate) however and a [Glory](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glory) showed up soon after to protect them, making it very hard for Wilfired to actually win. Two Coliseums give Wilfried an [Arrogant Wurm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arrogant+Wurm) and two Roars to give him some creatures to work with. More importantly though, it gave him 3 [Aether Burst](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aether+Burst)s and a [Psionic Gift](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psionic+Gift) to help him get the Advocates off the table despite the [Glory](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glory) in Snepvangers’ graveyard.

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gplon02/907.jpg) When Ranque activated his Gifted creature Bram activated his [Glory](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glory) so Wilfried untapped and [Aether Burst](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aether+Burst)ed Bram’s board. Bram played [Prismatic Strands](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Prismatic+Strands). Next turn Bram caught Wilfried off guard with a [Vengeful Dreams](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vengeful+Dreams) for 4 decimating his board.

Nevertheless Bram conceded as the [Alter Reality](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Alter+Reality) in Wilfried’s graveyard prevented him from getting his creatures large enough to protect them from [Psionic Gift](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psionic+Gift).

### Game 3

Ranque had to mulligan again and, obviously disgusted by his deck, decided to keep a one Coliseum hand. He drew an Island on turn two but no green sources and a [Quiet Speculation](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Quiet+Speculation) for three [Battle Screech](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Battle+Screech)es looked to finish his top 8 dreams in a hurry. Bram didn’t have a third creature right away though but when he played a [Glory](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glory) on turn 5 with Wilfried still stuck at two lands, the Frenchman extended the hand.

Match to Bram Snepvangers (2-1) who advances to the top 8.
