Day 2 Coverage



Autumn Burchett left more than a mark on the 2017 English National Championships. She scorched all opposition away on the way to an unbeaten 14-0-1 record, with the '1' coming from an intentional draw in the twelfth round in order to guarantee being top seed in the Top 8. Ross Broxup tried his best to stop her 4-Color Energy deck in the final, but a mulligan to four in the deciding game left him without enough resources to keep up. At least he can console himself with a place on the national team, joining Burchett and team captain Niels Molle.


Molle came close to the double of team captain and national champion. He was part of an experienced Top 8 that included two former national team members, Peter Ward and Daniel Gardner, and a former Pro Tour quarterfinalist in Quentin Martin.


Unfortunately for Molle, he came up against Burchett in the quarters and nothing was going to deny her glory this weekend. She took down her future team captain, went on to overcome Ward's Zombies in a very tight semifinal, and crushed Broxup's Vehicles in the final to earn the title of English National Champion!
