Patrick "Trick" Jarrett oversees web content and social media for Magic, and acts as the publisher of DailyMTG.com and Magic content on the web. He's an ardent Commander player and lover of the game he's played since Ice Age. 






You might remember watching the **Magic** panel from San Diego Comic-Con when [Felicia Day](http://www.twitter.com/feliciaday) decided to drop by. During her brief visit she announced that [Geek & Sundry](http://www.geekandsundry.com) is launching a new **Magic** show. She also announced [Sean "Day[9]" Plott](http://twitter.com/day9tv) as the host of the show.

Well, the wait is nearly over. It is launching this Wednesday, September 18, 2013, on [the Geek & Sundry YouTube channel](http://www.youtube.com/user/geekandsundry/featured)!

Here's a look at the trailer we were running in our booth at PAX Prime, it's what those in the *biz* call a "sizzle trailer" because it's short and splashy.
