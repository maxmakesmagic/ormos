![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/ptosa02/a855.jpg)This round saw two superheroes do battle at 2-2. On one side was everyone's favorite Superman, Ben Rubin. His patience would be matched by the reckless abandon of Japan's version of The Flash, Katsuhiro Mori. 

Sixteen extra minutes were awarded as Mori had to resleeve his deck, but then things started to happen. The two matched Compulsions, but Mori managed to resolve a [Shadowmage Infiltrator](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shadowmage+Infiltrator). Rubin Madnessed a [Fiery Temper](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fiery+Temper) to kill it. Mori came back with a [Psychatog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psychatog), and when Rubin mustered one of his own and a [Cephalid Looter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cephalid+Looter), Mori sent them packing with [Aether Burst](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aether+Burst).

Still, Rubin was at twenty, in no danger of a quick [Psychatog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psychatog) kill. Mori followed up with another Finkel. Rubin put on his thinking cap. He tried to [Compulsion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Compulsion) away [Violent Eruption](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Violent+Eruption) to stop Jonny Magic, but Mori was ready with Circular Logic. Rubin sighed, then used [Aether Burst](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aether+Burst) to reset Mori's team. Mori replayed Finkel and passed it back.

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/ptosa02/a857.jpg)Rubin brought back his dudes, but Mori had yet another Burst to clear a path for Jon. [Psychatog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psychatog) made another appearance. Rubin tried again to Compulsion away [Fiery Temper](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fiery+Temper), but Mori simply [Compulsion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Compulsion)ed away Circular Logic. Rubin put a [Psychatog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psychatog) in the way, but Mori had [Chainer's Edict](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chainer%27s+Edict) to dispatch it.

The frenetic Mori tried his best to remain calm while Rubin checked graveyards and worked out lines of play. Finally, Rubin drew into [Upheaval](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Upheaval), and made a try at a [Psychatog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psychatog) kill. Mori used his Coliseum, then [Compulsion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Compulsion), but he couldn't find a Logic to stop it. He didn't even wait for Rubin's discard step to scoop.

Rubin 1 - Mori 0

Mori had turn two [Compulsion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Compulsion) in the second game, but no third land. He didn't have to wait long to find one. However, his first two creatures, [Patchwork Gnomes](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Patchwork+Gnomes) and [Shadowmage Infiltrator](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shadowmage+Infiltrator) met removal spells from Rubin. Rubin had meantime found a [Compulsion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Compulsion) of his own.

The two matched card drawers, Mori with [Concentrate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Concentrate), Rubin with [Deep Analysis](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deep+Analysis). Mori got in with another Infiltrator. Rubin removed it with [Violent Eruption](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Violent+Eruption). Next he played [Upheaval](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Upheaval) with two mana floating, stopping a [Circular Logic](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Circular+Logic) with [Divert](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Divert), then playing a land and [Compulsion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Compulsion).

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/ptosa02/a858.jpg)They rebuilt. Both tore through their decks with [Compulsion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Compulsion), refusing to be the first to act. Rubin was going for the throat, though, sending [Fiery Temper](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fiery+Temper)s right at Mori. Mori cracked, and played [Psychatog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psychatog). Rubin showed him a Logic. He tried a second. Rubin had [Chainer's Edict](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chainer%27s+Edict).

And then, the death knell. [Flaming Gambit](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flaming+Gambit) brought Mori to six. Then Rubin asked him to deal with [Psychatog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psychatog). He had to tap out to fight past Rubin's countermagic, leaving him vulnerable to [Upheaval](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Upheaval). When Rubin showed him the second 'Tog, Mori extended the hand.

**Final Result:** Ben Rubin defeats Katsuhiro Mori 2-0
