Ask Wizards is a weekly feature that allows you to ask us questions! If you'd like to submit your question please email it to [AskWizards@wizards.com](mailto:AskWizards@wizards.com).

**Q:** Why wasn't there a catchphrase (à la "Horror lurks within" / "The Grand Compleation is Achieved") for Return to Ravnica ?


-@The\_Hyze


**A:** From **Monty Ashley**, Web Publisher **DailyMTG.com**


Actually, there is! But we didn't include it in [our announcement](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/magazine/article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/arcana/946) because it would have given away the presence of the guilds. We wanted to keep them under wraps a little longer. But no more! So the tagline for *Return to Ravnica* is... 


**Choose Your Guild**


This will tie in to the Prerelease, where each player will choose from the five guilds in *Return to Ravnica* (Azorius, Izzet, Rakdos, Golgari, and Selesnya) and receive a Guild Prerelease Pack (while supplies last) of five *Return to Ravnica* booster packs, a guild-specific booster pack, a special alternate-art Prerelease card unique to each guild, an achievement card, a Spindown life counter, a guild symbol sticker, and a letter from the guild's leader. And for this event, players may use the promo card included with the Guild Prerelease Pack in their tournament decks!
