Both players were undefeated heading into the final round of Day 1 of GP Beijing. Tung-Yi Cheng had been riding a wave of hyper-aggressive creatures and burn, and Gong Yin Mao had piloted a monstrous concoction of creatures to a perfect record. 



 Mao's opening [Elvish Mystic](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elvish+Mystic) was scorched by a [Searing Blood](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Searing+Blood). Cheng followed up with a pair of [Ash Zealot](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ash+Zealot)s, who started pinging away at Mao's life total. Mao summoned a [Reaper of the Wilds](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reaper+of+the+Wilds) and passed. I stood up to try and take a photo, and by the time I had the lens cap off, Cheng had played a flurry of removal, there was an adjustment of life totals, and suddenly a slightly ill-looking Mao was reaching for his sideboard. Length of first game: two minutes, twelve seconds.






*Mao's slightly shellshocked expression is perfectly understandable at this juncture.*
