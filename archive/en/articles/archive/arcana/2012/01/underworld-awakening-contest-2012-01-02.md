There are a lot of Vampires and Werewolves in *Innistrad*. You know what else has both of those things? The *Underworld* movies! Well, it has Lycans instead of Werewolves, but that's close enough. The important part here is that we've got a contest that involves the movie *[Underworld Awakening](http://www.entertheunderworld.com/)*, which will hit movie theatres on January 20, 2012. Here's a trailer!

We've got a little contest that's going to run from January 3, 2012 through January 15, 2012. It's only open to residents of the United States and Canada, except for residents of Quebec. Sorry, Quebec!

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/arcana/876_tablet.jpg)The Grand Prize is a Sony Tablet S (with cradle, screen protector, AC adaptor, and an entertainment bundle), a signed poster from *Underworld Awakening*, 72 *Innistrad* boosters, and a free screening of *Underworld Awakening* for the winner and up to a *hundred* guests!

There may be up to fifty second-place winners, who will each receive six *Innistrad* boosters and a pack of *Underworld Awakening* swag including a T-shirt, a poster, a soundtrack CD, and a ticket to see the movie.
