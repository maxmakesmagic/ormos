Blake is the content manager for DailyMTG.com, making him the one you should email if you have thoughts on the website, good or less good (or not good). He's a longtime coverage reporter and hasn't turned down a game of Magic in any format ever. 






Today kicks off Annihilation Week on DailyMTG.com, in celebration of all the cards that destroy wide swaths of otherwise perfectly good permanents. You can check out the [full list of cards in *From the Vault: Annihilation*](/articles/archive/look-inside-vault-annihilation-2014-08-11), but cards that "destroy all" or "destroy each" are actually even more common throughout *Magic*'s history than you might suspect.



Sure, you know [Wrath of God](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wrath+of+God) and [Armageddon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Armageddon). You know [Upheaval](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Upheaval) and [Rout](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rout). You might have even played with [Cataclysm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cataclysm) and [Living Death](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Living+Death), back in the day. But how well do you know your destructive tendencies?


**How many Planeswalkers say "destroy all" or "destroy each"?**




1. 0
Wrong! Planeswalkers certainly don't mind blowing things up.
2. 1
Nope! You're probably thinking of the one that's Standard legal.
3. 2
Still no!
4. 3
Correct! But can you name them?


**What color do all of these destructive Planeswalkers share?**




1. White
Correct! Two Elspeths plus [Ajani Vengeant](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ajani+Vengeant).
2. Black
Nope! Black can be pretty destructive, but its Planeswalkers tend to like the personal touch (so far).
3. Red
Close, but not quite. [Ajani Vengeant](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ajani+Vengeant) is a bit red, but the others aren't.
4. Green
False! Green tends to blow up all artifacts or enchantments, something that we haven't seen much of on Planeswalkers.


**It's not much of a secret that white has the most "destroy all" or "destroy each" cards (64!). But which color is second? (Multicolor cards count for all colors in the casting cost.)**




1. Blue
HAHAHAHA. I hope you're just clicking on this answer to see what I wrote here. Blue has a paltry six entries in this destructive category. Even [Upheaval](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Upheaval), its representative in *From the Vault: Annihilation*, doesn't actually say "destroy" on it.
2. Black
Correct! But probably not by as much as you think. Black has 47 cards that say "destroy all" or "destroy each."
3. Red
A close second. Well, a close third. Red is way short of white and just short of the actual second place. Red has 43 cards total that say the magic words.
4. Green
Green is pretty good at blowing up enchantments and artifacts, but that doesn't get it too high on this list. Just 35 green cards say destroy all/each.


**Most massively destructive cards tend to be sorceries, but creatures get in on the action as well. Let's see how well you know your destructive creatures.**



**There are two one-mana creatures with the words "destroy all" in their text. Name them!**



Click to reveal.




[Nova Cleric](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nova+Cleric) can be sacrificed to destroy all enchantments and costs just ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227125855im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/white.gif) to summon to the battlefield. [Abu Ja'far](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Abu+Ja%27far) destroys all creatures blocking or blocked by it when it dies.




**Blue has exactly two fairly obscure creatures that say "destroy all" or "destroy each." Can you name them? If you do, you get all of the points (no Gatherer-ing).**

If you guessed [Vodalian War Machine](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vodalian+War+Machine)—which takes all riding Merfolk with it when it dies—and [Hakim, Loreweaver](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hakim%2C+Loreweaver)—which can destroy all Auras attached just to him (useful!)—then you are some kind of powerful wizard who I never want to play Mental *Magic* against.




**That one was tough. Let's make this next one easier. Name the "destroy all" creature printed recently in *Conspiracy*.**



Click to reveal.




[Magister of Worth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Magister+of+Worth) will gladly destroy all other creatures—if the votes go that way.




**Finally, we take a trip back to the beginning of all the destruction for our final question. Alpha was one of the most destructive sets ever and set the tone for destructive cards to come. There were eight cards in Alpha that read "destroy all." Of those, [Wrath of God](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wrath+of+God) and [Armageddon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Armageddon) are in *From the Vault: Annihilation*. What are the other six?**



Click to reveal.




Everyone remembers [Nevinyrral's Disk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nevinyrral%27s+Disk) and [Tranquility](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tranquility). Many will recall [Flashfires](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flashfires) and [Tsunami](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tsunami). A few will pick up on the fact that [Chaos Orb](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chaos+Orb) says "destroy all." But did you get [Siren's Call](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Siren%27s+Call)?



If you did, I have nothing left to teach you.




*From the Vault: Annihilation* comes out Friday, August 22, and Annihilation Week continues all week here on DailyMTG.
