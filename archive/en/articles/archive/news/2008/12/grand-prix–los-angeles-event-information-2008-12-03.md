![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/grandprix/images/NEW_GP.jpg)Bring your shades, shorts and sandals. January in Los Angeles means 68ºF (20ºC) highs and time for **Magic**. The stars will be out, hotter than ever looking for the first invites of the 2009 Grand Prix season. Success means even more heat with Honolulu on the horizon and fat checks to chase away wintertime blues.


The 2009 Grand Prix season kicks off [January 17-18 in Los Angeles](/en/articles/archive/grand-prix%E2%80%93los-angeles-trials-2008-12-19) and showcases the Extended format across two days of exciting tournament action. Like with all Grand Prix, Day 1 is open to all players--no invitation needed! Day 2 features the new 2009 policy on second-day cuts with all players X-2 or better advancing to Sunday.


The Entertainment Capital of the World opens its arms once again to host a stellar weekend of playing with the stars. With invites to Pro Tour–Honolulu on the line you can count on an outrageous weekend of fun, foils, foreign cards, excitement, and dreaming. 


Jody Godard, Sunmesa Events, and Wizards of the Coast invite you to “California Dreaming on a Winter’s Day.”
