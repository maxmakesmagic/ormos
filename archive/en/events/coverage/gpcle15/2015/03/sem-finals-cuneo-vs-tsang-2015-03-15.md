 Stybs has played Magic the world over, writing and drafting as part of the event coverage team and slinging Commander everywhere his decks will fit. 





Bill Tsang was in an enviable spot. By reaching the Top 8 he qualified for Pro Tour *Magic Origins* in Vancouver, Canada. As one lone remaining Canadian of the event his travel partners gave him some good-natured hassle as the match got underway, sharing that Tsang had slept throughout the long drive down. “He was well-rested for this tournament,” one said.



But there was plenty of wear from the challenges he had faced thus far.



The number twenty-one-ranked Andrew Cuneo was looking to win the first Grand Prix of his long career, having found just a finalist slot in Lincoln in 2012. After dispatching the storied and talented Yuuya Watanabe in the quarterfinals in a decisive match, Cuneo looked well-positioned to advance further.



**The Decks**



Tsang’s deck was made to take advantage of the worst opponents could offer. With multiple copies of [Act of Treason](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Act+of+Treason) and [Collateral Damage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Collateral+Damage) to go along with, his aggressive deck topped out with [Icy Blast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Icy+Blast) and other potent removal to cleave a path to victory.



Cuneo’s deck was using similar colors and aggression but leaned on a longer game. With [Warden of the Eye](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Warden+of+the+Eye) to bring back powerhouse cards like [Jeskai Charm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jeskai+Charm) and a surprising Howl of the Horde, Cuneo used evasive creatures and burn into a deadly one-two combo to win games.



**The Games**



Cuneo led off with a morph on turn three, which Tsang wasted no time clearing with Bathe in Dragonfire. [Summit Prowler](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Summit+Prowler) and [Hordeling Outburst](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hordeling+Outburst) gave Tsang a larger presence against Cuneo’s long morph that followed, but with five mana up on Cuneo’s side Tsang used [Singing Bell Strike](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Singing+Bell+Strike) to clear the way.

Mastery of the Unseed gave Cuneo a way to make a blocker anyway, and one Goblin token was eaten. On his next turn, Tsang unleashed the full fury of this deck with [Act of Treason](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Act+of+Treason) into [Icy Blast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Icy+Blast) that left Cuneo without any ways to block. Tsang overran the first game from there.



The second game was a similar race, with [Valley Dasher](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Valley+Dasher) punching in against Cuneo’s Wandering Champion. Creatures traded back and forth after that, but Cuneo’s Watcher of Roost looked to tip the race in his favor.

At least it looked favorable until back-to-back copies of [Act of Treason](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Act+of+Treason) with a [Collateral Damage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Collateral+Damage) in between handily took the game away for Tsang.



“So many Act of Treason,” Cuneo said in surprise. “Good luck in the finals.”



Tsang shook his hand. “Thanks.”



**Bill Tsang defeated Andrew Cuneo, 2-0.**
