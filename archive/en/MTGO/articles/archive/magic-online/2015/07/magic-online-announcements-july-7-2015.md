***Magic Online* *Dragons of Tarkir* Championship Winners**


Even without wings and the ability to breathe fire, over 600 competitors clawed their way through the *Dragons of Tarkir* Championship Qualifiers to try to make it into the Finals.


The final matches came down to SaucyPizza versus littledarwin (who also made Top 8 in the Standard Championship Finals) in the *Dragons of Tarkir* [Limited Championship Finals](http://magic.wizards.com/en/MTGO/articles/archive/magic-online-dragons-tarkir-championship-winners-2015-07-06#limited), and Fastfake and Matter\_Mixer in the *Dragons of Tarkir* [Standard Championship Finals](http://magic.wizards.com/en/MTGO/articles/archive/magic-online-dragons-tarkir-championship-winners-2015-07-06#standard). How did the victors triumph over their competition? Check out the full [article](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/magic-online-dragons-tarkir-championship-winners-2015-07-06) to see how each match unfolded.

**Certain *Magic Online* Updates Delayed**


[Last week](http://magic.wizards.com/en/MTGO/articles/archive/magic-online/magic-online-announcements-june-30-2015#item3), we announced that we'd be rolling out a Collection Performance Upgrade for *Magic Online* with the Wednesday, July 8, downtime. Unfortunately, we've recently discovered that this upgrade needs a little more work before it can launch at a level of quality that the *Magic Online* team is happy with.


Additionally, we planned to implement the Commander rule commonly referred to as the “tuck rule” with the *Magic Origins* release with the July 22 downtime. This rule, which allows a player to put his or her commander in the command zone if it would go the library or hand, is proving more difficult than originally expected to implement. Because of this, the Commander change will not go live at that time.


We'll update players with a new deployment dates for these items as soon as we have them.
