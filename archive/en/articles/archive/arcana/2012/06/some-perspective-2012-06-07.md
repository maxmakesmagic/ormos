[Malignus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Malignus) is one of the Mythic rares in *Avacyn Restored*. But what is it? Well, it's a giant elemental spirit that appears to be pretty unhappy with some villagers. If you check the art closer you'll see he's rolling through a village and laying waste to it.
