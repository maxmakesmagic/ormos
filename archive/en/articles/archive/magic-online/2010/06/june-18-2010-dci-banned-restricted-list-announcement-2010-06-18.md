**Announcement Date:** June 18, 2010   
**Effective Date:** July 1, 2010   
**Magic Online Effective Date**: July 14, 2010 (after the scheduled downtime)

**Magic: The Gathering Tournament Rules Change: Extended**
  
 On July 1, 2010, the following sets will leave the Extended format: *Ninth Edition*, *Mirrodin*, *Darksteel*, *Fifth Dawn*, *Champions of Kamigawa*, *Betrayers of Kamigawa*, *Saviors of Kamigawa*, *Ravnica: City of Guilds*, *Guildpact*, *Dissension*, and *Coldsnap*. From that point forward, the Extended format will include approximately four years of **Magic**  sets instead of seven.

At that time, the following sets will be legal in the Extended format: *Time Spiral*, *Planar Chaos*, *Future Sight*, *Tenth Edition*, *Lorwyn*, *Morningtide*, *Shadowmoor*, *Eventide*, *Shards of Alara*, *Conflux*, *Alara Reborn*, ***Magic**  2010*, *Zendikar*, *Worldwake*, and  *Rise of the Eldrazi*.

 With the upcoming release of *Scars of Mirrodin*, the following sets will leave the Extended format: *Time Spiral*, *Planar Chaos*, *Future Sight*, and *Tenth Edition*. One year's worth of releases will leave Extended with every subsequent fall **Magic**  set.
