Later this month, 24 of the best Magic players of our time will gather in Seattle for the 2015 World Championship. This weekend, four of them decided to take a break from their preparations and to compete in Grand Prix London. Naturally, we wanted to pick their brains with a variety of questions regarding Standard and the upcoming tournament.


First, we asked them whether they considered Blue-Red [Sphinx's Tutelage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sphinx%27s+Tutelage) to be a "real deck." Had they adapted their own deck with this threat in mind?

**2014 World Magic Cup champion Martin Müller:** "It just won a Grand Prix, so of course it's a real deck. But it loses a lot when people know more about it and put cards in their sideboard against it. I think more people should be playing [Annul](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Annul)." [Müller was running two in his sideboard.]

**Pro Tour *Dragons of Tarkir* champion Martin Dang:** "The deck caught everyone by surprise. It's very explosive with the right draws. Tough to play once people know what's going on and have cards to answer it though. I have two [Reclamation Sage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reclamation+Sage) and four [Unravel the Æther](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Unravel+the+%C3%86ther) in the sideboard, which is also good against [Hangarback Walker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hangarback+Walker)."

**2010 Player of the Year Brad Nelson:** "It has to be. It was the breakout Grand Prix of Kibler's green-white deck featuring a ton of [Dromoka's Command](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dromoka%27s+Command) and [Unravel the Æther](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Unravel+the+%C3%86ther). The mill deck dropped one round against that. As much as pros don't like decks that seem gimmicky, you have to take into account numbers like that. Has to be countered with dedicated hate and aggression. I like to take in a whole format before choosing a deck and in the end I went with Green-Red Dragons as a homage to Steve Rubin's Grand Prix Providence Top 8 deck. It's an aggressive Dragons deck with [Draconic Roar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Draconic+Roar) and [Goblin Rabblemaster](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Rabblemaster). The aim is to get as many Dragons into play as I can before they mill me."

*Ondřej Stráský*


**Platinum pro Ondřej Stráský:** "I just played against it [in Round 6]. Standard overall is over-metagamed. The deck might just work if people aren't running the obvious cards like [Thoughtseize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtseize) and [Dromoka's Command](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dromoka%27s+Command). It's certainly interesting. A completely normal real deck. As for what I'm doing against it: I'm already playing four [Dromoka's Command](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dromoka%27s+Command)s. They're good against Mono-Red, good against Thopters. I didn't want to play [Unravel the Æther](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Unravel+the+%C3%86ther), but ended up playing one. I was glad to see the mill deck win the Grand Prix as I was already on Abzan Aggro and it's good to have more good matchups."
