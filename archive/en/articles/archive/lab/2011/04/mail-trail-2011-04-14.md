Hello, and welcome back to the Lab. Please kindly follow me to the Observatory (yeah, I've got all sorts of amazing rooms in my lab) and take a look through my latest invention, the **Magic** Futurescope. This gizmo was designed to (what else) look into **Magic**'s near future. Sorta like an [Infiltration Lens](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Infiltration+Lens), but for **Magic**. Anyway, you know what it told me?

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/ftl/ftl138_theFuture.jpg)  
Not only will *New Phyrexia* be released soon, but ***Magic: The Gathering** Commander* and ***Magic** 2012* will be hot on its heels. I might actually drown in the wealth of creative infinity that's no doubt about to be unlocked. Gotta say though, it's probably about time. Writing this column for as long as I have has basically forever bonded my mind with the **Magic** timeline, and I recognize certain ebbs and flows by now. So this point in time (being on the cusp of whatever wonders exist in those three sets) is sort of the calm before the storm.

I thought to myself, "What sort of column slides right into these 'calm' weeks?" After deliberation, I landed on the ever-popular mailbag column. Not only is it overwhelming proof that I read every single letter sent to me (which I do), but opening the mailblag basically gives me a week-long vacation from deck-building for a week. Win/win! I get some very interesting mail, so I'd say it's time to reveal it to the Johnny world.

While I'm on the subject of mail, I'd like to bring up an unfortunate habit I have: I rarely answer mail. I would love to have the time to do so, but the mere fact that I am a human being and thus have responsibilities here and there means I must devote time to real-life matters. So if I never answered that letter that you begged and pleaded for me to answer, it's never personal.

Alright, that's out of the way. Let's dive in!

### The Mailblag

Of course, the goal of any From the Lab column is to above everything else, provide creative decks. That's goal number one. I like to think I achieve this goal every week. Even with the whole 'mail' gimmick, this week is no different goal-wise.

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/ftl/ftl138_envelope.jpg)  
Last week I received a doozy of a creative deck from Will Cooper, who's broke into this column a couple times before. His letter was well written and thoroughly explainedâ€”general traits of letters that tend to make my column. Also, it's a classic Johnny seven-card combo deck... in Standard.

Intrigued? (You know you are. Brainwashing is great, huh?) Then read further.


> There are those who say that seven-card combos are far too unwieldy to ever win games. There are also those who would say that [Archmage Ascension](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Archmage+Ascension) is basically impossible to make good use of.

Know why this is the first deck to enter your membranes today? Well, I planned it that way. Why? Because Will's email could double as the gold standard. The deck was properly explained and, even better, *properly built.* Will understands the concept of synergy, which is a concept to be mastered for any rogue out-of-the-box deckbuilder.

Another concept that Will understands is building a deck around what I like to call a "Maximum Potential Moment." The seven-card combo above is this deck's MPM. All of my decks have MPMs. The trick is to weave them into your deck while building it to be cohesive, fun, and, dare I say it, playable. Thereby, a successful synergy deck will play with the very essence of Johnny, with the MPM lurking in the beyond as the deck's shining moment.

Next we have an email from Darth Parallax, who often sends me emails that are too insane to print in the column. (Keep 'em up, DP.) A while back, I ran a poll on [Treasure Mage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treasure+Mage), and what the artifacts it can fetch should be called, if [Trinket Mage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Trinket+Mage) finds "cogs." The people spoke (half a tenth of a million people total, by the way!) and voted for "bombs." Darth Parallax was unhappy:


> I must submit this on behalf of Vorthoses. 'Bombs' should not have won the poll. It was clearly chosen by the disproportionate number of Johnnies in your audience. Now, I know, 'From the Lab' is all ABOUT Johnnies, but 'bomb' to a Johnny is just 'any huge thing that wins the game' and could be applied to any Tutors' fetch list. [Trinket Mage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Trinket+Mage) has always fetched cogs because it was so evocative from a Flavor standpoint! A little wizard mechanist, playing with his tinker toys of mass destruction, putting together cogs INTO a bomb. I posit that the original feedback you thought you were getting from your inbox, as you mentioned in the column you linked to, is the appropriate path, and that [Treasure Mage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treasure+Mage) fetches 'gears'. However, I also appreciate a certain kind of flavor in 'Relics' as seen in Zendikar and From the Vault: Relics. it just doesn't seem as Mirrodin-ish as 'gears' though.
> 
> 
> I enjoy a good Johnny Combo as much as the next guy, (see My Infinite Universes of Madness), but when one of my psychographics conflicts with another, I usually tip my hat to Vorthos to make a decision. In fact, I stand by the statement that Infinite Universes of Madness.dec is at least as much Vorthos as Johnny, if not more so.  
>  --Darth Parallax

It's funny. I'm a closet Vorthos as well (don't worry, thoughâ€”Johnny reigns supreme), but I didn't mind that "bombs" had won the poll (since it was your collective decision). And while it'd be pretty cool to have one of these names catch fire like "cogs" did, I realize that people will call their six-mana artifacts whatever they damn please. Still, DP's enthusiasm compels me to ask: Is "bombs" truly right for [Treasure Mage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treasure+Mage)? I won't be holding another poll, but sound off in the forums.

Next, I'm a sucker for those great interactions in **Magic** that just result in something strange. Examples include the ["Fetterball"](http://www.wizards.com/magic/magazine/article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/sf/50) and flipping [Skill Borrower](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skill+Borrower) with Jushi Apprentice on top of your library. Isak Wessman found a cool one:

Okay, can I officially trademark "Do you see it? SPACE Do you see the insanity?" Due to the phrase successfully rocking all your minds during the [Contested War Zone article](/en/articles/archive/lab/no-contest-2011-03-03), I think I could make a million with it. Hey, if Charlie Sheen can trademark "Duh, winning?!" and "Tiger blood," I should be able to do anything I freaking want to. (No Contest, by the way, was actually my second "Geddon Warmer," after the [Lich's Mirror](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lich%27s+Mirror) deck. I've arrived for a while now. I just never like to pump my ego. It gets me all existential.)

Finally, we have a deck from Daniel Haas, who decided that A Little Mercy (the playtest name of [Dissipation Field](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dissipation+Field)) wasn't quite broken enough. My first attempt with the Field resulted in a really interesting Naya-influenced deck (yup) and while that was fun, Daniel's idea was pretty awesome:

> I'd been knocking around [Dissipation Field](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dissipation+Field) in my head for a while, feeling like it was worth playing but unsure how. Then, I noticed that the bouncing was something that I might want... and the wheels began to turn.

> The idea is to give your opponent [Dissipation Field](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dissipation+Field) with either [Bazaar Trader](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bazaar+Trader) or [Puca's Mischief](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Puca%27s+Mischief). Then, suddenly, your [Ball Lightning](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ball+Lightning)s, [Hell's Thunder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hell%27s+Thunder)s, and [Hellspark Elemental](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hellspark+Elemental)s get to come back home when they're done instead of being tossed away! Before you hand over the field, these guys can get tossed in like any aggro deck, but afterwards you get to recur them every turn.

Imagine casting [Deathforge Shaman](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deathforge+Shaman) every turn, or even a lowly [Sparkmage Apprentice](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sparkmage+Apprentice). [Electropotence](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Electropotence) lets your little Hellsparks hit harder. Hedge-Mage clears out blockers.

> I also threw in [Deep-Slumber Titan](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deep-Slumber+Titan) both because he's adorable and because with all the damage flying around he's sure to wake up. I also went for the [Distant Memories](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Distant+Memories) tutor suite, since you can either find your combo pieces or just get more gas for your aggro.

You can always sideboard into [Bazaar Trader](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bazaar+Trader)'s night job: stealing your opponent's stuff! Grab some more Dominuses (Domini? Dominoes?) and they can steal things for your trader to trade back to you, or you can just untap your titan for 7 damage! I decided that the [Immortal Coil](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Immortal+Coil) didn't need to be shuffled off in this deck, but you could also do that...

> Hopefully by the end of it all, your opponent will be begging for A Little Mercy...and then you can give it to them!

I LOVE IT. Here's Daniel's deck.
