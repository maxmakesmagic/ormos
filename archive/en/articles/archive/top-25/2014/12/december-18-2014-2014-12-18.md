Welcome to our final look of 2014 at the *Magic* Top 25 Pro Rankings. The effect on the end-of-year table came in two parts. From Patrick Chapin at No. 15 right the way up to our leader Owen Turtenwald, the only change was the swap between reigning Player of the Year Jérémy Dezani of France, and Reid Duke of USA, who now takes Dezani's place at No. 4.


The bottom part of the table, however, saw plenty of churn brought about by Grand Prix in both Europe ([Milan](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/gpmil15), Modern) and the States ([Baltimore](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/gpbal15), *Khans of Tarkir* Limited). Two of [ChannelFireball](http://store.channelfireball.com/landing)'s finest were the big winners on the weekend. Both Josh Utter-Leyton and Ben Stark had busy weeks at Worlds. While Josh was in the 24 player [World Championship](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/2014WC), Ben joined us in the commentary booth for all the [World *Magic* Cup](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/2014WMC) action over the weekend. Both returned to the GP circuit in Baltimore, and both made the Top 8, where they faced each other in the quarterfinals. Stark prevailed with a grotesquely powerful white-black deck, but he could do nothing about eventual winner Gerard Fabiano in the semifinals. Nonetheless, Stark moves up five to No. 17, one behind Utter-Leyton, who rises four on the back of his Top 8 performance.


The other gainers on the weekend were Gaudenis Vidugiris, whose 17th place in Baltimore was enough to take him above Raphaël Lévy, who is now on the trapdoor at No. 25, and Alexander Hayne, who stayed in Europe with Jacob Wilson to take in the Modern GP in Milan. His 42nd place sees him end the year at No. 22.


So, that brings the premier event action to a close for 2014. Owen Turtenwald ends the year a deserved No. 1, with Ivan Floch his nearest challenger—surely the most improved pro of the last twelve months. Join us again in 2015 as we continue to bring you all the news from the *Magic* Top 25 Pro Rankings.
