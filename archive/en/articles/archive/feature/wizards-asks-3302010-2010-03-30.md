*What's your favorite fantasy creature?*

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/mtgcom/authorpics/authorpic_kellydigges.jpg)**Kelly Digges:** I've been playing **Magic** for so long that it's hard to untangle my favorite **Magic** creatures from my favorite fantasy creatures. I don't think I cared about Goblins very much before **Magic**, and I know I had absolutely no opinions about fungus-monsters.

In fact, I can hardly remember what sort of fantasy stuff I liked before I played **Magic** or **D&D**. I was just about to give up and go with my favorite **Magic** creature type when I remembered that there was one kind of fantasy monster I loved way before **Magic**, and it's one of my favorite creature types in **Magic**.

I am all about the dragons. I was raised on *The Hobbit* and Anne McCaffrey's Pern books, and I know I was doodling sketches of dragons on things long before I had ever tapped a [Mountain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mountain) to summon one.
