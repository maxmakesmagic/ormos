Innistrad Chaos Draft Ends Tomorrow
-----------------------------------


From November 17–24, you will be able to find Innistrad Chaos Draft in the Limited Play Lobby. In this three-round Draft format, each of the eight players will open a random booster pack from among all seven Innistrad sets. In addition, as there are only seven sets to choose from but eight different players opening eight packs each round, each set will be opened at least once each round, with only a single set being duplicated. The Spooky Season may be over for now, but Innistrad horrors (including opening a booster pack of Avacyn Restored) live on forever!
