With 2460 players at Grand Prix Boston-Worcester only a few can make it to the second day of competition. In the final round of Day One many players were playing with their backs against the wall needing a win to make it into competition tomorrow.


I caught up with three matches with players on the bubble:


**Martin Juza vs Carlo Angiuli:**


With 18 Grand Prix top eights under his belt, Juza is no stranger to the 9th round win-and-in. Juza brought his Merfolk deck, while Angiuli made it to the last round with [Scapeshift](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scapeshift). In game one, Juza got out a small army of little blue men and starting chipping away at his opponent's life total. Angiuli attempted to slow down the onslaught with [Izzet Charm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Izzet+Charm) and [Cryptic Command](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cryptic+Command), but, in the end, Angiuli was unable to assemble his combo before Juza took him out.


In game two Juza had two [Ã†ther Vial](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=%C3%86ther+Vial)s but only two lands. Angiuli, on the other hand, quickly accelerated into seven lands. With Juza having just a [Master of the Pearl Trident](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Master+of+the+Pearl+Trident) out, Angiuli went for [Scapeshift](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scapeshift). Juza promptly used [Swan Song](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swan+Song) to counter the game ending spell and used Vial to put another [Master of the Pearl Trident](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Master+of+the+Pearl+Trident) into play. On Angiuli's following turn, he tried [Scapeshift](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scapeshift) again. Juza had another [Swan Song](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swan+Song), but Anguili had a [Cryptic Command](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cryptic+Command). With Anguli tapped out from the pair of four-mana spells, Juza used [Spell Pierce](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spell+Pierce) to counter [Scapeshift](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scapeshift) once again. At the end of his turn he put a [Master of Waves](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Master+of+Waves) into play, untapped, and attacked for lethal.

**Gerard Fabiano vs Alexander Fincher**:


Gerard Fabiano and his W/U/R Control deck faced off against Alexander Fincher's 8-Rack deck--one that utilized discard, [The Rack](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=The+Rack), and [Shrieking Affliction](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shrieking+Affliction) to leave his opponent cardless and lifeless. In game one, Gerard lost many permanents thanks to a pair of [Smallpox](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Smallpox)es, but was able to cast a [Vendilion Clique](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vendilion+Clique) nonetheless. Alexander, unfazed, cast an [Ensnaring Bridge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ensnaring+Bridge), locking down the faerie. Alexander soon got access to [Dark Confidant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dark+Confidant), which got him a Raven's Crime. Things looked bleak for Gerard, but he was able to draw a Cryptic command, which, with [Vendilion Clique](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vendilion+Clique) and potential damage from Alexander's own [Dark Confidant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dark+Confidant) might've been able to deal the last points of damage. Unfortunately for Gerard, Alexander had more discard, forcing him to use his [Cryptic Command](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cryptic+Command) early and denying him the ability to deal the final points of damage. When Alexander found [The Rack](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=The+Rack) and a [Shrieking Affliction](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shrieking+Affliction), Gerard perished a few turns later.

In game two Alexander made quick work of Gerard's hand with [Inquisition of Kozilek](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inquisition+of+Kozilek), [Wrench Mind](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wrench+Mind), and [Thoughtseize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtseize). With Gerard floundering, Alexander was able to cast a [Dark Confidant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dark+Confidant) and [The Rack](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=The+Rack). With an opening, Gerard cast [Threads of Disloyalty](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Threads+of+Disloyalty) on [Dark Confidant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dark+Confidant) but, Alexander had all the answers, promptly casting a [Smallpox](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Smallpox) on the following turn. On Alexander's subsequent turn, he cast a Liliana, which, paired with [The Rack](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=The+Rack) locked Gerard down and slowly drained his life total.



**Fincher 2 - 0 Fabiano**


**Frank Karsten vs Mathieu Brault**:


In the final round of day one, Pro Tour Hall of Famer Frank Karsten and his Affinity deck faced off against Mathieu Brault and his Zoo deck. Game one was a tight race, with Brault amassing a quick army of [Wild Nacatl](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Nacatl)s and a [Tarmogoyf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf) and with Karsten getting a pair of [Vault Skirge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vault+Skirge)s and Nexuses. With both players under 10 life Brault attacked with his entire army. Karsten blocked with his pair of [Inkmoth Nexus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inkmoth+Nexus)es and fell to a precarious 3 life. Without a burn spell from Brault, Karsten was able to untap, attack with his creatures and use [Galvanic Blast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Galvanic+Blast) to finish off Brault.


In the second game, Brault came out of the gates with another pair of [Wild Nacatl](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Nacatl)s. Karsten had an awkward double [Glimmervoid](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glimmervoid) hand, but, when he reached 3 artifacts was able to pump out a pair of [Etched Champion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Etched+Champion)s thanks to a [Mox Opal](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mox+Opal). After falling to 10 life from the cats, Karsten began to stabilize. Brault though, promptly played an [Engineered Explosives](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Engineered+Explosives) with 3 charge counters. Karsten untapped and played an [Arcbound Ravager](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arcbound+Ravager). Brault let it resolve, and waited until his turn to use his [Engineered Explosives](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Engineered+Explosives) during combat. But the damage was already done; Ravager grew to become a 5/5 and Karsten had a third [Etched Champion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Etched+Champion) up his sleeve. Using Ravager's Modular ability to make his [Etched Champion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Etched+Champion) a 7/7 unblockable creature, Karsten sealed his invitation to play on Sunday.
