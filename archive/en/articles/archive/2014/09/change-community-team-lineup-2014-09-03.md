The lineup of the Community Team for this year’s [*Magic Online* Community Cup](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/2014-community-cup-player-profiles-2014-08-18) has had a late shakeup, as Dalibor Trnka had to bow out of participating in this year’s event for personal reasons. As such, we have tapped our first alternate: a popular submission from the community and well-known podcast host of *The Deck Tease*, Erin Campbell!
