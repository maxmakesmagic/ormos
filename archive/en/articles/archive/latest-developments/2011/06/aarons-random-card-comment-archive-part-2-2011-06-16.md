*Director of **Magic** Ramp;D Aaron Forsythe is consistently active in the online **Magic** community, primarily through his Twitter account, @[mtgaaron](http://twitter.com/#!/mtgaaron). One occasional feature on his Twitter feed is Aaron's Random Card Comment of the Day, or #arccd. For each Random Card Comment, Aaron uses the [Random Card](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?action=random) button in Gatherer, then heads into the Discussion tab for that card and writes a short commentary on it—no matter what it is (except for basic lands, as discussed in ARCCD #16).*

*The result is something like 30,000 words—and counting—of candid card commentary from a man who's spent more time thinking about **Magic** than can comfortably be guessed. Inside, you'll get Aaron's thoughts, insights, and recollections about "perfect" cards, the difference between design and just making cards, and the switch from [Counterspell](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterspell) to [Cancel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cancel).*

*Here, collected in one place for the first time, are Aaron's Random Card Comments numbers 26-50. We're divvying them up for your protection—if you've ever tried to drink out of a firehose you know what I'm talking about—but if you really want to dive in, you can find our archive of the first 25 [here](/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/ld/145), and all the cards Aaron has commented on in Gatherer [here](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?action=advancedamp;user=+%5BAaron_Forsythe%5D).*

*Tom LaPille will be back next week!*
