Happy Holidays from **magicthegathering.com**, and welcome to the "Best Of" Weeks! During these two weeks each year, Wizards of the Coasts staffers get to go home for the holidays. And because that includes the web team, the site takes a break as well.


Rather than just go dark for two weeks, we use this time to showcase some of our favorite articles and features from the last year. The feature article and column slots, Magic Arcana, and Card of the Day will all show off some of the highlights of 2008.


The site will return to regular updates on Monday, January 5, and *Conflux* previews start just two weeks after that, on Monday, January 19. However you spend this holiday season, have fun and we'll see you next year!
