Dear Mr. Garfield, 

First off, let me thank you. If it wasn't for you, I wouldn't have the awesome job I have today. After all, if you hadn't invented **Magic: The Gathering**, then Pete Hoefling never would have started StarCityGames.com as a place to publish articles on how to play **Magic**. Without **Magic**, *I* never would have started writing articles on playing politics in multiplayer games. And without both of those factors coming into play, Pete wouldn't have hired me full-time to edit all the **Magic** articles he received, enabling me to quit my other job. 

So really, *you* were the one who rescued me from a life of drudgery at a Dunder-Mifflin-style paper company. [\*](#footnote1) I owe you a hug. 

That said, a lot of people have been emailing me about some old articles you recently had republished on this site, particularly the one where you said this: 


> 
> "In my opinion, team **Magic** *rules* over free-for-all play.... Eventually, any play advantage that stems from a better understanding of strategy will be overshadowed by how everyone treats you. After that point, gaining further knowledge is worth far less than becoming everyone's friend. If I still like the game, I change the way we play so that the politics are diminished. Another option, of course, is to get a different game and begin the journey of exploration again."
> 
> 

Now, how can I put this delicately? 

You're wrong. 

[![Gainsay](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/cardart/PS/Gainsay.jpg)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Gainsay)Okay, that's funny to say, but it's also *not true*. You get more enjoyment out of team play, which for you provides a "better understanding of strategy"... And it is worth noting that in 1997 when you wrote those words, Wizards didn't provide rules support for multiplayer anything like what it does now—multiplayer games really were the Wild West. But for me, the lack of politics leaves me cold and it seems depressingly obvious. The great thing is that *neither* of us is right *or* wrong, because the great thing about gaming is that enjoyment *is* subjective. There's enough room for preferences of all kinds!

However, like George Lucas before you, I think that you don't *quite* understand all the reasons why your brainchild **Magic** succeeded as well as it did... and the fact that you see politics as lessening the strategy in the game confirms that for me. I don't think you understand why **Magic** appeals to *my* style of gaming, so I'm going to try to explain why I think politics does *not* lessen the overall strategy.

### What Is Strategy?

First off, let's take your phrase here: "Any play advantage that stems from a better understanding of strategy will be overshadowed by how everyone treats you."

That kind of makes it sound as though that "strategy" is a very narrow realm of skills directly involved in **Magic**. In other words, you may have won via correctly anticipating the reactions of groups of other players, but you didn't win using ***Magic*** strategy. Which is a covert way of separating skillsets into two groups: a valid "**Magic**" strategy and a non-**Magic** strategy that doesn't count. 

But that's not true, Mr. Garfield! In fact, every serious tournament player has to play a game where they have to read their opponents and make a game-changing decision *before they even show up*. 

We call that game precisely what it is: *the metagame*. 

When someone goes to a tournament, they may have the most awesome deck in the world. Objectively speaking, maybe Dredge *is* the most powerful deck out there, capable of obscene wins. But if everyone at the tournament knows that and they're all packing maindecked anti-Dredge tech, that player may lose merely by dint of not guessing properly what people are thinking.

That *is* a form of politics, and you could easily argue that the metagame is a skill-lowering factor. After all, the best player might show up with the strongest deck and lose just because everyone in the room decided to pick on his choice. That keeps the "best" player from winning due to circumstances beyond his control.... and how is that all too different from folks dogpiling the guy in the lead in a multiplayer game? You lost because a group of people thought your deck was too powerful. 

Heck, in a game of multiplayer, you can at least *try* to talk someone out of attacking you. You can't get someone to remove their pre-boarded hatred for Dredge!

Yet I don't think too many people would seriously argue that beating the metagame involves no strategy. Sure, the metagame isn't as predictable as folks would like... but there have been too many times where, say, Zvi showed up with "The Solution" or people have dusted off that long-forgotten Affinity deck to steal a win from nowhere. Though it seems random if you don't know how to do it (and there are certainly random factors that nobody can account for), players *can* beat the metagame. 

In fact, I'm willing to bet that you, Mr. Garfield, probably think the metagame is a part of "proper" **Magic** strategy. But why? Maybe you think that reading *some* class of people is a part of **Magic** because it involves deck building, while reading *another* class of people is not a part of **Magic** because it doesn't. 

But if so, then what *else* falls into the nebulous realm of "**Magic**" strategy? After all, there are a lot of things that go into **Magic** that also don't, technically speaking, have a lot to do with **Magic** *specifically*. Good card shuffling technique is something that also applies to other card games... so can that also be good ***Magic*** strategy? It may not be, but if you don't know how to sufficiently randomize your deck, you're in trouble. 

[![Aven_Warcraft](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/cardart/JUD/Aven_Warcraft.jpg)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Aven%2BWarcraft)What about Jedi mind tricks? Observing your opponent closely to make sure he doesn't cheat? Those aren't part of **Magic** proper, since they're also a part of many *other* games. 

If you 0-4'd a tournament because you had superior skill at the "relevant" elements of **Magic** but failed to shuffle properly, brought a deck that everyone anticipated, and fell for people's silly mind tricks, would you argue that your ***Magic*** strategy is superior....

....or do *all* of those elements combine to make you better at **Magic**, and thus each of them should count as a part of an overall **Magic** strategy? 

My point is that I think it's an arbitrary distinction you're making here. You're separating "politics" from "**Magic**" as though politics can be handwaved away as "Well, you may have won because of it, but that's not *Magic* strategy you used." 

Whereas as far as I'm concerned, *anything that helps you to win **Magic** games is **Magic** strategy*. 

To me, it doesn't matter whether I'm not playing [Chameleon Colossus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chameleon+Colossus) because I think I can win this game without it and I don't want my opponent to sideboard against it in Game 2, or I'm not playing [Chameleon Colossus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chameleon+Colossus) because I know that Phil and Ted would overreact if I played it and come after me in a way that I'm not quite ready to withstand yet. 

Yet only *one* of those factors matters in a duel. And since duels are the default for **Magic**, "mind games" have fallen under the umbrella of "proper **Magic** strategy" while "politics" has been left out in the drizzle. 

I'm not sure that's fair. 

### The Nature of My Enjoyment

It's often said that the creator never truly understands why his creation is successful. (Calling Mister Lucas again—Jar Jar *who*?) And I don't think that you fathom the full extent of what *I* like about **Magic**, so let me try to explain my love to you. 

My favorite game manufacturer of all time is Cheapass Games, manufacturer of such awesome enjoyments as "Unexploded Cow" and "Devil Bunny Needs a Ham." Cheapass Games has an interesting niche market: to save money, they assume you already have tokens and Monopoly money hanging about. So they print only bare-bones games that cost about $5 to $8 apiece and come in inexpensive cardboard boxes, leaving *you* to provide the dice and glass beads. 

The great thing about Cheapass games is that you can buy three of them for a sawbuck, and play through them quickly. You don't feel bad about playing them only once or twice. And you know what I've discovered?

The first game is invariably the best game for me. 

I *love* the challenge of trying to dope out what strategies are optimal before I fully understand the game. I *like* looking at a hugely complicated mass of rules and trying to ascertain what the correct path to victory is. 

Once I play the games two or three times, the best strategies generally become clear... and then it becomes boring to me. I can *refine* those strategies, sure, but it's not as fun as looking at a seething mass of options and pondering, "Is it better to go on an all-out grab for as many resources as I can get, or to spend my efforts getting only the *best* resources?" There's something that just hits me right about trying to snort all of the instructions into my brain and then calculating which path is correct.

You know what else I've noticed? The people who are good at winning first-time Cheapass games *also* tend to be very good at winning multiplayer **Magic**. 

**Magic** is awesome for me because of its randomness. I hate Constructed, because playing the same cards over and over again bores the heck out of me. The games are designed to be very similar; redundancy is the goal of a Constructed deck. But I adore Limited, because every game plays out differently. 

Every game of **Magic** for me is like a Cheapass game, because the optimal strategy changes in every game. That's where your game hits my hot button. 

And the harder it is for me to find the correct path to victory, the more unknowns in my path as I try to divine the right route that will lead to a win, *the better I like it*. 

That's why **Magic** is made of awesome—it fulfills the needs of so many different players! If you enjoy testing your pure, random-free skill, then tournament Constructed's your bag, since it very much rewards planning, crystal-clear objectives, and minimizes the randomness. But if you get a charge out of what I do, plucking the relevant choices out of a sea of possibly-unrelated factors, then Limited and multiplayer **Magic** are for you. 

I don't think you fully appreciate that aspect of the game, though. My suspicion is that you're a Constructed guy (after all, you built **Magic** as a Constructed game) and tend to see the other forms of enjoyment as just noise.[\*\*](#footnote2) But they aren't! They're just as skill-intensive—if anything, they're often harder because you have so many other factors to consider that *a* wrong step can doom you!

[Strategy, Schmategy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Strategy%252C%2BSchmategy) That's why I love multiplayer **Magic**. Learning to play the other players is what makes it fun for me—especially since you can't play the same player the same way twice. People evolve as you play with them, and a psychological strategy that worked last week might not work *this* week. And trying to guess how the table thinks in conjunction is *even harder*. 

It adds more chaos to the game, yes! But that doesn't mean that the game *degenerates* into chaos. I heard that you told Randy Buehler once that "who wins multiplayer **Magic** is completely random, so just bring any deck," but that's not true. Heck, give a bunch of newbies some **Magic** decks, and they'll tell you how ***Magic*** is random, because they don't understand what factors go into winning the game. 

Multiplayer **Magic** involves thinking on *so* many levels that you're *adrift* in a sea of seemingly unrelated factors. But politics is *not* random. It's controllable...

...*but only if you treat it as a valid strategy*. 

Like the novice **Magic** players who go, "Man, it all comes down to who draws the [Craw Wurm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Craw+Wurm) first" and throw up their hands to say that **Magic**'s just luck, it's easy to write off multiplayer **Magic** as being so needlessly complex that there's no logic involved in winning it. But I think that's the wrong approach. 

Yes, the kingmaker strategy *can* get irritating. Particularly in games like Settlers of Catan, which has the problem of players building up a lead that no one else can overcome, the kingmaker element is almost overwhelming.[\*\*\*](#footnote3) Thankfully, **Magic** is fluid enough that people almost always have an out, unlike the clogged endgames of Risk. 

Rather than dismissing the kingmaker as an inevitable consequence of playing, however, I choose the strategic bent of isolating how kingmakers can be used. "How can I sway the kingmaker to my side?" I ask. (And I often do.) Or, better yet, I ask "How can I play to knock the kingmaker off his perch? What's the best way to foresee *when* someone is going to be kingmaker in a few turns, and how do you head him off at the pass?" 

That to me is just another layer on the cake. And I can't dismiss it as radio chaos theory. To me, that learning to play the sub-games is what makes it *fun*, whether they are (or are not) a part of **Magic**. 

You may disagree. But I think brushing it off because it's not "a better understanding of strategy" misses the point of what strategy *is*. 

**Conclusions**

[![Political_Trickery](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/cardart/MI/Political_Trickery.jpg)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Political%2BTrickery)You *are* right about one thing, though; politics isn't always fun. I agree with you that too much politics can encourage players to be passive, and that's why I try to encourage gaming cultures where aggression isn't frowned upon. Sometimes, you have to give up a little strategy for a little fun. 

And some people just don't enjoy politics! Thank God they have other formats to turn to. **Magic**'s a big field thanks to your phenomenal design, Mr. Garfield, and there's so much room for players of all kinds to stand around and go, "Wow, that part of **Magic** sucks, but the rest here is *awesome*." 

You created a great game. There's a lot of space for us to stand in. But just as some claim that Rock, Paper, Scissors is purely random and others claim there's a lot of strategy to it (I won a game recently by noting my wife's hand position on the upswing), I claim that there *are* valid strategies to political games. They're just harder to isolate and verify. 

Also, you say a lot more in many fewer words. That's the sign of a true master, sir. I took nearly twice the number of words to say what you did in a thousand, and my verbal logorrhea makes me seem drooling compared to you. 

With love and affection,

[\*\*](#footnote2a) – Though I can't be sure on that. RoboRally, which you *also* designed. has a strong element of playing with chaos, so I'm a little loathe to say that for sure. Plus, **Magic** was not designed with the four-of rule in mind—who knew it would be such a success?—so early games tended to be a lot like Limited. 

[\*\*\*](#footnote3a) – Fun trivia fact: In our first game of Settlers of Catan together, my wife played kingmaker when I and another player were in the lead. I'd pissed her off sufficiently that she chose the other guy. Husbands, don't assume your wife is on your side!
