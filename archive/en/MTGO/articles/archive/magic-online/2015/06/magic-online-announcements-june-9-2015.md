**Qualify for the *Dragons of Tarkir* Championship**


You might not be able to become a [Dragonlord](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?action=advanced&name=+%5BDragonlord%5D&type=+%5B%22Legendary%22%5D) and rule the skies of Tarkir, but you can become a champion who rules at *Dragons of Tarkir*! The *Dragons of Tarkir* Championships are coming up on *Magic Online*.


In the Limited Championship Qualifiers, players will wrestle with the question of how many Dragons they should play in their Sealed decks. Trick question—play them all! Study up and come back for the [*Dragons of Tarkir* Limited Championship Qualifiers](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/magic-online/dragons-tarkir-championship-events-2015-04-13#ltdqualifier) beginning on Wednesday, June 10, 12:30 p.m. through Tuesday, June 16, at 9:30 p.m. (All times Pacific, UTC-7). After that, we transition to the Standard Championship Qualifiers.


Some might say (a Dragonlord might say) that Constructed is more of a celebration than a mere format, an elaborate 60-card dance meant to show off Dragons in their purest form. Perhaps you disagree and wish to bring an unequivocally worse deck (a non-Dragon deck) to the Qualifiers. Please join us for the [*Dragons of Tarkir* Standard Championship Qualifiers](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/magic-online/dragons-tarkir-championship-events-2015-04-13#strdqualifier) starting on Wednesday, June 17, 12:30 p.m. Pacific where you can sign up for a slot in which your deck can be put to task by one containing more Dragons than yours. Standard Qualifiers run every three hours, on the half hour, through Tuesday, June 23, 9:30 p.m. Even if you're not able to win your first time out, participation in any Qualifier Event will net players a full-art promo version of [Scaleguard Sentinels](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scaleguard+Sentinels), a glorious card that is, like all things, better with Dragons. Four or five wins in any Qualifier earns you an invitation to the Finals!


Get the full *Dragons of Tarkir* Championship event details [here](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/magic-online/dragons-tarkir-championship-events-2015-04-13#qualifiers).
