Shahar Shenhar's Origin Story

 Mike Rosenberg is a writer and gamer and has been part of the Magic text coverage team since 2011. He joined Wizards as organized play’s content specialist in June 2014. 







Two years ago, in Amsterdam, nineteen-year-old Shahar Shenhar entered the professional *Magic* history books as the first *Magic: The Gathering* World Champion to be younger than the game itself, as he won the World Championship during the game's twentieth anniversary.



One year later, Shenhar made history yet again by becoming the first player to win back-to-back World Championship titles.



The now 21-year-old Shenhar, who has roots in Israel as well as Sacramento, California, now seeks a third World Championship title this year. But going back into the past a bit, Shenhar's origin story with *Magic* and his first Pro Tour began seven years ago.

"I've been playing *Magic* since I was fourteen, which is when the set *Lorwyn* was released," Shenhar recalled. "I was introduced to this game by my best friend. He was raised in a religious family—I was not, but when I was at their house I respected the restrictions—and so during Shabbat he wasn't allowed to use any electronics. Instead of playing first-person shooters we either went outside to play sports or played indoor games like Chess, Checkers, and one of the games his older siblings played as well was *Magic*."



"Once I learned the game—mostly by watching—I completely fell in love. I started building decks out of their collection which was a very casual one. I built a mono-black deck which was doing well against their field. My mom saw that I really liked the game, and she liked it too because it was very intellectual compared to all the shooting games I played which she to this day still hates. She looked online to see if there were any nearby *Magic* stores, and there were a few, including one ten minutes away from us called Adventureson.com/Adventures Comics and Games."



And from there, Shenhar's *Magic* history began. It was at Adventures Comics and Games that he began to improve with his two friends, Ricky Sidher and Michael Hetrick. They would go to the store a few times each week to play and it was watching them and playing against them each week that improved Shenhar for the Pro Tour.



"Pro Tour Paris 2011 was my first Pro Tour," Shenhar recalled. "I qualified by winning my first PTQ Top 8, so I was very new to the competitive scene. At the Pro Tour I played the U/R/G Ramp deck that I was doing really well with at FNMs and other tournaments during the week."



"At this Pro Tour, I had my best Constructed performance ever which was 8-1-1, but I remember that my Limited game was off, to say the least. This was due to the fact that I was just a kid that had no one to team with. All of my friends from my area were not qualified. My Limited record was 2-1-3, which when combined with my Constructed record was good enough for 38th place."



That 38th place finish from Shenhar qualified him for the next Pro Tour, the beginning of Shenhar's ascension to one of *Magic*'s top players. He currently plays *Magic* professionally as one of the game's Platinum players, and is also a content provider for TCGPlayer.com.



For Shenhar, who has already obtained *Magic*'s greatest title (twice!), this year's World Championship is yet another victory lap for the young but storied pro player, and another year to defend the title from 23 other competitors who will seek to knock him off the plateau. Would they succeed, or would Shenhar continue to build his *Magic* legacy with an unprecedented third win?



*The 2015* Magic: The Gathering *World Championship takes place in Seattle, Washington during PAX Prime on August 27, 28, and 30.
