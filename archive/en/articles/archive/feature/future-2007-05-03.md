As analysts, it is not enough for us to see a thing and name that thing, to merely notice that it is there, a feature of the landscape of our physical—or even imaginary—universe. We look at a thing and seek to reconcile it with its context. We force meaning on our observations, whether or not it is there. *So now what?* is one of our favorite catchphrases. Scott McCloud says that it is not enough that we see a face in a cloud, a puddle, a grilled cheese sandwich; after noticing it, we can never look that way again *without* seeing the face. 

In the same way, the brief glimpses into some possible tomorrows in *Future Sight* compels us to string together general statements. Are they true? In some wise, they are patterns built without third points for reference. 

But they're fun.


> *In the future,* White Weenie will beat up on combo decks.

**[Aven Mindcensor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aven+Mindcensor)**

Not since Matt Linde flashed the Long-crushing Abeyance heard 'round the world has White Weenie been able to make such a ludicrous statement. [Aven Mindcensor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aven+Mindcensor) isn't enough to beat combo outright, but it is certainly a disincentive for at least some players to choose to go with Standard standbys like World Champion [Dragonstorm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragonstorm). Remember, though, that if [Dragonstorm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragonstorm) has a [Bogardan Hellkite](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bogardan+Hellkite) in the top cards, one point can go to the Mindcensor and [Dragonstorm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragonstorm) can continue searching and shuffling unimpeded.

That said, the splash damage on *Onslaught* sacrifice duals, [Flagstones of Trokair](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flagstones+of+Trokair), and even in-block [Terramorphic Expanse](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Terramorphic+Expanse)s is something that deck designers will have to take into consideration now that [Aven Mindcensor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aven+Mindcensor) is a resource. This is one of the most thought-provoking—and probably best—cards in the new set.


> *In the future*, even more White creatures will die to [Sulfur Elemental](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sulfur+Elemental).

![Blade of the Sixth Pride](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Blade+of+the+Sixth+Pride)**[Blade of the Sixth Pride](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blade+of+the+Sixth+Pride)**It isn't an entirely bad thing to have yet another weenie that bites it outright to the ubiquitous [Sulfur Elemental](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sulfur+Elemental)... It is actually a testament to how strong [Blade of the Sixth Pride](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blade+of+the+Sixth+Pride) might be that it will be eligible for Sulfur-cide in tournament Constructed.

One thing that I can't wait to see is the mulligan to four. [Plains](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plains), [Plains](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plains), Lions, Blade. Keep. Winner Winner! Nice. Deck.


> *In the future,* Rebels will sow treaties rather than trouble.

**[Bound in Silence](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bound+in+Silence)**

This is actually one of the cooler cards in the new set. [Pacifism](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pacifism) is a card that has been hovering on the outskirts of Tier Two since its first appearance more than ten years ago, seeing play as everything from a Swords to Plowshares that didn't turn off [Oath of Druids](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oath+of+Druids) to a bullet in Ghost Dad, but it has never been clear that the card is exactly what a top flight deck wanted to play in *any* role. 

I think that if a *Time Spiral*-centric Rebel deck has any shot, this card will be a central target for both black and white two mana searchers.


> *In the future,* Two-Headed Giant will be the team format of choice... by necessity.

**[Imperial Mask](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Imperial+Mask)**

Really, can you imagine the number of times "Judge!" will get called if they let players run [Imperial Mask](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Imperial+Mask) in heretofore recognizable three-man Limited or Constructed PTQ-level events? [Ivory Mask](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ivory+Mask) was perfectly awesome—and main deck—in three-man Standard Constructed last year. What a nightmare for the judging staff!

There is no [Gifts Ungiven](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gifts+Ungiven) at the present time, nor Yosei, so the demand on [Imperial Mask](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Imperial+Mask) versus [Ivory Mask](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ivory+Mask) is less, it seems, though Mask + Moat ([Teferi's Moat](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Teferi%27s+Moat)) seems like it would be hell on Block beatdown decks of multiple flavors. With only a single ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227125855im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/white.gif) in the mana cost, I can see this card being worth the mana investment.


> *In the future* you will be able to kill creatures for ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20211201201921im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless1.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227125855im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/white.gif)...

**[Lucent Liminid](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lucent+Liminid)**


> *In the future* thriving on lingo and in-jokes will be replaced with being tongue-tied and confused.

**[Lymph Sliver](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lymph+Sliver)**

Remember when "[Absorb](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Absorb)" could only mean one thing? And it was awesome?

**[Thornweald Archer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thornweald+Archer)**

My favorite part about this is that I couldn't remember what [Thornweald Archer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thornweald+Archer)'s name is, so I plugged "reach" into Gatherer and got everything from [Aquastrand Spider](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aquastrand+Spider) to [Harbor Guardian](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Harbor+Guardian) in the first query. You go, Gatherer! 

Will [Thornweald Archer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thornweald+Archer) be awesome in Constructed? At first I wasn't sure because 2/1 creatures that specialize in blocking can't be "good" really at any mana cost above one... but at the same time, the second ability means that lots of players with much better creatures than [Thornweald Archer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thornweald+Archer) will have no interest in tussling with it. I give this card a strong, very strong, maybe. Probably in the sideboard. Prepare to find yourself on the wrong side of a terrible trade. 


> *In the future*, everything—not just computers—will be half the size and cost half as much.

![Sporoloth Ancient](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Sporoloth+Ancient)**[Sporoloth Ancient](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sporoloth+Ancient)**The various Saproling-themed cards have me torn. On one hand I don't buy it, but on the other hand, the best of the Saproling-themed cards really seem to be pushing the linear. I really love a linear, especially one that I think that no one is gunning for. I am well known to play 4/4s in Constructed that cost ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227130050im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless3.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20220123123600im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/green.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20220123123600im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/green.gif) and do nothing more than create a little card advantage, and [Sporoloth Ancient](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sporoloth+Ancient) might just create a *lot.* Add [Sporesower Thallid](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sporesower+Thallid) and [Thelon of Havenwood](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thelon+of+Havenwood)... It really seems like there might be a deck there.


> *In the future*, judges will be called.

**[Seht's Tiger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seht%27s+Tiger)**

Here is an excerpt of a conversation I had with Brian David-Marshall last week.


> 
> 
> **SwimmingWithSharks** This card is awesome. It like counters hellbent [Demonfire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Demonfire)... Without, you know, *countering* it.

> 
> **TheWeekThatWas** Awesome! Does that mean it counters, like, [Stupor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stupor)?

> 
> 
> **SwimmingWithSharks** Man! So this does nothing? I thought it was like Pouncing [Gilded Light](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gilded+Light). Is it *not* awesome?
> 
> 
> **TheWeekThatWas** Wait! Protection... Doesn't that mean you can't be targeted?
> 
> 
> **SwimmingWithSharks** I, um... Well... So what you're saying is that it *can* counter [Stupor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stupor)?

> **TheWeekThatWas** Man! Yes?

I was mildly reminded of USENET community construction of the [White Knight](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=White+Knight) / [Pestilence](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pestilence) deck in 1995 or so, where arguments included "This doesn't work, n00b. [Pestilence](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pestilence) will kill [White Knight](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=White+Knight) because [Pestilence](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pestilence) doesn't target, you know, how [Wrath of God](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wrath+of+God) still kills Black Knight... It's only fair."

"Judge!"


> *In the future*, someone will have some terrible idea... And you will lose to it.

**[Arcanum Wings](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arcanum+Wings)**

I am having really vivid fantasies about [Verdant Embrace](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Verdant+Embrace) right now. This card seems to me like a terrible, terrible, [Tinker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tinker) or Natural Order... But maybe not so terrible that it might not get played. There was a time that we didn't know Natural Order was good enough, mind you.


> *In the future*, Walls will be very fast.

![Bonded Fetch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Bonded+Fetch)**[Bonded Fetch](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bonded+Fetch)**1) I am aware that we don't call them "Walls" any more, but I am from before the Defender civil rights trials. I'm a bit old school. I remember the [Terror](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Terror)-reminiscent Necrite flavor text "Ever see a wall drop dead of fright, kid? It ain't pretty."

2) I know we have cards like [Molten Sentry](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Molten+Sentry) and [Battle Rampart](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Battle+Rampart) that have "haste," kind of, but [Bonded Fetch](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bonded+Fetch) seems really impressive to me anyway; it's the only legitimate hasty defender in the game, I think. Isn't the idea of a lightning quick *Wall* just cool?

3) Every sort of [Merfolk Looter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Merfolk+Looter), [Thought Courier](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thought+Courier), and [Cephalid Looter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cephalid+Looter) has excelled in Constructed, including Pro Tour and Grand Prix Top 8 appearances. [Bonded Fetch](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bonded+Fetch) comes online faster and actually has a chance to block the smallest of the small, at least.


> *In the future*, [Dread Return](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dread+Return) will be free. Okay, it will *still* be free.

**[Narcomoeba](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Narcomoeba)**

This card will be a great addition to a [Dredge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dredge) / [Dread Return](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dread+Return) strategy. Big dredge cards like [Golgari Grave-Troll](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Golgari+Grave-Troll) will flip this little man over and the free babies will pave the way for better threats like [Akroma, Angel of Wrath](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Akroma%2C+Angel+of+Wrath), or [Sutured Ghoul](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sutured+Ghoul), or [Sundering Titan](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sundering+Titan), depending on the format. [Narcomoeba](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Narcomoeba) will also play nicely with [Cephalid Illusionist](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cephalid+Illusionist) decks. There is no reason to ever pay retail.


> *In the future*, gaming halls will be filled with bitter laughter.

**[Nix](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nix)**

[Rift Bolt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rift+Bolt), [Greater Gargadon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Greater+Gargadon), even [Frogmite](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Frogmite)... There are a lot of cards that [Nix](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nix) can handle. It should in fact be a key card in Limited. I am not sure I would even sideboard [Nix](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nix) in Constructed, just because most of the trouble caused by most present suspends ([Aeon Chronicler](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aeon+Chronicler), [Detritivore](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Detritivore)) has nothing to do with actually countering them at the end of their suspend tenures. However, someone will play [Nix](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nix), and it will really ruin the opponent's day, at least once that day. I'm looking at you, [Riftwing Cloudskate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Riftwing+Cloudskate).


> *In the future*, artifacts will be blue.

**[Sarcomite Myr](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sarcomite+Myr)**

Did you notice the "draw a card" line on [Sarcomite Myr](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sarcomite+Myr)? This is just R&D making explicit something that has always been true since the days of Jayemdae Tome, Nevinyrral's Disk, &co.


> *In the future*, **Magic** card art will be spectacular.

![Shapeshifter's Marrow](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Shapeshifter%27s+Marrow)**[Shapeshifter's Marrow](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shapeshifter%27s+Marrow)**I have no idea when you would seriously want to play this in Constructed. Therefore it will have a nice permanent place in your rare binder. Where it will look, framed, like *Art*. Just look at it!


> *In the future*, awesome cards will be hard to break.

**[Spellweaver Volute](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spellweaver+Volute)**

I suppose this trend of cards like [Wild Pair](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Pair) and [Spellweaver Volute](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spellweaver+Volute) has to be better than the *traditional* mantra of awesome cards being extremely simple to break. Maybe with all the [Careful Consideration](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Careful+Consideration)s and [Compulsive Research](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Compulsive+Research)es available in Standard, you can put lots of instants into your graveyard and fix your hand, filling it with sorceries that will draw you more sorceries and bury more instants.

Let's assume you have the right engine... What are you supposed to do with it?

I don't know!

That's because [Spellweaver Volute](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spellweaver+Volute) is hard to break.

My guess is that you can swing some nice incremental card advantage, a la The Rock (but with more or better spells), as well as piggybacking somewhat on the opponent's graveyard. Maybe [Spellweaver Volute](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spellweaver+Volute) is a key sideboard card in a spell- and removal-heavy mirror. 


> *In the future*, blue and black will play nicely together.

**[Vedalken Aethermage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vedalken+Aethermage)**

I know! Surprise! Turn four should be sick for blue... [Vedalken Aethermage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vedalken+Aethermage) into [Venser, Shaper Savant](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Venser%2C+Shaper+Savant)? Aethermage as a setup card for [Linessa, Zephyr Mage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Linessa%2C+Zephyr+Mage) seems like the most powerful direction, though I'm not sure it is exactly broken given the cards necessary to make them click. Aethermage setting up Linessa with [Oath of Ghouls](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oath+of+Ghouls) or [Oversold Cemetery](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oversold+Cemetery) as the engine could make for a really big "big turn." If you resolve one of the aforementioned ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20211201201921im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless1.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227195556im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/black.gif) enchantments and so much as *draw*
[Vedalken Aethermage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vedalken+Aethermage), you pretty much always beat control. You can keep Wizardcycling for more Aethermages, then chain into Zephyr Mages, and your strategy is next to untouchable from an attrition standpoint. Add a little speed, and the team might just be a machine gun [Decimate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Decimate).


> *In the future*, black will still be frightening, but R&D will be frightened.

**[Fleshwrither](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fleshwrither)**

As for frightening, just look at it. [Fleshwrither](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fleshwrither) has all mismatched limbs, two heads, etc. It seems to be juggling flames or something. 

But frightened? Why does this card sacrifice only as a sorcery? There is no possibility for card advantage via damage on the stack combat tricks. What four mana creature is worth seven mana, slow-style? My guess is that transfigure was too good at some point... You know, like why [Magus of the Bazaar](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Magus+of+the+Bazaar) is 0/1 for two.


> *In the future*, black will like green... and nobody else.

![Death Rattle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Death+Rattle)**[Death Rattle](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Death+Rattle)**This card costs ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227195556im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/black.gif)+[Stinkweed Imp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stinkweed+Imp). Nudge, nudge, wink, wink. We are buddies with green! See! We don't target a green creature. We love a green creature! Delve you.

**[Tombstalker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tombstalker)**

This card costs ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227195556im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/black.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227195556im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/black.gif)+[Golgari Grave-Troll](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Golgari+Grave-Troll). [Dredge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dredge) + Delve! This isn't a hard play on turn two, if you really want to.

**[Yixlid Jailer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Yixlid+Jailer)**

I think **Magic Online** makes me in some ways stupider. **Magic Online** reminds me to gain life for [Firemane Angel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Firemane+Angel), [Leonin Elder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leonin+Elder), etc. However I still have to remember to use my [Withered Wretch](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Withered+Wretch) at the end of the opponent's turn. [Yixlid Jailer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Yixlid+Jailer) is like the **Magic Online** version 3.0 of [Withered Wretch](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Withered+Wretch)es. I don't have to remember myself any more! Huzzah! 


> *In the future*, even more Johnnys will continue to win one game in ten.

**[Bloodshot Trainee](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodshot+Trainee)**

I've already tried, myself. I don't think this one is probably worth the effort in serious Constructed. [Bloodshot Trainee](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodshot+Trainee) costs one more than [Spikeshot Goblin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spikeshot+Goblin) and has less creature-killing utility unenhanced; [Spikeshot Goblin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spikeshot+Goblin) never saw 60-card consideration. 

You can't help it though, can you Johnny? [Bloodshot Trainee](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodshot+Trainee) really is exciting. It does *four* (the irony is it will never do four... maybe one in ten).


> *In the future*, combo players will start on 12.

**[Street Wraith](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Street+Wraith)**

This will be a staple in a lot of decks. Unlike cards like [Mishra's Bauble](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mishra%27s+Bauble), [Street Wraith](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Street+Wraith) is essentially a pure way to cut your deck by four cards from 60 to 56 (you don't need to wait the turn), which is very good for combo, even though they life loss is not inconsiderable. By the way, as a last ditch fallback, I don't think that a 3/4 Swampwalker for five mana is actually that bad.


> *In the future*, jellyfish will come gold-plated.

**[Venser, Shaper Savant](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Venser%2C+Shaper+Savant)**

It didn't appear in a press release or anything, but the expansion symbol on [Venser, Shaper Savant](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Venser%2C+Shaper+Savant) is printed in actual gold leaf. That's why it costs an additional ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161115194122im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/blue.gif) over [Man-o'-War](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Man-o%27-War). 

Venser might not be [Man-o'-War](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Man-o%27-War), but he's the only [Man-o'-War](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Man-o%27-War) that Standard players are likely to have any time soon. The additional mana pushes the card to a less desirable curve point, but Venser can bounce land, essentially [Remand](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Remand) spells, and create unprofitable combats thanks to flash. I am not sure where he will show up, but Venser seems to me a highly possible role player. He can steal tempo and set up [Extirpate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Extirpate) well in Block control-on-control. Plus, Venser beats.


> *In the future*, basic [Mountain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mountain) will become a haven for compulsive gamblers.

**[Shah of Naar Isle](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shah+of+Naar+Isle)**

There used to be a card called [Indentured Djinn](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Indentured+Djinn), which was actually probably a worse deal for what you got than [Shah of Naar Isle](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shah+of+Naar+Isle) will be. Yet perfectly reasonable players with Pro Tour Top 8s and gaming resumes outside top level **Magic** played a deck dubbed "Lucky Djinn." If you got lucky, the opponent didn't draw anything with his three free cards, and you just got to bash him with your 4/4 flyer for three. *Lucky.*

[Shah of Naar Isle](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shah+of+Naar+Isle) is really a great deal. For only four mana, you get a 6/6, yes, but also a free trip to adrenaline-ville. When you lose thanks to the Shah, well, you could see that coming. The other guy got a free [Ancestral Recall](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ancestral+Recall), after all. But when you win? Ooh, yeah. Trample is nearly as strong offensively as flying, and 6/6 for four is in rare company in terms of its body. Moreover, there are ways you can mitigate the downside of shipping three cards, via mana control, or just conceding that aspect of the game to a deck that already has more cards. There are some matchups where, if you get a fast 6/6, it doesn't matter how many cards the opponent draws (you stole about two mana). The biggest difference between the Shah and the somewhat defensible [Indentured Djinn](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Indentured+Djinn) is that you get a 6/6 for a turn even if you don't want to pay the echo cost, far different from the blue predecessor, who was quite inflexible on this term. So if you need a giant blocker for a turn and don't want to pay the echo? It might not be optimal, but [Shah of Naar Isle](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shah+of+Naar+Isle) can at least play that role. 

And victory? Winning with this card will be a rush, not just a dubya.


> *In the future*, Fireblast will have legs.

**[Skizzik Surger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skizzik+Surger)**

This card is a little pricey, but I can see it as a possible addition to multiple strategies. We think of six mana as expensive for Red Decks proper and, say, Gruul Deck Wins, but *Time Spiral* Block definitely has decks that can support this mana cost thanks to [Search for Tomorrow](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Search+for+Tomorrow), [Wall of Roots](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wall+of+Roots), [Prismatic Lens](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Prismatic+Lens), and [Mwonvuli Acid-Moss](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mwonvuli+Acid-Moss). Will [Skizzik Surger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skizzik+Surger) be the post-[Damnation](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Damnation)[Giant Solifuge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Giant+Solifuge) that green-red needs to beat the best of the control strategies? Maybe it is just a "burn" spell. Either way, this is definitely one I will watch.

Incidentally, I really like how [Skizzik Surger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skizzik+Surger) recalls Fireblast on both mana cost and the "sacrifice two lands" bit, even if it is not an alternate mana cost... Feels like an Easter Egg for us old timers.

![Oriss, Samite Guardian](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Oriss%2C+Samite+Guardian)**[Oriss, Samite Guardian](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oriss%2C+Samite+Guardian)**[Orim, Samite Healer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Orim%2C+Samite+Healer) (who made Top 8 of a Constructed Pro Tour, don't forget) meets [Orim's Chant](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Orim%27s+Chant). Of all the legendary creatures in this cycle, Oriss seems the most breakable, if not fundamentally broken. The obvious combination—in-Block even—is [Undertaker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Undertaker). It might be a bit of a problem setting them together, but once they are, the game is essentially over.

**[Linessa, Zephyr Mage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Linessa%2C+Zephyr+Mage)**

As above. Linessa might have the strongest non-grandeur ability of the bunch. 

**[Korlash, Heir to Blackblade](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Korlash%2C+Heir+to+Blackblade)**

Next to [Pact of Negation](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pact+of+Negation), Korlash is likely the strongest standalone card in *Future Sight*. He has a great body, is very difficult to kill, and his grandeur is actually cheaper than [Kodama's Reach](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kodama%27s+Reach) for a much more effective in-context mix of ability and acceleration. Don't forget that the card never says *basic* [Swamp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swamp)s! Korlash will retrieve [Watery Grave](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Watery+Grave)s and [Overgrown Tomb](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Overgrown+Tomb)s very nicely for years to come.

**[Tarox Bladewing](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarox+Bladewing)**

Interested in a turn-four—maybe even turn-three—win in Standard?

Two words: Pat Chapin I mean *[Weird Harvest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Weird+Harvest)*. 

**[Baru, Fist of Krosa](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Baru%2C+Fist+of+Krosa)**

With a name like "Fist of Krosa," you know Baru deserves at least a second look, and we've already talked *in this article* about the viability of a 4/4 for five. Baru combines the power of two of green's most successful specialties, land ramp and effective creatures great *and* small. Your Wurm creature tokens—contingent on having a particular large creature—threaten to really get out of hand, and the mini-[Overrun](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Overrun)s encourage swarms... but also make the Wurms look that much bigger. Don't forget the trample line! If your opponent forgets—and often there won't *be* a good block—just kill him.
