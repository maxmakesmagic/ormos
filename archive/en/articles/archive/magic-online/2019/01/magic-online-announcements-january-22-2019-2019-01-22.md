Pack-Per-Win Queue Retirement
-----------------------------


We are retiring the Pack-Per-Win queues starting tomorrow, January 23. It has become clear from participation data, based on the tail end of GRN season and the first weekend of RNA season, that this is not a tournament prize structure that is of interest to *Magic Online* players anymore. Rather than offer players a queue that's effectively a trap, we have chosen to focus player attention on the queues that will be a better experience.


Players are encouraged to finish their courses. When the league is retired, all remaining players will be prized out according to their accumulated wins up to that point.

Treasure Chest Updates
----------------------


Treasure chest contents and drop rates were updated with the release of *Ravnica Allegiance* on *Magic Online* last Thursday.


Click [here](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/magic-online/ravnica-allegiance-magic-online-edition-2019-01-11) to check out all the latest changes and goodies in store.

Leonin Arbiter Reverted Changes
-------------------------------


Our previous decision to make a quality-of-life update to [Leonin Arbiter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leonin+Arbiter)'s ability has caused more issues rather than solve them, so we've reverted the change as the best course of action. Regardless of the initial change, we are still hard at work exploring ways to make the interface better while maintaining playability in the future.
