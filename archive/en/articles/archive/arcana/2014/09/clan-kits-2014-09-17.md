Bonnie Bruenderman is a visual designer for DailyMTG. The authors write the articles; the editors edit; then she gets to add cards, images, funnies, charts, graphs... whatever the article needs above and beyond the text. She has a very nerdy sense of humor. (Someday, her illustrated mutant amalgamations shall take over the Multiverse! Patience, my pet. Patience.....) 






How big a fan of your clan are you? Can you use the raindrops as stepping stones? Do you make deals with dark forces to ensure your power or wreak thunder and death on your enemies from above?

1: So the quiz said I was Temur, but I am finding myself drawn more and more to the Jeskai. I'm just a poor lost soul who hasn't found a home on Tarkir yet. It must be because I'm really Simic at heart. <3 ( [Return](#_ftnref1) )
