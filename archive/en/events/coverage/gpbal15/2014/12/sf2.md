After fending off a fast assault in his semifinal match, Gerard Fabiano was ready to face down another face from his past. Reminiscing about times at Nationals and their early careers, Fabiano was one to wander and converse his way through matches.


His opponent, twenty-second-ranked and Pro Tour Hall of Fame member Ben Stark, was one to oblige in conversing. Echoing their time before they "were big-time" Stark shuffled his deck without missing a beat. Stark had already dispatched his teammate and twentieth-ranked Josh Utter-Leyton in their quarterfinal match with "one of the best decks [he] ever had in the format."


Fabiano was never much for convention, and headed in undeterred.



**The Games**




 Stark was off to a slow start against Fabiano in the first game, losing an early morphed [Ponyback Brigade](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ponyback+Brigade) as [Sultai Flayer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sultai+Flayer) and a morph built up across from him. [Debilitating Injury](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Debilitating+Injury) killed Fabiano's morph, and Raiders Spoils let Stark go to town with a few card-drawing triggers.
