With less than a week to go before Pro Tour *Born of the Gods*, it's time to take another look at the **Magic** Top 25 Pro Rankings. It was a strange week—there were two Grand Prix, and almost none of the ranked players attended either! In [Paris, France](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/magazine/article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/eventcoverage/gppar14/welcome) (not Texas), Jérémy Dezani and Christian Calcano tried their hand at Legacy. The Pro Tour *Theros* Champion Dezani lost his win-and-in for Day Two, and although Calcano got his fair share of wins, ending up on 10–4–1 after fifteen rounds, it wasn't enough for Pro Points. 

 For Limited fans, [Mexico City](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/magazine/article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/eventcoverage/gpmex14/welcome) was the venue on offer, and another Pro Tour Champion, Craig Wescoe, was in action. Unfortunately, Sealed Deck wasn't kind to Wescoe, and he couldn't advance to Day Two. Meanwhile, Marc Lalague picked up his second career Grand Prix title, putting him in perfect form for the Pro Tour in Valencia later this week. 

And so, that's where our attention turns. More than 400 competitors, all of the world's best gathered in one room, to battle across sixteen epic rounds of Draft and Modern. Twenty-five names, as ever, sit on our leaderboard. How many will still have their names on the list this time next week? Almost anything is possible, but this time next week could well be the moment for words like "seismic." Stay tuned.
