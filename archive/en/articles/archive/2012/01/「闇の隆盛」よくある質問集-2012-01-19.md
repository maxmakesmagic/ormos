An FAQ is a collection of clarifications and rulings involving the cards in a new **Magic: The Gathering** set. It's intended to make playing with these new cards more fun by clearing up the common misconceptions and confusion inevitably caused by new mechanics and interactions. As future sets are released, updates to the **Magic** rules may cause some of this information to become outdated. If you can't find the answer you're looking for here, please contact us at [www.wizards.com/customerservice](http://www.wizards.com/customerservice).

This FAQ has two sections, each of which serves a different purpose.

The first section ("General Notes") explains the mechanics and concepts in the set.

The second section ("Card-Specific Notes") contains answers to the most important, most common, and most confusing questions players might ask about cards in the set. Items in the "Card-Specific Notes" section include full card text for your reference. Not all cards in the set are listed.

### Returning Card Layout: Double-Faced Cards

**Returning Keyword Action: Transform**

The *Innistrad* set introduced double-faced cards, the first traditional **Magic** cards ever to not have the *Deckmaster* card back. Instead, they have two faces: a front face and a back face. In the *Dark Ascension* set, double-faced cards return with sinister innovations.

**Sinister Innovation #1: Noncreature Double-Faced Cards**

Some double-faced cards in the *Dark Ascension* set aren't creatures on one or both of their faces.



|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| (front face)  Soul Seizer  Creature -- Spirit  1/3  Flying  When Soul Seizer deals combat damage to a player, you may transform it. If you do, attach it to target creature that player controls. | (back face)  Ghastly Haunting  \*blue\*  Enchantment -- Aura  You control enchanted creature. |

</sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_legacy_migration/flipcard/flipcard_big.html?ca=m8tpdnjb6c&cb=76a2yjrunk&set=dka>

* Transforming a permanent doesn't affect any Auras or Equipment attached to that permanent, provided they can still legally be attached to it. Similarly, any counters on the permanent will remain on that permanent after it transforms, even if those counters don't have any visible effect (for example, a +1/+1 counter on a noncreature permanent).
* Damage marked on a double-faced permanent will stay marked on that permanent after it transforms, even if that permanent is no longer a creature.

**Sinister Innovation #2: Entering the Battlefield Transformed**

There is one card in the *Dark Ascension* set that can enter the battlefield with its back face up.



|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| (front face)  Loyal Cathar  Creature -- Human Soldier  2/2  Vigilance  When Loyal Cathar dies, return it to the battlefield transformed under your control at the beginning of the next end step. | (back face)  Unhallowed Cathar  \*black\*  Creature -- Zombie Soldier  2/1  Unhallowed Cathar can't block. |

</sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_legacy_migration/flipcard/flipcard_big.html?ca=zpp9zhw8hk&cb=l9euwh2ve5&set=dka>

* When Loyal Cathar dies, it will return to the battlefield with its back face (Unhallowed Cathar) up. It doesn't return to the battlefield and then transform.
* If a card that isn't a double-faced card becomes a copy of Loyal Cathar (due to Cytoshape, for example) and then dies, that card will return to the battlefield. It will no longer be a copy of Loyal Cathar and will simply have its printed characteristics.
* Another double-faced card that becomes a copy of Loyal Cathar and then dies will return to the battlefield with its back face up.
* If you gain control of a Loyal Cathar owned by another player and it dies, it will be put into to its owner's graveyard and then return to the battlefield under your control.

**Game Supplement: Checklist Cards**

It's important that the cards in your deck be indistinguishable from one another. To accomplish this with double-faced cards, you can use the checklist cards included in some *Dark Ascension* booster packs and in the *Dark Ascension* fat pack. These checklist cards have a list of all double-faced cards in the *Dark Ascension* set on one side and the typical **Magic** card back on the other side. (*Innistrad* checklist cards can be found in *Innistrad* booster packs.)

* You must have with you the actual double-faced card the checklist card is representing. The double-faced card should be kept apart from the rest of your deck. In tournaments, the double-faced card should also be kept separate from your sideboard.
* A checklist card can't be included in a deck except when it's being used to represent a double-faced card.
* You must mark exactly one fill-in circle on the checklist card to indicate which double-faced card it represents.
* You can still use card sleeves, even if you also choose to use checklist cards.
* During the game, a checklist card is considered to be the double-faced card it represents. For example, say you have a checklist card in your hand representing Loyal Cathar and an opponent casts [Despise](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Despise). The checklist card is a creature card, so your opponent may choose the checklist card and you would discard it.
* As soon as a checklist card enters a public zone (stack, battlefield, graveyard, or exile unless it's exiled face down), use the double-faced card and set the checklist card aside. If the double-faced card is put into a hidden zone (hand or library), use the checklist card again.
* If a double-faced card is exiled face down, keep its identity hidden by using the face-down checklist card.

**Returning *Innistrad* Themes and Mechanics**

For more information about double-faced cards, transform, color indicators, morbid, flashback, and Curses, see the *Innistrad* FAQ at [http://www.wizards.com/Magic/TCG/Resources.aspx?x=magic/rules/faqs](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/TCG/Resources.aspx?x=magic/rules/faqs).

**New Keyword: Undying**

On Innistrad, the more pernicious creatures are especially resistant to mortal wounds. Undying is an ability that brings a creature back from the dead, stronger than before.


> ![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/tcg/products/dka/lit1p8pdzb_en.jpg)Nearheath Stalker   
> ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20160830042801im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless4.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227130159im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/red.gif)  
>  Creature -- Vampire Rogue   
>  4/1   
>  Undying (When this creature dies, if it had no +1/+1 counters on it, return it to the battlefield under its owner's control with a +1/+1 counter on it.)

The official rules for undying are as follows:


> 702.91. Undying
> 
> 
> 702.91a Undying is a triggered ability. "Undying" means "When this permanent is put into a graveyard from the battlefield, if it had no +1/+1 counters on it, return it to the battlefield under its owner's control with a +1/+1 counter on it."
> 
> 
> 

* Each card with undying is a creature. If one of them stops being a creature, undying will still work.
* The undying ability triggers when the permanent is put into a graveyard. Its last known information (that is, how the creature last existed on the battlefield) is used to determine whether it had a +1/+1 counter on it.
* If a permanent has multiple instances of undying, they'll each trigger separately, but the redundant instances will have no effect. If one instance returns the card to the battlefield, the next to resolve will do nothing.
* If a token with no +1/+1 counters on it has undying, the ability will trigger when the token is put into the graveyard. However, the token will cease to exist and can't return to the battlefield.
* When a permanent with undying returns to the battlefield, it's a new object with no memory of or connection to its previous existence.
* If multiple creatures with undying are put into the graveyard at the same time (due to combat damage or a spell that destroys all creatures, for example), the active player (the player whose turn it is) puts all of his or her undying triggers on the stack in any order, then each other player in turn order does the same. The last trigger put on the stack is the first one that resolves. That means that in a two-player game, the nonactive player's undying creatures will return to the battlefield first, then the active player's undying creatures do the same. The creatures return to the battlefield one at a time.
* If a creature with undying that has a +1/+1 counter on it receives enough -1/-1 counters to cause it to be destroyed by lethal damage or put into its owner's graveyard for having 0 or less toughness, undying won't trigger and the card won't return to the battlefield. That's because undying checks the creature's existence just before it leaves the battlefield, and it still has all those counters on it at that point.

**New Ability Word: Fateful Hour**

Fateful hour is an ability word. It appears in italics at the beginning of abilities that improve if you're at 5 or less life. (An ability word has no rules meaning.)


> ![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/tcg/products/dka/46gb31fmpe_en.jpg)Gavony Ironwright   
> ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161225105850im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless2.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227125855im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/white.gif)  
>  Creature -- Human Soldier   
>  1/4   
>  Fateful hour -- As long as you have 5 or less life, other creatures you control get +1/+4.

* Some fateful hour abilities that appear on instants and sorceries use the word "instead." The spells have an upgraded effect if you have 5 or less life at the time they resolve. You receive only the upgraded effect, not both effects.
* Other instants and sorceries have fateful hour abilities that don't use the word "instead." They provide an additional effect if you have 5 or less life at the time they resolve.
* Some fateful hour abilities (like Gavony Ironwright's) are static abilities. These abilities constantly check whether you have 5 or less life to see if the bonus applies. These abilities function only on the battlefield.
* A creature whose toughness is being increased by a fateful hour ability loses that bonus as soon as its controller has 6 or more life. If damage marked on the creature is greater than or equal to its toughness after the fateful hour ability stops applying, the creature is destroyed and put into its owner's graveyard.

**Cycle: "Increasing" Flashback Spells**

A cycle of cards with flashback in the *Dark Ascension* set have an increased effect when cast from a graveyard. They all have the word "Increasing" in their names.


> ![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/tcg/products/dka/7npqzfe1it_en.jpg)Increasing Savagery   
> ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161225105850im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless2.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20220123123600im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/green.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20220123123600im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/green.gif)  
>  Sorcery   
>  Put five +1/+1 counters on target creature. If Increasing Savagery was cast from a graveyard, put ten +1/+1 counters on that creature instead.   
>  Flashback ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20170413132456im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless5.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20220123123600im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/green.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20220123123600im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/green.gif) (You may cast this card from your graveyard for its flashback cost. Then exile it.)

* Although flashback is the most common way to cast a spell from a graveyard, you get the bigger effect if you cast an Increasing spell from a graveyard through any means.
* The targeting requirement (if any) of an Increasing spell doesn't change, even if you're casting the card from a graveyard. Increasing Savagery always targets a single creature, for example.
* If an Increasing card was cast from a graveyard, it has only the increased effect, not both effects.

**Rules Note: Activated Abilities and Sacrificing Creatures**

Many cards in both the *Innistrad* and *Dark Ascension* sets have activated abilities that include sacrificing a creature as part of the activation cost (costs appear before the colon (:) in an activated ability). Other cards in these sets have triggered abilities when trigger whenever a creature dies.

* An activated ability is put on the stack just prior to its cost being paid. If paying this cost causes any triggered abilities to trigger, those abilities are put on the stack after the activated ability.
* If multiple triggered abilities trigger at the same time, the active player puts his or her abilities on the stack in any order, then each other player in turn order does the same. The abilities controlled by the last player to do so will resolve first. The active player's triggered abilities will resolve last.
* All triggered abilities in this case will resolve before the activated ability whose cost caused them to trigger.

### CARD-SPECIFIC NOTES



|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| (front face)  Afflicted Deserter  Creature -- Human Werewolf  3/2  At the beginning of each upkeep, if no spells were cast last turn, transform Afflicted Deserter. | (back side)  Werewolf Ransacker  \*red\*  Creature -- Werewolf  5/4  Whenever this creature transforms into Werewolf Ransacker, you may destroy target artifact. If that artifact is put into a graveyard this way, Werewolf Ransacker deals 3 damage to that artifact's controller.  At the beginning of each upkeep, if a player cast two or more spells last turn, transform Werewolf Ransacker. |

</sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_legacy_migration/flipcard/flipcard_big.html?ca=de7lprp5q7&cb=2fogew93ji&set=dka>

* You choose the target artifact when Werewolf Ransacker's first triggered ability goes on the stack. You choose whether or not to destroy the artifact when that ability resolves.
* If the targeted artifact is indestructible or regenerates (or you choose not to destroy it), Werewolf Ransacker doesn't deal damage to that artifact's controller. Similarly, if the targeted artifact is destroyed but a replacement effect moves it to a different zone instead of its owner's graveyard, Werewolf Ransacker doesn't deal damage to that artifact's controller.
* An artifact token that's destroyed is put into its owner's graveyard before it ceases to exist. If a token is destroyed by Werewolf Ransacker ability, Werewolf Ransacker deals damage to that token's controller.
* If something becomes a copy of Werewolf Ransacker, that doesn't count as "transforming into Werewolf Ransacker." The first triggered ability of the new Werewolf Ransacker doesn't trigger.

>  Sorcery   
>  Target creature an opponent controls deals damage equal to its power to each other creature that player controls, then each of those creatures deals damage equal to its power to that creature.

* The two parts of Alpha Brawl's effect happen sequentially: first the targeted creature deals damage, then the other creatures deal damage. State-based actions aren't checked in the middle, so creatures that are dealt lethal damage by the targeted creature will still deal damage.
* None of the damage dealt due to Alpha Brawl is combat damage.
* Combat abilities like first strike, double strike, and trample don't apply and will have no impact on Alpha Brawl's effect.
* Abilities like lifelink and deathtouch that care about any kind of damage are taken into account.
* If the targeted creature has infect or wither, the damage it deals will result in -1/-1 counters being put on each creature it deals damage to. The power of those creatures will be reduced when they deal damage back to the targeted creature.
* The damage dealt by the targeted creature is not divided in any way. For example, if a 3/3 creature is targeted, it will deal 3 damage to each other creature controlled by its controller.

* Altar of the Lost doesn't allow you to cast spells from any other player's graveyard, although you can spend the mana it produces on such spells if something else allows you to.
* You can spend mana produced by Altar of the Lost to cast any spell with flashback that you cast from a graveyard. You don't have to be using flashback to cast that spell, however, as long as something else is allowing you to cast that spell.

* If you have no cards in your graveyard, you won't gain any life, but you'll still shuffle your library.

* In order to activate the ability, you must be able to target a creature with power less than or equal to the number of creatures you control. The comparison is made again when the ability resolves. If the power is greater than the number of creatures you control at that time, the target is illegal and the ability is countered.
* The control-changing effect lasts indefinitely, even if the power of the creature becomes greater than the number of creatures you control after the ability resolves.

>  Enchantment -- Aura Curse   
>  Enchant player   
>  If a source would deal damage to enchanted player, it deals double that damage to that player instead.

* Curse of Bloodletting works with any damage, not just combat damage. It also doesn't matter who controls the source of the damage that's being dealt.
* The source of the damage doesn't change. A spell that deals damage will specify the source of the damage, often the spell itself. An ability that deals damage will also specify the source of the damage, although the ability itself will never be that source. Often the source of the ability is also the source of the damage.
* If more than one Curse of Bloodletting enchants the same player, damage dealt to that player will double for each one (two of them will end up multiplying the damage by four, three of them by eight, and four of them by sixteen).
* If multiple effects modify how damage will be dealt to the enchanted player, that player chooses the order to apply the effects. For example, Mending Hands says, "Prevent the next 4 damage that would be dealt to target creature or player this turn." Suppose a spell would deal 5 damage to enchanted player and that player has cast Mending Hands targeting him or herself. The enchanted player can either (a) prevent 4 damage first and then let Curse of Bloodletting's effect double the remaining 1 damage, taking 2 damage, or (b) double the damage to 10 and then prevent 4 damage, taking 6 damage.
* If the enchanted player controls a planeswalker and noncombat damage is being dealt to the player from a source controlled by an opponent, the enchanted player will choose whether to apply Curse of Bloodletting or the planeswalker redirection effect first. If the player chooses to apply the planeswalker redirection effect first, and the opponent chooses to redirect the damage to the planeswalker, then Curse of Bloodletting won't double the damage.

>  Enchant player   
>  Whenever enchanted player casts an instant or sorcery spell, each other player may copy that spell and may choose new targets for the copy he or she controls.

* When the triggered ability resolves, it creates a copy of that spell for each other player. The active player creates his or her copy and may choose new targets first (if that player isn't the enchanted player), then each other player (except the enchanted player) creates his or her copy and may choose new targets in turn order. The last player who creates his or her copy controls the copy that will resolve first.
* All the copies are created on the stack, so none of them are cast. Abilities that trigger when a player casts a spell won't trigger. The copies will then resolve as normal, after players get a chance to cast spells and activate abilities.
* Each copy will have the same targets as the spell it's copying unless its controller chooses new ones. That player may change any number of the targets, including all of them or none of them. If, for one of the targets, that player can't choose a new legal target, then it remains unchanged (even if the current target is illegal).
* If the original spell is modal (that is, it says "Choose one --" or the like), each copy will have the same mode(s). You can't choose different ones.
* If the original spell has an X whose value was determined as it was cast, each copy has the same value of X.
* You can't choose to pay any additional costs for the copy. However, effects based on any additional costs that were paid for the original spell are copied as though those same costs were paid for the copy too. For example, if the enchanted player sacrifices a 3/3 creature to cast Fling, each copy of Fling will also deal 3 damage.

* The "legend rule" checks only for permanents with exactly the same name. Elbrus, the Binding Blade and Withengar Unbound can be on the battlefield at the same time without either going to its owner's graveyard.
* Elbrus will transform even if you are unable to unattach it (most likely because the equipped creature died).
* If the equipped creature deals combat damage to more than one player at the same time, perhaps because some of its combat damage was redirected, Elbrus's ability will trigger once for each player it deals combat damage to. This may cause it to become unattached, transform, then transform again. If it transforms back into Elbrus, it will remain unattached.
* Withengar's triggered ability will trigger no matter how a player loses the game: due to a state-based action (as a result of having a life total of 0 or less, trying to draw a card from an empty library, or having ten poison counters), a spell or ability that says that player loses the game, a concession, or a game loss awarded by a judge.
* In a multiplayer game using the limited range of influence option (such as a Grand Melee game), if a spell or ability says that you win the game, it instead causes all of your opponents within your range of influence to lose the game. This is another way by which Withengar's ability can trigger.

* A "non-Human Werewolf" is a creature that is a Werewolf but is not a Human.

Then exile it.)

* Increasing Vengeance can target (and copy) any instant or sorcery spell you control, not just one with targets.
* When Increasing Vengeance resolves, it creates one or two copies of a spell. You control each of the copies. Those copies are created on the stack, so they're not "cast." Abilities that trigger when a player casts a spell won't trigger. The copies will then resolve like normal spells, after players get a chance to cast spells and activate abilities.
* Each of the copies will have the same targets as the spell it's copying unless you choose new ones. You may change any number of the targets, including all of them or none of them. If, for one of the targets, you can't choose a new legal target, then it remains unchanged (even if the current target is illegal). If there are two copies, you may change the targets of each of them to different legal targets.
* If the spell Increasing Vengeance copies is modal (that is, it says "Choose one --" or the like), the copies will have the same mode(s). You can't choose different ones.
* If the spell Increasing Vengeance copies has an X whose value was determined as it was cast (like [Earthquake](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Earthquake) does), the copy has the same value of X.
* You can't choose to pay any additional costs for the copies. However, effects based on any additional costs that were paid for the original spell are copied as though those same costs were paid for the copies too. For example, if you sacrifice a 3/3 creature to cast Fling and then copy it with Increasing Vengeance, the copies of Fling will also deal 3 damage to its target.

* Removing an attacking creature from combat doesn't untap that creature.
* Because Lost in the Woods will trigger once for each creature that attacks you or a planeswalker you control, it's important to specify which trigger is associated with which attacking creature before revealing any cards.

* The ability affects each spell that's not a creature spell, including your own.
* The ability affects the total cost of each noncreature spell, but it doesn't change that spell's mana cost or converted mana cost.
* When determining a spell's total cost, effects that increase the cost are applied before effects that reduce the cost.

* You can activate Wolfbitten Captive's ability, let it transform into Krallenhorde Killer, then activate Krallenhorde Killer's ability, all on the same turn, and vice versa.
* If you activate one face's ability, and some effect causes the card to transform twice that turn, you won't be able to activate that face's ability again that turn.

* Only the equipped creature's controller can activate the abilities it gains from Wolfhunter's Quiver.
* For each of the activated abilities, the equipped creature is the source of the ability and the damage. For example, if the equipped creature is not an artifact, you could activate either ability targeting a creature with protection from artifacts.
* You could activate the first ability targeting a Werewolf creature if you wanted to.
