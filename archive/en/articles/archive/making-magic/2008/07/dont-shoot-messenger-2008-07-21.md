| **IM Conversation With: White****White:** Maro?**Maro:** Oh, hello, the color White.**Maro:** One of the many abstract concepts that I like to talk to by instant message.**Maro:** What's shakin'?**White:** I'm just tweaking some numbers in my spreadsheets.**White:** Later, I'm going to oppress people who don't think the way I do.**Maro:** Sounds like a wild night.**White:** Are you busy?**Maro:** Sort of. I'm writing my column.**Maro:** In it, I outline some of the techniques I use to be more creative.**White:** In list form?**Maro:** But of course.**White:** w00t!**White:** I mean, this pleases me.**Maro:** Technique #1 is Wait for Divine Inspiration.**Maro:** If you stare at a blank screen long enough, an old man from outer space will eventually tell you what to do.**White:** Is that even true?**Maro:** In my experience, yes.**White:** All my god ever seems to do is destroy all of my little men.**Maro:** I guess I'm just lucky. Mine supplies me with article gimmicks. |
| **IM Conversation With: Roderick Van Ouch****Roderick Van Ouch:** Maro, how are things?**Maro:** Things are good.**Maro:** I'm working on an article about how to be more creative.**Roderick Van Ouch:** That's great to hear.**Roderick Van Ouch:** I've noticed that in recent weeks you haven't mentioned my classic guide to creativity *A Roundhouse Kick to the Chops*, nor its increasingly violent but equally enlightening follow-ups *An Elbow to the Solar Plexus* and *A Football in the Groin*.**Roderick Van Ouch:** You remember our deal.**Maro:** You won't let me forget it.**Roderick Van Ouch:** If you don't mention my books soon, I'll have to self-publish another one. I'm going to call it *A Slap Across Your Face*.**Roderick Van Ouch:** Early reviews are unfavorable.**Maro:** I don't know what that means, but I'll mention them this week. |
| **IM Conversation With: White****Maro:** Oh, White, I've been meaning to ask you something.**Maro:** How did that party go a few weeks ago?**White:** It was a disaster. Everyone left in tears.**Maro:** That's too bad. Sorry I had to duck out early.**Maro:** **Magic** needed ruining and it couldn't wait. |
| **IM Conversation With: Evil Mark Rosewater****Evil Mark Rosewater:** Bro?**Maro:** What do *you* want?**Evil Mark Rosewater:** Don't be like that. Who says I want something?**Maro:** Just a hunch.**Evil Mark Rosewater:** We've been twins for, what? Two, three months?**Maro:** All our lives.**Evil Mark Rosewater:** Right. And in all that time, have I ever once asked you for a favor?**Maro:** No, but you've demanded them.**Evil Mark Rosewater:** You say, "Tomato," I say, "Give me that tomato or I'll cut you." |
| **IM Conversation With: White****White:** I just hooked up with red and black.**Maro:** Both of them?**White:** Yeah. What can I say? I have a thing for dwarves and nasty-looking old ladies.**Maro:** Do they know you're two-timing?**White:** Not yet.**Maro:** What about your sense of honor? What about chivalry?**White:** I'm sure they will kick in eventually.**White:** That's why the relationships won't last. I give them three months, tops. |
| **IM Conversation With: Evil Mark Rosewater****Maro:** Maybe you can help me, too. I'm writing about creativity.**Evil Mark Rosewater:** Great. My least favorite subject.**Maro:** I'm at Technique #2: Steal!**Evil Mark Rosewater:** Now you're talking my language.**Evil Mark Rosewater:** As I famously said, "Talent borrows. Genius steals."**Maro:** That was my line!**Evil Mark Rosewater:** Philosophy in action, folks. |
| **IM Conversation With: White****White:** I need some more advice.**Maro:** Really? After how things went last time?**Maro:** I'm not sure if I should be playing matchmaker.**White:** I'm having a crisis of faith.**Maro:** Oh?**White:** All I ever do is ruin other people's fun.**White:** It's always prevent this, destroy that. Players can't do X, Y, or Z.**White:** I'm the biggest stick-in-the-mud in all of **Magic**.**Maro:** I'll keep that in mind. |
| **IM Conversation With: Evil Mark Rosewater****Maro:** "Steal!" is just a dramatic way of saying, "Draw inspiration from anywhere."**Evil Mark Rosewater:** You mean like the time you "drew inspiration" from my diary and created Yawgmoth's Bargain?**Maro:** You made Yawgmoth's Bargain!**Maro:** Then you snuck it into the set while I was out breeding creativity with an old pair of restrictions!**Evil Mark Rosewater:** Oh, yeah. Right. What do you mean, then?**Maro:** I'll give you an example. |
| **IM Conversation With: White****White:** I just need to loosen up a bit.**White:** Take off my hair and let down my glasses.**Maro:** Live a little.**White:** Yeah. That's why I want to hook up with Timmy at tonight's party.**Maro:** Timmy, the player psychographic?**White:** Yeah. I get a real adrenaline rush whenever we're together.**White:** I feel so calm and free, like nothing else matters.**White:** Do you think there's a chance?**Maro:** Why not? |
| **IM Conversation With: Evil Mark Rosewater****Maro:** One morning, several years ago, I was sitting in my kitchen, eating a piping-hot bowl of cream of wheat.**Evil Mark Rosewater:** You live a life of danger!**Maro:** As I stared into this mushy glob of tastelessness, I became inspired.**Maro:** I asked myself, "Self, if cream of wheat was a **Magic** card, what would it look like?"**Evil Mark Rosewater:** And?**Maro:** Long story short, that's how *Mercadian Masques* came to be. |
| **IM Conversation With: Ga'Aark****Ga'Aark:** Brains.**Maro:** Oh, hi, Ga'Aark. I haven't heard from you in a while.**Maro:** What's on your mind?**Ga'Aark:** Brains.**Maro:** Same here. I'm fascinated by how our brains work.**Maro:** In fact, I'm writing a column about how to be more creative.**Ga'Aark:** Brains.**Maro:** Yes, by using our brains!**Maro:** So far, I'm up to Technique #3: Resurrect Old Ideas.**Maro:** If it's been rotting in a hole in the ground for years, it's gotta be good.**Maro:** I'm sure you can appreciate that one. |
| **IM Conversation With: Evil Mark Rosewater****Evil Mark Rosewater:** Enough with this "creativity" crap.**Maro:** What do you want to talk about, then?**Evil Mark Rosewater:** I think I'm in love with a Goblin.**Maro:** A Goblin? Which one?**Evil Mark Rosewater:** You know which one.**Maro:** Steamflogger Boss.**Evil Mark Rosewater:** Obviously. It's a cruel taskmaster *and* its meaningless ability might cause the end of **Magic** as we know it.**Maro:** I can see why you like it.**Evil Mark Rosewater:** There's a party tonight. S.B.'s going to be there.**Evil Mark Rosewater:** Would you put in a good word for me?**Maro:** I'll see what I can do. |
| **IM Conversation With: The Swordfish****The Swordfish:** Maro, I need you to pick me up in 20 minutes.**Maro:** What, again?**The Swordfish:** Yeah. And this time, don't leave me alone with some Armani-suited psycho who wants to eat me for lunch. I barely swashbuckled my way out of that one.**Maro:** Sorry.**The Swordfish:** Don't worry about it. The person who's really got to worry is that guy in the Armani suit. If I ever see him again, it'll be for the last time. This scimitar stuck to my beak isn't just for show, you know.**Maro:** It is very pointy.**Maro:** Do you remember what Mr. Armani looks like?**The Swordfish:** Not really.**The Swordfish:** Anyway, I've got to get to this party. Pick me up. |
| **IM Conversation With: Roderick Van Ouch****Maro:** Are you going to this party too?**Roderick Van Ouch:** Unfortunately, I can't go. I'm too busy trying to figure out what a box of raisins has in common with parliamentary democracy.**Maro:** Why?**Roderick Van Ouch:** I'm giving a seminar on Micronesian Macroeconomics.**Maro:** Oh, of course.**Roderick Van Ouch:** Or is it Macronesian Microeconomics?**Maro:** I wouldn't know. But good luck.**Roderick Van Ouch:** Thanks. Better get back to these raisins... |
| **IM Conversation With: The Swordfish****Maro:** Why don't you drive there yourself?**The Swordfish:** You know my flippers can't reach the pedals.**The Swordfish:** Plus, I've had too many adult beverages.**Maro:** You drink like a fish.**The Swordfish:** ...**The Swordfish:** That was embarrassing.**Maro:** All right. See you in twenty. |
| **IM Conversation With: Ga'Aark****Ga'Aark:** Brains.**Maro:** By the way, I'm really sorry that we haven't been making many Zombies lately.**Maro:** It's just that the creative demands of recent sets haven't been very accommodating to corpsekind.**Maro:** I guess you'll always have *Onslaught* Block, though, huh?**Ga'Aark:** Brians.**Maro:** Yes, I believe both Brian Schneider and Brian Tinsman had a hand in making some of your undead compatriots from that era.**Ga'Aark:** That was a typo. |
| **IM Conversation With: Steamflogger Boss****Steamflogger Boss:** Maro, how's tricks?**Maro:** Oh, it's you. Let me guess. You're going to a party tonight.**Steamflogger Boss:** How did you know?**Maro:** Let's just say a little birdie told me.**Maro:** Plus, I'm writing all this dialogue. |
| **IM Conversation With: Ga'Aark****Ga'Aark:** What's a guy got to do to get some brains around here?**Maro:** Might I suggest prying open a human skull.**Ga'Aark:** Too easy.**Ga'Aark:** I like when they play hard to get. |
| **IM Conversation With: Steamflogger Boss****Steamflogger Boss:** All of the unloved cards are going to be at this party.**Steamflogger Boss:** Me and Squire and the entire graduating class from Homelands High.**Steamflogger Boss:** If you're not busy, you should come. |
| **IM Conversation With: Ga'Aark****Ga'Aark:** I have a confession to make.**Maro:** Oh?**Ga'Aark:** Promise you won't be mad.**Maro:** I promise.**Ga'Aark:** I have a crush on your evil twin brother.**Maro:** ...**Maro:** I guess he does have a lot of brains, being my twin and all.**Ga'Aark:** Precisely.**Maro:** It's just that they're evil brains.**Ga'Aark:** That only makes them even more delicious. |
| **IM Conversation With: Grok****Grok:** Maro, what's up?**Maro:** Grok! My most empathetic imaginary friend.**Grok:** Got a sec?**Maro:** I'm writing a column, but a little procrastination never hurt anybody. |
| **IM Conversation With: Steamflogger Boss****Maro:** I do have a column to write. It's about different ways to be creative.**Maro:** I just got to Technique #4: Beat a Dead Horse.**Steamflogger Boss:** Can it be a dead Goblin?**Maro:** Sure. It's only a metaphor.**Steamflogger Boss:** Oh. Never mind, then.**Maro:** The point is that sometimes that horse isn't quite as dead as you think it is. |
| **IM Conversation With: Grok****Grok:** I'm going to a party later and I need some advice.**Maro:** Shoot.**Grok:** Do you think there's a chance that Ga'Aark and I could get together?**Maro:** You mean as a couple?**Grok:** Yeah.**Maro:** A union between a Zombie and, uh, whatever it is that you are is a little unorthodox.**Grok:** I know, but I think it could work.**Maro:** Anything's possible. Just look at Julia Roberts and Lyle Lovett.**Grok:** Very topical, Mark. |
| **IM Conversation With: Steamflogger Boss****Steamflogger Boss:** I like to flog things, but with steam.**Steamflogger Boss:** Don't ask me how it works, though.**Maro:** Why, trade secret?**Steamflogger Boss:** No, it just makes no sense. |
| **IM Conversation With: Grok****Grok:** I'm tired of dating regular humans. They're just too complex.**Maro:** Yeah, especially their brains.**Maro:** Did I mention I'm writing a column about creativity?**Maro:** In case you're wondering, Technique #5 is Sleep On It.**Maro:** For example, Einstein came up with the Theory of Relativity after a long nap.**Grok:** I find that highly suspect.**Maro:** And I wrote entire episodes of *Roseanne* while in a somnambulistic trance.**Grok:** That I believe. |
| **IM Conversation With: Steamflogger Boss****Steamflogger Boss:** I've been a little frustrated lately.**Maro:** How so?**Steamflogger Boss:** Just...irritable at work, you know? Grumpy.**Maro:** Go on.**Steamflogger Boss:** What I'm trying to say is that I didn't flog my way up to middle-management only to have to spend my days wrangling a pack of rock-eating morons.**Maro:** Isn't that what middle-management does?**Steamflogger Boss:** Touché. |
| **IM Conversation With: Timmy****Timmy:** Maro, you around?**Maro:** Yeah, Timmy. Just putting the finishing touches on my column.**Timmy:** I need to ask you a question.**Maro:** Fire away.**Timmy:** Why does everybody hate me?**Maro:** Everybody doesn't hate you.**Maro:** Only the overwhelming majority of people hate you.**Timmy:** I think it's because people don't understand me.**Timmy:** They think I'm some kind of idiot, but I'm not.**Maro:** I know, Timmy.**Timmy:** I just have different priorities. |
| **IM Conversation With: Grok****Grok:** I want someone with uncomplicated motivations.**Grok:** Ga'Aark is someone who knows exactly what he wants.**Maro:** You mean brains.**Grok:** Right. I just don't know how to go about getting to know him.**Maro:** You need to find some common ground.**Grok:** I don't understand.**Maro:** Look for values you share, activities you can do together.**Grok:** *No comprende, amigo.***Maro:** Try to figure out if something that you're passionate about, something that you love to do, lines up with Ga'Aark's passions.**Grok:** I'm not sure I follow.**Maro:** Let me put it this way: Do you like to eat brains?**Grok:** I don't know. A little.**Maro:** Go with that. |
| **IM Conversation With: Timmy****Timmy:** I'm thinking of changing my name.**Maro:** Really? To what?**Timmy:** I don't know yet. To something a little more grown-up.**Timmy:** Maybe Tim or Timothy.**Timmy:** What do you think of Timbaland?**Maro:** I think it's taken. |
| **IM Conversation With: Steamflogger Boss****Steamflogger Boss:** Productivity is way down, our margins are shrinking.**Steamflogger Boss:** My employees eat half of our raw materials.**Steamflogger Boss:** What I need is a reliable work-force, one that can coexist peacefully and work together as a team towards a common goal, one that can follow directions.**Steamflogger Boss:** What I need is White. |
| **IM Conversation With: Assistant Steamflogger Boss****Assistant** **Steamflogger Boss:** No, you don't! I can right this ship! |
| **IM Conversation With: Steamflogger Boss****Steamflogger Boss:** Tell him to shut up.**Maro:** How did you know he sent me a message?**Steamflogger Boss:** The omniscient narrator.**Steamflogger Boss:** And that guy's not the Assistant Steamflogger Boss. |
| **IM Conversation With: Assistant to the Steamflogger Boss****Assistant to the** **Steamflogger Boss:** Fine. I still think I can right this ship. |
| **IM Conversation With: Timmy****Timmy:** You know who does understand me? Grok.**Timmy:** Grok really gets what I'm about.**Timmy:** I can be myself around Grok, slinging spells for the sheer thrill of it.**Timmy:** Win or lose, it doesn't matter. |
| **IM Conversation With: White****Maro:** This might be a little awkward.**White:** What do you mean?**Maro:** Well, have you ever thought of hitting on Steamflogger Boss?**White:** No, not once. In fact, the idea disgusts me. |
| **IM Conversation With: Evil Mark Rosewater****Maro:** Do you have a Plan B for tonight? What about Ga'Aark?**Evil Mark Rosewater:** That is possibly the dumbest thing you've ever said. |
| **IM Conversation With: Timmy****Maro:** Timmy, I'm just wondering something.**Maro:** Would you consider making a move on White?**Timmy:** Are you kidding? White's about as fun as a whack on the side of the head. |
| **IM Conversation With: Mistform Ultimus****Mistform Ultimus:** Hey, Maro.**Maro:** You're like a bad penny. |
| **IM Conversation With: Steamflogger Boss****Maro:** What do you think of my evil twin brother? Any romantic interest?**Steamflogger Boss:** You can't be serious. |
| **IM Conversation With: Mistform Ultimus****Mistform Ultimus:** I'm going to this party tonight.**Maro:** And you need some advice.**Mistform Ultimus:** Yeah. What should I be?**Maro:** Well, you have a lot of options. |
| **IM Conversation With: Grok****Maro:** If Ga'Aark isn't interested, maybe you should direct your attention to Timmy.**Grok:** Timmy? That lamer? I'd rather Terror myself with a rusty Terror. |  |
| **IM Conversation With: Mistform Ultimus****Mistform Ultimus:** I was thinking of going as a Giant Dwarf.**Maro:** People love the oxymorons.**Mistform Ultimus:** Or maybe a Treefolk Splinter.**Maro:** Cute. How about just being a Pest?**Maro:** I think you can pull it off. |
| **IM Conversation With: Ga'Aark****Maro:** Hey, Ga'Aark, if things don't pan out with my brother, how do you feel about Grok?**Ga'Aark:** Brains.**Maro:** Oh, I give up.**Maro:** This is going to be painful. |
| **IM Conversation With: Mistform Ultimus****Maro:** Sigh. Is there someone you're trying to impress?**Mistform Ultimus:** Yeah, this hot Swordfish I met down at my local watering hole.**Maro:** Oh, then wear an Armani suit.**Mistform Ultimus:** Really?**Maro:** Yeah. They're very popular among swordfish these days.**Mistform Ultimus:** Thanks, Maro. I knew I could count on you.**Maro:** See you at the party! |
