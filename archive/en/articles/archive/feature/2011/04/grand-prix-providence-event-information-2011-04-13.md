Just because it's the beginning of the summer season in New England doesn't mean this event won't be hotter than the sun! With invitations to Pro Tour Philadelphia going to the top 16 finishers, everyone has their eyes on the prize.

In addition to $30,000 in cash prizes, Pro Tour invitations for the top 16 finishers, and exclusive foil promo cards for participants, Grand Prix feature a host of other activities, including public events and artist signings (prizes subject to change).

Grand Prix Providence takes place in the Rhode Island Convention Center, located just 11 miles away from TF Green International Airport in Warwick, Rhode Island. The Convention Center is connected to the Providence Place Mall via the Westin Hotel. There are many available restaurants, as well as a great food court in the mall.


The best part of getting to Grand Prix Providence is how accessible it is via public transportation!


**Air Travel**
  
[TF Green International Airport](http://www.pvdairport.com/) in Warwick, RI is just a few miles away!   
[Logan Airport in Boston](http://www.massport.com/LOGAN-AIRPORT/Pages/Default.aspx) is less than 1 hour away.   
 Both Logan and TF Green have rail service to downtown Providence, two blocks from the Convention Center. 


**Train Travel**
  
 Both major airports offers connecting train service to [Providence](http://www.mbta.com/schedules_and_maps/rail/lines/?route=PROVSTOU), and the station is two blocks from the Convention Center. You can also take the [Amtrak train](http://tickets.amtrak.com/itd/Amtrak) directly from downtown Boston to Providence. From New York you can take the [Amtrak train](http://tickets.amtrak.com/itd/Amtrak) directly to Providence.


**Bus Travel**
  
[The Kennedy Plaza](http://www.ripta.com/news/index.php?section=10), Providence's historic transportation center, offers regional bus service as well as [Amtrak train](http://tickets.amtrak.com/itd/Amtrak) service for the [Peter Pan](http://www.peterpanbus.com/) and [Greyhound](http://www.greyhound.com/) bus lines.

**Public Transportation**
  
 Providence LINK Trolley is your link to the city's most popular destinations. Enjoy Providence the environmentally sensitive way, avoid the parking hassles and reach the city's key attractions. LINK trolleys run on CNG (compressed natural gas), a clean fuel, and offer two routes to take you to Providence's restaurants, hotels, theaters, universities, historic sites, shopping and more. Cost: $2 per person per Ride (See the [Link webpage](http://www.ripta.com/schedules/index.php?section=70) for schedule and information.)


**About Providence**
  
 Since many players combine a Grand Prix weekend with vacation time both before and after the event, we've assembled a small collection of links about the city and some of its points of interest.


With more restaurants per capita than any other major city in America, Providence—home to the Johnson and Wales University Culinary Institute—legitimately lays claim to being one of the nation's best places to eat.


These are all recommended for excellent places to get some delicious food and chill out after a competitive day of slinging spells.
