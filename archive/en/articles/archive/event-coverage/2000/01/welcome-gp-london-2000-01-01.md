With 552 players, it's the largest tournament ever run in the United Kingdom. The quality of the field is showing, too. Many of the world's top players are making the trip to London and then travelling across to New York for the team Pro Tour next weekend.


People are being drawn to the event for many reasons. The Invasion block constructed format is very popular with all kinds of players. A new Player of the Year race has begun. All the big names are looking to be the next person to claim the coveted title. Players with 0 Pro points are drawn in by the new Amateur awards, which award $7,500 to the top players who have never played a professional event.


Unusually, the hottest topic of conversation at the Grand Prix is not what decks are the best to play, or the latest Pro Tour gossip. Tonight, at 6:30pm local time, England play Germany in a football World Cup qualifying match. It's a vital match for both sides, and all the supporters know it.
