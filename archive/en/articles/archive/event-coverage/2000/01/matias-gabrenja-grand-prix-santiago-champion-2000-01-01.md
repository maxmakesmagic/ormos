The deck's name is Mr. Wilson. It's because we put an Obliterate in the sideboard as a joke. In the Argentinian Nationals, some players put a Coalition Victory in their sideboards, just to give some help to their opponents.


I played it because, thanks to the UG, I won $180 and my third bye so there was no reason to stop playing it. When I saw the version with red, i even liked it more and with some friends we modified a lot of times until we got to the final version. We started with David Price's version, but we didn't like it at all because it was just like 4 of every card, so we cut out some cards to add another ones.


*Why did you thought it was the best deck to play?*  

With all my playtesting, I knew that I had a very bad matchup against Domain and Solution/No-Mar but, as the only ones playing these two deck would be the Americans I thought my chances were very good.


*What does it feel to make your first Top 8 in an international tournament, and even more, win it?*  

It's great! More than great, excellent! Really I didn't come to win the tournament, it was more to have some vacation, miss some school days and have fun....and well. I won. And I get the $3900 home.


*And what if would have lost in the finals?*  

It would be ok too. I would also get a lot of money but I wanted to win. All the Chileans were very cool, because they wish me the best luck and they wanted me as the champion. But really, I wanted to win the trophy and get it to Argentina. Before entering to the top 8 they told me that the last time, a Mexican took it (GP Buenos Aires) so now it was Argentinean's time.


*U have fame of a great topdecking. Does your victory have a lot of that?*   

No, praying to god is also very helpful. Yesterday I prayed to be in the top 16 and take some bucks. But wait! I pray every night but yesterday I really asked for some luck today. Talking seriously, a friend of mine used to play Chess in a professional way. His mother died and before every game, he prayed.... and so I get used to it. But I don't do it always because it's too much.  

That's why I got very bad at Nationals and in the Latin American Tournament. For asking for more than what I deserve.  

But some luck is always good. That Urza's Rage in the finals was great.


*Are you going to keep traveling outside Argentina to play Magic?*  

Sure! More now that I won money. I will use it to go in December to Curitiba, Brasil. And maybe to Pro Tour New Orleans. Also, my parent need some help.


*Anything else you wanna say?*  

No, nothing. Thanks to all my friends, especially to Nicolas Otatte, and everyone who trusted in me.
