Welcome back to the Lab, folks! We've got another week of *Dragon's Maze* previews lined up for you here on DailyMTG, and I get to help kick it off with a sweet card for Johnnies everywhere. Progenitor Mimic follows in the footsteps of a card from the original *Ravnica*, but definitely kicks it up a notch, Simic-style.
