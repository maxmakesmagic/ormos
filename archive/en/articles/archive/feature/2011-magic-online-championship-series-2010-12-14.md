**MAGIC ONLINE CHAMPIONSHIP SERIES ELIGIBILITY**

* All **Magic Online** players who meet the eligibility requirements set forth herein are eligible to compete in this online tournament series. All **Magic Online** players are eligible to compete in the 2011 **Magic Online** Championship Series except (a) players who are otherwise ineligible to engage in tournament play pursuant to the [**Magic Online** User Agreement](http://wizards.custhelp.com/cgi-bin/wizards.cfg/php/enduser/std_adp.php?p_faqid=1358) and (b) employees or contractors of Wizards of the Coast LLC (“Wizards”), Hasbro or each of their respective subsidiaries or affiliates or their advertising or promotion agencies, or those who are domiciled with any such person, or those who have been disqualified for other reasons (see below). This is a skill-based tournament based on a player's ability to defeat other players.
* Players will be disqualified if they are suspended from **Magic Online** for any reason, including without limitation a violation of the [**Magic Online** User Agreement](http://wizards.custhelp.com/cgi-bin/wizards.cfg/php/enduser/std_adp.php?p_faqid=1358).
* Although players may have multiple accounts qualified for an end-of-season championship or the Player of the Year championship, players are not permitted to have more than one of their accounts entered in any single event at one time. Players are not permitted to have any accounts entered in events played by other players for any reason. If a player is discovered to have more than one account playing in any end-of-season championship or championship event before, during, or after the event, Wizards may take action against that player's account(s), up to and including disqualification with no refund of product and/or event tickets, suspension of the offending account(s), and/or termination of the offending account(s). Using an account other than your own, allowing any other player to use your account, selling your account, and other similar actions are all violations of the [**Magic Online** User Agreement](http://wizards.custhelp.com/cgi-bin/wizards.cfg/php/enduser/std_adp.php?p_faqid=1358). If you play in **Magic Online** events, win, and expect to get your prize, be very, very sure you are playing on your own account. We do not recognize excuses, such as "I and a friend jointly own the account," "It's my brother's account but he gave it to me," or similar. The only exception is an adult may authorize a single dependent child age 13-18 to play on an account that the adult has established.
* Wizards of the Coast reserves the right to reschedule and/or restart games and matches as needed. Such decisions will be announced on the **Magic Online** website and/or within the **Magic Online** client as needed.
* To be eligible to participate in the **Magic Online** Championship Series, the following requirements must be met:

	+ Players must have access to a personal computer.
	+ Players must be **Magic Online** account holders in good standing and in compliance with the **Magic Online** User Agreement.

**2011 MAGIC ONLINE CHAMPIONSHIP SERIES STRUCTURE**  
 The 2011 **Magic Online** Championship Series will use the following structure: 

* Seasons: The 2011 **Magic Online** Championship Series will be divided into ten (10) separate seasons. Each season's duration is four (4) weeks. Each season's start and end date are listed in the schedule below.
* Qualifier Points: During each season, a number of **Magic Online** events will offer the opportunity to earn Qualifier Points (QPs). These qualifying events are restricted to queues, daily events, and premier events that have successfully completed with at least eight (8) players and include Qualifier Points (QPs) listed as part of their prize structure. The number of Qualifier Points (QPs) offered will vary by event. Points earned in a season do not carry over to any other season. See the table below for more information about Qualifier Points (QPs).
* Earning Qualifier Points (QPs): At the end of each specified tournament, all participants may earn Qualifier Points (QPs) based upon their final rank or points standing in the tournament.
* End-of-Season Championships: At the end of each season, all players who have earned sufficient QPs are invited to participate in the corresponding end-of-season championship. The winner of each end-of-season championship will earn an invitation to participate in the 2011 **Magic Online** Championship. Invitations to end-of-season championships are season specific and do not carry over to any other end-of-season championships.
* Player of the Year: Wizards of the Coast will track the cumulative Qualifier Points (QPs) of each player and maintain the following [Player of the Year leaderboards](/en/articles/archive/building-budget/2011-magic-online-player-year-standings-2009-04-09): Overall, Standard Constructed, Block Constructed, Extended Constructed, Legacy Constructed, Specialty Constructed, Booster Draft, and Sealed Deck. After the end of the tenth season, players who are ranked in the top 100 of the Overall leaderboard and/or ranked in the top 20 of any other leaderboard will be invited to play in the 2011 **Magic Online** Player of the Year Championship tournament held on October 1, 2011. The winner of the Player of the Year Championship will be invited to participate in the 2011 **Magic Online** Championship.
* Last-Chance Qualifier: **Magic Online** will host a 2011 **Magic Online** Championship Series Last-Chance Qualifier (MOCS LCQ) on October 8, 2011. This tournament will be open to all eligible players not already invited to the 2011 **Magic Online** Championship. The winner of the MOCS LCQ will be invited to participate in the 2011 **Magic Online** Championship.

**CONNECTIVITY**  
 Due to the nature of computers and the Internet, Wizards of the Coast is not responsible for the results of any disconnection or network problems experienced by players.

**QUALIFIER POINTS**   
 In addition to the normal prizes for specified tournaments, high finishing players earn Qualifier Points (QPs) based on the following schedule: 



|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Tournament Type** | **Finish** | **QPs** |
| Premier Event | 1st Place | 6 |

| 8-Player Queue | 1st Place | 1 |

*Exception:* Tournaments that are part of the MOCS (such as end-of-season championships) do not award QPs.

In addition, different tournaments or formats may be called out and offer increased amounts of QPs each month. This adjusted QP schedule will be announced a minimum of one week prior to the start of a season. 

Wizards of the Coast reserves the right to add/remove qualifying formats, alter events that award Qualifier Points (QPs), and/or adjust the number of QPs offered by any event with a minimum of 24 hours notice.

**END-OF-SEASON CHAMPIONSHIP STRUCTURE**  
 The end-of-season championships are open only to players who earned sufficient QPs in the appropriate season. 

Each player's QPs are reset to zero during the last scheduled downtime of the **Magic Online** Championship Series season. 

All events that start after this downtime will offer QPs towards the next season's championship.

**END-OF-SEASON CHAMPIONSHIP PARTICIPATION**  
 A player must have earned at least **15 QPs** during an individual season to be eligible for that season's end-of-season championships. In addition, players can earn byes in the championship based on the following QP total:



|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **QPs** | **Benefit** |
| 15-24 | Qualified for End-of-Season Championship |
| 25-34 | Qualified for End-of-Season Championship with one awarded bye |
| 35-44 | Qualified for End-of-Season Championship with two awarded byes  |
| 45+ | Qualified for End-of-Season Championship with three awarded byes |

A list of all players that have qualified for an end-of-season championship will be maintained on the Wizards of the Coast web site. Players will be registered into that month's end-of-season championship after the season has ended during the last scheduled downtime before the event. A list of all qualified players will also be [posted online](/en/articles/archive/building-budget/magic-online-championship-series-2011-season-10-qps-earned-2009-04). 

It will be the player's responsibility to make sure that they have been properly entered into this event and are able to join it PRIOR to the start of the end-of-season championship. If a player is qualified and is unable to join the end-of-season championship, they will need to contact customer service to get this corrected.

**Updated March 8, 2011:** If a player has earned an invitation into an end-of-season championship but is unable to participate, they will automatically have a non-foil copy of the end-of-season championship's promo card plus 6 booster packs of a current **Magic: The Gathering** set or expansion (chosen by Wizards of the Coast) granted to their qualifying account in lieu of participating in the end-of-season championship. This grant will be made no later than 10 days after the completion of the end-of-season championship. 

In order to use this "skip tournament" option, a player must not play in the end-of-season championship event. 

Please note that players may only receive one "skip tournament" option, regardless of the number of accounts they have qualified for an end-of-season championship. In addition, if a player plays in the end-of-season championship, any "skip tournament" requests for any other accounts that player owns will be refused.
