Hey there, *Magic Online* Community. *Magic Online* asked me to come talk to you today. I know, I know, you think *Magic Online* forgot your 12th anniversary. Thing is, it’s been busy at the office lately for *Magic Online*, but *Magic Online* didn’t forget. *Magic Online* just wants to do your anniversary right! For you, *Magic Online* Community, *Magic Online* would pull the moon from the sky. *Magic Online* would even pull the Holiday Cube into the middle of July! For you, *Magic Online* Community, *Magic Online* would reach into the Multiverse and pluck out any plane in existence. As a matter of fact, *Magic Online* did all those things (minus the thing with the moon), and *Magic Online* did them for you,  *Magic Online* Community.

Anniversary Events begin on Tuesday July 2 and the festivities don't stop until July 25! The Anniversary Events are made up of a series of qualifiers that take players on a voyage through *Magic Online*'s twelve year history, highlighting a different set or block each day of the qualifiers. Players competing in the qualifiers will be able to win prizes that are also themed around the set(s) of the day, as well as an invite to the Anniversary Finals on July 19. You'll need to bust out your fruit cake and party poppers too, because we're bringing some of that holiday zest into the month of July with the return of the Holiday Cube and the paired *Modern Masters* Flashback Draft.


"It's never a bad time for a non-denominational Holiday Cube," is what I always say. In keeping with that, we've planned [the return of the Holiday Cube](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/magazine/article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/other/11252013/holidaycube#cardlist) as part of the *Magic Online* 12th Anniversary celebration! The Holiday Cube returns on Wednesday, July 16 and runs until Friday, July 25. The Holiday Cube runs in two flavors, Swiss and Single Elimination, so pick your favorite and jump in to celebrate this most prestigious of holidays.


Along with the Holiday Cube, we're bringing back *Modern Masters* for 8-4 Single Elimination and Swiss Flashback Drafts! Much like the egg nog bar at your traditional holiday party, the Cube and accompanying *Modern Masters*Flashback Drafts will be here throughout the 12th Anniversary festivities for you to refresh yourself between qualifier events.


Zendikar, Ravnica, Theros, Innistrad, and all the other greatest planes are coming to party for the [Anniversary Event Qualifiers](#anniversary). The Qualifiers take *Magic Online* players on a stroll through the Multiverse with a series of Swiss Sealed Events themed around your favorite planes and blocks from the past twelve years! Each and every day, the qualifer will feature a different set so be sure to keep an eye out for your favorites in the [schedule below](#anniversary). Are you the master of Mirrodin? Excellent, you should enter the qualifiers on [Thursday, July 12](#anniversary2). Maybe you're crazy about Kamigawa? [Wednesday, July 11](anniversary2) is the Qualifier for you. Just for taking part in a Qualifier, you'll get an alternative art version of the [Birds of Paradise avatar](#avatars) which was one of the first available avatars on *Magic Online*!


Go on, peruse the event tables below to find out when your favorite plane(s) will make an appearance, then plan to play in as many qualifiers as possible to have the best chance of qualifying for the [Anniversary Event Finals](#anniversaryfinals). The Anniversary Event Finals take place on Saturday, July 19. If you happen to prove yourself as one of the best competing *Magic Online* players, you will be able to open some *Magic 2015 Core Set* boosters before the [Prerelease](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/magic-online-2015-core-set-prerelease-and-release-events-2014-06-30) and be amongst the first players to possess cards from the set. The top four players will even get full *Magic 2015* sets! Check out the [event table below](#anniversaryfinals) for all of the details.


See? *Magic Online* is going to make this the best 12th Anniversary ever. Trust me, *Magic Online* Community, this anniversary is going to be *Magic*al.
