Blake is the content manager for DailyMTG.com, making him the one you should email if you have thoughts on the website, good or less good (or not good). He's a longtime coverage reporter and hasn't turned down a game of Magic in any format ever. 






Over the weekend, a cool hashtag emerged asking players for four *Magic* cards that define them in some way—their origins, their favorites, their successes, and whatever else was important to them. [#FourMTGCard](https://twitter.com/hashtag/FourMTGCards?src=hash) asked players to show the images of four cards with a short explanation of why they chose those cards.



It all started with this:



Brian David-Marshall (@Top8Games)

Of course, Brian David-Marshall is a well-known name in *Magic* and a constant presence on Twitter, which means that a number of pros and other *Magic* folk picked up on the hashtag immediately.

And, of course, we couldn't stay out of the action ourselves. But being who we are, we got to do something a little…unique.
