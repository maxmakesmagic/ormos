The following Pro Tour Hall of Famers and members of Wizards of the Coast R&D will be at Pro Tour–Amsterdam in the Champions Challenge area. Bring a deck and face off against them across multiple formats to win cool prizes!


### Mark Gottlieb, Advanced Developer, **Magic** R&D


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/ptams10/cc_gottlieb.jpg)I am, rather inexplicably, the newest, freshest face on the **Magic** Development team. Previously, I served as the **Magic** Rules Manager for all sets from *Guildpact* through the *Magic 2011* Core Set. I was also on the design teams of *Dissension*, *Future Sight*, *Shadowmoor*, *Conflux*, *Alara Reborn*, and *Scars of Mirrodin*, was the lead designer of the upcoming *Mirrodin Besieged*, was a member of the *Ravnica* development team, and led the development of *Masters Edition II*.


Cards I've designed include [Erratic Explosion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Erratic+Explosion), [Dimir Doppelganger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dimir+Doppelganger), [Warp World](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Warp+World), [Swans of Bryn Argoll](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swans+of+Bryn+Argoll), [Scapeshift](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scapeshift), [Path to Exile](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Path+to+Exile), [Dragon Broodmother](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragon+Broodmother), [Sovereigns of Lost Alara](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sovereigns+of+Lost+Alara), [Progenitus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Progenitus), and [Eldrazi Monument](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eldrazi+Monument).


I joined Wizards of the Coast in 2000. An MIT graduate, I enjoy the constant opportunities to be randomly creative that working at Wizards affords me. In my spare time, I'm a competitive puzzle solver who'll happily fly thousands of miles for a good puzzle hunt, as well as a sporadic professional puzzlemaker who's been published in *The New York Times*, *Games*, *Technology Review*, and *Wired*.


### Dave Guskin, Advanced Developer, **Magic** Digital R&D


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/ptams10/cc_guskin.jpg)Contrary to popular belief, **Magic** R&D is not all about the cards! As part of a new **Magic** Digital team within R&D, I hold brainstorms, coordinate projects and do playtesting / game design / game development for a number of digital products – some that you know and love like **Magic Online** or *Duels of the Planeswalkers*, and some new ones on the horizon!


I've worked on many **Magic** Design and Development teams, including *Alara Reborn*, *Planechase, Archenemy,* *Magic 2011*, "Action" (the third set of *Scars of Mirrodin* block) and "Roll" (the third set of *"Shake"* block). In my previous role as a web developer, I also helped create Gatherer and did a bunch of work prototyping Facebook games.


Cards I've Designed:  


* [Gideon Jura](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gideon+Jura)
* [Chandra Ablaze](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chandra+Ablaze)
* [Elixir of Immortality](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elixir+of+Immortality)
* [Dread Statuary](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dread+Statuary)
* [Deathbringer Thoctar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deathbringer+Thoctar)
* [Skill Borrower](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skill+Borrower)
* [Master of Etherium](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Master+of+Etherium)

I've been at Wizards for about three and a half years. I started a Web Developer working on our community forums and Magic website, and then started work with R&D – first with FFL playtesting, then with product teams. I've had a few other jobs as a programmer at game companies. Before that, I was a Plasma Physics student working on nuclear fusion. I enjoy making a fool of myself singing at karaoke, and love organizing game nights/weekends with friends.


### Steve Warner, Game Developer


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/ptams10/cc_warner.jpg) I spend my days building decks and play testing cards that I feel may be too good, too powerful, or not fun enough, to continue through **Magic**. 


I have worked on *Dissension*, *Shadowmoor*, *Zendikar*, and am currently working on *Magic 2012*. I have worked on the development team for every set since *Ravnica*. I also work on our new business games and Japanese games like *Duel Masters*. 


Many cards have been based on my design including [Augury Adept](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Augury+Adept), [Roil Elemental](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Roil+Elemental), [Telemin Performance](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Telemin+Performance), [Rite of Replication](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rite+of+Replication), [Celestial Mantle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Celestial+Mantle), [Sea Gate Loremaster](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sea+Gate+Loremaster), [Bloodghast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodghast), [Blade of the Bloodchief](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blade+of+the+Bloodchief), and quite a few others. I have worked on so many cards it's tough to remember them all!


I have worked for Wizards for almost 12 years now. I started in retail stores and moved up and down and back up again to R&D. It has been one heck of a roller coaster ride. My first job was at an arcade. That led to another arcade, then to a different game store. I have worked on pretty much all sorts of games, *Axis & Allies*, *Dreamblade*, Looney Toons TCG, GI JOE TCG, etc, and a couple games that never came out (yet). 


I am married with two other up-and-coming gamers.
