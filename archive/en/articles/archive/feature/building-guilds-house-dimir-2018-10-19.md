 Chris is the copy editor for DailyMTG. If the Ts are dotted and the eyes are crossed, he dun goofed. 






For every set we release and every world we visit, the Creative team creates a world guide that covers the history of the groups and characters living on the plane. The concept sketches in the world guide are then used by the talented artists from around the world to realize the creative vision for the set and give life to the cards.


To create *Guilds of Ravnica*, the Creative team revisited the guilds, updating their typical outfits for Ravnica's current weather (autumn) and filling in details on leadership changes and new character developments based on the overarching storyline.


In the gallery below, you can see just a few of the pages this team created to guide the artists as they brought *Guilds of Ravnica* to life. Enjoy!

House Dimir is Ravnica's dark but open secret: the populace knows Dimir exists, but they pretend it doesn't. Secrecy is House Dimir's weapon and its best defense, and the guild is hidden even from itself. Dimir agents leave no trace of their covert activities, destroying the memories of witnesses to their crimes and even wiping their own memories of their completed assignments.
