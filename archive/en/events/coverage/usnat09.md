2009 United States National Championship
----------------------------------------


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/usnat09/day3_end_blurb.jpg)The United States has a 2009 National Champion! The champion was crowned after a monstrous Top 8. Mark Hendrickson, who managed to make it through half of the Swiss rounds without a single blemish on his record, was joined by newcomer Drew Dumanski of Texas. They fell in the Quarterfinals, along with Grand Prix-Los Angeles Top 8 competitor Brett Piazza, and Rookie of the Year candidate Brian Robinson.


The Semifinals saw Brad Nelson and Todd Anderson fall to eventual finalists Adam Yurchick and Charles Gindy. Nelson, the famous **Magic Online** aficionado known as “FFFreak” brought a Conley Woods special to the tournament, tuned to beat Cruel Control. With his 3rd/4th playoff opponent Todd Anderson having full information about his deck, however, his tricks were no good and Anderson managed to earn the final slot for the team.


That left just one match to play out. In a powerful back and forth affair between Adam Yurchick and Charles Gindy, the Pro Tour-Hollywood champ Gindy managed to come back from a haymaker of an [Identity Crisis](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Identity+Crisis) out of Yurchick in the second game. The two players wrestled the match to a fifth and final game, but Adam just couldn’t hold on. Your 2009 United States National Champion is Charles Gindy!
