### **Name**: Robbie Schmidt


**Age:** 25


**Occupation:** Cook



**Hometown:** Calgary, AL



**Previous Magic Accomplishments:**


Couple PTQ Top 8s; Day 2 Grand Prix Calgary; Provincial Champ 2014



**What deck are you playing? Why did you choose it? What is its worst matchup?**


Robots. Couple years’ experience with the deck. But it’s sadly not [Scapeshift](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scapeshift). I wanted to play a proactive deck that I had a bunch of reps with. Worst Matchup: Stock Abzan, maybe Infect.



**What was your Day 1 Record? How many byes did you have? How did you earn them?**


9-0, baby! I had 1 bye from Planeswalker points.



**What was the best moment from your games so far this weekend?**


Turn two [Etched Champion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Etched+Champion); turn three [Etched Champion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Etched+Champion); Turn four [Etched Champion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Etched+Champion)




**Knowing the decks you’ve faced, would you have made any changes to your deck?**


My best card against Abzan is [Etched Champion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Etched+Champion) so if I could play a fifth, I guess I would have.

### **Name**: Alexander Hayne


**Age:** 26


**Occupation:** Pro *Magic* player



**Hometown:** Montreal, Quebec, Canada



**Previous Magic Accomplishments:**


Pro Tour *Avacyn Restored* champion. Three Grand Prix wins and two other Top 8s. 2011–12 Rookie of the Year; 2012 & 2014 Canadian National team member. Just passed $100,000 USD lifetime winnings.


**What deck are you playing? Why did you choose it? What is its worst matchup?**


Amulet Bloom. I chose it because I was winning a lot in testing it as the enemy for Team F2F+CFB for Pro Tour *Fate Reforged*, and it is a lot of fun to play. The worst match-up is Mono-White Disruption, followed by [Splinter Twin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Splinter+Twin) (or any deck that supports [Blood Moon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Moon).



**What was your Day 1 Record? How many byes did you have? How did you earn them?**


I was 8-1. I had three byes from Platinum Pro level.



**What was the best moment from your games so far this weekend?**


Killing my opponent turn two with two Amulets + [Summer Bloom](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Summer+Bloom) + [Summoner's Pact](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Summoner%27s+Pact), finding two [Primeval Titan](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Primeval+Titan)s and giving them both haste, +2/+0, and double strike. My opponent had played one land.



**Knowing the decks you’ve faced, would you have made any changes to your deck?**


I would have played more Infect and Twin hate, probably some more Nature’s Claims.

**Previous Magic Accomplishments:**


Grand Prix Lyon winner; Top 8 Grand Prix Madrid



**What deck are you playing? Why did you choose it? What is its worst matchup?**


Abzan. I am familiar with the decks and like to play it.


Probably Amulet Bloom or Red-Green ramp with Traps and [Emrakul, the Aeons Torn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Emrakul%2C+the+Aeons+Torn).



**What was your Day 1 Record? How many byes did you have? How did you earn them?**


8-1. I had two byes, Planeswalker points.




**What was the best moment from your games so far this weekend?**


The moment I knew I had locked up the Pro Tour qualification.

Some cards in the board were never used, but I am still happy with the deck.

### **Name**: Dan Lanthier


**Age:** 27


**Occupation:** Powerful Wizard



**Hometown:** Ottawa



**Previous Magic Accomplishments:**


Canadian National champion; several Grand Prix Top 8 near misses.



**What deck are you playing? Why did you choose it? What is its worst matchup?**


[Splinter Twin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Splinter+Twin). I’m very familiar with the archetype and felt it was well positioned. Abzan is my worst match-up by far.



**What was your Day 1 Record? How many byes did you have? How did you earn them?**


8-0-1. I had two byes from Planeswalker Points.




**What was the best moment from your games so far this weekend?**


Dying on turn one to Amulet Bloom.




**Knowing the decks you’ve faced, would you have made any changes to your deck?**


[Dismember](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dismember) was not very good. I would consider a [Combust](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Combust) or another [Flame Slash](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flame+Slash) in its place.
