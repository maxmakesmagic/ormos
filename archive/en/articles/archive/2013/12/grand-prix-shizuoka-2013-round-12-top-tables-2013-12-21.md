GRAND PRIX SHIZUOKA 2013 - Round 12 Top Tables
==============================================



 Posted in [NEWS](/en/articles)
 on December 22, 2013 










While our tireless workers sort through the decklists to bring you a complete Day 2 Metagame Breakdown, I took a quick tour of the top tables to see what decks were rising above the crowd.


[![](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Thassa%2C+God+of+the+Sea)](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thassa%2C+God+of+the+Sea)
The two big winners seem to be Mono-Blue Devotion and Mono-Red Devotion, both creature decks that have almost combo deck draws that can end games quickly. Close behind with at least four players is White Weenie. Still there's a lot of diversity out there. Mihara-style Green-Red Devotion. Black-White, Esper Control, straight Blue-White Control, even classic Mono-Black Devotion has a few adherents.


Does the wealth of creature decks mean that the Control decks are in a position to finish strong? Will [Thassa](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thassa) and her [Master of Waves](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Master+of+Waves) bring home another trophy? Or will a rogue deck like 12-0 Shota Takao's Esper Humans carry the day?
