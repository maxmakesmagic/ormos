 A longtime member of the Pro Tour and Grand Prix coverage staff, Nate Price now works making beautiful words for all of you lovely people as the community manager for organized play. When not covering events, he lords over the @MagicProTour Twitter account, ruling with an iron fist. 







So here's a quick look at the decks that each country had in the various formats for Stage 2:




|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Country | InnistradÂ Block Constructed | Standard | Modern |
| Croatia | Jund | Infect | RUG Delver |
| Finland | UW Miracles | UW Delver | RUG Delver |
| Philippines | Jund | UW Delver | Doran |
| Portugal | Reanimator | BR Zombies | Affinity |
| Chinese Taipei | Jund | BR Zombies | UW Tempo |
| Uruguay | Jund | Wolf Run Blue | Jund |
| United States | Jund | Naya Pod | RWU Delver |
| Hungary | Jund | Zombie Pod | RWU Delver |
| Scotland | Jund | UW Delver | Jund |
| Poland | Jund | BR Zombies | RUG Delver |
| Estonia | Jund | Wolf Run Blue | Aggro Loam |
| Slovenia | Jund | RG Ramp | RWU Delver |
| Slovak Republic | Jund | Sun Titan UW | RUG Delver |
| Ukraine | Mono-Black | Mono-Green | Affinity |
| France | Reanimator | Naya Pod | 4-Color Pod |
| Puerto Rico | Jund | UW Delver | Affinity |

As you can see from this, the Jund deck that made such a major splash at Grand Prix Anaheim earlier this year is still a menace in *Innistrad* Block Constructed. Riding strong on the backs of [Falkenrath Aristocrat](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Falkenrath+Aristocrat)s, the deck proved incredibly powerful over the course of the weekend, completely crushing the Boros decks that littered the field, conspicuously absent here.

Some of the other decks to have a heyday at that tournament are in representation here, including the [Angel of Glory's Rise](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Angel+of+Glory%27s+Rise) Reanimator deck. This deck uses [Cathedral Sanctifier](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cathedral+Sanctifier) to keep the deck afloat until it can begin to do ridiculous things with [Angel of Glory's Rise](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Angel+of+Glory%27s+Rise). One of the ridiculous things it can do involves a loop using [Fiend Hunter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fiend+Hunter) to trap an Angel, a [Falkenrath Aristocrat](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Falkenrath+Aristocrat) to sacrifice the [Fiend Hunter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fiend+Hunter), and potentially a [Cathedral Sanctifier](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cathedral+Sanctifier) to gain life. The end result is an ever-growing [Falkenrath Aristocrat](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Falkenrath+Aristocrat) that matches an ever-increasing life total. Once you're done looping, you can simply turn the Aristocrat sideways and kill your opponent.


Surprising me more than any other result from this was the diversity of the Standard format. Expecting UW [Delver of Secrets](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Delver%2Bof%2BSecrets) to be the elephant in the room, I was quite surprised that it only made up 25% of the field, which is a completely reasonable number. Standard also had the most surprising innovation, which was the Mono-Green Infect deck used by the Croatian team to dominate Standard on Day One. There was also a tweaked out Zombie deck featuring [Birthing Pod](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Birthing+Pod) as an enabler.


Finally, Modern saw most of the usual suspects returning to form. Various [Delver of Secrets](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Delver%2Bof%2BSecrets) builds, including RUG and RWU, were rampant throughout the field. It was refreshing to see the lists for France and Estonia, though. France brought a 4-Color Pod deck to the field, featuring an insanely large number of one-ofs. Estonia, on the other hand, brought an Aggro Loam deck, which has fallen in and out of favor in Modern and Legacy as the formats have matured.
