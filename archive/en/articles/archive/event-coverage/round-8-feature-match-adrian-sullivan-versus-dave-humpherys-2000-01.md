Adrian plays at a very hyperactive speed making his decisions instantaneously, and giving his opponent evil looks during their turn. Dave plays a conservative style, taking his time to thoroughly think out the turns. The deck match up was interesting as it pitted Adrian's Magpie Blue versus The Your Move Games's CounterRebel deck.


### Game 1


Adrian won the toss and elected to play first. The game started uneventfully as both players just played some land. Dave on the third turn went for the jugular by casting a Ramosian Lieutenant. Searchers that resolve in this match up tend to be very good as once they start, they tend not to stop. Adrian let the Lieutenant resolve and cast Accumulated Knowledge on the next turn. Adrian opted during his turn and Repulsed the rebel. Dave released the proverbial beast on the turn next turn by summoning a Lieutenant as well as a Defiant Falcon. Adrian shows that he too has creatures that net him card advantage by busting out a Thieving Magpie.


Fearing nothing, Dave Last Breathed the bird and sent his rebels to lower Adrian's life. Adrian cast Magpie number 2 and after a couple of Counterspells the Bird was in play. Dave then proceeded to cast another Falcon so it could chump the Bird and that is exactly what it did. Adrian had more to cast though and a Temporal Adept entered the fray. Dave searched up a Lin Sivvi and things were still looking pretty good for the YMG star. The Magpie attacked again and yet another Falcon died for the common cause. Humpherys searched out a pair of Defiant Vanguards, and had his Lin Sivvi bounced back to his hand.

Adrian sends again with the Magpie and is able to draw some cards, while bouncing the Lin. A Sky Marshal comes to play for a bit and it gets bounced back. The cards that Adrian was drawing as well as Dave only able to really get one key spell through a turn made things bad for The Hump. A couple turns later two Mahamoti Djinns are on Adrian's side and the first game is his.


Sullivan 1 Humpherys 0


### Game 2


This game didn't start ideally for Dave, he started with two Adarkar Wastes and took 2 damage to cast a Meddling Mage naming Repulse. Adrian played some manipulation spell, and said go with his two islands. Dave missed his land drop on turn 3 and just sent in the Mage. Adrian played a major threat card on his turn in the way of a Temporal Adept. Dave took more pain to counter that one. Dave drew a third land played it sent his Mage and said go. Adrian seeing an advantage busted out a Thieving Magpie, which Humpherys responded with an Absorb. Sullivan was ready for his and Misdirectioned it. Dave untapped and went to Last Breath the Magpie but another Misdirection saw his Meddling Mage removed from the game.

A second Last Breath killed the first Magpie but the Magpie's brother came out to seek vengeance. Vengeance was had, although Humpherys was able to cast a couple of Meddling Mages, The third and fourth Magpies came out and the game looked terrible. A Wrath of God was met with a counter and that was the end. The game ended with Dave with only lands as permanents, and two cards (both Meddling Mages), and Adrian attacking with three Magpies and 7 cards in hand.


**Final Result:** Sullivan 2 Humpherys 0
