As you may have read in the [Kamigawa Glossary Part 3](/en/articles/archive/kamigawa-glossary-part-3-2005-05-31), the term *bunrei* (BOON-ray) refers to a spirit created by dividing another spirit (or the ceremony of this act of division).


The *Saviors of Kamigawa* card **[Promise of Bunrei](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Promise+of+Bunrei)** is an enchantment that grants four 1/1 colorless Spirit tokens when one of your creatures dies. The concept behind the card is that the soul of your fallen warrior becomes split into four individual kami -- *bunrei* -- hence the enchantment represents the promise of those *bunrei*.


Note that you can see the four spirits splitting out from the soul of the fallen warrior right in Stephen Tappin's art:

The strength of the card became apparent during the card's development. There was discussion of having the tokens fly, or making the enchantment's sacrifice optional -- which made the card overpowered. There was also discussion of how powerful the tokens' Spirit creature type was in the Kamigawa block, but R&D decided that interactions with cards like [Long-Forgotten Gohei](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Long-Forgotten+Gohei) made the [Promise of Bunrei](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Promise%2Bof%2BBunrei) strong but not too strong.
