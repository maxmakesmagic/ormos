 Working in R&D since '95, Mark became Magic head designer in '03. His hobbies: spending time with family, writing about Magic in all mediums, and creating short bios. 






One day, many years ago, I was working on *Innistrad* design and I figured out that it was my thirteenth lead design and I thought that was cool (being that thirteen was a mini-theme of *Innistrad*). A few days later, I realized I'm bad at counting and that *Innistrad* was, in fact, my fourteenth lead design. I then realized that I was just two lead designs away from having my sixteenth. Why was that important? Because I've always loved head-to-head competitions where players vote each day on a theme-based bracket. Doing this requires a power of two and I hadn't thought of it when I got to eight. 

 Then and there I decided that as soon as my sixteenth set came out, I was going to have a head-to-head rumble. Well, *Gatecrash* is my sixteenth lead (technically co-lead, along with [Mark Gottlieb](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Archive.aspx?author=Mark%20Gottlieb)), and after years of waiting, I was ready to rumble. I called my head-to-head competition the Rosewater Rumble. I ran it across my social media outlets ([Twitter](https://twitter.com/maro254), [Tumblr](http://markrosewater.tumblr.com/), and [Google+](https://plus.google.com/107824009487778543249/posts)) with all the votes taking place on Twitter. Hundreds of players joined in and we had quite the rumble. 

After I set up how it was done, I'm going to take you to the bracket and then I'm going to walk you through what actually happened. If you haven't had the chance to see the rumble, it will give you an opportunity to decide how you would have voted before each outcome is revealed. When that is done, I'm then going to explain how it would have turned out if I was the only one voting—what I'll call the Mark Rosewater Rumble.

 Here's how it was put together. The following are the sixteen released **Magic** sets I was lead designer for. In chronological order, they are... 


> *Tempest*  
> *Unglued*  
> *Urza's Destiny*  
> *Odyssey*  
> *Mirrodin*  
> *Fifth Dawn*  
> *Unhinged*  
> *Ravnica*  
> *Future Sight*  
> *Shadowmoor*  
> *Eventide*  
> *Zendikar*  
> *Scars of Mirrodin*  
> *Innistrad*  
> *Dark Ascension*  
> *Gatecrash*

 The Countrymen design team ([Ethan Fleischer](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/magazine/archive.aspx?author=ethan%20fleischer), Dan Emmons, [Matt Tabak](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Archive.aspx?author=Matt%20Tabak), and myself—[Erik Lauer](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/magazine/archive.aspx?author=Erik%20Lauer) was also on the design team but was sick this day) seeded the sets as follows: 

1. *Ravnica*
2. *Innistrad*
3. *Tempest*
4. *Zendikar*
5. *Mirrodin*
6. *Unglued*
7. *Gatecrash*
8. *Shadowmoor*
9. *Dark Ascension*
10. *Scars of Mirrodin*
11. *Future Sight*
12. *Urza's Destiny*
13. *Unhinged*
14. *Odyssey*
15. *Eventide*
16. *Fifth Dawn*
We then put it into a traditional Top 16 bracket. Seeding ensures that the sets most likely to win don't meet until later in the pairings.

We had our bracket. It was time to rumble!

The only thing I said when I posted the pairings was that, for each match-up, I wanted the players to pick the set they liked the most. The criteria was completely left up to each voter to choose for him- or herself.

I am now going to go through round by round. If you haven't had a chance to vote yet, you will be given a chance to decide which set you would vote for before the outcome is revealed. Remember that the voters were my followers on Twitter, making them a slightly more enfranchised crowd.

 Round 1: *Shadowmoor* (#8) vs. *Dark Ascension* (#9) 
The first round is the battle of the dark sets. Also, the battle of persist versus undying.



|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ***Shadowmoor* included:**  | ***Dark Ascension* included:** |
| • persist | • undying |
| • wither | • fateful hour |
| • conspire | • new tweaks on double-faced cards |
| • the untap symbol | • new tweaks on flashback |
| • monocolor hybrid (nicknamed "two-brid") | • additional morbid cards |
| • a major "color-matters" theme | • stronger monster tribal theme |
| • extensive use of hybrid mana |  |

  
 Choose which you would pick and then click here to see the outcome. 

 The first match-up was close but *Shadowmoor* defeated *Dark Ascension* with 60% of the vote. The reason I believe *Shadowmoor* won is that I feel large sets have a huge advantage. Not only do they have more cards but they also come with all-new mechanics. Most of the mechanics of a small set, especially a middle set like *Dark Ascension*, are using those first seen in the large set that preceded it. 

 In the end, I think the love of hybrid overcame the love of "more *Innistrad*." 

Click here to continue onto Round 2. 

 Round 2: *Gatecrash* (#7) vs. *Scars of Mirrodin* (#10) 
 The second round was the battle of returns. Which set do you choose, the return to Ravnica or the return to *Mirrodin*? 



|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ***Gatecrash* included:** | ***Scars of Mirrodin* included:** |
| • battalion | • infect |
| • bloodrush | • metalcraft |
| • cipher | • proliferate |
| • evolve | • new tweaks on imprint |
| • extort | • lead up to Phyrexian invasion |
| • new charms and guildmages |  |
| • new Guildgates and guild leaders |  |

  
 Choose which you would pick and then click here to see the outcome. 

 The second match-up was equally close with *Gatecrash* defeating *Scars of Mirrodin* with just 60% of the vote. After looking at all the results (I asked players to explain why they were voting the way the did), *Gatecrash*'s victory seemed to hinge on people voting against *Scars of Mirrodin*. With multiple controversial mechanics and an oft-criticized Limited play, *Scars of Mirrodin* is a very polarizing set. Also, *Gatecrash* enjoyed the boost of being the set currently on everyone's mind. And to be fair to *Gatecrash*, the set also has proven to have many popular mechanics. 

In the end, both sets had a lot of fans but the current set had just a little bit more.

Click here to continue onto Round 3. 

 Round 3: *Unglued* (#6) vs. *Future Sight* (#11) 
 This round was the battle of the silly sets. *Future Sight* has jokingly been referred to as the third Un-set because it is the craziest black-bordered set ever designed. It goes up against the first *Un*-set. 



|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ***Unglued* included:** | ***Future Sight* included:** |
| • dice rolling | • future-shifted cards |
| • physical components | • mix and match cards |
| • verbal components | • tweaks on scry, suspend, vanishing |
| • new frame usage | • ten new keywords and keyword actions |
| • full-art lands | • the pact cycle |
| • token cards | • introduced deathtouch, lifelink, reach, shroud |
| • humor, including parody |  |

  
 Choose which you would pick and then click here to see the outcome. 

*Future Sight* was not only the first upset of the competition, but it also defeated *Unglued* soundly, taking 80% of the vote. The silver border of *Unglued*, making it unplayable in tournaments, proved to be a huge handicap, especially when its competition was an equally crazy set printed in black border. *Future Sight* was also home of the future-shifted cards from potential futures of the game, including such fan favorites as [Tarmogoyf](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf), [Narcomoeba](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Narcomoeba), and [Steamflogger Boss](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Steamflogger+Boss). (On the list of requests I get, contraptions is still in the top five.) 

In the end, black-bordered silly defeated silver-bordered silly.

Click here to continue onto Round 4. 

 Round 4: *Mirrodin* (#5) vs. *Urza's Destiny* (#12) 
 This round was a set from the Artifact Cycle taking on a set from the Artifact Block. (*Urza's Saga* was referred to as the Artifact Cycle—part of the storyline—on packaging, even though the main theme of the block was actually enchantments.) Do you pick the artifact set or the enchantment one? 



|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ***Mirrodin* included:** | ***Urza's Destiny* included:** |
| • affinity | • "reveal" mechanic |
| • entwine | • "lobotomy" mechanic |
| • equipment | • "flickering" |
| • imprint | • "cycling from play" |
| • artifact lands |  |
| • a major "artifacts-matters" theme |  |

  
 Choose which you would pick and then click here to see the outcome. 

*Mirrodin* defeated *Urza's Destiny* with 65% of the vote. *Urza's Destiny* had lots of things going against it. It was a small set up against a large set. It was an older set going up against a newer set (I mean "newer" as less old). *Urza's Destiny* was the weakest set in its broken block. *Urza's Destiny* also had a less coherent theme. 

In the end, the set with the record for being "the best-selling set of all time" the longest takes the victory.

Click here to continue onto Round 5. 

 Round 5: *Zendikar* (#4) vs. *Unhinged* (#13) 
This round was the battle of the full-frame land sets as the "land set" takes on the second silver-bordered one.



|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ***Zendikar* included:** | ***Unhinged* included:** |
| • allies | • gotcha |
| • landfall | • fractions |
| • quests | • "artist matters" |
| • traps | • donkey theme |
| • a major "land-matters" theme | • humor, including parody |
| • introduced intimidate |  |

  
 Choose which you would pick and then click here to see the outcome. 

 For a second time, the silver-bordered set was smashed in its pairing, with *Zendikar* defeating *Unhinged* soundly with 80% of the vote. While many voters appreciated the silver-bordered set, they didn't feel they could vote for it over a solid and popular black-bordered set. Many stated that landfall was their favorite mechanic of all time and that they loved the adventure world flavor of *Zendikar*. 

In the end, the less popular silver-bordered set never stood a chance.

Click here to continue onto Round 6. 

 Round 6: *Tempest* (#3) vs. *Odyssey* (#14) 
This round was the battle of the old sets, as they were the first two large sets I ever worked on.



|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ***Tempest* included:** | ***Odyssey* included:** |
| • buyback | • flashback |
| • licids | • threshold |
| • shadow | • "graveyard-matters" theme |
| • slivers |  |
| • connected to story |  |

  
 Choose which you would pick and then click here to see the outcome. 

 It was a pretty close match-up, as each set had its fans, but in the end *Tempest* managed to defeat *Odyssey* with 65% of the vote. What I think gave *Tempest* the edge was that *Odyssey* was a very Spikey set (the most Spikey set I've ever designed) and turned off many players who didn't enjoy card advantage being turned on its head. ("You see, the correct play here is to dump your entire hand to give this creature first strike even though it doesn't need it.") Also, *Tempest* was the beginning of the *Weatherlight* Saga (with the *Weatherlight* expansion being the set-up), a storyline beloved by some older fans. 

 In the end, Gerrard and company took down [Wild Mongrel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Mongrel) and company. 

Click here to continue onto Round 7. 

 Round 7: *Innistrad* (#2) vs. *Eventide* (#15) 
 This was the second battle of two dark worlds. (The planes of *Innistrad* and *Shadowmoor* also fought in the first match-up.) 



|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ***Innistrad* included:** | ***Eventide* included:** |
| • curses | • chroma |
| • double-faced cards | • retrace |
| • morbid | • new tweaks on enemy hybrid cards |
| • "Werewolf" mechanic |  |
| • tweaks on flashback |  |
| • introduced fight |  |
| • top-down horror design |  |

  
 Choose which you would pick and then click here to see the outcome. 

 As we get to the top seeds, the match-ups begin to be more of a smashing. *Innistrad* handily beats *Eventide* with 85% of the vote, the largest defeat yet. *Innistrad* was the lead set of one of the most popular blocks of all time, while *Eventide* was a lackluster follow-up to a less-enjoyed world (although, to be fair, there are many who loved the dual world of *Lorwyn* and *Shadowmoor*). 

In the end, the horror set proved to be a far scarier competitor.

Click here to continue onto Round 8. 

 Round 8: *Ravnica* (#1) vs. *Fifth Dawn* (#16) 
This final Top 16 battle was between a set that encouraged you to play two colors and one that encouraged you to play five.



|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| ***Ravnica* included:** | ***Fifth Dawn* included:** |
| • convoke | • scry |
| • dredge | • sunburst |
| • radiance | • "cogs matter" |
| • transmute | • more affinity, equipment, imprint |
| • hybrid mana | • five-color theme |
| • the guild model |  |

  
 Choose which you would pick and then click here to see the outcome. 

 Ravnica proves its top-seed position with the strongest victory in the Top 16. It defeats *Fifth Dawn* with a whopping 90% of the vote. *Fifth Dawn* had its fans but nothing could stand in the way of the guild-city juggernaut,Ravnica, which spawned the current *Return to Ravnica* block. 

 In the end, *Fifth Dawn* never had a chance. 

Click here to continue to the first quarterfinal match. 

 Round 9: *Zendikar* (#4) vs. *Mirrodin* (#5) 
 We come to our first quarterfinal match. It's "land matters" vs. "artifacts matters." Adventure World vs. Metal World. Who will win? 

Choose who you would pick and then click here to see the outcome. 

*Zendikar* came out swinging to defeat *Mirrodin* with 70% of the vote. *Mirrodin*'s downfall was twofold. First, *Zendikar* is one of the most popular sets in recent years. Second, some players associated *Mirrodin* with the degenerative Standard environment it created, causing many to leave the game. 

In the end, landfall defeated the set responsible for Standard's downfall.

 Round 10: *Tempest* (#3) vs. *Future Sight* (#11) 
 A set from the past with slivers takes on a set about the future with slivers. 

 Choose who you would pick and then click here to see the outcome. 

*Future Sight* continued its path of upsets (the only set thus far in the competition to have an upset) by defeating *Tempest* with 70% of the vote. *Tempest* is considered to be a groundbreaking set, but as the oldest set in the competition, it was both unknown to some and considered a bit stodgy by others. *Future Sight* has proven to be a much-beloved set by the more enfranchised players (and players who follow me on Twitter, on average, tend to be more enfranchised). 

Click here to continue to the next quarterfinal match. 

 Round 11: *Innistrad* (#2) vs. *Gatecrash* (#7) 
 This quarterfinal round is the large set I designed last block versus the one I designed this block. 

 Choose who you would pick and then click here to see the outcome. 

*Innistrad* had another blowout, defeating *Gatecrash* with 85% of the vote. *Gatecrash* is popular, but being so new it really hasn't had time to find its footing yet. And it was competing against *Innistrad*, which some argue is the best **Magic** set ever made.

 Round 12: *Ravnica* (#1) vs. *Shadowmoor* (#8) 
 This round is the set that premiered hybrid versus the set that made it matter most. 

 Choose who you would pick and then click here to see the outcome. 

*Ravnica* won this match-up pretty handily, winning 75% of the vote. *Shadowmoor* has its fans, but as we haven't done Return to *Shadowmoor* yet, it's pretty clear that Ravnica has more. 

Click here continue to the first semifinal match. 

 Round 13: *Ravnica* (#1) vs. *Zendikar* (#4) 
 Our first semifinal round pairs two very popular sets against one another. Has *Ravnica* finally met its match? 

 Choose who you would vote for and then click here to see the outcome. 

 Up until this round, *Ravnica* was winning by huge margins. All that ended when we had the closest match-up yet. Ravnica eked it out with a mere 52% of the vote. *Zendikar* had lots of fans and made a good run at beating Ravnica, but in the end it just wasn't able to overtake the #1 seed. 

Click here to continue to the other semifinal match. 

 Round 14: *Innistrad* (#2) vs. *Future Sight* (#11) 
*Future Sight* has upset every round thus far. Can it continue against one of the most popular sets of all time? 

Click here to see. 

 Nope. *Future Sight* is beloved by many, but not as much as *Innistrad*, which takes the match-up with 57% of the vote. *Future Sight* was overflowing with cool concepts but it didn't have the overall cohesion of *Innistrad*.

 Round 15: *Ravnica* (#1) vs. *Innistrad* (#2) 
 It comes down to the match everyone (including the people seeding the rumble) expected. Who walks away the winner of the Rosewater Rumble? 

Click here to see. 

 Ravnica had some of the best win records of the tournament but, in the end, it couldn't take down the popularity of *Innistrad*. *Innistrad* takes the ultimate battle with 60% of the vote. 

Now that we've seen how the Rosewater Rumble went, I want to do this one more time, except with a voting audience of one—me. I want to go through the match-ups, picking in each case which set I thought was the better designed. Being that I did them all, it's easy to remove the ego and just make an honest assessment as to which set I thought was the better design.

When I asked the public to vote I left the criteria up to each voter. For my personal Mark Rosewater Rumble, I've decided to vote for the set that I personally believe is the better design. Be aware that this is highly subjective but, hey, that's what things like this are all about—stating (and arguing) one's opinion.

 Round 1: *Shadowmoor* (#8) vs. *Dark Ascension* (#9) 
 What did I choose? 

Click here

 This first match-up is a pretty easy one for me. *Shadowmoor* was a groundbreaking design. It was the one that took the large/small/small block model—what up until then had been not just the default, but the only, option—and smashed it with a hammer. It showed that we could reevaluate how a block was put together. I also was proud of both wither and persist as mechanics and I think the draft environment was an interesting one that allowed a huge amount of freedom of choices. 

*Dark Ascension* built nicely on *Innistrad* but nothing was too revolutionary. The best new mechanic of the set was undying, which was a riff off persist from *Shadowmoor*. I'm proud of *Dark Ascension*, but to be honest with myself, *Shadowmoor* was a better design.

 Round 2: *Gatecrash* (#7) vs. *Scars of Mirrodin* (#10) 
Click here to see which I chose. 

 I'm happy with *Gatecrash* but most of the design was derivative (on purpose, mind you)—some from original Ravnica block and some from *Return to Ravnica*. I feel I added my own twist and I believe the new guild mechanics are all strong, but none of it I feel tops either infect or proliferate, both of which fall into my top ten favorite mechanics of all time. I'm also proud of how the mechanics helped shaped the flavor of the set and the conflict between the two sides. I think a lot of what I was able to do with *Innistrad* came about because of lessons I learned on *Scars of Mirrodin*.

 Round 3: *Unglued* (#6) vs. *Future Sight* (#11) 
 I felt this was the toughest match-up in the Top 16. 

Click here to see which I chose.

 This is probably my most controversial pick, especially when compared to the fan vote, so let me explain. These two sets might be the two most difficult sets I've ever designed. *Unglued* started with an open-ended request to make a silver-bordered set (where silver-bordered was merely defined as "not tournament legal") while *Future Sight* had the daunting task of "hinting at the future of **Magic**." Both sets paved the way for what future sets would do. Each was experimental and allowed me to explore new design space. 

 Both sets have gone on to have a cult status with diehard followings. The reason I lean toward *Unglued* was that its goal was to be a niche product. It wasn't designed with a mass audience in mind. *Future Sight* was. It was meant to be an expert expansion with wide appeal. In that regard, *Future Sight* was a failure. It sold poorly because the majority of the audience couldn't follow it. Yes, those who understood it loved it, but that was a minority of the intended audience (although a possible majority of those enfranchised enough to follow me on social media). 

 I know it angers some of my audience every time I call *Future Sight* a failure, because it was such a success for the segment that got it. I refer to *Future Sight* as my "art house picture." It got rave reviews from all the critics and had a terrible opening weekend. If I have to judge my design I have to take into account the target I was aiming for. Yes, *Future Sight* ended up this wonderful thing, but it wasn't what I was supposed to be making and, to be blunt, I missed with a giant segment of the audience. I can't just look at the reactions of its fans, I also have to look at the reaction of the many players who just didn't understand it. 

 Another stark contrast was that *Future Sight* was extrapolative design—that is, it was designed to be what players expected the future to be, whereas *Unglued* was true blue-sky design. Both were difficult but if I'm honest with myself as a designer (an ongoing theme in my rumble), *Unglued* was a lot more challenging. I know this pick will result in the most criticism, but this exercise is me being honest with myself as to which design was stronger and, in my opinion, it was *Unglued*.

 Round 4: *Mirrodin* (#5) vs. *Urza's Destiny* (#12) 
 Which of these two sets from the two most overpowered blocks did I choose? 

Click here to see. 

*Urza's Destiny* is the set I designed all by myself. Of all the sets I've done, it has more build-around-me cards percentagewise than any other set I've done (i.e., it's the most Johnny-friendly design I've made). I'm very proud of it. That said, it doesn't hold a candle to *Mirrodin*. *Mirrodin* is the first truly cohesive world I did where the design mechanics helped define the feel of the world. It introduced Equipment, which became an instant evergreen mechanic. It had affinity, imprint, and entwine, all of which I think are good mechanics. (Affinity had some power issues but I do still believe in the mechanic.) It was chock full of a bunch of iconic cards like [Mindslaver](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mindslaver) and [Platinum Angel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Platinum+Angel). 

*Urza's Destiny* was good but I feel *Mirrodin* was better.

 Round 5: *Zendikar* (#4) vs. *Unhinged* (#13) 
 Which one did I choose? 

Click here to see. 

 While there are a lot of individual cards in *Unhinged* I am proud of, I feel the set as a whole was a bit of a letdown. In particular, I now believe that gotcha was one of the worst mechanics I've ever designed and it sucked the fun out of what was supposed to be an extra-fun format. *Zendikar*, on the other hand, is a contender for one of the best sets I've ever designed. This pick was clear.

 Round 6: *Tempest* (#3) vs. *Odyssey* (#14) 
 Who wins the battle of the old sets? 

Click here to see. 

 This is another blowout. I consider *Tempest* to be one of my best and *Odyssey* one of my worst. *Odyssey* proved to be the set I learned the most from, but that is because I did so many things wrong. The biggest error was to make a super-Spikey set that alienated much of the audience because they didn't want to do what the set made them need to do. 

 This match-up is an easy pick for *Tempest*.

 Round 7: *Innistrad* (#2) vs. *Eventide* (#15) 
 Who wins? 

Click here to see. 

 The high/low seed pairings are pretty predictable. *Innistrad* is a contender for my best design ever and *Eventide* was full of mistakes, the biggest being the choice to switch over to enemy hybrid. The 180-degree turn was hard for players to adapt to. There are pieces of *Eventide* I like but the set as a whole doesn't hold together.

 Round 8: *Ravnica* (#1) vs. *Fifth Dawn* (#16) 
 We come to the final Top 16 match. 

Click here to see who wins. 

 This was the biggest sweep in the public vote and probably the same in my personal one. Ravnica is one of **Magic**'s highpoints and introduced all sorts of cool things (the guilds, hybrid, lots of iconic gold cards, etc.). *Fifth Dawn* was a crazy third-act turn (necessitated by earlier mistakes in the block) that wasn't properly set up. The best thing I can say about *Fifth Dawn* is that it made us realize the value of [Aaron Forsythe](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Archive.aspx?author=Aaron%20Forsythe) and got him into Ramp;D. 

*Ravnica* by a landslide.

 Round 9: *Zendikar* (#4) vs. *Mirrodin* (#5) 
 Okay, now it starts getting hard. (Well, *Unglued* vs. *Future Sight* was hard.)

 Choosing between one's babies is inherently difficult, but this match-up really made me think hard. Both sets introduced cool new things to the game. Both sets set up a cool world using mechanics to help give it the proper feel. *Mirrodin*'s mechanics (affinity, entwine, Equipment, and imprint) had a higher quality average, but *Zendikar* has landfall, which is tied for my favorite keyword mechanic that I've designed (the other being flashback). 

 Each set was me proving something different as a designer. *Mirrodin* was trying to show how the mechanics could be an extension of the world. *Zendikar* was me trying to show that we could maintain a high quality while also making [New World Order](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/mm/172) work. In many ways, it was trying to do much of what *Mirrodin* did but with a more restrictive set of tools. I'm happy with how *Mirrodin* turned out (remember that power level is a development issue, not a design one) but I was happier with *Zendikar*. 

 It was a squeaker but *Zendikar* pulls it out.

 Round 10: *Tempest* (#3) vs. *Unglued* (#6) 
 It took ten rounds but we finally get to a match-up that was different than what you all voted on.

 Man, the quarterfinals are hard. I love what I did with *Unglued* and I do believe it is some of my best individual card design, but it's going up against a set that historically redefined design for **Magic**. *Mirage* introduced blocks to the game, but *Tempest* shifted how we made them. It was the first set to really interconnect story with mechanics. It was the first set to start to tie together the different mechanical components synergistically. It was a big leap forward. Yes, it looks stodgy by today's standards, but then, so does the Model T. 

 As a historian of design, I have to give it to *Tempest*.

 Round 11: *Innistrad* (#2) vs. *Scars of Mirrodin* (#10) 
 We now come to the second altered match-up. 

Click here to see how I voted. 

 I'm happy that we got back to *Mirrodin*. I love how we reshaped the world; how we reintroduced **Magic**'s big bad, the Phyrexians; and how we managed to finally get poison back into the game. But Scars just can't hold a candle to *Innistrad*. *Scars of Mirrodin* started the [fifth age of design](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/mm/171) but *Innistrad* took a big step up. It redefined how we could make a **Magic** block and put top-down block design in a whole new light (previous attempts had always gone a bit sour). 

 Many of the quarterfinal match-ups have been hard but this one was not. *Innistrad* easily wins.

 Round 12: *Ravnica* (#1) vs. *Shadowmoor* (#8) 
 We come to the final quarterfinal match.

 This one wasn't close with the public and it's not close for me. I adore many things that *Shadowmoor* did, but it's just up against one of the most groundbreaking sets I've ever done. This isn't a fair fight and is one *Ravnica* wins without breaking a sweat. 

*Ravnica* again by a landslide.

 Round 13: *Ravnica* (#1) vs. *Zendikar* (#4) 
 And so we begin the semifinals. 

Click here to see how it turns out. 

 This match-up makes the quarterfinals look like a cake walk. Both of these sets are among the best I've ever done. Which is better? It's not an easy choice to make. Each has one of my all-time favorite things I've done—hybrid for *Ravnica* and landfall for *Zendikar*. Both are worlds where the mechanics are an integrated part of the flavor. Both are chock full of lots of fun individual card designs. In the end though, *Ravnica* has the guild model, which is a step slightly above of what *Zendikar* created. 

*Ravnica* squeaked by in the public vote and does the same in my personal one.

 Round 14: *Innistrad* (#2) vs. *Tempest* (#3) 
 And this brings us to the second semifinals. 

Click here to see how it turns out. 

 This is the altered semifinal round where I get a different vote than all of you. It's one of my latest and greatest against my first design. Both of them were original and both influence all the designs that follow them. In many ways, this isn't a fair fight because I've learned so much since designing *Tempest*. *Innistrad* is the result of years of design technology improvement and it results in a superior product—one which I believe will also be shined upon by history. 

 You never forget your first, but I have to pass it by to pick what I think is the better design: *Innistrad*.

 Round 15: *Ravnica* (#1) vs. *Innistrad* (#2) 
 In the end, my personal rumble matches the public's. Did I vote the same as them? 

Click here to see. 

Of all the match-ups this was by far the hardest. When we seeded the sets, I kept going back and forth on what was supposed to be Seed #1 and what was supposed to be Seed #2. I guess even then I knew this was not an easy decision.

 Both sets introduced amazing things and came together to make memorable blocks. In the end, I made my choice with this decision with the following question: How close was this set to the best I could do? When I looked deep inside and was as bluntly honest as I could be, the answer was clear. *Innistrad* was closer to perfection than *Ravnica*. I consider radiance to be a mistake. The design didn't have enough of a city feel. The synergy between guilds was uneven (for example, Golgari overlapped beautifully with Selesnya but not as well with Dimir). *Ravnica* had much go right but I believe I made more mistakes. 

 That's not to say *Innistrad* couldn't be improved, but it was closer to the bull's-eye. *Innistrad* does have six more years of design technology and six more years of experience, so maybe it's not the fairest fight, but then the rumble was all about forcing comparisons between sets. 

 So when the dust settles, in the Mark Rosewater Rumble, just as in the regular [Rosewater Rumble](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23rosewaterrumble), *Innistrad* is the winner. 

The Fight Is Over
 Whew! I'm tired, so let's call it a day. I'm curious, as always, to hear your take on my take. How do you think my rumble went and how did you feel about the public one? Let me know in my email, in the column's thread, or in any of my social media ([Twitter](https://twitter.com/maro254), [Tumblr](http://markrosewater.tumblr.com/), and [Google+](https://plus.google.com/107824009487778543249/posts)). 

Join me next week when I look at Dimir.

Until then, may you have the chance to see people fight passionately over your creations.

Drive to Work #24—The Mana System
 Today's podcast is the third in the Golden Trifecta series where I talk about [Richard Garfield](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Archive.aspx?author=Richard%20Garfield)'s three genius creations when he made **Magic**. Two weeks ago, I talked about the trading card game genre; last week, I talked about the color wheel; and today, I talk about the most maligned of the three: **Magic**'s mana system.
