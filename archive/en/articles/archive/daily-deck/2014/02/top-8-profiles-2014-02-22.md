You know, after playing Magic for 10 years without any big success, this top 8 all really means a lot for me. Winning would just be amazing…

I played affinity a lot on Magic Online and talked a lot with the German / Austrian team, especially with Patrick Dickmann who helped me a lot with the tuning and sideboard plans. For Limited I did like 20 drafts on Magic Online.
