**What's the strangest deck you've faced this weekend?**

***Frank Karsten**: Zoo. It's not so strange, but I thought it had become unpopular since the Pro Tour.* 


![](https://media.wizards.com/2014/events/gpbos14/Matej_ZatlkajQQ.jpg)
***Matej "Big Z" Zatlkaj**: A crazy discard deck with 4 [The Rack](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=The+Rack) and 4 [Shrieking Affliction](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shrieking+Affliction).*

***Nathan Holiday**: Soul Sisters. I know it's not strange- well, I know that people sometimes play it, but still.*

***Denniz Rachid**: Blue-Black Teachings. I'm playing Infect and kept what I thought was a good hand. Then he played turn-one [Darkblast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Darkblast). I could've conceded right there.*

***Guillaume Wafo-Tapa**: Mono-Blue Control, with [Scrying Sheets](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scrying+Sheets) and snow-covered Islands.*

***Alexander Hayne** : Burn with [Keldon Megaliths](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Keldon+Megaliths).*
