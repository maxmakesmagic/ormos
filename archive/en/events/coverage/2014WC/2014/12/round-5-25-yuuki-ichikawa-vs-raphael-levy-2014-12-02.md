 Pro Tour winner. Pro Tour Hall of Fame member. World *Magic* Cup-winning team captain. The career of Raphaël Lévy spans three different decades and nearly every continent on the planet. Encapsulating his accomplishments in a paragraph is a foolhardy endeavor: His full [World Championship player profile](/node/292871) is better suited to explaining his accomplishments.



And the World Championship is full of talented players like Lévy, but they aren't the whole cast.



 Yuuki Ichikawa is arguably the face of Japanese *Magic* streaming. A breakout star throughout 2014, Ichikawa earned Top 25 ranking, currently No. 25, and a second Pro Tour Top 8 in just five attended. While his history in the game is a fraction of Lévy's, the talent and skill Ichikawa has put on display makes it clear there's plenty of new faces ready to overrun the old vanguard. You can learn more about him by checking out [his player profile](/node/314574).



The World Championship is exactly where the greatest, old and new, decide it.


The Decks
=========



 Lévy, like many of his competitors, brought a combo deck. Unlike many of his competitors, [Scapeshift](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scapeshift) was his combo of choice, built to turn [Valakut, the Molten Pinnacle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Valakut%2C+the+Molten+Pinnacle) triggers into a hefty hit of burn to an opponent's face. With an impressive undefeated run through thirteen rounds at Grand Prix Richmond, the largest Modern tournament in history, as well as victory in the hands of Park Jun Young at Grand Prix Minneapolis, [Scapeshift](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scapeshift)'s potency has been on the edges of the top for some time.



Ichikawa, however, had a distinct flavor of Temur Delver. It was also the same deck that fellow Japanese contenders Yuuya Watanabe and Kentarou Yamamoto were playing.



 "I tested with Kentarou Yamamoto and Yuuya Watanabe; We're all playing the same deck," Ichikawa explained. "In this Modern environment, we thought the Temur Delver deck would be the strongest. We dug deeper and made our own version. The number one reason was [Treasure Cruise](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treasure+Cruise), where we felt we could play the long game and the short. [Tarmogoyf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf) is also very strong."




 What had Ichikawa expected to see? "[Scapeshift](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scapeshift), Blue-Red Delver, Resto Pod, B/G Rock, [Splinter Twin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Splinter+Twin), more of the former and less and you go down the list. We haven't played against [Jeskai Ascendancy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jeskai+Ascendancy) yet but we thought some might bring it."




 How did the Japanese contingent come to their deck? "We spent like three or four days together and played *Magic Online* separately, then we brought our results back together and talked about it. Usually [Young Pyromancer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Young+Pyromancer) is in this type of deck but we wanted to get rid of it. We didn't think it worked as well."



Ichikawa was drawn to their flavor of Temur Delver based on a different deck. "I love Canadian Threshold in Legacy," Ichikawa explained, "so I brought that kind of idea to Modern. It's working out very well today, even though I lost against Yamamoto last round."




*Hall of Famer Raphaël Lévy and young star twenty-fifth-ranked Yuuki Ichikawa settle into one of many pairings here this week that feature both the old and new guard battling it out.*
