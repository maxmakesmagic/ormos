Time for another quiz! Last time it was all about artifacts and some of you did quite well on that one! This time it's all about ***Magic** 2014* Core Set, and I hope you're prepared because tomorrow is [the Prerelease](http://www.wizards.com/Magic/TCG/Events.aspx?x=mtgcom/events/prereleases&dcmp=ILC-MTGNTOP) and you'll need to [know the cards](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&set=+%5b%22Magic+2014%22%5d) in the set!


Q**1.** Which two cards with “Giant” in their name are both printed in ***Magic** 2014*?


*(Difficulty: Easy)*


[50/50 Hint](#) - Click this to eliminate two wrong answers.


* [Giant Albatross & Giant Crab](#)  - WRONG - [Giant Albatross](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Giant+Albatross) was printed in *Homelands* while [Giant Crab](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Giant+Crab) was originally printed in *Tempest*. Though a normal albatross dwarfs a crab, here the [Giant Crab](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Giant+Crab) is more than capable of fending off the [Giant Albatross](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Giant+Albatross).
* [Giant Growth & Giant Spider](#)  - RIGHT! - [Giant Growth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Giant+Growth) returns to the core set for the first time since ***Magic** 2011*, and [Giant Spider](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Giant+Spider) was also absent in last year’s ***Magic** 2013*, so they are happy to be reunited in **Magic**’s latest core set.
* [Blind-Spot Giant & Giant Dustwasp](#)   - WRONG - Both of these cards were printed in *Modern Masters* but neither appear in ***Magic** 2014*.
* [Giant Solifuge & Oathsworn Giant](#)  - WRONG - Both cards appeared in the original *Ravnica* block, but not in any recent sets.

Q**2.** How many cards are in ***Magic** 2014*?


*(Difficulty: Medium)*


[50/50 Hint](#) - Click this to eliminate two wrong answers.


* [156 cards](#) - WRONG - There were 156 cards in *Dragon’s Maze*.
* [229 cards](#) - WRONG - There were 229 cards in *Modern Masters*.
* [249 cards](#) - RIGHT! - Spot on!
* [290 cards](#) - WRONG - There were 290 cards in **Magic**'s first set, Alpha.

Q**3.**  [Colossal Whale](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Colossal+Whale) is a rare from ***Magic** 2014*. It is one of only four creatures in **Magic** with the creature-type “Whale.” What is the largest power among the Whales?


*(Difficulty: Medium)*


[50/50 Hint](#) - Click this to eliminate two wrong answers.


* [4](#)  - WRONG - Pay attention! [Colossal Whale](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Colossal+Whale) is a 5/5 so this isn't possibly right.
* [5](#)  - RIGHT! - Both [Colossal Whale](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Colossal+Whale) and [Great Whale](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Great+Whale) are tied with a power of 5.
* [6](#)  - WRONG - There are no whales with a six power, though you could get three [Narwhal](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Narwhal), which would be 6 power.
* [7](#)  - WRONG - Sorry, but no. There aren't a lot of [7 power creatures in blue](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?action=advanced&color=+@(+%5BU%5D)&power=+=%5B7%5D).

Q**4.** Which Planeswalker in ***Magic** 2014* has the same starting loyalty as his or her counterpart from *Lorwyn*?


*(Difficulty: Medium)*


[Hint](#) - It is neither Chandra nor Garruk.


[Reveal the answer](#)



Of the Planeswalkers in ***Magic** 2014* and *Lorwyn*, the only pair which have the same starting loyalty are:



![Ajani, Caller of the Pride](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Ajani,%20Caller%20of%20the%20Pride&options=)
![Ajani Goldmane](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Ajani%20Goldmane&options=)


[Ajani, Caller of the Pride](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ajani%2C+Caller+of+the+Pride), [Chandra, Pyromaster](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chandra%2C+Pyromaster), [Garruk, Caller of Beasts](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Garruk%2C+Caller+of+Beasts), and [Jace, Memory Adept](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace%2C+Memory+Adept) have a starting loyalty of 4.


Q**5.** Which of the following is the oldest first-time reprint in ***Magic** 2014*? That is, before ***Magic** 2014*, this card had only been printed one time.


*(Difficulty: Hard)*


[50/50 Hint](#) - Click this to eliminate two wrong answers.


* [Capashen Knight](#)  - RIGHT! - Originally printed in *Urza’s Destiny*, it was first printed in 1999.
* [Coral Merfolk](#)  - WRONG - Although it was printed originally in *Urza’s Saga*, making it the oldest card amongst the answers, it has since been printed a handful of times, most recently in ***Magic** 2012*.
* [Lightning Talons](#)  - WRONG - [Lightning Talons](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Talons) was originally printed in *Shards of Alara*, and there are other cards in this list much older.
* [Shrivel](#)  - WRONG - Originally printed in *Rise of the Eldrazi* it is the youngest card on this question!
