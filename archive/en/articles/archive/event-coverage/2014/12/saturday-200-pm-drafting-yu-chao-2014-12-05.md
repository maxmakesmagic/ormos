Good players are not lacking in China and I have the honor of sitting down with Yu Chao today. Beneath his gentle demeanor, he is a deceptively strong opponent you do not want to encounter. Currently the highest rated player in China, Yu Chao is possibly known for his exceedingly superior drafting capabilities. He made Top 8 of his Nationals last year, no thanks to the constructed portion (he went 3-3 playing Jund), but because he went 6-0 in the booster draft portion. Let us sit down and see what insights he has to offer us for his first draft of the day!


Booster One (New Phyrexia)


Yu was happy to open a [Lashwrithe](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lashwrithe) but his happiness was very short-lived. Black dried up almost immediately and Yu could only be content with two [Blighted Agents](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blighted+Agents) and [Glissa's Scorn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glissa%27s+Scorn) by pick five. This twist of events was not totally unfortunate though, as Infect seemed pretty open to him. He managed to snag a [Vapor Snag](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vapor+Snag) and eventually tabling another two [Blighted Agents](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blighted+Agents) and double [Psychic Barrier](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psychic+Barrier), giving him a relatively good start.

 Better Than [Red Sun's Zenith](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Red+Sun%27s+Zenith)! |

**Booster Two (Mirrodin Besieged)**


Being already heavily cemented in Blue Green Infect, he was faced with the decision of [Blightwidow](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blightwidow) and [Plague Myr](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plague+Myr). [Red Sun's Zenith](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Red+Sun%27s+Zenith) did not even interest him as he flipped it behind the booster without hesitation. He decided to go for the infectious [Giant Spider](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Giant+Spider) and followed up pick two with [Plague Myr](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plague+Myr). [Core Prowler](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Core+Prowler) gave him a light touch of proliferation and a second [Blightwidow](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blightwidow+) Â joined his pile soon after. He was able to pick up a couple of [Steel Sabotage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Steel+Sabotage)s and a [Pistus Strike](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pistus+Strike), giving this color combination some required sideboard removal spells.


1st [Blightwidow](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blightwidow)  

2nd [Plague Myr](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plague+Myr)  

3rd [Core Prowler](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Core+Prowler)

6th [Mirran Mettle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mirran+Mettle)  

7th [Viridian Emissary](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Viridian+Emissary)

12th [Neurok Commando](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Neurok+Commando)  

13th [Kemba's Legion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kemba%27s+Legion)  

14th [Phyresis](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phyresis)


**Booster Three (Scars of Mirrodin)**


Yu was not blessed with good luck though and was forced to counterdraft [Geth, Lord of the Vault](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Geth%2C+Lord+of+the+Vault) before picking up a couple of [Untamed Might](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Untamed+Might)s. He lamented that the 3rd booster did almost nothing to improve his already solid deck, and was relatively disappointed with the outcome. He was able a pick up a [Sylvok Lifestaff](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sylvok+Lifestaff) to go with his quadruple [Blighted Agents](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blighted+Agents), but that was about it for him. Overall, this booster was not merciful to him and he would have liked to receive some bombs in his color.


1st [Geth, Lord of the Vault](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Geth%2C+Lord+of+the+Vault)  

2nd [Untamed Might](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Untamed+Might)  

3rd [Fume Spitter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fume+Spitter)  

4th [Silver Myr](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Silver+Myr)  

5th [Untamed Might](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Untamed+Might)  

6th [Disperse](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Disperse)  

7th [Sylvok Lifestaff](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sylvok+Lifestaff)  

8th [Vedalken Certarch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vedalken+Certarch)  

9th [Twisted Image](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Twisted+Image)  

10th [Carrion Call](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Carrion+Call)  

11th [Withstand Death](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Withstand+Death)  

12th [Bleak Coven Vampires](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bleak+Coven+Vampires)  

13th [Riddlesmith](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Riddlesmith)  

14th [Whitesun's Passage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Whitesun%27s+Passage)


When asked if he was able to go 3-0 with this deck, he humbly mentioned that it would not be an easy task. "2-1 would be a more realistic score but I honestly would not mind winning the pod." A quartet of unblockable "infectors", a light touch of removal, pump spells and countermagic should allow him to go all the way. Good luck, Yu!
