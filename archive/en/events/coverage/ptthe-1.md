Dezani Proclaims Allez les Bleus at Pro Tour!
=============================================




October 11-13, 2013













Pro Tour Theros 2013

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/ptths13/620_dezani.jpg)Maybe it should have been called Pro Tour Thassa. Rising French star Jeremy Dezani and his Mono-Blue Devotion deck filled with [Thassa, God of the Sea](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thassa%2C+God+of+the+Sea), [Master of Waves](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Master+of+Waves), and an army of blue creatures defeated Team Revolution teammate Pierre Dagen playing a nearly identical deck to earn the title of Pro Tour *Theros* champion.


Devotion was a major theme throughout the weekend in Dublin. Both the Standard and Booster Draft formats were filled with Devotion cards thanks to the introduction of *Theros*. Dagen and Dezany showed their devotion to their team and country with masterful performances, re-asserting France as a major power in **Magic**. The weekend began with Magic's ultimate tribute to devotion—the induction of legendary players Luis Scott-Vargas, William Jensen, and Ben Stark into the **Magic**  Pro Tour Hall of Fame.


Congratulations to Jeremy Dezani, the Pro Tour *Theros* champion! If you missed any of Sunday's action, [watch the replay here](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/magazine/events.aspx?x=mtgevent/webcast/home).
