*Kaldheim* Redemption Begins Wednesday
--------------------------------------


The delay is over! Starting Wednesday morning, you'll be able to redeem your complete sets of *Kaldheim* (both premium and regular) for physical copies of those cards shipped directly to you. See [the redemption page](https://magic.wizards.com/en/gameinfo/products/magiconline/redemption) for full rules and policies regarding this process.


Since we started a week later than originally planned, we're going to shift the end dates to match. These new dates are as follows:


* *Kaldheim* redemption's availability guarantee will expire on May 19. After that, redemption will be available only as supplies last.
* *Kaldheim* redemption will end completely on June 23.



---

*Vintage Cube* March 3–24
-------------------------


We've got a three-week run of this classic experience from March 3 until March 24. March is a little unusual for this cube, but . . . well, we live in unusual times and the MOCS Showcase events on March 13 and 14 are worth celebrating. Life's too short not to have a little more *Vintage Cube*.


For a full list of the latest changes to *Vintage Cube*, click [here](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/vintage-cube-cardlist).




---

*Ultimate Masters* Flashback Ends Tomorrow
------------------------------------------


*Ultimate Masters* Flashback Draft, one of the most underplayed yet incredibly fun draft environments, ends tomorrow, March 3, so get online and draft your favorite bombs before it's too late!


Players may enter with any of the following options: 10 Event Tickets; 1 *Ultimate Masters* booster + 3 Event Tickets; or 100 Play Points.




---

*Kaldheim* Season Alternative Play Calendar
-------------------------------------------


For *Kaldheim* season's alternative play, we have quite the variety for you. Please note that events change over from one week to the next on Wednesday mornings and last for one week unless specified otherwise.


* **March 24: *Time Spiral Remastered* Supreme Draft**. *Time Spiral Remastered* comes out on March 19. Before everyone has mastered this remaster, let's draft some truly absurd decks.
* **March 31: A new Spotlight Cube**. As usual, we'll have more to share when we get closer.
* **April 7: Another new Spotlight Cube**. Again, details will come as the event approaches.

Showcase Challenge Weekend
--------------------------


Players looking to prove their mettle against the best players in *Magic Online* will want to use their QPs to enter *Magic Online* Champions Showcase (MOCS) events such as the returning Showcase Challenges this weekend. These MOCS events are a set of linked events designed to highlight the best players on *Magic Online* each season, culminating in the Champions Showcase and its prize pool of $70,000 and a Split Championship invitation.


First up on Saturday, March 6, we have the Standard (6 a.m. PT), Modern (8 a.m. PT), and Vintage (10 a.m. PT) Showcase Challenges. Then on Sunday, March 7, we finish off with the Pioneer (6 a.m. PT), Legacy (8 a.m. PT), and *Kaldheim* Sealed (9 a.m. PT) Showcase Challenges. Each of these events requires 40 QPs to enter. The Top 8 finishers from each event will earn a qualification token to enter the appropriate Showcase Qualifier in April or May.
