Hot off of his second place finish at the Pro Tour Dragons of Tarkir last weekend, Shota Yasooka is looking to keep his hot streak alive at Grand Prix Kyōto. Although Legacy is not a format he plays frequently, Shota Yasooka decided on bringing OmniTell to this event. A deck with a lot of raw power, Yasooka hopes power out a quick [Emrakul, the Aeons Torn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Emrakul%2C+the+Aeons+Torn) with either [Show and Tell](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Show+and+Tell) or [Omniscience](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Omniscience). The general consensus among Japanese pros is that OmniTell became much stronger after the recent Banned and Restricted announcement took [Treasure Cruise](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treasure+Cruise) away from the various Delver decks.


His opponent, Hayato Kawachi is an up and coming tournament player from Wakayama. Starting the tournament off well with three quick wins, he seemed un-phased to sit across from a former Pro Tour champion. His deck of choice this weekend is Death and Taxes--a deck that takes advantage of the multitude of powerful white utility creatures to disrupt opponents and attack for victory. With many tools to disrupt Yasooka's combo, Kawachi confidently shuffled up for the first game.


The Games
=========


Play started off with a [Thalia, Guardian of Thraben](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thalia%2C+Guardian+of+Thraben) from Kawachi. Knowing that his combo deck would be hindered by the 2/1, Yasooka countered it with [Force of Will](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Force+of+Will). After setting up his draws with a pair of [Ponder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ponder)s and a [Preordain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Preordain), Yasooka cast [Show and Tell](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Show+and+Tell) on his third turn. For Yasooka this netted him a [Omniscience](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Omniscience), for Kawachi a [Flickerwisp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flickerwisp). [Flickerwisp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flickerwisp) temporarily exiled [Omniscience](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Omniscience). This put a pause on the combo and gave Kawachi one turn to find an answer. Kawachi untapped and attempted to cast a pair of [Phyrexian Revoker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phyrexian+Revoker)s, but Yasooka had a pair of [Force of Will](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Force+of+Will)s to counter the artifact creatures.

When Yasooka untapped with [Omniscience](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Omniscience) in play he cast a free [Emrakul, the Aeons Torn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Emrakul%2C+the+Aeons+Torn) netting him an extra turn and prompting the concession from Kawachi



**Yasooka 1 - 0 Kawachi**



The second game started with a [Gitaxian Probe](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gitaxian+Probe) from Yasooka revealing Kawachi's hand which included a pair of [Stoneforge Mystic](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stoneforge+Mystic)s, a [Phyrexian Revoker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phyrexian+Revoker), and an [Aven Mindcensor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aven+Mindcensor). On Kawachi's second turn he cast a [Stoneforge Mystic](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stoneforge+Mystic) and fetched up a [Batterskull](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Batterskull).


Yasooka used a [Lightning Bolt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt) to clear away Kawachi's first [Stoneforge Mystic](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stoneforge+Mystic)--attempting to put a stall on [Batterskull](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Batterskull), but Kawachi cast his second copy. This time he found a [Sword of Fire and Ice](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sword+of+Fire+and+Ice) and added it to his hand.

Yasooka found a [Show and Tell](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Show+and+Tell) on his following turn. Mirroring the previous game, Yasooka put an [Omniscience](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Omniscience) into play while Kawachi used his [Flickerwisp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flickerwisp) to attempt to put a hold on Yasooka's combo. This time, however, Yasooka had a number of responses to [Flickerwisp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flickerwisp)'s enter the battlefield ability. After casting a [Dig Through Time](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dig+Through+Time) and an [Impulse](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Impulse) he found [Firemind's Foresight](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Firemind%27s+Foresight). The seven mana instant found him [Brainstorm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brainstorm) and a [Cunning Wish](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cunning+Wish).

Still in response to the [Flickerwisp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flickerwisp) trigger, Yasooka used [Cunning Wish](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cunning+Wish) to find a [Release the Ants](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Release+the+Ants) from his sideboard. He then used [Brainstorm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brainstorm) to put an Emrakul from his hand on the top of the library. Since Emrakul allowed Yasooka to always win the clash on [Release the Ants](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Release+the+Ants), Yasooka was able to deal 20 damage at instant speed and win the match.



**Shota Yasooka defeats Hayato Kawachi 2-0**
