Merfolk, 10-0-1


**Why did you choose your deck?**


[Chalice of the Void](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chalice+of+the+Void) on 1 plus a fast clock seems good against a lot of decks.


**What were your best cards in your main deck? Why?**


[Chalice of the Void](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chalice+of+the+Void), [True-Name Nemesis](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=True-Name+Nemesis), and [Cavern of Souls](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cavern+of+Souls). [True-Name Nemesis](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=True-Name+Nemesis) is almost impossible to remove. [Chalice of the Void](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chalice+of+the+Void) and [Cavern of Souls](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cavern+of+Souls) locks out opponents decks without disrupting your own deck.

### Akash Naidu

**Age:** 24


**Hometown:** Boston, MA

9th Grand Prix New Jersey; PTQ Top 8


**What did you play today, and how did you do?**


Blue-Red [Omniscience](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Omniscience), 9-1-1


**Why did you choose your deck?**


It has done me well in the past and I can't resist combo decks.


**What were your best cards in your main deck? Why?**


[Dig Through Time](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dig+Through+Time). It's basically double [Demonic Tutor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Demonic+Tutor).


**What were the best cards in your sideboard? Why?**


[Lightning Bolt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt). I had multiple rounds where I attacked an [Emrakul, the Aeons Torn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Emrakul%2C+the+Aeons+Torn) and would have died on the swing back if not for [Cunning Wish](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cunning+Wish) into [Lightning Bolt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt) for lethal. [Young Pyromancer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Young+Pyromancer). It just makes a lot of bad matchups winnable.


**What is your favorite card in Legacy?**


[Cabal Therapy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cabal+Therapy). I enjoy the mind games it causes no matter whether I'm playing with it or against it.

Lands. Made Top 8.


**Why did you choose your deck?**


The popularity of Noah's [Delver of Secrets](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Delver+of+Secrets) deck pushed me off it.

[Dark Depths](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dark+Depths) and [Thespian's Stage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thespian%27s+Stage). They make a 20/20.


**What were the best cards in your sideboard? Why?**


[Trinisphere](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Trinisphere). It's busted enough to be restricted in Vintage but I can play four.
