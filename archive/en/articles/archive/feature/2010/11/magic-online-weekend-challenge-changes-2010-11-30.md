The Weekend Challenges were originally designed to allow fans of four main Specialty Formats (Classic, 100-Card Singleton, Pauper, and Standard Singleton) a chance to play in Premier-style events each week. While exciting at first, these events have not had the sustained success that we would have hoped and have decided to replace them. 

Beginning the weekend of December 10, we will offer the following Specialty Event schedule instead of the previous Weekend Challenge schedule: 



|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Time** | **Friday** | **Saturday** | **Sunday** |
| 5:00 AM PST(13:00 UTC) | ClassicDaily Event | 100-Card SingletonDaily Event  | PauperDaily Event |
| 10:00 AM PST(18:00 UTC) | 100-Card SingletonDaily Event | PauperPremier Event  | Standard SingletonDaily Event |
| 4:00 PM PST(00:00 UTC) | PauperDaily Event | Standard SingletonDaily Event  | ClassicDaily Event  |
| 8:00 PM PST(04:00 UTC) | Standard SingletonDaily Event | ClassicDaily Event | 100-Card SingletonDaily Event |

  
 While the scheduled time slots will remain constant, the formats will continue to rotate through them, similar to the previous Weekend Challenge rotation. Switching to Daily Events lets us increase the number of Specialty Format events we offer each weekend while reducing the minimum number of players required for each event to fire. For players who prefer a PE style experience, the Specialty Format event scheduled at 10 AM each Saturday will be a Premier Event (using the new structure announced above). This means that each Specialty Format will get a regularly scheduled PE once every four weeks. 

Check out the [**Magic Online** Calendar](/en/articles/archive/2009-07-14) (to be posted early Wednesday, December 1) for the full Specialty Event schedule.
