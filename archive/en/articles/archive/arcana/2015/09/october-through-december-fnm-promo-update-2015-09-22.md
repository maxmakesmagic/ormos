Blake is the content manager for DailyMTG.com, making him the one you should email if you have thoughts on the website, good or less good (or not good). He's a longtime coverage reporter and hasn't turned down a game of Magic in any format ever. 






The month is nearly over, so once again it's time to take a trip in our Friday Night *Magic* time machine and see what promos we have in store (and in stores!) for the coming months.


**October**


The spookiest month deserves a spooky [Ultimate Price](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ultimate+Price) promo. Get your own head in a bag with new art by Scott Murphyâ€”and get it soon, because the colorless Eldrazi are about to have the upper hand.

**November**


Is it a coincidence that our hottest promos come during some of the coldest months in North America? Stay warm with this Zoltan Boros take on [Roast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Roast).

**December**


For many, December is a highly anticipated month full of holidays, presents, the end of one year, and the start of a brand-new one. To celebrate, we're giving you a new tool to see what's ahead with an updated version of [Anticipate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Anticipate) from Volkan Baga. What? You didn't see that coming?
