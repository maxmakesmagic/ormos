A brainchild of TJ Collectibles owner Tom Shea, the second annual New England Challenge is a series of tournaments modeled on the Pro Tour, or the NG/YMG Grudge Match. A total of ten stores from across New England participate, each holding a number of qualifier tournaments. Each tournament is played in Standard format, and costs $7 to enter.


The winner of each of the qualifier events, as well as the most active player from each store are invited to compete at the New England Challenge Finals – the coverage of which you are now reading. Although there are no prizes for individual qualifiers, each of the 64 invited players get to compete for a prize pool of well over $2500 in cash, with prizes extending down to 40th place and the winner walking away with $1000.
