 Stybs has played Magic the world over, writing and drafting as part of the event coverage team and slinging Commander everywhere his decks will fit. 






 Jamie Parke is a bit of an enigma within competitive *Magic*. Returned and redoubled to the game in recent times, he found success with Top 8 appearances at both Grand Prix Richmond and Pro Tour *Journey into Nyx*, Parke was on the rise again after his hiatus. He even celebrated in a song he shared with the world.



Brandon Nelson had been on the cusp for a couple years. With plenty of heartbreak ninth-place finishes at recent events, adding a second Grand Prix Top 8 to his first from Kansas City was another notch in the best of a rising star. Surrounded by friends watching, Nelson looked the part of someone ready to win his first Grand Prix.



**The Decks**




 Nelson's deck was a thing of *Magic* 2015 drafting beauty. With [Resolute Archangel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Resolute+Archangel) to climb back from even the most precarious of life totals, [Spectra Ward](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spectra+Ward) with Heliod's Pilgrims to threaten a nigh invulnerable creature, and copies of [Triplicate Spirits](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Triplicate+Spirits) and [Sanctified Charge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sanctified+Charge) for good measure, Nelson's plan was powerful. Layering red on top of it, including cards like [Inferno Fist](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inferno+Fist) and [Stoke the Flames](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stoke+the+Flames) gave Nelson multiple ways to close out game quickly.




 Parke, too, was on a similar strategy. With copies of [Triplicate Spirits](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Triplicate+Spirits), [Sanctified Charge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sanctified+Charge), and [Stoke the Flames](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stoke+the+Flames) of his own, Parke wanted to end the game just as fast a Nelson. Instead of white creatures to lay down a base of attack, Parke leaned heavily on red creatures like [Torch Fiend](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Torch+Fiend) and Krenko's Enforce to get the average attack done.




**The Games**




 Nelson began with the one-two combo of [Soulmender](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soulmender) into Ajani's Pridemate, threatening to make a 4/4 on the attack the next turn. He did so, and began delivering the beats. Parke was undaunted, playing one of the best white spells in the format: [Triplicate Spirits](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Triplicate+Spirits). Using it to cast [Devouring Light](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Devouring+Light) on the massive Pridemate, Nelson responded in kind by calling on his own trio of flying Spirits.
