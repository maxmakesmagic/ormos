 Chris is involved in a little bit of everything the communications team does, but focuses primarily on Magic Duels and running the social media accounts associated with that. So mostly that means he has way, way, way too many internet browser windows open at once. 






Due to production issues, some *Zendikar Rising* and *Commander Legends* products will experience delays [at launch](#The%20End).


Initial allocations of *Zendikar Rising* will be arriving in two waves, with the second wave arriving in stores a week to 10 days after launch. As a result, some locations may experience limited availability until the second wave arrives. Additionally, *Zendikar Rising* Bundles in North America will be delayed and will arrive in stores as soon as possible, though they are unlikely to be available at launch.


Furthermore, production delays have also [Mulldrifter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mulldrifter) pushed back the release of [*Commander Legends* Collector Boosters](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/magic-story/episode-4-haunting-songs-and-whispered-warnings-2020-09-23), which will now release Nov. 20. Additionally, Commander decks associated with *Commander Legends* in the Asia-Pacific region will also be released on Nov. 20.


I like [Mulldrifter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mulldrifter). It is kinda like [Cloudblazer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloudblazer). It's even better as a target for [Animate Dead](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Animate+Dead). But only if they don't have [Tormod's Crypt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tormod%27s+Crypt)!


Finally we have an update on *Jumpstart*. We expect stores in North [Mulldrifter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mulldrifter) America and Europe to receive further shipments in October. If more precise dates become available, we'll share that as soon as we have them.
