### Quick Question 1: Which card in your main deck are you least sure you should be playing?

**Frank Skarren, 2-Time GP Champion:** [Borrowed Grace](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Borrowed+Grace). I thought I needed the reach, but I wind up trading creatures a lot.

**Rich Hoaen, 2-Time Team GP Champion:** The second [Mockery of Nature](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mockery+of+Nature). The first one is very good, but there may not be enough targets to justify two.

**Paul Dean, Pro Tour Battle for Zendikar Semifinalist:** [Ruthless Disposal](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ruthless+Disposal). I'm splashing for it, and I'm not sure it's as good as I think it is.

**Lucas Siow, GP Toronto 2015 Champion:** [Liliana's Elite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Liliana%27s+Elite). I'm only playing 14 creatures in my black-green control deck.

**Chris Pikula, Living Legend:** Oh that's easy, [Wailing Ghoul](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wailing+Ghoul). I'm playing it for curve considerations, but I don't think it's doing enough.

**Jamie Parke, Top 8 Pro Tour Journey Into Nyx:** [Cryptolith Fragment](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cryptolith+Fragment). I should probably be playing a second sorcery instead, to help with Delirium.
