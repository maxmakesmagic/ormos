You amazing people continue to light up [our Tumblr](http://wizardsmagic.tumblr.com/) with fantastic questions, comments, and ideas! In honor of *Magic Origins*'s upcoming release, we'd like to take this time to showcase a few of the questions that have come our way about the set and its design.



And as always, if you have a question you'd like answered by a specific designer, feel free to reach out to [Mark Rosewater](http://markrosewater.tumblr.com/), [Gavin Verhey](http://gavinverhey.tumblr.com/), [Doug Beyer](http://dougbeyermtg.tumblr.com/), and [Matt Tabak](http://tabakrules.tumblr.com/) through their blogs. You might even see your question (and the answer) show up here in the future!

====================================================================



**Q: For *Magic Origins*, are the double-faced Planeswalkers in the rare slot, or do they replace a common like in *Innistrad*?—toyybs**



A: There is no double-faced slot in a *Magic Origins* booster like there was in *Innistrad* and *Dark Ascension.* The Planeswalkers show up at the same frequency as any mythic rare.



**Q: You said that *Origins* was almost a villain-themed set. Are blocks always going to be based on planes? Or is it possible that we might see blocks where the story is strictly character-driven?—meatybacon**



A: *Magic* requires environments, so they will always take place in a location. But our characters do drive the story.

**Q: How can Kytheon's Irregulars be mono-white if its flavour text specifically mentions them working outside the law?—z00tgrunt**



A: They break the laws of the color pie itself. : )

==========================================================================



**Q: Hey Doug! So we've seen a few Planeswalkers from *Origins* spoiled now. Some of them seem a lot older on their Planeswalker side. Do the Planeswalker sides of the *Origins* walkers depict them in the future a good deal after they've ignited their spark?—frequency42**



A: Yep! The front face is the character around the time their spark was about to ignite. The back face is the character as we know them today.



**Q: Yesterday I discovered that Kytheon was named on [Desperate Stand](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Desperate+Stand) from *Journey Into Nyx.* You sneaky, sneaky Creative team.—sarpadianempiresvol-viii**



A: SNEAKY?! I don't know WHAT you're talking about, other than the fact that I totally do.

*"At the Akroan gates, hoplites revived the tactics of Kytheon Iora's infamous irregulars."*



To all those who suspiciously narrowed their eyes at us when this card came out, citing an eerie similarity to the name "Gideon Jura" and a gnawing sense that we were *up to something:* I officially applaud you AND your general paranoia. :)



By the way, for those who have asked: Kytheon Iora is pronounced "KITH-ee-un ee-OR-uh." *Kytheon* uses the same vowel sounds and first-syllable stress as *Gideon*.

[**Matt Tabak—Rules Manager**](http://tabakrules.tumblr.com/)
=============================================================



**Q: Is being put into the graveyard by the legend rule counted as dying? For example, if I play Liliana, Heretical Healer while already having a copy of her out, can I transform the one I keep when the other goes to the graveyard due to the legend rule? Or are they never on the battlefield at the same time or something?—peridotspellcard**



A: "Dies" just means "is put into a graveyard from the battlefield." It doesn't matter why it's going: destruction, 0 toughness, sacrifice, legend rule, and so on. You can exile the surviving one.



**Q: Are tokens considered to go to the graveyard, for cards like Kothophed, Soul Hoarder?—galaxy-drifter**



A: Yes. Tokens go to the graveyard, triggering any appropriate abilities before disappearing.

===========================================================



**Q: What is the ultimate answer to life the universe and everything?—cobrakmmndr**



A: A 42/42 creature. :)



**Q: Your next cosplay should be as Enthralling Victor.—Anonymous**



A: I have my own take on it that I like to call "Enthralling Verhey."
