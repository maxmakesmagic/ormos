Legacy Cube at Gen Con
----------------------


We're happy to announce that the Legacy Cube will be available on *Magic Online* beginning July 31, just in time for Gen Con. Now, if you're wondering why Gen Con is relevant to a *Magic Online* Cube announcement, it's because we've shared our Legacy Cube with Gen Con for their Mythic Convention Series Gen Con Championship!


This means that if you're lucky enough to be attending Gen Con, you can play in qualifier events over the course of the weekend (head over to the [Gen Con event finder](https://www.gencon.com/event_finder) to check out qualifier details) for your shot at the Championship. Eight skilled competitors will battle it out on [Gen Con's Twitch stream](https://www.gencon.com/experience/streaming) in a Legacy Cube Rochester Draft on Sunday, August 5, where the competitors get to keep the cards they draft. If that doesn't sound spicy enough, the winner gets a box of Legends, the third *Magic* expansion set, released in 1994.


Check out our Legacy Cube [article](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/magic-digital/magic-online-legacy-cube-returns-time-gen-con-2019-07-17) for more info on all the above as well as the updated card list [here](https://magic.wizards.com/en/MTGO/articles/archive/magic-online/legacy-cube-cardlist).

Format Championship Schedule Adjustment
---------------------------------------


In order to better support players who are interested in chasing the dream of playing in two Format Championships on the same day, we are moving the Modern and Legacy Format Championships, previously scheduled for January 4 and January 5, from 8 a.m. Pacific time to 5 a.m. Pacific time.


In the event that a player qualifies for both the Modern and Vintage Format Championships, or the Legacy and Pauper Format Championships, we reserve the right to delay the start of the second event that day to allow the double-qualified player to participate fully in both events.
