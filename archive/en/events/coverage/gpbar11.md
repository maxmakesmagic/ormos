Grand Prix Barcelona is at an end, and what a tournament it has been. 1,201 players started out on Saturday, and after 18 rounds of play, it was Spaniard Martin Scheinin who emerged victorious, over his countryman Toni Ramis Pascual in a lopsided final where Scheinin's blue/black control deck maintained a firm enough grip on things that it proved a shock that Pascual, in his first ever Grand Prix, won an extraordinary game two.


While the field was littered with variations on the Caw-Blade archetype, the top eight showed that there are plenty of ways to attack the format, with a variety of decks represented, both aggro and control. Given some of the explosive [Lotus Cobra](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lotus+Cobra) turns seen in the elimination stage of the event, one could almost call some of the decks combo decks.


As the sun goes down on the Spanish leg of the Grand Prix circuit, we look forward to Grand Prix Dallas Fort Worth, which will also be in the Standard format. We've seen a few new archetypes and variations on existing builds here in Spain, and it will be exciting to see how the metagame adapts as a result.


For now though, the fiesta will go long into the night, as we celebrate our victor for Grand Prix Barcelona 2011, Martin Scheinin.
