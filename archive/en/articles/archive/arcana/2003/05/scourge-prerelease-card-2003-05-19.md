If you attended the *Scourge* prerelease tournament on the weekend of May 17, then you should have a prerelease card in your possession. If not, here's what you missed out on:

The card is [Soul Collector](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soul+Collector), a rare black creature, and the only Vampire in the *Onslaught*  block. The card is a special kind of foil, with the focus of the art "cut out" of the foil background. The *Scourge* expansion symbol is foiled in the text box, and the date (17 May 03) is stamped on the type line in gold leaf.
