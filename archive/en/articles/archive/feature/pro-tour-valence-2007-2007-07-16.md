**PRO TOUR-VALENCIA TO RESUME SATURDAY**


Day One of Pro Tour-Valencia has been cancelled due to extreme rain and flooding at the event site.


The Pro Tour will resume Saturday morning with an 8:45 a.m. players meeting, and round one will start at 9 a.m. There will be 10 rounds on Saturday, with a cut at 21 points. The remaining players will return at 8:45 a.m. Sunday for three rounds of Swiss and a cut to the Top 8, which will be run as the normal best-of-five matches.


The site is scheduled to re-open at 6 p.m. Friday for pick-up drafts and the Friday Night Magic event from the existing side events schedule. Late registration for the Pro Tour will also take place from 6-9 p.m. Friday, as well as Saturday morning from 7:45-8:30 prior to the players meeting.


The side events schedule for Saturday and Sunday will run as normal. There may be some adjustments of prizes; check the side events schedule for updates.


Wizards of the Coast thanks all the players and staff for their patience and cooperation.
