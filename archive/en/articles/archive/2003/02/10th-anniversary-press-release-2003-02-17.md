### TRADING CARD GAME THAT STARTED IT ALL MARKS 10TH ANNIVERSARY


### With seven million players and billions of cards sold, *Magic: The Gathering®* game continues to be the most widely played trading card game


**February 14, 2003 (Renton, Wash.)** – Wizards of the Coast, Inc., a subsidiary of Hasbro, Inc. (NYSE: HAS), today announced plans to celebrate the 10th anniversary of its premier trading card game (TCG), *Magic: The Gathering*®. The *Magic: The Gathering* game first came onto the scene in 1993 and brought with it a whole new genre of play – trading card games. Today, the *Magic*® TCG continues to be the gold standard of trading card games and, in fact, is the basis for Wizards of the Coast’s exclusive patent on the play mechanic of trading card games (TCGs).


Coinciding with *Magic: The Gathering TCG’s* 10th anniversary, Wizards of the Coast will release a new *Magic: The Gathering* core card set featuring some of the greatest *Magic* cards of all time. Wizards will also release a “starter” version of the new core card set for those who are new to *Magic* and want to get in on the fun. The starter game will include both physical Magic cards and a *Magic Online*™ CD-ROM complete with a tutorial for new players, giving players the option to play tabletop or online – or on both platforms.


The new *Magic: The Gathering* TCG will hit stores in July 2003 and be available for a suggested retail price of $14.99 (USD). Booster packs of 15 cards will be available for $3.29 (SRP) and theme decks for intermediate-level play will be offered at $7.99 (SRP).


Celebrating *Magic’s* 10th anniversary, Wizards of the Coast also will host a fan celebration at this summer’s GenCon, the largest game fair. In addition, following GenCon and the release of the new *Magic: The Gathering* core set, players will be able to participate in the largest global *Magic* event ever – with tournaments held simultaneously via a worldwide network of more than 2,000 official tournament organizers.


*“Magic* represents one of the best game franchises ever created, constantly evolving and always offering something new to challenge and entertain players,” commented Joe Hauck, vice president of Wizards-owned trading card games. “It’s very gratifying to see the *Magic* community growing, with players at every level experiencing *Magic* – both tabletop and online. The *Magic: The Gathering* core set we’re releasing this summer will offer a new dimension of strategy for current players and is a great way for new players to get into Magic. Plus, we have some exciting events planned for players and our retailers to mark the 10th anniversary milestone.”


Created by award-winning game designer Richard Garfield and published by Wizards of the Coast, the *Magic: The Gathering* trading card game made its debut in August 1993. Available in nine languages, the *Magic* game is sold in more than 52 countries worldwide, with more than seven million *Magic* players worldwide. Wizards of the Coast has created more than 6,000 distinct *Magic* cards since 1993. Today there are several billion *Magic* cards in circulation.


Combining the dynamics of a card game with the excitement of trading and collecting, the Magic TCG offers fun for every level of player. *Magic* players try to reduce their opponent’s score from 20 to 0, casting from their deck creatures, spells, artifacts and other cards of varying power-levels and abilities in a series of attack and defense moves. Featuring some of the game world’s most revered fantasy art, *Magic* cards can also be highly collectible, offering another dimension for fans of this popular trading card game.


While most play the *Magic* TCG casually, *Magic* players have the opportunity to aspire to the *Magic: The Gathering Pro Tour,* which awards more than $3,000,000 to players each season. In addition, the $350,000 *Magic: The Gathering* Junior Super Series tournaments offer scholarships for players under the age of 16. There are more than 100,000 sanctioned *Magic: The Gathering* tournaments held every year. And, with *Magic Online,* the online version of the TCG, launched in 2002, players can now meet and compete at any hour of the day, with opponents next door or across the world, via the Internet.


Wizards of the Coast, Inc., a subsidiary of Hasbro, Inc. (NYSE: HAS), is the worldwide market share leader in the trading card game and tabletop roleplaying game categories. A leading developer and publisher of game-based entertainment products, the company holds an exclusive patent on the play mechanic of trading card games.
