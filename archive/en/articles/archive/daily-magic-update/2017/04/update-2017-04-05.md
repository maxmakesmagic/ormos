The Daily *Magic* Update is a roundup of everything *Magic* you should know on April 5, 2017. Today's Update is brought to you by [Gideon. Gideon forever. Gideon always.](#9)


Today's Previews
================


Every day for the next two weeks, I'll be sharing all the non-DailyMTG previews you can find around the web in this space. Here are today's:


1. [Watchers of the Dead](http://puremtgo.com/articles/amonkhet-preview-card-watchers-dead) | PureMTGO | Terran Qualls

A cool video *and* an article. It's like two previews in one. Except it's one preview. But it's a saucy one—some of the graveyard hate people were looking for. It doesn't completely nuke graveyards, but mostly does. Does that make it a hate bear, or, like, a strongly dislike bear? A not-really-my-cup-of-tea bear? A "you may like it, but it's just not my style" bear?


1. [Noah Bradley](https://noahbradley.com/dusktodawn/)

Yes, we're aware the card Noah is previewing leaked early. But this video was a year in the making and is just too fantastic to hold back. It's unfortunate the card leaked early, but you'd be doing yourself a disservice if you don't watch this art progression video anyway. Especially great for the art-loving crowd, this shows Bradley's process in creating the powerful Dawn to Dusk card from *Amonkhet*.

Hey, have you heard that Trick Jarrett likes [Kiki-Jiki, Mirror Breaker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kiki-Jiki%2C+Mirror+Breaker)? True story. As such, there was only one card we could have possibly given him to preview.


1. [@Wizards\_Magic](https://twitter.com/wizards_magic) and [@MelissaDeTora](https://twitter.com/MelissaDeTora) | Coming Soon

We've got something funky coming your way later today. Like, weird and cool and odd and kooky and bizarre and peculiar and other adjectives found through thesaurus.com. That's from [@Wizards\_Magic](https://twitter.com/wizards_magic). From [@MelissaDeTora](https://twitter.com/MelissaDeTora) we'll have something a little bit more grounded, but still welcome in the format.


After Those, Read, Watch, or Listen to These
============================================


1. [Temmet EDH Spotlight](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmhILl6orJw) | Commander Society

How's that for being on the ball? The Commander Society has already created a video for a new legendary creature in Temmet, Vizier of Naktamun. It's a short video, but it's packed in a ton of different ways to build a Temmet deck in 99 cards.


Also worth noting, the channel is relatively new, having started just a week ago. They already have five short, easy-to-digest videos on a few cool Commander options, also including Hazoret the Fervent!

1. [*Amonkhet* Spoilers: Limited Review for April 4](https://www.mtggoldfish.com/articles/amonkhet-spoilers-limited-review-for-april-4?src=wizards) | MTGGoldfish | Jake Stiles

Stiles is watching *Amonkhet* through the lens of Limited, grading the newly previewed cards from yesterday and taking in what the Limited format will look like. It appears as if he'll be doing one of these reviews each day, so certainly stay tuned for more and follow along the progression of the Limited format.


1. [Landing in *Amonkhet*](https://www.channelfireball.com/articles/landing-in-amonkhet/) | ChannelFireball | Neal Oliver

Oliver is excited for what *Amonkhet* has revealed so far. He reveals why in this very article. Yes, this very one!


Top 25
======


1. The Peach Garden Oath Rises

They may not have won the whole thing, but a 2nd-place finish by the trio of Owen Turtenwald, Reid Duke, and William Jensen was a pretty strong statement—especially since, for many, they finished one place below expectations.


But they did get a solid bump up in the ratings, with Turtenwald leapfrogging Shota Yasooka to grab the No. 2 spot and Duke moving back into the Top 5 at No. 4.


Others benefit from last weekend as well. Oliver Tiu, Mike Sigrist, and Brian Braun-Duin all jumped up two spots, while Ondřej Stráský and Joel Larsson received nice one-spot bumps.

Today, we previewed [Gideon of the Trials](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/magic-story/trust-2017-04-05) and, as people have pointed out, that is a lot of Gideons that will be in Standard (three, to be exact). As others have pointed out, this is, in fact, an artifact of *Amonkhet* being initially designed and developed with the twice-yearly rotation in mind.

Oliver Tiu, the former rookie of the year, won Vintage Super League last night through a field full of Hall of Fame pros and Vintage ringers. I think he might have a future in this game.

Now that Vintage Super League is over, it's time to get hyped for Team Draft Super League! Where teams, ya know, draft! If you liked Vintage Super League but didn't know what was going on, this is the Super League for you!
