The 2009 **Magic** season started with a bang at [Pro Tour–Kyoto](/en/events/coverage/nassif-greater-power), and now it's time to see how the dust is settling. The new split-format Pro Tour showcased the best players in Standard and Booster Draft. Is Faeries still public enemy No. 1 in Standard, or did the influx of anti-Fae cards from *Conflux* tip the scales? Paul Jordan crunched the numbers for all the major deck archetypes. If you're looking for the hard numbers on what beat what, you won't want to miss it.
