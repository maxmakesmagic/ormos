Jacob Van Lunen began playing Magic in 1995. He has participated in organized play at every level of competition and was a member of the winning team at Pro Tour San Diego in 2007, thanks to an innovative draft strategy. As a writer, Van Lunen has had more than three hundred Magic strategy pieces published 





Juan Carlos Botis is a psychologist competing in his first Grand Prix Top 8. Botis, a local to Taluca that comes up to Mexico City to play *Magic* on weekends, was on the ropes in the final round of swiss. He was dead on board in the third game against Pascal Maynard. Maynard wound up for a lethal attack, but thought better of it and decided to concede, thus putting both players in the Top 8.  


Chapman Sim is constantly traveling for *Magic*. A native of Singapore, Sim works as a coverage writer for events in Asia and is regularly qualified for the Pro Tour. Sim made the trip to Mexico with his MTGMINTCARD teammates and will be in attendance at the Pro Tour next weekend. This is Sim’s third Grand Prix Top 8.


Botis completely ran over Sim in the first game. There was virtually no chance of recovery as an army of evasive creatures backed up by strong removal spells sealed the deal.

The second game was more interesting. Sim and Botis traded blows in the early turns. Sim was attacking on the ground with Morphs and [Highland Game](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Highland+Game) while Botis took to the skies with [Lotus Path Djinn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lotus+Path+Djinn) and [Shockmaw Dragon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shockmaw+Dragon). The game was tight race.


Botis found an opening and went for a very big play. [Goblin Heelcutter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Heelcutter) dashed onto the battlefield alongside [Flamerush Rider](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flamerush+Rider) and all three of Botis’s creatures turned sideways. [Flamerush Rider](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flamerush+Rider)’s trigger attempted to target [Shockmaw Dragon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shockmaw+Dragon), but Sim had [Sandblast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sandblast) with the trigger on the stack. Botis was forced to return both of his creatures back to his hand with Sim at eight life.


Sim attacked back to put Botis at one life.


Botis was faced with a tough decision. He could dash both of his creatures into play and attempt to steal the game or cast a creature and have the ability to block. Sim had a few cards in hand and tons of mana open so he chose to go with the latter line of play. As it turned out, he would’ve won had he dashed his creatures, but Sim used [Hunt the Weak](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hunt+the+Weak) and [Sultai Flayer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sultai+Flayer) to clear the way for a lethal attack on the following turn.


The third game was a strange one. Sim had [Kin-Tree Warden](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kin-Tree+Warden) attacking and used an aggressive [Dragonscale Boon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragonscale+Boon) to get in for more damage.


Botis’s side of the table was much more impressive.


Botis set himself up to attack for lethal with a dashing [Goblin Heelcutter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Heelcutter), but Sim had other plans. Sim’s second [Dragonscale Boon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragonscale+Boon) untapped [Kin-Tree Warden](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kin-Tree+Warden) and gobbled up the Heelcutter, giving Sim enough power on the table to steal the game.
