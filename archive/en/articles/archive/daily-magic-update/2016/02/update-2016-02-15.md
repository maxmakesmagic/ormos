The February 15, 2016 Update

The Daily *Magic* Update is a roundup of everything *Magic* you should know on February 15, 2016. Today's Update is brought to you by all of the questions I cannot answer about *Eternal Masters*.


What People Are Talking About
=============================

> KA-BOOM, Eternal Masters is a thing for June. [#MTGEMA](https://twitter.com/hashtag/MTGEMA?src=hash) <https://t.co/mFhRxU2xmb>

KA-BOOM indeed. Couldn't have onomatopoeia'd it any better myself.


Yes, we did [announce this very thing this very morning](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/news/announcing-eternal-masters-2016-02-15). Oft-whispered (or typed) about, *Eternal Masters* is a real thing happening this year. The Draft format is a blast, much like *Modern Masters*, and, of course, we'll be reprinting some sweet cards in there to spice up your cube or—if you're into these things—*Commander* and *Legacy* decks. There are even some *Vintage*-worthy cards.


If you want to discuss *Eternal Masters* (you know you do), you can use the hashtag [#MTGEMA](https://twitter.com/hashtag/MTGEMA) or jump on the [Reddit thread here](https://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/45x3u8/ema_eternal_masters/).

As if *Eternal Masters* wasn't enough to wrap your collective heads around this morning, we've also [released the full deck lists](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/feature/duel-decks-blessed-vs-cursed-2016-02-15) and new cards for *Duel Decks: Blessed vs. Cursed*. Yes, *new* cards, straight out of Innistrad.


What You Might Have Missed This Weekend

It was Valentine's Day on Sunday, and if you don't need reminding of that, well, then Twitter wouldn't have been a very fun place for you this weekend as *Magic* players took to the hashtag [#mtgvalentines](https://twitter.com/hashtag/mtgvalentines). If you're feeling nostalgic for, well, yesterday and are saddened by all of the chocolate and red hearts listed at 50% off now, take a stroll down that hashtag. It'll brighten your day. I mean, if *Eternal Masters* didn't already do that.


1. [MtA VIDEO—Episode 159: Pro Tour *OGW*](http://www.magictheamateuring.com/mta-video-episode-159-pro-tour-ogw/) | Magic the Amateuring | Meghan Wolff and Maria Bartholdi

Maria goes behind the scenes at the Pro Tour to show you all of the, um, behind the scenes stuff! It's really quite self-explanatory.


1. [TTC 116—Highlander Tournament Report](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oy84mTXK0DA&feature=youtu.be&a) | TapTapConcede | LoadingReadyRun

TapTapConcede is here to talk aboot highlander—Canadian Highlander, that is. The LoadingReadyRun crew is pretty into the most Canadian of *Magic* formats, so you'll hear them talk aboot it from time to time. And this is one of those times!


If you're looking for a more introductory video on the format from this crew, [check here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLDTH3B0WaQ). If you're looking for more information on *Eternal Masters*—nice try. Not today. Not today, random internet writing device.

After Those, Read, Watch, or Listen to These
============================================


1. [Takin' Turns](http://magic.tcgplayer.com/db/article.asp?ID=13120&writer=Melissa+DeTora&articledate=2-15-2016) | TCGPlayer | Melissa DeTora

Takin' Turns is a fun Modern deck that gets played now and then, but Melissa takes on the challenge of porting it to Standard. Can you take all the turns in Standard? And if you can, what will you do with them? And will *Eternal Masters* contain powerful cards at Uncommon? Melissa answers two of these questions in today's article!


1. [Affinity for Numbers: Pro Tour Eldrazi](http://www.gatheringmagic.com/nickvigabool-021616-affinity-for-numbers-pro-tour-eldrazi/) | Gathering Magic | Nick Vigabool

There are a lot more numbers to the Pro Tour than just Top 8, or the two mana Eldrazi lands produce, and Nick Vigabool has, well, not all of them. But a bunch. All of them would be asking quite a bit.


1. [Mardu in Modern](http://www.channelfireball.com/articles/mardu-in-modern/) | ChannelFireball | Paul Rietzl

Mardu was the new kid on the block that was overshadowed by the cooler, newer kid whose parents have a pool (I think Daddy Eldrazi has old money), but does that stop Paul Rietzl from recommending the new creation he and a few friends played at the Pro Tour? I don't know. Read on if you want the answer. I'm not here to give that kind of information away.

Speaking of new brews for Modern, get some idea juices flowing with this gem from Hall of Fame pro Gabriel Nassif, which is full of full- and half-cooked ideas for Modern.


Deck of the Day
===============


1. [MOCS Rally](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/mtgo-standings/standard-mocs-2016-02-14)

A [*Magic Online* Championship Series](http://magic.wizards.com/en/content/2016-magic-online-championship-series) Playoff Event took place this weekend, earning two players invites to the *Magic Online* Championship. One of those players is TWOP, who earned first place by playing—well, it's [Rally the Ancestors](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rally+the+Ancestors). Yup, the same [Rally the Ancestors](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rally+the+Ancestors) that's been all over Standard for months.


Don't know how the deck works? Well, it's pretty...complex, actually. The deck plays a bunch of value creatures that either do something while dying, while entering the battlefield, or while sacrificing other creatures, then it brings them all back for one big re-hurrah with [Rally the Ancestors](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rally+the+Ancestors). Or sometimes it just runs people over with a bunch of little dorks. That happens to. [Collected Company](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Collected+Company) helps. And it does so with a mana base only a mother could love.


The deck is undeniably powerful, and just as undeniably earned its pilot a spot in the *Magic Online* Championship. Congrats to TWOP!


Oh, and for those of you clamoring for coverage of the event? Tune into DailyMTG on Thursday for a bit of retroactive coverage of one of the hardest tournaments around.
