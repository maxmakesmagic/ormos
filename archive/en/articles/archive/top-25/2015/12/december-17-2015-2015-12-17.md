This has been a week of two halves at the home of the *Magic* Top 25 Pro Rankings. For a dozen of the players on the list, the past weekend was a chance to look toward the holiday season and reflect on 2015—and what *Magic* may have in store for them in 2016. For the lucky thirteen, this was another weekend of high-level competition, with the World *Magic* Cup putting an epic punctuation mark on the end of the calendar year. As a result, we've seen one of the most fluid shifts in the table of the season so far, with eight going up, twelve going down, and four staying still, leaving just enough room to squeeze in one new entry.


Three of the four non-movers head the table. The year will end with Owen Turtenwald on top of the pile, with a miniscule lead over World Champion Seth Manfield and a hefty gap between himself and Paul Rietzl at No. 3—a gap that seems unlikely to be bridged any time before the next Pro Tour in February.


As Brazil's national Captain, Paulo Vitor Damo da Rosa led them comfortably into pool play on Day Two, but couldn't advance them to the elimination rounds. Indeed, it's no surprise that our biggest mover *was* part of a team that saw Sunday play in Barcelona. Martin Müller capped off a brilliant year for Denmark, and for himself personally. Although the Danes were upset by eventual finalists Thailand in the quarterfinals, Müller still leaps a mighty ten places up from No. 17 to finish the year at No. 7. Two-time World Champion Shahar Shenhar and England's Fabrizio Anteri were the next to benefit from their Barcelona escapades, both climbing six spots. That puts Shenhar at No. 13 while Anteri closes out 2015 at a well-deserved No. 18. Other gains were made by Alexander Hayne, Yuuya Watanabe, and Ondřej Stráský (each up one place).


But, in a week when it was seemingly all about Denmark yet again, it's no surprise to see our new entry in the chart be Team Captain Martin Dang. The 2015 Pro Tour winner continued his remarkable run of form, and Team EUreka seems certain to be at the forefront of many of the major events next year.


From everyone at the home of the *Magic* Top 25 Pro Rankings, Happy Holidays, and we'll see you all next year.
