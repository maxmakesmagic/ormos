As [we've seen before](/en/articles/archive/swaps-faultless-2006-03-14), the act of creating a **Magic** card is a dynamic and protean process that touches design, development, and creative teams in equal parts. To take a *Dissension* example, graveyard hoser **[Loaming Shaman](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Loaming+Shaman)** started out with this text:


> [Graveyard Guy]  
>  Creature  
>  At the beginning of your upkeep, you may shuffle any number of target creature cards in a single graveyard into their owner's library.  
>  1/1 
> 
> 
> 

First to change was the creature's ability. Instead of every upkeep, it was changed to trigger once when it came into play, but was allowed to target non-creature cards. 


> [Graveyard Guy]  
>  Creature  
>  When CARDNAME comes into play, target player shuffles any number of target cards from his or her graveyard into his or her library.  
>  1/1 
> 
> 
> 

Meanwhile, the critter got a flavor facelift, giving him the concept of a recycling-minded nature shaman whose compost heap is full of the bones of the dead.


> [Composting Shaman]  
>  Creature - Human Shaman  
>  When CARDNAME comes into play, target player shuffles any number of target cards from his or her graveyard into his or her library.  
>  1/1 
> 
> 
> 

In line with this concept, artist Carl Critchlow sent in this sketch:

The next thing to change was the critter's power and toughness. It became 3/2 in order to give it some beef after it had performed its graveyard-hosing duties:


> [Composting Shaman]  
>  Creature - Human Shaman  
>  When CARDNAME comes into play, target player shuffles any number of target cards from his or her graveyard into his or her library.  
>  3/2 
> 
> 
> 

Suddenly, the flavor was off. This guy was too big to be represented by a single Human creature, especially a Shaman. The creative team suggested a switch to the Centaur creature type, and Carl Critchlow submitted this second sketch:

It's tough to see in that sketch, but our recycling shaman does have the centaur back-end. When the final art was in, the card was done:
