The *Battle for Zendikar* rages on. How well do you know the Allies fighting to repel the Eldrazi? Give our Ally quiz a spin and see if you know enough to band the disparate peoples of Zendikar together! (Note that we are only talking about the Allies found in *BFZ*.) As always, answers are after the beautiful art of [Gideon, Ally Generating Machine](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gideon%2C+Ally+of+Zendikar).


1. What are the names of the two Angels who are Allies?
2. Which is the only vanilla (meaning creature with no abilities) Ally?
3. Who is the Ally that eats stones and claims to have eaten Tuktuk the Explorer?
4. Which Ally killed a massive Eldrazi by eating its heart?
5. Which Ally was once a lullmage but now works to rouse the land's fury?
6. Three creature types of Allies are able to fly. One of them is Angel, as mentioned in the first question. Name the other two.
