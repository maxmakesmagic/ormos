This was Fabrizio Anteri's third run at winning a Grand Prix. In his first Top 8, at last year's Grand Prix London, he ended up in third place, in his second Top 8, later in the year in Antwerp, he made it all the way to the finals, so now it was time for a win, right? Definitely not agreeing with such frivolous superstition was Javier Dominguez who had won a Grand Prix in his first Top 8 in Paris three months ago and was now looking to claim a second trophy.


Anteri had drafted a blue-green deck with a tiny splash of white, whereas Dominguez was on Blue-White Heroic. White heroic decks had been the bane of Limited Grand Prix for the past months, but so far at this event, it appeared as if green was ready to take over. Would it do so now?


**Game 1**


Though Anteri missed a land drop, [Font of Fertility](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Font+of+Fertility) and [Sylvan Caryatid](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sylvan+Caryatid) meant he still was able to cast [Snake of the Golden Grove](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snake+of+the+Golden+Grove) on turn four. Meanwhile, Dominguez combined [Deepwater Hypnotist](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deepwater+Hypnotist) with [Mortal Obstinacy](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mortal+Obstinacy)—a lot of effort to create a power-3 attacker, though it managed to kill the 2/4 [Snake of the Golden Grove](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snake+of+the+Golden+Grove) with the help of [Battlewise Valor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Battlewise+Valor). And Dominguez added yet more pressure in [Supply-Line Cranes](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Supply-Line+Cranes) and [Akroan Skyguard](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Akroan+Skyguard) enchanted with another [Fate Foretold](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fate+Foretold).

However, Anteri cast [Nessian Game Warden](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nessian+Game+Warden) and [Aerie Worshippers](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aerie+Worshippers), and equipped the latter with [Siren Song Lyre](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Siren+Song+Lyre) to create a deadly combination of tapper/token producer which threatened to take over the game. Then, however, he tried to do one better and bestowed [Hopeful Eidolon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hopeful+Eidolon) upon his [Nessian Game Warden](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nessian+Game+Warden). Dominguez had [Kiora's Dismissal](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kiora%27s+Dismissal). Anteri tried again on the next turn, and this time Dominguez had [Voyage's End](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Voyage%27s+End) for [Nessian Game Warden](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nessian+Game+Warden).


 


In the meantime, Anteri had fallen so low on life that he wasn't able to recast his 4/5, instead needing to spend his mana on [Siren Song Lyre](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Siren+Song+Lyre). And that would have been well enough, if it had not been for Dominguez's [Oppressive Rays](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oppressive+Rays). Anteri was forced to move [Siren Song Lyre](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Siren+Song+Lyre) to [Hopeful Eidolon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hopeful+Eidolon) and found a new combo with [Kiora's Follower](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kiora%27s+Follower).


Dominguez's own [Hopeful Eidolon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hopeful+Eidolon), however, turned [Deepwater Hypnotist](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deepwater+Hypnotist) into a serious threat again. So now Dominguez had three creatures Anteri needed to deal with, but he could only tap two with [Siren Song Lyre](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Siren+Song+Lyre) plus [Kiora's Follower](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kiora%27s+Follower). He went down to 1 life.


Actually, though, with all his mana, Anteri could also do something else. Like, for example cast a hugely massive [Mistcutter Hydra](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mistcutter+Hydra) to attack for lethal damage. And that is exactly what he did now.


**Fabrizio Anteri 1-0 Javier Dominguez**


"That was a close one," said Dominguez, and Anteri agreed: "Phew. Yeah, it was."


**Game 2**


It had also been a long game, though the second would make up for it. To make it short: After a mulligan, Dominguez had a total of nine lands among his first 12 cards and his three spells were [Crystalline Nautilus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crystalline+Nautilus) (which died to [Sylvan Caryatid](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sylvan+Caryatid) wielding [Siren Song Lyre](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Siren+Song+Lyre)), [Akroan Mastiff](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Akroan+Mastiff) (which was subsequently always tapped via [Siren Song Lyre](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Siren+Song+Lyre)), and [Oppressive Rays](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oppressive+Rays) (which didn't do a lot since both players had rather more than enough lands).

In the end, it was again [Mistcutter Hydra](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mistcutter+Hydra) that finished the game, though that was largely academic.
