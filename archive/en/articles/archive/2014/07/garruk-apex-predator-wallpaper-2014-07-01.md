In today's [Uncharted Realms](/node/230291) James Wyatt takes a look at the toll [Liliana Vess](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Liliana+Vess) has to pay to wear the Chain Veil. But Liliana isn't the only one paying the price for the powerful artifactâ€”[Garruk Wildspeaker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Garruk+Wildspeaker) has been transformed into Garruk, Apex Hunter, and his new form is truly terrifying. If, for some reason, you want that horrifying visage staring back at you from your screen, we've got a wallpaper displaying Garruk's newest incarnation just for you.
