Each guildmage embodies the core values of its guild, and the [Izzet](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=magic/guildpact/izzet) representative is no exception -- in this case, creativity, passion, brilliance, and just a touch of mania. Part of the art description for *Guildpact's* 
 **Izzet Guildmage** ([previewed today](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/daily/mr211) by Mark Rosewater) summarizes the wizard as looking "smart and a little crazy," which Jim Murray nailed in the art.

The *mechanics* of the [card](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=magic/images/mtgcom/fcpics/making/mr211_czwsbv4s2spnv4vw.jpg), of course, leave you thinking, "What two-mana instants and sorceries can I copy with this?" You may already be familiar with the usual *instant* suspects at converted mana cost two and under, due to [Isochron Scepter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Isochron+Scepter), but you might want to take a stroll through Gatherer for another look at the sorceries...


[Gatherer: All sorceries in Standard, sorted by mana cost](http://gatherer.wizards.com/?first=1&last=100&term=&Field_Name=on&Field_Rules=on&Field_Type=on&setfilter=Standard&colorfilter=All&typefilter=sorcery&output=summary&sort=cost&x=34&y=24)


[Gatherer: All sorceries in **Magic**, sorted by mana cost](http://gatherer.wizards.com/?first=1&last=100&term=&Field_Name=on&Field_Rules=on&Field_Type=on&setfilter=Allsets&colorfilter=All&typefilter=sorcery&output=summary&sort=cost&x=61&y=30)


Of course, at this writing, Gatherer doesn't show off the goods from *Guildpact*. Stay tuned until after the [prerelease](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/prerelease/guildpact) for that.


Are there other examples of "smart and a little crazy" in Izzet art? Do you think we'd put that question there if the answer weren't "oh heck yes"?
