*What's your favorite art in Innistrad?*

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/mtgcom/authorpics/authorpic_kellydigges.jpg)**Kelly Digges:** Artwise, *Innistrad* is quite possibly my favorite set of all time. It has some of the [creepiest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=creepiest), [coolest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=coolest), and [most beautiful](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=most+beautiful) art ever to grace **Magic** cards.

Nonetheless (and with a regretful nod to the flawlessly understated horror of [Village Cannibals](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Village+Cannibals)), this is an easy choice. My favorite art in *Innistrad*, Top Ten all-time favorite **Magic** illustration, and [current desktop background](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/magazine/article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/arcana/795) is Endless Ranks of the Dead, prominently featured in Jenna Helland's [feature article](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/feature/164) this week.

You can practically hear the shuffling moans and the frantic tolling from the belltower as clammy fingers slide down stained glass. It's got beauty and horror in equal measure, and it perfectly encapsulates Innistrad's status as a world of piety and order under siege by the forces of darkness.
