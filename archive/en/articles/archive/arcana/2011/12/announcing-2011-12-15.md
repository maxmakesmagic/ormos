**Magic**'s May 2012 set, code-named "Roll," is called *Avacyn Restored*. Although it's the third set of the *Innistrad* block, it will be a large set. This means that *Innistrad* Block Constructed will be composed of all three sets, but *Avacyn Restored* will be drafted by itself. Sealed events will use six *Avacyn Restored* booster packs.
