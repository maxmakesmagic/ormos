Rich Hagon and Brian David-Marshall recap the major developments from [Pro Tour *Khans of Tarkir*](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/ptktk), starting with the shake-up to the Standard format. With *Return to Ravnica* block rotating out, the pros showed off a variety of new deck strategies, from aggro to control to combo. Rich and BDM also explore drafting *Khans of Tarkir* and how it pays to stay open on your colors. They conclude by honoring Makihito Mihara, Paul Rietzl, and Guillaume Wafo-Tapa, the newest inductees to the [*Magic* Pro Tour Hall of Fame](http://magic.wizards.com/en/content/hall-fame-top-players-coverage-events).
