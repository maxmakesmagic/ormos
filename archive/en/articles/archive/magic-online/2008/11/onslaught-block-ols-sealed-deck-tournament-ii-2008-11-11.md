Playing on another person's account, selling your account, etc. are all violations of the Terms of Service.

The only exception is an adult may authorize a single dependent child age 13-18 to play on an account that adult has purchased.


All players that have qualified for the *Onslaught* Block Sealed Deck Tournament II will be registered into the championship after the downtime on Wednesday November 17. It will be the player's responsibility to make sure that they have been properly entered into this event and are able to join it PRIOR to the start of the Tournament. If a player is qualified and is unable to join the tournament, they will need to contact customer service to get this corrected.
