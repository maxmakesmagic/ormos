**Name:** Joe Lossett


**Age:** 39


**Occupation:** Streamer: twitch.tv/oarsman79


**Hometown:** Redlands, California


**Previous *Magic* Accomplishments:** 2 Grand Prix Top 8s, 5 StarCityGames Open wins


**What deck did you play this weekend and why?**  

I took Blue-White Stoneforge and made it legendary. The legends were my favorite cards from Miracles, they just needed a new home.


**What was the best card in your deck and why?**  
[Snapcaster Mage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snapcaster+Mage) just ties everything together, especially when it's uncounterable.


**What, if anything, was the most surprising deck you played against this weekend?**  

I got crushed by [Aluren](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aluren) today. It feels like whatever deck I play ends up bad against them. Fortunately it's super fringe.


**What does this Top 8 mean to you?**  

It feels good to show I can win in Legacy without Miracles. I never doubted, but it's nice to show it.

**Name:** Alex Jay Chen


**Age:** 21


**Occupation:** Student


**Hometown:** Philadelphia, Pennsylvania


**Previous *Magic* Accomplishments:** 56th place at the StarCityGames Season 1 Invitational this year; 3 lifetime Pro Points.


**What deck did you play this weekend and why?**  

Temur Delver, had to remind people that the goose is indeed loose.


**What was the best card in your deck and why?**  
[Nimble Mongoose](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nimble+Mongoose) because it cannot be the target of spells or abilities. Also [Divert](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Divert), because Edward Sockol told me to play it for the spice.


**What, if anything, was the most surprising deck you played against this weekend?**  

Expected a lot of [Death's Shadow](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Death%27s+Shadow), end up facing it only once, as my win and in no less.


**What does this Top 8 mean to you?**  

Validation for years of hard work, this means the world to me. Also makes my lifetime GP Top 8 count equal to my friend Ethan Gaieski. Love you man, we did it.

**What deck did you play this weekend and why?**

**What was the best card in your deck and why?**  
[Back to Basics](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Back+to+Basics). One sided [Armageddon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Armageddon) is “balanced” and “fair”.


**What, if anything, was the most surprising deck you played against this weekend?**  

Elves. Has he read [Terminus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Terminus)?

A hard-fought Pro Tour invite, and locking up Bronze for the first cycle.

**What deck did you play this weekend and why?**  

Blue-Black [Death's Shadow](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Death%27s+Shadow). Felt like the most consistent Delver deck.


**What was the best card in your deck and why?**  
[Thoughtseize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtseize)? With the ban of [Deathrite Shaman](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deathrite+Shaman), proactive turn one plays are key.


**What, if anything, was the most surprising deck you played against this weekend?**  

Maybe [Aluren](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aluren)? Never too surprised to see different decks in Legacy.

Moar points!! And a chance to get that elusive trophy.
