Jacob Van Lunen began playing Magic in 1995. He has participated in organized play at every level of competition and was a member of the winning team at Pro Tour San Diego in 2007, thanks to an innovative draft strategy. As a writer, Van Lunen has had more than three hundred Magic strategy pieces published 







Two weeks ago I promised a column on [Heartless Summoning](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Heartless+Summoning), but I'm not confident enough in my [Heartless Summoning](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Heartless+Summoning) list to share it with you in good faith. And last week I was out due to technical difficulties. Make sure to tune in next week for a column on [Heartless Summoning](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Heartless+Summoning). I should have that deck in a good place by then. (I promise it's worth the wait!)


In the meantime...


[Worlds](/en/events/coverage/japan-stands-tall-worlds-again) has given us a jolt of new Modern tech, and the next Constructed PTQ season will consist of Modern events. It's safe to say that Modern is on the minds of aspiring deck builders around the world. There are a lot of Modern interactions that haven't been fully explored yet. Today, I'd like to dissect an overlooked rare that I've been trying to break for at least a few years.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/boab/boab170_erayo.jpg)[Erayo, Soratami Ascendant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Erayo%2C+Soratami+Ascendant) | Art by [Matt Cavotta](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&artist=+%5B%22Matt+Cavotta%22%5D)


[Erayo, Soratami Ascendant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Erayo%2C+Soratami+Ascendant) has always had a lot of potential. Many players chose to include the blue legend in their Affinity decks at Pro Tour Los Angeles about a half decade ago. Things seem like they've gotten a lot better for [Erayo](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Erayo) in the new Modern format. The likelihood that your opponent will combo you on the first few turns of the game has greatly decreased. This makes a relatively consistent [Erayo](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Erayo) engine into something that can really break the format wide open.



![Erayo, Soratami Ascendant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Erayo%2C+Soratami+Ascendant)

 

Your opponent will be in a pretty rough spot when you flip [Erayo](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Erayo), but you can lock the game up entirely with an [Arcane Laboratory](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arcane+Laboratory)–type effect. [Ethersworn Canonist](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ethersworn+Canonist) seems like the best option in Modern.



![Ethersworn Canonist](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Ethersworn+Canonist)

 

Here's the goal. Flip an [Erayo, Soratami Ascendant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Erayo%2C+Soratami+Ascendant) and have an [Ethersworn Canonist](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ethersworn+Canonist) on the battlefield. This will lock almost all opponents out of the game. Players will only be able to play one nonartifact spell per turn and their first spell of each turn will be countered. Opponents will be in a hard lock unless they're packing an extremely high density of artifacts.

Having a flipped [Erayo](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Erayo) feels really good, but how do we expect to flip it with any amount of consistency? New cards like [Gitaxian Probe](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gitaxian+Probe) and [Noxious Revival](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Noxious+Revival) make flipping an [Erayo](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Erayo) a lot easier than it used to be. [Ponder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ponder) and [Preordain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Preordain) seem like they would have been awesome here, but, ironically, those cards being eliminated make this deck significantly more feasible.


There's a huge world of possibilities for deck builders that are looking to work on an [Erayo, Soratami Ascendant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Erayo%2C+Soratami+Ascendant) deck. I intend on building a version of the deck that sets up a hard lock with [Erayo](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Erayo) and [Ethersworn Canonist](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ethersworn+Canonist) after a timely casting of [Congregation at Dawn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Congregation+at+Dawn). Unfortunately, the Bant version of the deck will have very difficult mana and I can't make the deck passable as budget, even when I cut the maximum number of corners.


Side note: If you do want to try building the Bant version of the deck, then you should try some of the following Congregation piles. [Bloodbraid](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodbraid+Elf)-[Erayo, Soratami Ascendant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Erayo%2C+Soratami+Ascendant)- [Ethersworn Canonist](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ethersworn+Canonist) is going to be the most common pile. Two "free" spells will be enough to establish a hard lock in a very short period of time. [Enlisted Wurm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Enlisted+Wurm) – [Bloodbraid Elf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodbraid+Elf) – [Erayo, Soratami Ascendant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Erayo%2C+Soratami+Ascendant) may cost a lot of mana, but it only requires one free card to flip your [Erayo](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Erayo).


Three-color Modern mana bases are difficult to put together, so I'd like to stick to a two-color strategy. We need to be playing blue to play [Erayo](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Erayo), and white seems like the natural supplementary color. Playing a lot of white lets us play [Tempered Steel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tempered+Steel). If we play [Tempered Steel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tempered+Steel), then we get access to a lot of very cheap creatures that make flipping [Erayo](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Erayo) very easy.


I'd like to discuss the card choices and the implications they have on how you play the deck:


[Memnite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Memnite) and [Ornithopter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ornithopter) are going to be very interesting in this type of strategy. There will be many situations where it is incorrect to cast these creatures on the first turn. For example, if you have an [Erayo](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Erayo) in your opening hand along with one or two zero-mana creatures, then it's definitely worth the wait to assemble the flipped [Erayo](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Erayo). Your opponents will have a nightmare trying to deal with a flipped [Erayo](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Erayo), and you're not losing much value by not playing these on the first turn. The clock presented by [Ornithopter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ornithopter) and [Memnite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Memnite) comes from the strength of [Master of Etherium](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Master+of+Etherium), [Steel Overseer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Steel+Overseer), and [Tempered Steel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tempered+Steel).

There's a careful balance to knowing when you should dump your hand on the table and when you should be reserved and wait for a key turn to put your opponent in an awkward spot. There are a lot of situations wherein an opponent will be forced to use a board sweeper when you have only two or three threats on the table. Flipping an [Erayo](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Erayo) by casting threats is a game-winning play in roughly 99.9% of games.


[Ethersworn Canonist](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ethersworn+Canonist) is lackluster without [Erayo Essence](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Erayo+Essence), but once the legendary enchantment is active then it becomes the best card in the deck. Cards like [Tempered Steel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tempered+Steel), [Steel Overseer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Steel+Overseer), and [Master of Etherium](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Master+of+Etherium) all do a pretty good job of making the body worthwhile without [Erayo](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Erayo).


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/boab/boab170_3Cards1.jpg)[Gitaxian Probe](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gitaxian+Probe) has a lot of applications in this type of strategy. It's important that you use [Gitaxian Probe](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gitaxian+Probe) to scout for board-sweeping effects; this can give you the information you need to make correct decisions about board commitment. If your opponent is out of reactive spells, then it's usually correct to commit all of your threats to the board and just cross your fingers that a [Firespout](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Firespout) or [Day of Judgment](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Day+of+Judgment) isn't on the top of your opponent's library. [Gitaxian Probe](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gitaxian+Probe) is great at flipping an [Erayo](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Erayo). It draws the deck more cards without a mana commitment. In a lot of ways, it's like playing a 56-card deck. It's better, though! [Gitaxian Probe](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gitaxian+Probe) counts as a spell for your [Erayo](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Erayo). Flipping [Erayo](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Erayo) on a whim is pretty easy when you're playing with [Gitaxian Probe](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gitaxian+Probe), [Mishra's Bauble](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mishra%27s+Bauble), and eight zero-cost creatures.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/boab/boab170_path.jpg)[Path to Exile](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Path+to+Exile) | Art by [Todd Lockwood](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&artist=+%5B%22Todd+Lockwood%22%5D)


[Path to Exile](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Path+to+Exile) may be a bit difficult to acquire, but it's a card that you should probably have four of. The card will be a staple removal spell in Modern forever, and it also has a lot of usefulness in Legacy sideboards when a player is looking to play [Swords to Plowshares](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swords+to+Plowshares) numbers five through eight.



![Path to Exile](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Path+to+Exile)

 

[Master of Etherium](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Master+of+Etherium), [Tempered Steel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tempered+Steel), and [Steel Overseer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Steel+Overseer) are the deck's paths to victory. The deck may have one of the coolest disruptive elements in the format, but it's also capable of a relatively consistent turn four kill.


I chose to not play [Mox Opal](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mox+Opal) because it's difficult to acquire. However, if you're lucky enough to have a few [Mox Opal](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mox+Opal)s then you should probably include up to three, replacing a [Plains](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plains), an [Island](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island), and a [Mishra's Bauble](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mishra%27s+Bauble).

The deck does an incredible job applying pressure, and the inclusion of [Erayo, Soratami Ascendant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Erayo%2C+Soratami+Ascendant) does an excellent job of disrupting opponents. I played a few games with the deck in the tournament practice room on **Magic Online**.

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/boab/boab170_sleight.jpg)I lost the roll and kept [Island](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island), [Seachrome Coast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seachrome+Coast), [Mishra's Bauble](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mishra%27s+Bauble), [Erayo, Soratami Ascendant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Erayo%2C+Soratami+Ascendant), [Gitaxian Probe](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gitaxian+Probe), and 2 [Tempered Steel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tempered+Steel) on the draw. My opponent played a [Shivan Reef](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shivan+Reef), cast [Serum Visions](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Serum+Visions), and passed the turn. I drew a [Plains](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plains), played my [Seachrome Coast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seachrome+Coast), and passed the turn. My opponent played a [Steam Vents](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Steam+Vents) tapped, cast a [Sleight of Hand](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sleight+of+Hand), and passed the turn. I drew a [Memnite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Memnite), played my [Plains](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plains), cast [Erayo, Soratami Ascendant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Erayo%2C+Soratami+Ascendant), cast [Gitaxian Probe](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gitaxian+Probe), drew [Ornithopter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ornithopter), cast [Ornithopter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ornithopter), cast [Memnite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Memnite), flipped [Erayo](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Erayo), cast [Mishra's Bauble](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mishra%27s+Bauble), cracked it, and passed the turn. My opponent passed the turn with no play. I drew [Court Homunculus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Court+Homunculus) for the Bauble trigger, drew another [Erayo](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Erayo) for my turn, cast [Tempered Steel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tempered+Steel), attacked for 5, and passed the turn. My opponent again passed the turn with no play. I drew [Adarkar Wastes](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Adarkar+Wastes), cast [Tempered Steel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tempered+Steel), attacked for 9, played the [Adarkar Wastes](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Adarkar+Wastes), cast [Court Homunculus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Court+Homunculus), and passed the turn. My opponent conceded.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/boab/1_0Footer.jpg)This game may have seemed boring and noninteractive, but fighting through a flipped [Erayo](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Erayo) is a very tall order. Sometimes, this deck doesn't even need [Erayo](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Erayo) to beat down.

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/boab/boab170_dark.jpg)I won the roll and kept [Adarkar Wastes](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Adarkar+Wastes), 2 [Island](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island), [Ornithopter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ornithopter), [Court Homunculus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Court+Homunculus), [Steel Overseer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Steel+Overseer), and [Master of Etherium](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Master+of+Etherium). I played the [Adarkar Wastes](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Adarkar+Wastes), cast [Court Homunculus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Court+Homunculus), and passed the turn. I chose not to cast the [Ornithopter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ornithopter) because it wouldn't be attacking for damage until turn three anyway and I may have drawn an [Erayo, Soratami Ascendant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Erayo%2C+Soratami+Ascendant) to make the zero casting cost spell gain a lot of value. My opponent played an [Overgrown Tomb](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Overgrown+Tomb) tapped and passed the turn. I drew [Gitaxian Probe](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gitaxian+Probe) and decided to take a look at my opponent's hand. I saw a [Dark Confidant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dark+Confidant), a [Kitchen Finks](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kitchen+Finks), a [Putrefy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Putrefy), a [Death Cloud](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Death+Cloud), and lands. I drew a [Path to Exile](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Path+to+Exile), cast [Ornithopter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ornithopter), attacked for two, cast [Steel Overseer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Steel+Overseer), and passed the turn. My opponent played a land and cast [Dark Confidant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dark+Confidant) before passing the turn. I drew an [Ornithopter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ornithopter), cast it, played my land, cast [Master of Etherium](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Master+of+Etherium), activated my [Steel Overseer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Steel+Overseer), and attacked for 6, my opponent took the damage. My opponent revealed a [Thoughtseize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtseize) with Confidant, cast [Kitchen Finks](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kitchen+Finks), and passed the turn. I drew [Erayo, Soratami Ascendant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Erayo%2C+Soratami+Ascendant), cast it, cast [Path to Exile](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Path+to+Exile) on the [Kitchen Finks](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kitchen+Finks), activated the [Steel Overseer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Steel+Overseer), and attacked with my team, my opponent blocked the [Master of Etherium](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Master+of+Etherium) with [Dark Confidant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dark+Confidant) and took 11. My opponent drew a card and conceded.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/boab/2_0Footer.jpg)This game really showcases the deck's ability to play an aggressive game that puts its opponents on their heels immediately. It's worth noting that [Death Cloud](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Death+Cloud) decks usually do very well post-sideboard against this deck. [Death Cloud](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Death+Cloud) players usually have cheap spot removal and (sometimes) [Ancient Grudge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ancient+Grudge).

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/boab/boab170_elspeth.jpg)I lost the roll and kept [Seachrome Coast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seachrome+Coast), [Plains](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plains), [Path to Exile](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Path+to+Exile), [Ethersworn Canonist](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ethersworn+Canonist), 2 [Gitaxian Probe](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gitaxian+Probe), and [Erayo, Soratami Ascendant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Erayo%2C+Soratami+Ascendant). My opponent started things by sacrificing a fetchland and grabbing a [Forest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest), he cast [Wild Nacatl](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Nacatl) and passing. I drew a [Court Homunculus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Court+Homunculus), played my [Seachrome Coast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seachrome+Coast), cast [Court Homunculus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Court+Homunculus), and passed the turn. My opponent played an [Arid Mesa](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arid+Mesa), sacrificed it, found a [Sacred Foundry](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sacred+Foundry), went to 16, cast [Qasali Pridemage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Qasali+Pridemage), attacked for 4, and passed the turn.


I found myself in a bit of a quandary: [Qasali Pridemage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Qasali+Pridemage)'s activated ability can be used to destroy [Erayo Essence](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Erayo+Essence) post-flip. I drew another [Court Homunculus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Court+Homunculus) and decided to play it safe. I played my [Plains](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plains), tapped it for white, cast [Court Homunculus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Court+Homunculus), attacked for 2, and cast [Path to Exile](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Path+to+Exile) on the [Qasali Pridemage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Qasali+Pridemage). My opponent searched for a land and put it onto the battlefield tapped. I passed the turn.


My opponent cast [Elspeth, Knight-Errant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elspeth%2C+Knight-Errant), gave [Wild Nacatl](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Nacatl) +3/+3 and flying, and attacked me for 6. I drew a [Path to Exile](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Path+to+Exile), cast it on the [Wild Nacatl](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Nacatl), attacked Elspeth for 4, cast [Erayo, Soratami Ascendant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Erayo%2C+Soratami+Ascendant), cast two [Gitaxian Probe](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gitaxian+Probe)s for life and dropped down to 6, and passed the turn with a flipped [Erayo](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Erayo). My opponent made a 1/1 with Elspeth, cast a [Lightning Bolt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt) to be countered by the [Erayo](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Erayo) trigger, then a [Tarmogoyf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf), and passed the turn. I drew for my turn and started digging for anything that could help me. Nothing played hero off the top of my deck, and I was down a game.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/boab/2_1Footer.jpg)I've played a good deal of matches with White-Blue [Erayo](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Erayo) decks and, unfortunately, I feel that they lack strength in the Game 2 and 3 metagame. [Ancient Grudge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ancient+Grudge) has become very popular and it's difficult to power through that card. However, the general strategy of the deck is quite sound and the power level of the cards in the deck make it a very dangerous foe for just about everything. I believe [Erayo](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Erayo) is currently being overlooked, and I hope this column piqued your interests in the often-overlooked *Saviors of Kamigawa* legend.


Tune in next week for a finely tuned version of [Heartless Summoning](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Heartless+Summoning)!


Happy brewing!
