Congratulations Pierre Canali! You are the Pro Tour-Columbus 2005 Champion!


The 22- year-old Salsa instructor from France may have missed a step or two on his way through the Top 8 of this tournament, but he still emerged on top of the inaugural event of the 2005 Pro Tour season. This was his first Pro Tour and it ended with him holding a $30,000 check and the lead of both the Rookie and Player of the Year Races.


He played Affinity--one of only eight players in the tournament to make that deck choice--and the field was not prepared for the deck's power this weekend. Many players made the mistake of only offering token resistance to the most dominant deck from the most recent Block Constructed and Standard seasons. Canali showed the world that a couple of [Energy Flux](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Energy+Flux) es are just not going to cut it folks!


Canali led the Swiss at the end of Day 1 and his only three losses on Day 2 were to fellow Top 8 competitors Gadiel Szleifer, Geoffrey Siron, and countryman Oliver Ruel. He avenged his loss to Siron's Madness deck in the quarterfinals and did the same to Ruel and his Red Army in the semis. He met up with Japan's Shuhei Nakamura in the finals and despite a couple of questionable plays still won the match against Red Deck Wins in a convincing three-game sweep.


Canali's sideboard was his MVP all weekend. Looking at his decklist, the sideboard cards -- with [Meddling Mage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Meddling+Mage) , [Chill](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chill) , [Kami of Ancient Law](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kami+of+Ancient+Law) , and [Engineered Plague](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Engineered+Plague) -- looks like it should be attached to a Dump Truck listing instead of Affinity. The Top 8 featured a buffet of decklists for players looking forward to the upcoming Extended PTQ season, with a different deck for each competitor. It will be interesting to discover if Affinity will be a dominant force come January or will this event give players enough advance warning to trade for the [Meltdown](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Meltdown) s, [Pulverize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pulverize) s, and various and sundry artifact hate to keep the deck in check.
