Tom LaPille makes things. Some of the things he makes are card sets, like Dark Ascension and Born of the Gods. Sometimes he makes stories, too. Sometimes he makes unexpected things, like 16th-century Japanese clothing. He's probably making something right now.

M**agic** Ramp;D is a fun place to work. Although we do many of the mundane things that one might do in any company, we also get to do things like play **Magic** while we're on the clock. We spend some of that time playing Limited with new sets, and the rest of the time playing Constructed—usually Standard—as it will be when the newest set we are working on is released. We call that Constructed playtesting the "Future Future League," and internally we have shortened that to "FFL."

Decks we build for the Future Future League have many different purposes. The most obvious purpose is to test for power level, and that is much of what we do. However, not everything we do is that rigorous. It is not realistic to expect that all 145 cards in *Worldwake* will become Standard tournament staples, so in order to get the full picture of a **Magic** set, we often build decks with other purposes. Perhaps we have one specific question we want to answer, or maybe a mechanic or a pair of cards randomly struck us as interesting enough to build a deck around. No matter what the purpose of a deck, however, playing it against other people's FFL decks teaches us something about the cards that are on their way toward release. Today, I'll tell you about some FFL decks we made while *Worldwake* was the newest set in our format.
