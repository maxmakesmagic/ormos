Unfortunately, due to technical difficulties at Grand Prix Warsaw, we had to cancel Day One’s stream after the first few rounds to troubleshoot the issues.


After working on the problems throughout Saturday, we intend to approach Day Two with an unchanged Sunday start time of 9 a.m. local time (1 a.m. PT/4 a.m. ET/8 a.m. UTC).


However, should we see a return to the issues we experienced on Day One as we get ready for Day Two, we will move to a delayed broadcast approach. We will be recording the feature matches and once a round’s match is complete, we will stream those recordings with live commentary. We’ll repeat this option with each round until the tournament is complete. If it becomes clear that we will have to move to this option, we will message in the Twitch chat and via [@magicprotour](http://www.twitch.tv/magic) on Twitter as soon as possible.


Should any issues arise during this process, we will keep you informed on the latest. If we ultimately have to move to a broadcast with recorded matches, we will start this coverage at ***10:15 a.m. local time (2:15 a.m. PT/5:15 a.m. ET/9:15 a.m. UTC)*** Sunday.


As fans of premier-level *Magic* ourselves, we will work to the best of our abilities to bring you as much *Magic* to watch as possible from Grand Prix Warsaw, and apologize for the inconveniences caused by these technical issues during the weekend.
