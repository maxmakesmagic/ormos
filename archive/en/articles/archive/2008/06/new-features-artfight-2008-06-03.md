Hey there. Remember [ArtFight](/en/articles/archive/introducing-artfight-2008-05-12), the Facebook application where you can arbitrarily rate one piece of **Magic** art as being better than another one and then bask in a sense of lordly power? Well, it's got some new features. Let's start off with a special wallpaper. Click on the image to download it!


![Click here for a special ArtFight wallpaper!](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/mtgcom/arcana1000/1603_Wallpaperthumb.jpg)The bonus rounds (where you guess which piece of art *other* people liked better) are still here, and this time... they're *personal*. Each time you vote in a bonus round, you'll learn what percentage of people agree with you. And when your streak gets broken, you'll be given the name of someone who *disagrees* with you, which will presumably initiate some sort of lifelong rivalry. And you can see your history of bonus rounds and post old bonus rounds in the forum for everyone to see.


[Swamp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Swamp)But that's not the coolest part. There's now a Global Experience Bar that tracks all the experience earned by everyone on the ArtFight. And every time it fills up, a whole new set of card art gets added to the game! Right now, the community is about halfway to adding *Ravnica: City of Guilds* to the pool of art. And after *Ravnica*, who knows?
