**rev·e·nant**

![Revenant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Revenant)  
 From Merriam-Webster Online:  
 Function: noun  
 Etymology: French, from present participle of *revenir* to return  
 Date: 1827  
 : one that returns after death or a long absence  
 - **revenant** adjective
 **lea**

![Ley Druid](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Ley+Druid)  
 From Merriam-Webster Online:  
 Variant(s): or **ley**  
 Function: noun  
 Etymology: Middle English *leye*, from Old English *lEah*; akin to Old High German *lOh* thicket, Latin *lucus* grove, *lux* light  
 Date: before 12th century  
 1 : grassland, pasture  
 2 usually *ley* : arable land used temporarily for hay or grazing
 **Ee·sha**

![Commander Eesha](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Commander+Eesha)  
 From Rei Nakazawa, **Magic** creative text writer:  
 Function: proper noun  
 Etymology: Character names sometimes take even more time to create than normal card names. The original "placeholder" name given to this character by *Judgment* author Will McDermott was "Killian." However, the naming team decided it was too based in real world culture, clashing too much with Kirtar and Teroh. "Eesha" was chosen for a few reasons: the "a" ending is generally feminine, reflecting this character's gender; the long "e" sounds in the name echo bird calls, and the name in general sounds softer than those of her two predecessors, hinting at her (somewhat) more reasonable personality.
