Two Grand Prix took place on two different hemispheres last weekend. While [Grand Prix Santiago](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/gpsan14) was all about Standard, [Grand Prix Nashville](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/gpnas14) was a first look into the *Khans of Tarkir* Team Sealed format.


In Santiago, many regular archetypes made their appearance, as expected, but decks based on [Whip of Erebos](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Whip+of+Erebos) were the ones that made their big show. Eduardo dos Santos Vieira of Brazil battled his way through 642 other players with his Abzan/graveyard-themed deck, highlighting powerful creatures like [Hornet Queen](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hornet+Queen) recurring with [Whip of Erebos](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Whip+of+Erebos) alongside *Magic 2015* Limited powerhouse [Soul of Theros](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soul+of+Theros).


Speaking of powerhouses, Nashville was a hotbed of pro player activity, with the Top 4 teams featuring twelve players who had at least one thing in common: a minimum of one Grand Prix Top 8 each. When the dust settled, it was the west-coast contingent of Matt Nass, Jacob Wilson, and Jesse Hampton that hoisted the trophies in Tennessee.


We're nearing the final weeks of the Pro Tour Qualifier season for Pro Tour *Fate Reforged* as well. There are still plenty of invitations to the Pro Tour to win. [Be sure to find a PTQ near you](http://magic.wizards.com/en/protour/qualifierlist) and we hope to see you in Washington DC in February!
