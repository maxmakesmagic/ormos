======================

Due to the nature of logistics at the Pro Tour, the Feature Match area usually lags behind the main tournament for a few minutes. This usually results in the players having a few minutes to casually chat while waiting for the go-ahead to begin. It's not uncommon for there to be joking and laughing heard around the stage in the minutes before the round begins.



 But this is Round 14 of the Pro Tour, and a berth in the Top 8 is on the line. And the table was silent as Pro Tour *Born of the Gods* Top 8 competitor Christian Seibold sat down across the table from eighth-ranked Shaun McLaren, who just so happened to win that Pro Tour.



The tension of late-round Pro Tour matches is palpable, and it's no surprise that banter winds down as Day 2 does the same (well, maybe Ari Lax is the exception). McLaren entered the match at 11-2, and a win here would very likely be enough to make his way to the Top 8. At 10-3, Seibold wasn't in as good of a spot but was still very much in contention.



 McLaren sat down with the format's most popular deck this weekend: Jeskai Wins. The versatile deck can answer anything else in the format, by switching from a control role to an aggressive route with [Mantis Rider](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mantis+Rider) and [Goblin Rabblemaster](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Rabblemaster) to a burn strategy with [Lightning Strike](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Strike), [Magma Jet](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Magma+Jet) and [Stoke the Flames](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stoke+the+Flames).




 Seibold arrived to battle with one of the format's more unexplored decks: Sidisi Whip. Utilizing its namesakes [Sidisi, Brood Tyrant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sidisi%2C+Brood+Tyrant) and [Whip of Erebos](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Whip+of+Erebos), the deck focuses on "milling" itself with cards like [Satyr Wayfinder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Satyr+Wayfinder) and the legendary shaman herself. That allows it to both make hordes of Zombie tokens and set up goodies like [Hornet Queen](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hornet+Queen) to whip back into play. In a format that largely plays cards that trade one-for-one outside of [Dig Through Time](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dig+Through+Time), it's a strategy that attacks from an unpredictable and often-uncontrollable angle.





*The two Pro Tour *Born of the Gods* Top 8 competitors had to battle, both fighting to secure a second Pro Tour Top 8 to add to their resume.*
