### Game 1

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gpsev03/a891.jpg)*A difference of side but not of skill.*Antoine played first and Carlos had to take a mulligan.

Antoine: "All my opponents are mana screwed or mulliganing today"  
 Carlos: "Caltos!"

The World Champion's draw were quite good (turn two [Wellwisher](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wellwisher), turn three [Timberwatch Elf](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Timberwatch+Elf), turn four [Taunting Elf](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Taunting+Elf) and Morph) and despite Antoine's good opposition ([Smother](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Smother) the [Wellwisher](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wellwisher), Legion, 2/3, 3/3) he managed to keep the advantage.

The World Champion attacked with the morph and the [Taunting Elf](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Taunting+Elf), which both Ruel's 2/3 and 3/3 had to block. He morphed [Patron of the Wild](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Patron+of+the+Wild), making his 0/1 a 6/7 with [Timberwatch Elf](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Timberwatch+Elf).

Antoine:"Rourrrrou"

Antoine hasn't had his last word, and a few turns later after losing all his creatures in an attack he managed to make a face-down Cabal Exetutionar go through. At that point, the Cleric was only facing [Taunting Elf](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Taunting+Elf) and [Timberwatch Elf](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Timberwatch+Elf), since Carlos had had to sacrifice another freshly-played [Timberwatch Elf](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Timberwatch+Elf). But the waves were just too fast. [Spitting Gourna](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spitting+Gourna) and [Seedborn Muse](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seedborn+Muse) finished what the elves had started.

Ruel 0-1 Romao

![Patron of the Wild](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Patron+of+the+Wild)Antoine Ruel, Frenchier than ever, tried to draw on his first turn when he was supposed to be playing first.After they traded a couple of attacks and creatures, Antoine decided to play [Infest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Infest) to kill his own Buzzard, [Timberwatch Elf](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Timberwatch+Elf), and [Shepherd of Rot](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shepherd+of+Rot). Carlos chose to discard his spoiler Mystic Proportions and keep his cheapest creatures, which he then proceeded to play one by one, turn after turn: [Seedborn Muse](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seedborn+Muse), [Sootfeather Flock](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sootfeather+Flock), and [Everglove Courier](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Everglove+Courier). Antoine tried to race the 3/2 with [Severed Legion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Severed+Legion) but the great amount of [Swamp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swamp)s he was drawing didn't help him a lot. Things really start to go wrong for Ruel when Carlos had the good idea to play [Krosan Tusker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Krosan+Tusker). The Beast, too big for Antoine's 2/2's, forced him to topdeck.

He looked at the top card of his library, added it to the pile of lands he had already played and conceded with a smile. Being Top 4 is already good, and he knows that three members of the online clan Cephalid Sea Fodd Restaurant are on the podium and that is a little victory.

**Final Result:** Ruel 0-2 Romao.
