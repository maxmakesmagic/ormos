![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/ptyok03/a361.jpg)It's only appropriate that one of the last Masters matches be played between two true masters- Darwin Kastle and Bob Maher. Kastle has been a mainstay on the Pro Tour since its existence, and is one of three players to have 300 or more lifetime Pro Tour points. The other two? Kai Budde and Jon Finkel. To anyone who follows competitive Magic, Bob Maher needs no introduction either. He has won Pro Tour, Grand Prix and Player of the Year titles, along with countless other solid finishes.

The matchup here features both players running signature decks- Kastle's Rock against Maher's [Tinker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tinker). Kastle is very confident about the matchup. When he played against Kibler's [Tinker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tinker) deck earlier in the tournament, he commented that Your Move Games thought [Tinker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tinker) would be a big deck at Pro Tour Houston, and The Rock's performance against it in testing was a major reason why he decided to run that particular deck at the event. The big difference maker is [Pernicious Deed](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pernicious+Deed), since [Tinker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tinker) often needs to dedicate plenty of cards to the table in the form of artifact mana and the threats they power. All it takes is one Deed to decimate everything. [Upheaval](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Upheaval) will be Maher's ace in the hole, since he can float a ton of mana and replay his artifacts to a tremendous board advantage that Kastle will be unlikely to recover from.

### Game 1

Kastle accelerated with [Llanowar Elves](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Llanowar+Elves), while Maher ramped up even more, using [Ancient Tomb](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ancient+Tomb) to bring out [Grim Monolith](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grim+Monolith). A second turn [Pernicious Deed](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pernicious+Deed) gave Kastle a great threat, and the game would now become a game of chicken, as both players would try to push ahead without committing too many resources to the table. Maher would look to extend just enough to force Kastle to blow the Deed, while Kastle would try to get a little pressure on the table to get Maher to play more permanents. Of course, if Maher had a [Tinker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tinker), he could get a higher casting cost threat that could survive the Deed. That happened to be the case, as he played [Thran Dynamo](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thran+Dynamo) and [Tinker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tinker)ed [Grim Monolith](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grim+Monolith) into [Urza's Blueprints](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Urza%27s+Blueprints). Kastle could have blown up the Deed for four, which would have destroyed the Dynamo and made paying echo on Blueprints impossible. However, Maher still would have drawn two extra cards. So, Kastle played a threat in [Ravenous Baloth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ravenous+Baloth) instead.

The Baloth attacked, and Maher was already at nine due to his [Ancient Tomb](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ancient+Tomb). A second Baloth followed, and Kastle was looking to go straight for the kill. With Llanowar Elf, he would be able to attack for the win on the following turn. Maher thought for a while, and played [Crumbling Sanctuary](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crumbling+Sanctuary) followed by [Tangle Wire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tangle+Wire). Thanks to [Urza's Blueprints](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Urza%27s+Blueprints), Maher had five cards in hand to Kastle's one. Due to [Tangle Wire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tangle+Wire), Kastle would need to activate Deed on upkeep if he wanted to use it. He decided not to, and attacked with his Baloths to take eight cards off the top of Maher's library. Once he got enough mana, Kastle could attack with the Baloths, put damage on the stack, and Deed for five to destroy the Sanctuary and win. 

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/ptyok03/a360.jpg)Maher needed to do something, and fast. [Upheaval](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Upheaval) fit the bill perfectly, and after it resolved Maher played [Ancient Tomb](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ancient+Tomb), [Thran Dynamo](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thran+Dynamo) and [Metalworker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Metalworker). A turn later he absolutely exploded with [Metalworker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Metalworker), producing twelve mana. He then played [Voltaic Key](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Voltaic+Key) and untapped the [Metalworker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Metalworker) to use it again, which brought him up to twenty mana. [Masticore](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Masticore), Dynamo, Blueprints and [Tangle Wire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tangle+Wire) followed, as well as [Tinker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tinker), which got [Mishra's Helix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mishra%27s+Helix). This left Kastle completely locked, and [Masticore](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Masticore) came through for the win.

Kastle- 0 Maher- 1

### Game 2

Kastle was visibly upset with his opening draw, and sent it back. He started with [Duress](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress), which got [Grim Monolith](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grim+Monolith). The rest of Maher's hand was two [City of Traitors](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=City+of+Traitors), [Rishadan Port](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rishadan+Port), [Metalworker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Metalworker), island and [Phyrexian Colossus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phyrexian+Colossus). [Metalworker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Metalworker) died right away to [Diabolic Edict](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Diabolic+Edict), and Kastle played his second [Treetop Village](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treetop+Village). On the following turn both were activated, one was Ported down, and the other got through for three damage. Maher summoned [Masticore](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Masticore), and Kastle did nothing on his turn. When Maher tapped out to shoot down a [Birds](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Birds), Kastle [Naturalize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Naturalize)d it. [Grim Monolith](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grim+Monolith) brought out a Key, which helped bring out a Helix. A Dynamo gave Maher more mana to work with on the following turn, and he had Kastle locked up once again. [Phyrexian Processor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phyrexian+Processor) came out set to ten a few turns later, and got to work. After taking ten damage from a token, Kastle found the [Naturalize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Naturalize) he had been waiting for and destroyed the Helix, but it was too late.

**Final Result:** Kastle- 0 Maher- 2
