### Elvish Predation


The Elves are coming out of the woodwork! When you pilot the “Elvish Predation” deck, you’re in control of a massive Elf-producing force. Not only are all twenty-eight creatures in the deck Elves, but many of them, such as [Lys Alana Huntmaster](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lys+Alana+Huntmaster) and [Nath of the Gilt-Leaf](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nath+of+the+Gilt-Leaf), put Elf creature tokens into play. Some of your spells make tokens as well—in fact, [Elvish Promenade](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elvish+Promenade)*doubles* your number of Elves!


What to do with so many Elves? The easy answer is to pump them up with [Imperious Perfect](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Imperious+Perfect) and attack! Alternately, you can use [Lys Alana Scarblade](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lys+Alana+Scarblade) to make opposing creatures smaller based on how many Elves you’ve got, or use [Immaculate Magistrate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Immaculate+Magistrate) to make your own creatures bigger based on how many Elves you’ve got. Then attack!
