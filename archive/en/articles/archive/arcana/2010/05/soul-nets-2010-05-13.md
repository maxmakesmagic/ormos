Once there was a card called "[Soul Net](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soul+Net)." When creatures went to the graveyard, its controller gained 1 life.

Then there was a card called "[Onulet](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Onulet)." It gave its controller 2 life when it went to the graveyard. Originally it was going to be called "Onulets," which is an anagram for "Soul Net." But the art had only one creature in it, so it was just "Onulet."

Much later, there was a card called "[Anodet Lurker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Anodet+Lurker)," which gave its controller 3 life when it went to the graveyard. As we learned [on June 9, 2004](/en/articles/archive/ask-wizards-june-2004-2004-06-01), it was an anagram for "Darker Onulet."

So why bring this up now? Well, there's a card in *Rise of the Eldrazi* that gains its controller *4* life when it goes to the graveyard.

That's a lot of life. It's some kind of ... **Mega Onulet**!
