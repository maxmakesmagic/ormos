### PRO TOUR KHANS OF TARKIR


THE JESKAI WAY
==============

 Step 1: Cast [Narset, Enlightened Master](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Narset%2C+Enlightened+Master).



Step 2: Turn it sideways.


Step 3: Profit.



  




 Jeskai is a color combination typically exemplified by efficient decks that combine efficient red and white removal with blue counterspells and a few creatures to tie it all together. And in *Khans of Tarkir*, you get exactly what you expect. From the [Flying Crane Technique](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flying+Crane+Technique) that usually ends the game on the spot to the [Warden of the Eye](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Warden+of+the+Eye) that brings it back if things go awry, Jeskai manages the mingling of creatures, instants and sorceries better than any other clan on Tarkir could dream of.



It's a combination that is perfectly encapsulated in the Jeskai mechanic, prowess. Creatures with the prowess ability are granted +1/+1 when their owner casts a non-creature spell, and that means things can get out of control quickly. Balancing creatures with other spells can be tricky, but it's absolutely deadly when it all comes together. 



 A Jeskai deck in *Khans of Tarkir* draft is very flexible. It can play an aggressive route with removal and counterspells to pump up the prowess creatures while disrupting the opponent, or take a more controlling stance and rely on a few powerful creatures to go the distance while hiding behind flexible morphs like [Dragon's Eye Savants](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragon%27s+Eye+Savants) and [Monastery Flock](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Monastery+Flock) and a host of instants and sorceries.




 Jeskai is not without some signature spells in Limited. [Winterflame](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Winterflame) is a popular one for the flexibility it offers, and [Efreet Weaponmaster](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Efreet+Weaponmaster) is one of the most powerful common morphs in the set. It wins combat against most cards that unmorph for five or less mana, and it allows another creature to trade up thanks to its power-granting ability.




 Jeskai is also unique in that it offers some interesting "build-around-me" cards that other clans can't match. It's hard to have more fun in Draft than with a strong [Quiet Contemplation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Quiet+Contemplation) or [Goblinslide](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblinslide) deck, and the existence of those archetypes is a testament to the depth of the format.




 Then there's the game-breaking rares. [Flying Crane Technique](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flying+Crane+Technique) is the most well-known, but [Dragon-Style Twins](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragon-Style+Twins) and [Sage of the Inward Eye](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sage+of+the+Inward+Eye) get the job done as well. [Mantis Rider](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mantis+Rider) may not be as immediately game-breaking as those spells, but it is one of the best cards in the clan, with three of the four undefeated Jeskai decks from Day One sporting the hasty flier.




 If [Mantis Rider](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mantis+Rider) is powerful treat in Limited, it's an absolute powerhouse in Constructed. It forms the backbone of the Jeskai Aggro deck that has performed consistently well since the debut of *Khans of Tarkir* in Standard.

*Perhaps one of the Jeskai's most recognizable and defining cards, [Mantis Rider](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mantis+Rider) has been a powerhouse in both Standard and Limited this weekend.* 





 The deck is something of an enigma that defies any traditional label. It's not a tempo deck, though it can sometimes play out that way. It plays a ton of direct damage red spells, yet it's not exactly a Burn deck. The beauty of the Jeskai deck is that it can adapt to fill whatever role is needed, whether that's to pressure a Control opponent with threats or control the board against an aggressive opponent. Thanks to flexible spells like [Jeskai Charm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jeskai+Charm), it's easy for the deck to move back and forth between whatever role is necessary.




 And while it's technically a Sultai card, [Dig Through Time](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dig+Through+Time) has been a staple of the Jeskai deck this weekend. It fills a vital need for the deck, giving it the card advantage it needs to compete with the Control decks around the room while also providing the spell that allows Jeskai to fully pull ahead of the aggressive decks.




 One of the players most invested in the archetype is your 2013 *Magic* World Champion Shahar Shenhar, who tested other decks before the Pro Tour but came back to Jeskai because of the options it allowed.



"There's a lot of interaction with your opponent, and it allows you to plan out plays around what your opponent is doing," he explained. "It really doesn't have any truly bad match-ups. The green decks aren't easy, but it's definitely winnable. Really, this just fits my play-style."




*2013* Magic *World Champion Shahar Shenhar is one of many representatives of the Jeskai Way this weekend in Standard.*
