Paul Jackson, who won GP Sydney in 2014 squared off against Sam Loy in the Feature Match area of GP Auckland. Both had participated in Pro Tour Dragon’s Maze in 2013. Jackson had finished higher at the Pro Tour, so it was a chance for Loy to even the score.


Jackson’s plan was to rush Loy with his aggressive Mardu build. Loy’s plan was to slow his opponent down so his four colour deck could play it’s bombs and win.


Jackson started with an quick [Chief of the Edge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chief+of+the+Edge) and Aleha’s Vanguard to Loy’s morph and Archer’s Parapet. The two traded in the early game, Loy’s Parapet doing good work maintaining his life total.


Jackson fired off a [Sandblast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sandblast) to kill a Mystic of the Hidden Way, but a flipped [Mistfire Weaver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mistfire+Weaver) saved the shifty monk from an early death. It wasn’t for long, through, as Jackson found a [Reach of Shadows](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reach+of+Shadows) the next turn and used it to finally slay the Mystic.

*Loy counts up his opponent’s life total.*


Loy looked to be in trouble as Jackson cast an Arc Lighting after blockers to kill the Parapet and the Misfire Weaver, clearing Loy’s board. Loy top-decked a [Temur War Shaman](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Temur+War+Shaman) and his new army regain control of the battlefield. Loy’s continual morphs and manifestations, and their ability to fight each of Jackson’s creatures, allowed him to eventually overcome Jackson and take the first game.


**Jackson 0 - Loy 1**


Jackson started with a lonely tapped Mardu Skullhunter, whereas Loy found a [Ainok Guide](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ainok+Guide) and Archer’s Parapet to slow the game right down as planned. After a few turns, Jackson found a Noxious Dragon, and though Loy cast an [Aven Surveyor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aven+Surveyor) to bounce the scaled reptile, it returned the following turn to harass Loy.


The two players started trading blows, Jackson in the air and Loy on the ground. Jackson found a second dragon, a Wardcale this time, while Loy summoned his valuable Temur War Shaman. Jackson used an Arc Lighting to clear the way for his Dragons, but both life totals were dropping fast.


  

Finally, Jackson drew a [Reach of Shadows](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reach+of+Shadows) in immediately used it to kill the Temur War Shaman. Loy, on 5, assessed the board, pulled the trigger on his Duneblast, leaving behind a solo Glacial Stalker, which he used to drop Jackson to 5 as well.

*Jackson considers his options.*


Jackson cast a [Venerable Lammasu](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Venerable+Lammasu) and passed the turn. Loy forced the big elemental into the red zone and Jackson declined to block. With no pump spell from Loy, Jackson fell to 1. Loy cast a morph and passed.


Jackson flew his giant bird-person-elk-thing to attack, when Loy flipped the morph to block. However when Loy went for the kill the following turn, Jackson shot the [Glacial Stalker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glacial+Stalker) down with a Saltblast, and Loy, having no answer for the Lammasu, conceded the game.


**Jackson 1 - Loy 1**


Jackson kept a grip of seven cards, but Loy decided to mulligan to six. Jackson came out swinging, trading a [Chief of the Edge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chief+of+the+Edge) for a Highland Game, then casting Alesha, Who Smiles at Death.


Unfortunately Jackson made a play error his following turn, using Alesha to bring back the [Chief of the Edge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chief+of+the+Edge) to the battlefield. However, Alesha can only bring back two **power** creatures, not two **mana** creatures. A [Chief of the Scale](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chief+of+the+Scale) would of been fine, but a [Chief of the Edge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chief+of+the+Edge) was an illegal play.


The error wasn’t picked up until it was Jackson’s turn again, so a judge was called. As there had been several plays since the error, the judge determined that the battlefield should be left as is. Jackson received a warning and the game continued. With Loy struggling to find lands, Jackson ran him over shortly after.


“Sorry, man.” Jackson offered afterwards.


“It’s okay, I was probably dead.” Loy admitted.


**Jackson 2 - Loy 1**
