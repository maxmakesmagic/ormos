![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/USNAT01/889.jpg)*Brian Davis vs. Steve O'Mahoney-Schwartz*The match had a rather relaxed mood as before the match begun, Steve O asked if Brian was the only pro player from Tennessee. Brian said, "I am the ONLY player from Tennessee." Brian reminded Steve O that Craig Wescoe was also from Tennessee and was not sure if he counted. Steve O said he didn't count him cause he doesn't know who he is. Both of the players deck have extremely powerful cards. Brian is playing black red with *three* Magma Burst as well as Reckless Spite, Smoldering Tar and Shivan Emissary. Steve O playing white blue green was sporting a Treva the Renewer and a Voice of All.


The first game started off rather uneventfully with Brian laying a Nightscape Apprentice while Steve played an Obsidian Acolyte. Both players played lands and said go for the next couple of turns before action finally began. On Brian's fourth turn he cast Magma Burst without kicker to kill the acolyte and was able to begin serving with his apprentice. Steve then cast Reviving Vapors which revealed Nomadic Elf, Alpha Kavu and Benalish Emissary. Steve took the Emissary and cast it with kicker to destroy Davis's swamp. Davis took his turn and was unable to find a fourth land while his hand was amazing. Davis' hand consisted of Reckless Spite, Shivan Emissary, Magma Burst, Smoldering Tar and a couple of Kavus. Brian looked down at his board of 2 mountains and a swamp and passed the turn. Steve dropped a Quirion Sentinel and a Voice of All naming red and passed the turn.

Steve didn't do anything and just sent his men and passed the turn. Brian cursed flesh the sentinel, and took 3 next turn when Steve played nothing. Another turn passed and Brian still hadn't seen his fourth land and had to Cursed Flesh the Emissary to slow down the beats some more. Both players did nothing for a couple of turns aside from Steve attacking with his Voice. Brian finally drew a fourth land at 12 life and cast an Ancient Kavu. Steve showed how skillful he is by drawing Treva the Renewer and put the fierce dragon into play. Brian slammed on his deck calling for at least a land if not a swamp and drew an Ancient Kavu. Brian packed up his cards and was in shock from his inability to draw land.


Davis 0 - OMS 1


Game 2 was a great start for Brian. He started with the Nightscape Apprentice and a Rogue Kavu. Steve dropped a Quirion Explorer and passed. Brian sent with his potentially first-striking Kavu and Steve had no choice but to take the beats. Next turn Steve Harrowed and casts a Quirion Sentinel and a Nomadic Elf. Brian once again swung with his Kavu and cast an Ancient Kavu. Steve, unable to attack because of the 3/3, busted out Treva again. Brian, who had mana this time, proceeded to Shivan Emissary Treva and swung with the Ancient Kavu. Steve then dropped a Lashknife Barrier which made the Magma Burst in Brian's hand less effective.

Steve's next turn allowed him to stabilize with a Wings of Hope on his Nomadic Elf and an Alpha Kavu. Brian cast his second Ancient Kavu to keep up the pressure but Steve just Hobbled it on the next turn. Steve O was able to stabilize the game at 7 life but knew Brian must have at least one of the bursts in his hand. Steve was able to Strength of Unity his Alpha Kavu and made the math a mess for Brian. Brian kept drawing land after land and was unable to draw anything that could make him break through. A Pincer Spider with Kicker and a Gaea's Might later and the match was Steve's.


**Final Result:** Brian Davis 0 Steve O'Mahoney-Schwartz 2
