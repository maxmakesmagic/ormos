DAY 1 COVERAGE



757 players attended Grand Prix Manila, but after nine rounds of competition only 233 will return for Day 2!


Three players - namely Ryoichi Tamada, Mark Anthony Biala, and Matias Monico Palu-Ay – finished 9-0 and were well-poised to make the Top 8 tomorrow. Close behind were (11) Ken Yukuhiro, Toru Inoue, Wee Pang Ming along with 19 other players, all with 8-1 records. In addition, Yuuki Ichikawa, Soh Weng Heng, Zax Ozaki, Au Yong Wai Kin, Mark Lawrence Tubola, Jan Ang, Tomoharu Saito, and Jake Hart all made the cut and remained in Top 8 contention.


Despite initial fears that Aetherworks Marvel was going to suffocate the metagame, only around 22% of the field showed up with the legendary artifact. Approximately 15% were Vehicles variants, 15% Black-Green variants, 10% Zombies variants, and 10% Torrential Gearhulk variants, indicating that the metagame was more balanced than what was perceived!


As we shut the doors here at the SMX Convention Center, the action is still going on at Grand Prix Omaha and Grand Prix Amsterdam! What surprises await us this weekend? Only time will tell!
