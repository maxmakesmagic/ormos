Build Notes
-----------


* [Robber of the Rich](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Robber+of+the+Rich) no longer lets players play MDFCs exiled with its triggered ability as lands.
* [Skyclave Shadowcat](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skyclave+Shadowcat)'s triggered ability will now correctly see itself dying, as long as it has a +1/+1 counter when it dies.
* [Akiri, Fearless Voyager](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Akiri%2C+Fearless+Voyager) can now correctly trigger multiple times per combat phases if its controller attacks multiple players.
* Several cards that allow a player to reveal some cards from the top of their library and put one into their hand, notably including Tajuru Paragon, will now have a game log entry identifying the chosen card.
