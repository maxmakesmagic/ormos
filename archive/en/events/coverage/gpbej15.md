Wescoe, Hoaen and Hron Drown All Hopes in Beijing!
==================================================




Craig Wescoe, Rich Hoaen, Mike Hron each added yet another Grand Prix Champion Trophy to their mantle, defeating Yuuya Watanabe, Makihito Mihara and Yuuki Ichikawa in the finals! Quite literally, they had drowned all hopes in Beijing!

TOP 8 COVERAGE



When Craig Wescoe, Rich Hoaen and Mike Hron decided to make the far-flung, trans-Pacific trip to Beijing, they had high expectations. In fact, the highest. They had come to win, and they certainly lived up to not only their own, but also the public's expectations!


To secure their victory, they had to get past ranked 17th Yuuya Watanabe, Makihito Mihara and Yuuki ichikawa in the final draft tables. Watanabe was hunting for his 8th Grand Prix title to dethrone Shuhei Nakamura's status as the ultimate Grand Prix master, and quickly dispatched Craig Wescoe in his match. Mike Hron equalized the score by defeating Yuuki Ichikawa and all hopes were pinned on Rich Hoaen.


Already down one game against Makihito Mihara, he reversed the dire situation he was in during the second and third games, on the back of a foil Drowner of Secrets which Watanabe had shipped him in the second booster.


Rounding out the Top 4 were local heroes three-time Grand Prix Top 8 competitor Liu Yuchen, He Yue and 2009 World Team Champion Zhang Zhiyang, as well as Pro Tour Paris Top 8 competitor Shintaro Ishimura, Pro Tour San Diego Top 8 competitor Yoshihiko Ikawa, as well as Pro Tour Battle for Zendikar Champion Takimura Kazuyuki.


Against all odds, Rich Hoaen and Mike Hron had won another Team Limited Grand Prix, this time with Craig Wescoe by their side. Quite literally, they had drowned all hopes in Beijing and each added yet another Grand Prix Champion Trophy to their mantle.


Hearty congratulations once again!

DAY 2 COVERAGE



The *Battle for Zendikar* ensues, this time in the historic city of Beijing. Regarded as one of the "Four Great Ancient Capitals of China", the capital city has enjoyed a prosperous history of more than 3000 years.


It has also been host to numerous Grand Prix, but for the first time ever, Team Limited will be utilized in China and hordes of competitors have made their way to the one of the Olympic Stadiums within the University of Science and Technology.


Now that the field of 271 teams has been whittled down to just 40, there is ample deck building space for the remaining 120 hopefuls. As we speak, they're tackling their second Sealed Pool of the weekend, and five additional rounds will take place before the cut to Top 4!


Keep your eyes peeled, as we bring you the action, live from Beijing!

DAY 1 COVERAGE



271 teams of three, totaling over 800 players, arrived in Beijing but none managed to emerge unscathed. In a rare twist, there are no undefeated teams here this weekend!


Wescoe/Hoaen/Hron were playing for that top honor when they reached 8-0 but were defeated by local heroes Ding/Jia/Xu. Along with top-seeded Saito/Tsumura/Takahashi and Ishimura/Ikawa/Takimura, only four teams remain at 8-1.



 Liu/Ji/Du and Benefel/LePine/Berkowitz ended at a rather unconventional score of 7-0-2, but should be happy to be ranked 5th and 6th going into Day 2.




 Many other teams are on their tails, including Yamamoto/Yukuhiro/Kitahara, Watanabe/Mihara/Ichikawa, as well as Kato/Yasooka/Kakumae, who sneaked in on tiebreakers as the 40th team!



A second round of Team Limited will take place tomorrow, before forty teams are reduced to just four. It's gonna be an exciting Sunday, at least for everyone here at Beijing!



 For the *Magic* aficionados who're still in search for additional action, you'll be pleased to know that Grand Prix Quebec is just about to begin! If you're still "Twitching" for some action (pun intended), perhaps you should [swing over for continued around-the-clock *Battle for Zendikar* action](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/gpqc15)!
