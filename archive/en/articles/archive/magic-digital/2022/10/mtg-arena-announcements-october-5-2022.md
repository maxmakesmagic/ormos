*Alchemy: Dominaria* Arrives Tomorrow!
======================================


![Alchemy: Dominaria logo](https://media.wizards.com/2022/images/daily/logo_alchemy_dominaria.png)


Reinforcements are arriving in the fight for the survival of Dominaria! *Alchemy: Dominaria* charges into the fray with 30 new digital-only cards featuring mechanics that will open new strategies as you face your competition. Take a look at [the *Alchemy: Dominaria* Card Image Gallery](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/card-image-gallery/alchemy-dominaria) and start planning your next deck build!


Pick Your Archetype and Prove It's the Best!
============================================


![The Ultimate Showdown event October 8–10](https://media.wizards.com/2022/images/daily/ultimate_showdown_2022_768.jpg)


The *Magic* player archetypes throwdown in *MTG Arena* to finally prove which is the best way to play! In The Ultimate Showdown event happening October 8–10, pick from four preconstructed decks representing four of the *Magic* player archetypes you'll find in the *Un-* sets: Timmy, the monster master; Johnny, the ingenious inventor; Spike, the relentless competitor; or Vorthos, the art and lore aficionado.


Plus, look for bundles in the *MTG Arena* Store that include avatars of each of these player archetypes, as well as space-ic lands and shock lands!

Five Cards to Be "Unrebalanced" for Historic
============================================


As part of the *Alchemy: Dominaria* game update, the original tabletop versions of these cards will be returned to Historic (once a rebalanced card rotates out of Alchemy and is only playable in Historic, we can balance solely around that):

*Streets of New Capenna* Rebalances
===================================


Several cards from the *Streets of New Capenna* set will be rebalanced to create a new take on that set's Limited format. Here are a few examples:


![Cabaretti Charm](https://media.wizards.com/2022/images/daily/en_2jgl2gz15ry.png)![Glittermonger](https://media.wizards.com/2022/images/daily/en_n23jl7k512z.png)![Ready to Rumble](https://media.wizards.com/2022/images/daily/en_6w1pwtnjz4z.png)
