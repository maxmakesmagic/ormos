As expected, there were multiple answers to [Tuesday's puzzle](/en/articles/archive/magic-puzzle-2003-01-21). Some are a little crazier than others. All of the solutions begin with:


1. Tap [Brushland](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brushland) and two other painlands for ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20160830042801im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless4.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20220123123600im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/green.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20220123123600im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/green.gif).
2. Play [Living Wish](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Living+Wish) and copy it with [Mirari](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mirari), leaving ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20220123123600im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/green.gif) in your mana pool.

From there, all that changes are the Wish targets. One of the targets must be used to either fix your mana or gain you life, and the other is used to win the game. Death from mana burn must also be taken into consideration. Here are the ten viable combinations we could find.
