By Mike McArtor




 Mike first played with Ice Age and became the copy editor for DailyMTG.com in December 2011. Before DailyMTG, he was an editor on D&D's Dragon magazine for four years. 









![Hundred-Handed One](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Hundred-Handed+One)**[Hundred-Handed One](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hundred-Handed+One)** – *Theros*. In Greek myth, the little-known [Hekatonkheires](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hekatonkheires) were three powerful giants who (originally) helped the Olympians overthrow the titans. Read about how these giants made it into Theros from both [Ethan Fleischer](http://www.wizards.com/Magic/magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/feature/263) and [Mark Rosewater](/en/articles/archive/making-magic/theroses-are-red-and-white-blue-black-and-green-part-1-2013-09-23). 
 


![Artisan's Sorrow](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Artisan%27s+Sorrow)**[Artisan's Sorrow](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Artisan%27s+Sorrow)** – *Theros*. From the [*Theros* Release Notes](/en/node/634966) : 
 You perform the actions stated on a card in sequence. For some spells and abilities, that means you'll scry last. For others, that means you'll scry and then perform other actions. 





![Fanatic of Mogis](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Fanatic+of+Mogis)**[Fanatic of Mogis](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fanatic+of+Mogis)** – *Theros*. From the [*Theros* Release Notes](/en/node/634966) : 
 Mana symbols in the text boxes of permanents you control don't count toward your devotion to any color. Hybrid mana symbols, monocolored hybrid mana symbols, and Phyrexian mana symbols do count toward your devotion to their color(s). 





![Hythonia the Cruel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Hythonia+the+Cruel)**[Hythonia the Cruel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hythonia+the+Cruel)** – *Theros*. From the [*Theros* Release Notes](/en/node/634966) : 
 Monstrous isn't an ability that a creature has. It's just something true about that creature. If the creature stops being a creature or loses its abilities, it will continue to be monstrous. An ability that triggers when a creature becomes monstrous won't trigger if that creature isn't on the battlefield when its monstrosity ability resolves. 





![Artisan of Forms](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Artisan+of+Forms)**[Artisan of Forms](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Artisan+of+Forms)** – *Theros*. From the [*Theros* Release Notes](/en/node/634966) : 
 Heroic abilities will resolve before the spell that caused them to trigger. Heroic abilities will trigger only once per spell, even if that spell targets the creature with the heroic ability multiple times. Heroic abilities won't trigger when a copy of a spell is created on the stack or when a spell's targets are changed to include a creature with a heroic ability.





![Heliod's Emissary](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Heliod%27s+Emissary)**[Heliod's Emissary](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Heliod%27s+Emissary)** – *Theros*. From the [*Theros* Release Notes](/en/node/634966) : 
 Unlike other Aura spells, an Aura spell with bestow isn't countered if its target is illegal as it begins to resolve. Rather, the effect making it an Aura spell ends, it loses enchant creature, it returns to being an enchantment creature spell, and it resolves and enters the battlefield as an enchantment creature.
