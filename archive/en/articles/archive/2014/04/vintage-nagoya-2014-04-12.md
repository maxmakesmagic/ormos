It's the Cadillac of constructed formats, where **Magic**'s oldest and most powerful cards come out to play. Unfortunately, those cards are also some of the game's most scarce, and therefore command a staggering price tag. That goes double for Japan, so you might suspect that Vintage would be all but ignored here. I certainly thought so, but the interest is here, and growing!

As evidence, TokyoMTG hosted a tournament on Friday. They didn't expect to meet their cap of thirty-two players, but the event sold out well in advance. The field ran the gamut from seasoned Vintage ringers to absolute novices. There were prizes for the Top 3 (Unlimited [Mox Pearl](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mox+Pearl) to the winner!) as well as a [Plateau](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plateau) given out to the highest-placing unpowered player, one whose deck featured none of the iconic Power 9.


In the end, Kazuya Shinmura emerged victorious. Take a look at this beauty.
