Luis Scott-Vargas plays, writes, and makes videos about Magic. He has played on the Pro Tour for almost a decade, and between that and producing content for ChannelFireball, often has his hands full (of cards). 







If I were to name the most powerful Standard card that isn't seeing much play, [Prophet of Kruphix](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Prophet+of+Kruphix) might just be at the top of the list. The Prophet doubles your mana and lets you play almost every card at instant speed, so to see it languish on the sidelines is very strange to me. Luckily, Ben Seck has a sweet and profitable brew for us, and it's not just any Ben Seck either: it's The Ben Seck, or TBS, as he's known. 


![Prime Speaker Zegana](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Prime+Speaker+Zegana)
 TBS has been testing various devotion decks, all of which involve Prophet, and after getting trounced in an eight-player queue by him on **Magic Online**, I threw together my take on his decklist. The focus isn't quite as strongly on devotion as some versions of the deck, which the lack of [Burning-Tree Emissary](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Burning-Tree+Emissary) and less-than-four Nykthos can attest to. What it does do is maximize how much mana Prophet generates, turn that mana into cards, and repeat the process until the opponent is dead. 


 Since this is a ramp deck at its core, we should start at the bottom. The full twelve accelerants are what let you get away with all the expensive cards, and the mana fixing on Caryatid and Satyr is especially important here. Other devotion decks only splash the second color, whereas this deck not only plays ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161115194122im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/blue.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161115194122im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/blue.gif) and ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161115194122im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/blue.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161115194122im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/blue.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161115194122im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/blue.gif) spells, it has a third color in the deck as well! 



[Jace, Architect of Thought](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace%2C+Architect+of+Thought) is one of the best cards to accelerate out on turn three, and the combination of Jace and [Sylvan Caryatid](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sylvan+Caryatid) to protect it is very effective. The curve goes right on up past Jace and Polukranos at four, with Prophet and Colossus at five, Ætherling at essentially seven, and [Sphinx's Revelation](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sphinx%27s+Revelation) at any number you can name. These blue cards are a huge draw, and help shore up difficult control matchups while putting any sort of long game out of reach for aggro or midrange. In fact, when I played against TBS, I thought I had the game locked up with my RWU deck. Unfortunately, TBS slammed an Ætherling and I found myself staring down the barrel of an enemy [Shapeshifter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shapeshifter), which did not end well for me. 



[Detention Sphere](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Detention+Sphere) and [Cyclonic Rift](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cyclonic+Rift) are a concession to the opponent Doing Things, which is something that happens from time to time. They are both flexible, which is exactly what you want when you only have a couple slots for this kind of effect. Rift even ramps up nicely, which fits the theme of the deck perfectly.
