After [Bearscape](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bearscape) was made [green instead of black](/en/articles/archive/bearscape-dead-2002-01-22) and created Bears instead of Zombies, R&D had to come up with a name for it. Below is R&D's list of names that, once you read it, you'll be glad weren't used.

It is interesting to note that [Grizzly Fate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grizzly+Fate) was used in *Judgment* and [Animal Magnetism](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Animal+Magnetism) in *Onslaught*. Don't expect a card called "Bear Supply" anytime soon, however.
