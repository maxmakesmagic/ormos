With Toy Fair happening last Friday and *Modern Masters 2017 Edition* previews starting next week, there's a ton of information out there already—information that we need to shoot down your brain hole today. So let's not spend a ton of time reading my words and instead get right to the pretty pictures of things you can pick up soon.


*Modern Masters 2017 Edition* Packaging
=======================================


First up is the packaging for *Modern Masters* *2017 Edition*, just like that section header right above this says. You're going to recognize some of these, but we're going to preview them next week anyway. I'm not so self-absorbed that I think everyone will read everything I write and will know what these are come next week. Though they should. Because I'm great.

*Amonkhet* Packaging
====================


Toy Fair released a bundle of information last Friday. First up are *Amonkhet* booster pack images, none of which you will or should recognize. Because they're new!

And when you show up at a Prerelease, you'll get one of these:

We'll also have Bundles!

Altogether, it will look like this. Look for more information on *Amonkhet* when previews start April 3 (with a special article March 27 as well).


*Amonkhet* Planeswalker Decks
=============================


Oh, right, we also showed these off. The Planeswalker Decks of *Amonkhet*, featuring versions of Gideon and Liliana.

Let's take a closer look at those two face cards (without text):

*Amonkhet* Basic Lands
======================


Finally, we announced full-art basic lands as part of some in-store promotions last week, but that's not the only place you'll find them—you can also get them in *Amonkhet* booster packs! Full-art basic lands will appear in approximately one out of every four boosters and will be available in other products as well.

*Archenemy: Nicol Bolas*
========================


Want to fight against Nicol Bolas himself? Or maybe you want to play as the dastardly Dragon yourself to take on three friends at once? Either way, Toy Fair provided an early look at the packaging for this cool product (which releases in June).

Sweet *Amonkhet* Art
====================


Finally, you might have also seen some cool *Amonkhet* art—or if you haven't you might see it soon.


Or you might just see it right now. For the time being, we'll just show it without context and let you enjoy how fantastic it looks. Enjoy!
