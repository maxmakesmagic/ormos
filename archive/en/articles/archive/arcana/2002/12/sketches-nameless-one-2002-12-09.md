This week's "Sketches" looks at one of the *Onslaught* Avatars, [Nameless One](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nameless+One) by Mark Tedin.


### 1. Art Description


These are the instructions given to the artist:


"Location: Breaker Bay   
 Action: Floating head Avatar. The Avatar is made of energy and should resemble the ultimate Wizard, in this case a large, floating head (the face should look stern, wise, and powerful).   
 Notes: Avatar Cycle. Not flying. For the floating head, we were thinking the great and powerful Oz, the mirror from Disney's *Snow White*, etc.,--not Gandalf."


### 2. Sketch


This is the preliminary sketch submitted by Mark. The Wizard is shown as a waterspout and is clearly not flying.


### 3. Final Art


Here is a large version of the final piece. The lightning in the eyes was added at the art department's request to make it seem more like a Wizard. The human and Cephlaid in the foreground were added for perspective.


### 4. Card


Finally, here is the card as it appears in the set.
