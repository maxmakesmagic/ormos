Ben was wielding the deck he co-designed with Brian Kibler, while Jay was playing a mono-black variant including a healthy complement of [Caustic Tar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Caustic+Tar)s, [Morbid Hunger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Morbid+Hunger)s and [Nantuko Shade](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nantuko+Shade)s.

### Game 1

Jay won the coin toss and elected to play first. The first few turns were uneventful with Elarar casting a [Diabolic Tutor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Diabolic+Tutor) on turn four and Ben laying down his [Shadowblood Egg](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shadowblood+Egg). Jay cast [Caustic Tar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Caustic+Tar) followed by [Mind Sludge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mind+Sludge); Ben discarded [Chainer's Edict](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chainer%27s+Edict), [Circular Logic](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Circular+Logic), [Aether Burst](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aether+Burst), [Cephalid Looter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cephalid+Looter) and [Psychatog](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psychatog). The Canadian continued with two [Morbid Hunger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Morbid+Hunger)s to leave Rubin at seven life. The [Caustic Tar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Caustic+Tar) got him down to four. Jay laid a Swamp and attempted to flashback [Morbid Hunger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Morbid+Hunger), Ben countered with [Circular Logic](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Circular+Logic), but the Tar was too much for him.

### Game 2

![](http://magic.wizards.com/sites/mtg/files/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/ptosa02/a909.jpg)Rubin started out with a fourth turn [Compulsion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Compulsion). Jay tried to cast [Mirari](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mirari), but Ben responded with a [Circular Logic](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Circular+Logic). The San Franciscan Diverted Elarar's [Mind Sludge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mind+Sludge) making him discard four cards. Rubin discarded his [Violent Eruption](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Violent+Eruption) to [Compulsion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Compulsion) and dealt four to Jay. Elarar once again attempted to [Mind Sludge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mind+Sludge) Rubin, but Ben had ample cards in his graveyard to fuel a [Circular Logic](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Circular+Logic). Jay cast [Haunting Echoes](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Haunting+Echoes) targeting Ben, Rubin responded with a [Circular Logic](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Circular+Logic) for 12, which Elarar paid, then the two-time Master's Champion responded with a [Divert](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Divert), and Elarar promptly scooped.

### Game 3

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/ptosa02/a908.jpg)With twenty minutes left on the clock, the two decided they needed to speed up their play a little bit going into the final game. Jay elected to play first, and Rubin was forced to mulligan his opening hand. Elarar started out with two [Tainted Pact](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tainted+Pact)s, getting a [Haunting Echoes](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Haunting+Echoes) and a [Mind Sludge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mind+Sludge). He then cast [Rancid Earth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rancid+Earth) on Ben's only blue source forcing Ben to cast [Skeletal Scrying](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skeletal+Scrying) for one in desperation to try and [Divert](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Divert) either of Jay's spells. His efforts were futile, and Jay took out a good portion of Ben's power spells, including [Upheaval](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Upheaval), [Chainer's Edict](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chainer%27s+Edict), [Skeletal Scrying](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skeletal+Scrying), [Divert](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Divert) and [Compulsion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Compulsion). Ben was left with a Mountain and [Shadowblood Ridge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shadowblood+Ridge) in play with [Fiery Temper](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fiery+Temper) and [Divert](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Divert) in his hand. He drew an Island to give him a bit better footing on the game. Jay cast [Mirari](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mirari), then cast [Tainted Pact](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tainted+Pact) twice, getting [Nantuko Shade](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nantuko+Shade) and Swamp. The next turn Elarar cast [Diabolic Tutor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Diabolic+Tutor) twice, and then [Rancid Earth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rancid+Earth) twice killing both of Ben's islands. Jay attacked for five with the shade leaving been at 12 life. The situation looking grim for Ben as Elarar had 15 activations of [Nantuko Shade](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nantuko+Shade) on the stack, he said, "So, they're all on the stack, and if I had a [Fiery Temper](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fiery+Temper) or something that would be really good here." He didn't so he scooped.
