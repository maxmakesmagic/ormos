Do you like *Magic*?


Of course you do, that's why you're reading this!


Do you like watching things on your screen?


Of course you do, you're reading something on a screen right now!


Do you like watching *Magic*?


Probably! Watching *Magic* is the next best thing to playing *Magic*.


How about watching some of the most popular *Magic* streamers playing the Holiday Cube on *Magic Online* today on Twitch.tv? Is that something you might be interested in?


Of course it is!


This month marks the first episode of a monthly streaming program we're calling Streamer Showdowns that features two eight-player Draft pods boasting a number of popular streamers battling with one of the latest *Magic Online* setsâ€”in this case, the Holiday Cube.


Don't know what the [Holiday Cube](http://magic.wizards.com/en/MTGO/articles/archive/magic-online/holiday-cube-updates-2015-06-22) is? It's a Cube featuring the most powerful cards in *Magic*'s history, including [Black Lotus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Black+Lotus), [Ancestral Recall](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ancestral+Recall), and, a personal favorite, [Vedalken Shackles](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vedalken+Shackles) (which is basically unbeatable).


This month, the streamers showing down include a bevy of popular streamers, Pro Tour competitors, Grand Prix winners, the melodious voice of Pro Tour coverage, professional funny people, several bastions of the community, and also Frank Lepore! (We kid because we love you, Frank.) Check out the times they'll all be streaming:
