Fabrizio Anteri has been on a tear. In May he completed his 3-2-1 in Warsaw, by finishing 3rd, 2nd, then 1st at successive European Grand Prix events. This Venezuelan-by-way-of-Italy-currently-living-in-England player has been making his mark on the European Grand Prix circuit as an opponent to be feared. And that's saying something in Europe. They fear nothing.


He's on the Jeskai deck today, as he was playing the colors at the Pro Tour. "You can just play control with burn spells," Anteri said. "There are so many ways to just go bigger than everyone else."


"No I don't like it," Anteri said as he shipped his first seven cards back into his library.


"I probably did," Brad Nelson said, "It would've been good for me." Nelson is a name that needs little introduction. The former Player of the Year is a known Standard specialist and places highly at each Standard Grand Prix he attends. He's on an innovative Mardu Midrange deck that he Valentin Mackl and Patrick Dickmann are all playing.



 Unlike many [Butcher of the Horde](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Butcher+of+the+Horde) builds, they are eschewing cards like [Raise the Alarm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Raise+the+Alarm) and [Stoke the Flames](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stoke+the+Flames), even though they are playing [Goblin Rabblemaster](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Rabblemaster) and [Hordeling Outburst](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hordeling+Outburst). They plan to go into longer games, and often, their opponents, who have tested similar decks, play around cards that aren't even there.



After mulligans, they got to it.



**The Games**




 In the first game Nelson's deck did exactly what it was supposed toâ€”one-for-one trading with slight upsides. [Seeker of the Way](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seeker+of+the+Way) was pumped repeatedly, and Anteri was spending his entire turn answering things like [Hordeling Outburst](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hordeling+Outburst). For example, [Chained to the Rocks](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chained+to+the+Rocks) on Anteri's second [Mantis Rider](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mantis+Rider) was a low-mana way to remove an imposing threat, while still leaving enough lands to do something productive.




 "You have three cards?" Nelson asked. He used [Hordeling Outburst](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hordeling+Outburst) to get a little presence on the board. Each player went back and forth countering or killing each other's spells, but Nelson was getting the better end each time. [End Hostilities](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=End+Hostilities) from Anteri against three Goblin tokens was a net win. Tapping out with not presence of his own wasn't the way Anteri would win this game.
