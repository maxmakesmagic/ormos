The Daily *Magic* Update is a roundup of everything *Magic* you should know on December 12, 2016. Today's Update is brought to you by a [Consulate Crackdown](#4).


What You Might Have Missed This Weekend
=======================================


1. [Grand Prix Milwaukee Top 5 Moments](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/gpmil16/top-5-moments-2016-12-11) | Wizards of the Coast | Corbin Hosler

There's a ton of coverage you could sift through from Grand Prix Milwaukee, but if you've only got a few minutes, the Top 5 Moments piece has got you covered. From Matt Severa's continued strong performance, the dominance of Team East-West Bowl, Corey Burkhart's breakout performance, and an underdog winning the whole thing.


1. [In Response: Masters Sets, New UN-Set, and Commander Control - A Magic The Gathering Debate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrLbcG7zqRo) | Tolarian Community College | The Professor and Josh Lee Kwai

The second episode of this debate-style *Magic* talk show aired on Friday, but it's worth a watch at pretty much any time, if for no other reason than the introduction and Josh Lee Kwai's sunglasses look.


1. [MTG – Top 10 Best Standard Cards of 2016 for Magic: The Gathering!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsyvIhTjQ-w) | The Mana Source | Wedge

The year is nearing its conclusion, and Wedge takes the opportunity to count down the 10 best cards of 2016. However, Neither [Cloudblazer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloudblazer) nor [Panharmonicon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Panharmonicon) made the list, so I'm not sure how seriously I should take it. But go ahead and watch it anyway, because it's kind of great regardless.

After Those, Read, Watch, or Listen to These
============================================

Another Monday, another *Aether Revolt* preview card. This one is called Consulate Crackdown in English, and it represents when the Consulate, well, cracks down on the people of *Kaladesh*. There's been some question on the exact translation of the card, so I figured we'd just show you the card in English to answer all your translation questions:

1. [*Magic* Puzzles](http://www.starcitygames.com/article/34184_Magic-Puzzles.html) | StarCityGames.com | Jennifer Long

There's been a bit of talk lately about *Magic* as a puzzle-solving exercise; not as a "find a way to win before the end of the turn" kind of puzzle, but a "what's the best play" kind of puzzle. Jennifer takes a long look at a few scenarios and asks you, gentle reader, to solve the puzzles she puts before you.

1. Wizards Account Holders will be getting an *Aether Revolt* preview card on December 19. Don't have a Wizards Account? Sign up at [accounts.wizards.com](https://accounts.wizards.com/). Do have a Wizards Account? Well, um, good job. You're all set.

*Vintage Cube* early?! Happy Holidays to me. And some other people, I suppose. But also to me.

SandyDog, if you aren't aware, is [Brandon Burton](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/ptbfz/the-best-team-at-the-pro-tour-2015-10-16), a longtime *Magic* *Online* grinder, strong player, and has one of [the best stories](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/ptbfz/the-best-team-at-the-pro-tour-2015-10-16) on the Pro Tour. It's always good to see Burton doing well, and after his performance this past weekend, we'll be seeing him at Pro Tour *Amonkhet*!

They got engaged at a *Magic* event, so it's only right that we celebrate the nuptials of Hall of Fame Pro Eric Froehlich and *Magic* streamer Athena Huey. [He proposed](https://youtu.be/q72cRP91xLM?t=15m52s) when he was inducted into the Hall in 2015, and now they've sealed the deal. Congratulations to the happy couple!


Deck of the Day
===============


1. Life and Taxes

This Standard Showdown brew takes a lot of cards that have shown promise but never quite gotten there—plus a few all-stars—and puts together a synergistic, grindy black and white deck capable of grinding with the best of them.


Check out some of the synergies the deck has going for it. [Ayli, Eternal Pilgrim](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ayli%2C+Eternal+Pilgrim) works best with sacrifice fodder and lifegain, and this deck has both in spades. [Accursed Witch](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Accursed+Witch) sacrifices nicely, turning into lifegain after the fact. [Eternal Scourge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eternal+Scourge), [Relentless Dead](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Relentless+Dead), and [Scrapheap Scrounger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scrapheap+Scrounger) all have ways of returning to play—[Eternal Scourge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eternal+Scourge) even feeds [Scrapheap Scrounger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scrapheap+Scrounger) to do so.


And several of the cards are effective for the current metagame, especially against vehicles. [Kambal, Consul of Allocation](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kambal%2C+Consul+of+Allocation) triggers if opponents play Vehicles, [Authority of the Consuls](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Authority+of+the+Consuls) stops players from crewing vehicles with newly cast creatures, and Authority is even strong against the ever-present [Ishkanah, Grafwidow](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ishkanah%2C+Grafwidow) and [Emrakul, the Promised End](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Emrakul%2C+the+Promised+End). Plus, it helps that it makes it harder to be ambushed by [Torrential Gearhulk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Torrential+Gearhulk) and [Avacyn](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=409741).


It's a well-put together deck and looks like a blast to play. I would highly recommend trying this out at the final Standard Showdown this Saturday.
