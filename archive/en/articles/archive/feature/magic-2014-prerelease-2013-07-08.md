Previews are done and the full set is public, you can go check it out in the [***Magic** 2014* Card Image Gallery](http://www.wizards.com/magic/tcg/article.aspx?x=mtg/tcg/magic2014coreset/cig). This weekend, July 13-14, 2013, is the Prerelease for the new set, and in case this is the first Prerelease for you - here are a few good things to know.

So important, it's number zero on my list! Not every store will be taking preregistrations for the Prerelease, but if they are it's always a good idea to sign up ahead of time and save your spot. This ensures you don't miss out in case it fills up before you arrive the morning of the event!


### 1. Have Fun


Prerelease events are meant to be two important things to players. Firstly, they're meant to be the very first opportunity for players to play with Magic's newest cards. Secondly they're meant to be fun and relaxed events!

Normally during a tournament helping other players build their deck is forbidden, but during Prereleases because of the new cards and mechanics, rather than forbid it - we encourage players to help each other during deck building. Maybe your friend sees a card combo you missed, or maybe you're not sure what your twenty-third card should be.


### 3. Change your deck


Throughout a normal tournament, your deck should remain the same, including de-sideboarding between rounds. But at a Prerelease decks are much more amorphous, you might add a card after a game and discover it's way better than you realized. Well, during the Prerelease you can keep it in! Or maybe after the first or second round you decide to change your deck up, maybe you see a friend playing Blue and you recognize a few cards you're not playing - you can completely change your deck between rounds!
