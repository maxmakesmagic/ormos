Many, many things in **Magic** have changed since the days of Alpha, but one constant has been with us the whole way -- the cardback.

A new cardback was designed for *Arabian Nights* (we'll get into that later), but the decision was made to keep things uniform, and that decision has been a good one. But recently, a change was almost inadvertently made…

See anything weird with this card?

Well, the subtle difference is that someone here decided the word "Deckmaster" needed to be trademarked, without thinking of the ramifications the change would have on the game, namely that players could cheat by using lands that didn't have the extra trademark and spells that did, or vice versa.

Granted, the change was attempted with the best intentions. But luckily our "quality control" also has the best intentions, and the change was never implemented. The cardback is eternal.
