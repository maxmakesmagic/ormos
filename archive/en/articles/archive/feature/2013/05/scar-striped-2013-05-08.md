When I cracked my Prerelease pack a few weeks ago I was excited to see [Varolz, the Scar-Striped](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Varolz%2C+the+Scar-Striped) amongst my rares. He ended up being an utter beast during my matches. Between sacrificing my creatures to regenerate him, and then scavenging them to make him stronger, I spent a lot of time looking at him and his art.

Â 

Now it's your turn! Here is the art description from which [Adam Paquette](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&artist=+%5B%22Adam+Paquette%22) drew Varolz, Below the art description you'll get to see both the sketch and the final art.


**Color:** Black Green Legendary creature (Golgari guild)  
**Location:** Golgari turf  
**Action:** Show Varolz the Golgari troll, chosen to represent the Guild in the Dragon's Maze. He's who the Golgari call upon when there is real danger. Varolz has a symbiotic fungi living on him that repairs his wounds, replacing his skin with tough scar tissue which means that the more battles he's in, the tougher he gets. He has a wicked looking knife and some totemic Golgari charms on him. Varolz is about 12-15 feet tall.  
**Focus:** Varolz the Scar-Striped.  
**Mood:** Tough and battle hardened.
