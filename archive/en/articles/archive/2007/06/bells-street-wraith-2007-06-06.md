[Street Wraith](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Street+Wraith)—thinning decks and enabling graveyard strategies for zero mana since 2007—is an undead menace from a possible future setting. A wraith in **Magic** is a spectral undead, often shown wearing a hooded cloak that partially obscures its face (or lack thereof).


Note that [Street Wraith](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Street+Wraith) wears bells that dangle from its cloak. If you look closely, you can see that the bells are very sinister in shape and origin. Mouse over the image below to enhance the detail of one of the wraith's bells.

*Street Wraith art by Cyril van Der Haegen*
As you can see in the full art, [Street Wraith](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Street+Wraith) bears many of these skull-bells. They were an invention of the artist, Cyril Van Der Haegen, and really serve to add depth and menace to the wraith's character. Nice work, Cyril!
