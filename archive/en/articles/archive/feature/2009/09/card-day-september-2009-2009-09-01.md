![Hedron Crab](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Hedron+Crab)**[Hedron Crab](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hedron+Crab)** – *Zendikar* uncommon. The mysterious monoliths found floating above Zendikar (and occasionally being investigated by crabs) are called hedrons. They're the remnants of a lost civilization, but their original purpose is unknown.
 ![Into the Roil](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Into+the+Roil)**[Into the Roil](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Into+the+Roil)** – *Zendikar* common. The Roil is the name residents of Zendikar have given to the terrain's tendency to shudder, writhe, and erupt. The Roil can cause unpredictable winds, whirlpools, and even unexpected mountains to show up in inconvenient places!
 ![Stonework Puma](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Stonework+Puma)**[Stonework Puma](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stonework+Puma)** – *Zendikar* common. [Stonework Puma](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stonework+Puma) might look like "another vanilla Gray Ogre", but its ability is hidden in the creature types. In the right deck, a vanilla Ally can cause all sorts of havoc!
 ![Harrow](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Harrow)**[Harrow](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Harrow)** – *Zendikar* common. When [Harrow](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Harrow) was first created back in the days of *Tempest*, its playtest name was "Crop Rotation". That name was removed, but it came back as [Crop Rotation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Crop%2BRotation) in *Urza's Legacy*.
 ![Brooding Saurian](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Brooding+Saurian)**[Brooding Saurian](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brooding+Saurian)** – *Coldsnap* rare. The "brooding" in the name of [Brooding Saurian](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brooding+Saurian) does not mean that it's thinking anxiously or moodily about something, but that it's taking care of its offspring, or "brood".
 ![Panic Attack](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Panic+Attack)**[Panic Attack](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Panic+Attack)** – ***Magic** 2010* common. The massive jaws in the art for [Panic Attack](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Panic+Attack) are strictly imaginary! Check the flavor text, which explains that the enormous rows of teeth are just a panic-induced hallucination on the part of the person in the center of the art.
 ![Gargoyle Castle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Gargoyle+Castle)**[Gargoyle Castle](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gargoyle+Castle)** – ***Magic** 2010* rare. It's pretty rare for a card to create a 3/4 token. How rare? The only other two we can think of are [Stangg](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stangg) and [Gemini Engine](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gemini+Engine)!
 ![Etched Oracle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Etched+Oracle)**[Etched Oracle](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Etched+Oracle)** – *Fifth Dawn* uncommon. Ever wonder exactly what [Etched Oracle](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Etched+Oracle) is prophecying? Clearly it's the dawn of the fifth sun, as seen in the oracle's orb. After all, when you summon him, you can only use the four mana that exist before [All Suns' Dawn](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=All+Suns%27+Dawn)!
 ![Hua Tuo, Honored Physician](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Hua+Tuo%2C+Honored+Physician)**[Hua Tuo, Honored Physician](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hua+Tuo%2C+Honored+Physician)** – *Portal Three Kingdoms* rare. Hua Tuo's legendary medical skills (he may have been the first doctor in China to use anesthetic) are represented in *Portal Three Kingdoms* with the ability to bring people back from the brink of death. In fact, he can bring people back who died several turns earlier!
 ![High Tide](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=High+Tide)**[High Tide](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=High+Tide)** – *Fallen Empires* common. When *Fallen Empires* first came out in 1994, [High Tide](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=High+Tide) was widely considered a useless common. It took four years (and *Urza's Saga*) to bring out [High Tide](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=High+Tide)'s power, and it went directly from "chaff" to "completely broken".
 ![Horned Turtle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Horned+Turtle)**[Horned Turtle](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Horned+Turtle)** – ***Magic** 2010* common. There are [five non-changeling turtles](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?action=advanced&subtype=+%5Bturtle%5D) in **Magic**. Does it seem strange to you that the one that's been reprinted the most is the only vanilla one?
 ![Hedge Troll](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Hedge+Troll)**[Hedge Troll](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hedge+Troll)** – *Planar Chaos* uncommon. [Hedge Troll](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hedge+Troll) is the planeshifted version of [Sedge Troll](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sedge+Troll), but did you ever notice that the flavor text also mirrors its Sedge sibling? [Hedge Troll](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hedge+Troll) lives in a clean place and eats nothing; [Sedge Troll](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sedge+Troll) is in a smelly hovel and eats everything!
 ![Horned Troll](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Horned+Troll)**[Horned Troll](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Horned+Troll)** – *Mercadian Masques* common. The art for the *Mercadian Masques* version of [Horned Troll](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Horned+Troll) does not, at a casual glance, look like a troll. But in the flavor text, [Squee, Goblin Nabob](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Squee%252C%2BGoblin%2BNabob) assures us that it is. And who are we to argue with Squee?
 ![Carnivorous Death-Parrot](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Carnivorous+Death-Parrot)**[Carnivorous Death-Parrot](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Carnivorous+Death-Parrot)** – *Unhinged* common. The flavor text for the [Carnivorous Death-Parrot](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Carnivorous+Death-Parrot) is carefully crafted to conflict with a number of other *Unhinged* cards, like [Creature Guy](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Creature+Guy) and [Kill! Destroy!](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kill%21+Destroy%21). If you're curious, the [*Unhinged* FAQ](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/TCG/Article.aspx?x=magic/faq/unhinged) says you can't use sign language to get around the "speaking" part.
 ![Mishras War Machine](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Mishras+War+Machine)**[Mishra's War Machine](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mishra%27s+War+Machine)** – *Antiquities* rare. For the [2000 **Magic** Invitational](http://www.wizards.com/sideboard/event.asp?event=mi00) in Sydney, Australia, Mark Rosewater presented players with a variety of [recosted cards](http://www.wizards.com/sideboard/article.asp?x=mi00%5C988dupmaster). He put [Mishra's War Machine](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mishra%27s+War+Machine) at ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20170413132456im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless5.gif), hoping that half the players would play it. And exactly half did!
 ![Famine](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Famine)**[Famine](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Famine)** – *Portal Three Kingdoms* uncommon. The flavor text for [Famine](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Famine) refers to "people reduced to eating leaves of jujube trees". The jujube in question is a date tree native to China and should not be confused with the gummy candy popular in movie theaters.
 ![Pestilence](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Pestilence)**[Pestilence](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pestilence)** – *Limited Edition Alpha* common. Back in the Scary Old Days of **Magic** rules, there was a time when [Pestilence](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pestilence) could be activated in batches instead of only one activation at a time. This meant that someone with a [Circle of Protection: Black](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Circle+of+Protection%3A+Black) could activate [Pestilence](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pestilence) with six mana and prevent the damage with one mana on the [Circle of Protection: Black](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Circle%2Bof%2BProtection%253A%2BBlack)!
 ![Whiplash Trap](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Whiplash+Trap)**[Whiplash Trap](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Whiplash+Trap)** – *Zendikar* common. [Whiplash Trap](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Whiplash+Trap) is one of the four *Zendikar* preview cards included in *Planechase* decks (it's in Metallic Dreams, if you're curious). We bring this up because it provides the perfect transition from *Planechase* week to the *Zendikar* previews, which will start on Monday, September 7. Can't wait!
 ![Nefashu](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Nefashu)**[Nefashu](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nefashu)** – *Scourge* rare. We haven't talked much about the **Magic** cards included with the *Planechase* decks, but they're frequently interesting. And each one has *eight* rares! More relevantly to today's card of the day, this Zombie Mutant from *Scourge* is in the Zombie Empire deck.
 ![Castle Sengir](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Castle+Sengir)**[Castle Sengir](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Castle+Sengir)** – *Homelands* uncommon. The *Planechase* plane card [The Dark Barony](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/images/daily/arcana/264_thedarkbarony_086z4dobfy.jpg) is set in the demesne of [Baron Sengir](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Baron+Sengir) and a careful examination of the architecture reveals that it's drawn from the point of view of someone standing on [Castle Sengir](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Castle+Sengir) itself. It helped that the Barony was illustrated by Pete Venters, who did the Baron, the Castle, and even [Grandmother Sengir](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Grandmother%2BSengir)!
 ![Narcomoeba](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Narcomoeba)**[Narcomoeba](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Narcomoeba)** – *Future Sight* uncommon. Ever wonder where the creepy jellyfish-like [Narcomoeba](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Narcomoeba) comes from? The *Planechase* plane card [The Aether Flues](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/images/daily/arcana/264_theaetherflues_086z4dobfy.jpg) suggests that the answer is "Iquatana"!
