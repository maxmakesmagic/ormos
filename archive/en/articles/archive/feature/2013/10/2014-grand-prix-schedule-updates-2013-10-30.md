There have been two date and format changes for the 2014 Grand Prix schedule that we want to call out for any players who are currently planning on attending either Grand Prix Milan or Grand Prix Utrecht.

Grand Prix Milan was originally scheduled for August and was going to be a Standard event; we have moved this event to be June 27–29, 2014, and it will be *Theros* Block Sealed/Draft.

Grand Prix Utrecht was originally scheduled in June as a *Theros* Block Sealed/Draft event and will now take place on August 8–10, 2014; it will be a Standard format event.

All venue information remains the same for both events.
