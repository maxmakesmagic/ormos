**Name:** Jack Kiefer


**Hometown:** Boulder, CO


**Occupation:** Student


**Previous Magic Accomplishments:**


I got to Pro Tour before my brothers.

UW Gift. It is a deck that I have played before as a metagame call and I thought this was the perfect time to bring it out.


**What was the best card in your main deck and why?**


[Champion of Wits](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Champion+of+Wits). It does everything the deck wants to do.

Turn 4 Gift?

**Name:** Scott Matthews


**Hometown:** Kalamazoo, MI


**Occupation:** Warranty Technician


**Previous Magic Accomplishments:**


Top 8d RPTQ Dominaria


**What deck did you play this weekend, and why?**


UB Control, because it has a good matchup against red and has more consistent mana than Esper.


**What was the best card in your main deck and why?**


[The Scarab God](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=The+Scarab+God), because it provides a fast clock against aggro and doubles the effectiveness of my Gearhulks against control.


**What was your most interesting play this weekend?**


I used a [Torrential Gearhulk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Torrential+Gearhulk) to cast the Memory half of [Commit // Memory](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Commit+%2F%2F+Memory) in response to a [Refurbish](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Refurbish) targeting [God-Pharaoh's Gift](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=God-Pharaoh%27s+Gift).

Everything.

**Name:** Paul Dean


**Hometown:** Toronto


**Occupation:** Tax Accountant


**Previous Magic Accomplishments:**


1 PT Top 8, 4 GP Top 8s


**What deck did you play this weekend, and why?**


BR Chainwhirler. It is very difficult for other decks to sideboard against and beat both the aggressive and midrange side of BR.


**What was the best card in your main deck and why?**


[Goblin Chainwhirler](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Chainwhirler). It is a [Plague Wind](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plague+Wind) + repeated [Lightning Strike](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Strike) + [Moat](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Moat), all in one.


**What was your most interesting play this weekend?**


A situation where I held a [Chandra's Defeat](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chandra%27s+Defeat) for several turns, until they tried to [Chandra's Defeat](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chandra%27s+Defeat) my Hazoret with a [Soul-Scar Mage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soul-Scar+Mage) in play. I killed the mage in response for a very profitable exchange.


**What would winning GP Pittsburgh mean to you?**


It would mean I could afford to buy my own [Goblin Chainwhirler](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Chainwhirler)s, from Face to Face Games in Toronto - conveniently located near Woodbine Station - visit them for all your hobby needs!

**Occupation:** Robotics Engineer


**Previous Magic Accomplishments:**


4th, GP Montreal 2016


1st, GP Toronto 2018


9th, PT Dominaria


**What deck did you play this weekend, and why?**


RB Chainwhirler. Been tuning BW Benalia for two months, but finally realized it just wasn't as good. Took the easy way out.


**What was the best card in your main deck and why?**


Bomat, because Paul Dean told me not to play it.


**What was your most interesting play this weekend?**


Flipping [Glorybringer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glorybringer) off Chandra on camera.


**What would winning GP Pittsburgh mean to you?**


Last 6 weeks have already been incredible. Another win would have me looking for some sort of alternate dimension nonsense. It would lock for Gold which would be so insane.

Uhm . . . I won a PPTQ to the Pro Tour I was just invited to.

Mono-Red Aggro, I've been playing it for a while, and I think it's by far the best deck.


**What was the best card in your main deck and why?**


[Bomat Courier](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bomat+Courier), [Scavenger Grounds](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scavenger+Grounds). They both won me a few games.

Esper Control, I love [Torrential Gearhulk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Torrential+Gearhulk) and Teferi


**What was the best card in your main deck and why?**


I think [Torrential Gearhulk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Torrential+Gearhulk) was the most clutch this weekend, but Teferi is the best card overall and it's not close.

Beating multiple [Knight of Grace](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Knight+of+Grace)s and Arguel's Bloodfast out of Black-[White Knight](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=White+Knight)s with [Dynavolt Tower](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dynavolt+Tower)s.

Exposure for my store, RIW, and my podcast, Turn1Thoughtseize.
