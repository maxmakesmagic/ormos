![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/arcana/927_cubebooster.jpg)Ever since Cube hit **Magic Online**, it's been a hit. We've iterated on the card list a few times with some sweeping changes during *Gatecrash* and now it's coming back with just a few updates from *Dragon's Maze*.


Starting when **Magic Online** returns from downtime on July 17, 2013, you'll be able to join **Magic Online** Cube events. For the prize payout, players will receive *Rize of the Eldrazi* booster packs!


Triple *Rise of the Eldrazi* is among my favorite Draft formats ever so I'm excited to see the Draft queues in **Magic Online**.


The four card changes to the cube are as follows:
