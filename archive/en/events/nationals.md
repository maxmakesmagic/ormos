NATIONALS
=========

















OVERVIEW
--------


Do you have what it takes to represent your country against the rest of the world? Nationals pits your nation’s best against one another in one big tournament, with the finalists of the event earning an invitation to the World *Magic* Cup to represent their country battle for the ultimate national bragging rights.


The World *Magic* Cup is an annual *Magic* event, gathering representatives from nations all over the world to compete in a unique team format for the ultimate national bragging rights. Teams of three, representing more than 70 countries, face off every year over a multi-day, multi-format event to crown the World *Magic* Cup Champion.
