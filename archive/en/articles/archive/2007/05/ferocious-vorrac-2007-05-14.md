A vorrac is a green-aligned beast native to the plane of Mirrodin. It's a boarlike creature with huge, curving, coppery tusks, and can often be found flattening the undergrowth of the Tangle. During *Mirrodin* set design, the beast was called a "djeeruk."

Artificers on Mirrodin were responsible for the [Clockwork Vorrac](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Clockwork+Vorrac), a magically animated metal version of the boar-beast. The Viridian elves of the Tangle hunted this unnatural abomination.

[Vorrac Battlehorns](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vorrac+Battlehorns) shows the tusks of a vorrac forged into a hand-held weapon, magically infused with the beast's unstoppable ferocity.


Speaking of ferocity, note that the *Fifth Dawn* "[Giant Growth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Giant+Growth)" effect [Ferocious Charge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ferocious+Charge) depicts a vorrac on the rampage. (Happy Scry Week!)
