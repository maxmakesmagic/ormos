**Card of the Day - vendredi 29 mars 2002**


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Birds%20of%20Paradise)#### Birds of Paradise


 *Alpha* rare.  
The Birds have been one of the staples of the game since it began, but they were created as an afterthought. Their art was originally supposed to be for Tropical Island, but the bird was too prominent. So Richard Garfield created a card just for the art, and it ended up being the most versatile mana-producing creature ever.
 


**Card of the Day - jeudi 28 mars 2002**


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Regal%20Unicorn)#### Regal Unicorn


 *Portal* common.  
Along with Blaze, the Regal Unicorn was the first *Portal* card to be introduced directly into the base set. It appeared in *Sixth Edition*.
 


**Card of the Day - mercredi 27 mars 2002**


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Mirari)#### Mirari


 *Odyssey* rare.  
*Sixth Edition* rules have proven to work well enough that the terminology is showing up in card text. Mirari is the first **Magic** card to mention "the stack." 
 


**Card of the Day - mardi 26 mars 2002**


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Citanul%20Druid)#### Citanul Druid


 *Antiquities* uncommon.  
Citanul Druids were "driven mad by the fall of Argoth," and it's evident in their name: "Citanul" is "Lunatic" spelled backwards.
 


**Card of the Day - lundi 25 mars 2002**


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Frightcrawler)#### Frightcrawler


 *Odyssey* common.  
The original name for this card was… Faceless Butcher. But the art has mouths, which implied a face, so the name Faceless Butcher was saved for *Torment*.
 


**Card of the Day - vendredi 22 mars 2002**


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Scathe%20Zombies)#### Scathe Zombies


 *Seventh Edition* common.  
The zombies may be simple, they may be plain, but they also hold the title of "longest running flavor text." Coleridge's haunting lines are the only flavor text to survive unchanged from *Alpha* through *Seventh Edition*.
 


**Card of the Day - jeudi 21 mars 2002**


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Obsianus%20Golem)#### Obsianus Golem


 *Alpha* uncommon.  
The "Song of the Artficer" in the Golem's flavor text is a take-off on the old African-American spiritual "Dem Bones."
 


**Card of the Day - mercredi 20 mars 2002**


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Durkwood%20Boars)#### Durkwood Boars


 *Legends* common.  
Legends was the last expansion set to use real literary quotations for flavor text, and the only set to use the Bible as a source for those quotes. The Boars sport one such Biblical quotation.
 


**Card of the Day - mardi 19 mars 2002**


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Dauthi%20Trapper)#### Dauthi Trapper


 *Stronghold* uncommon.  
The flavor text for the Trapper is interesting because it mentions two other obscure cards: Dandân and Rag Man.
 


**Card of the Day - lundi 18 mars 2002**


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Granite%20Gargoyle)#### Granite Gargoyle


 *Alpha* rare.  
The name of the author of "The Underworld Cookbook" appears in the Gargoyle's flavor text. It is the longest word ever to appear on a **Magic** card (and won't fit here). For the German version of the card, the name had to be arbitrarily shortened, since it wouldn't fit in one line of text.
 


**Card of the Day - vendredi 15 mars 2002**


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Cabal%20Patriarch)#### Cabal Patriarch


 *Odyssey* rare.  
Throughout the entire *Odyssey* storyline, the Patriarch is never given a "real" name. He is always referred to as the Cabal Patriarch.
 


**Card of the Day - jeudi 14 mars 2002**


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Noble%20Panther)#### Noble Panther


 *Invasion* rare.  
The original concept for Noble Panther was a giant scarab beetle that could gain flying for one mana. When flying was removed in favor of first strike, the card was changed into a panther.
 


**Card of the Day - mercredi 13 mars 2002**


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Time%20Vault)#### Time Vault


 *Alpha* rare.  
Time Vault was the first non-ante card banned from tournament play. Using its original wording, it comboed with Animate Artifact and Instill Energy to create an infinite-turn engine. Errata has since been issued to prevent such abuse, and the card has been un-banned.
 


**Card of the Day - mardi 12 mars 2002**


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Zodiac%20Rooster)#### Zodiac Rooster


 *Portal: Three Kingdoms* common.  
Plainswalk is a rare ability, and non-white creatures with plainswalk are even rarer. The Rooster, released just in Asian markets, is the only one.
 


**Card of the Day - lundi 11 mars 2002**


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Blizzard%20Elemental)#### Blizzard Elemental


 *Urza's Destiny* rare.  
Blizzard Elemental was originally slated to be in *7th Edition*, but it was replaced by the more popular Mahamoti Djinn.
 


**Card of the Day - vendredi 8 mars 2002**


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Falling%20Star)#### Falling Star


 *Legends* rare.  
Perhaps the weakest non-ante card currently banned in Type 1, Falling Star is "guilty by association" of being a problem card. The real culprit is it's over-powered big brother, Chaos Orb.
 


**Card of the Day - jeudi 7 mars 2002**


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Floral%20Spuzzem)#### Floral Spuzzem


 *Legends* uncommon.  
The original wording on Floral Spuzzem implies that the decision to destroy an artifact is made by… the Floral Spuzzem itself! We didn't know Spuzzems could play **Magic**!
 


**Card of the Day - mercredi 6 mars 2002**


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Rubinia%20Soulsinger)#### Rubinia Soulsinger


 *Legends* rare.  
Rubinia was originally called "Titania," but that name was used in *Antiquities*. The model for Rob Alexander's painting of Rubinia was a former employee of Wizards' sales department.
 


**Card of the Day - mardi 5 mars 2002**


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Raging%20Bull)#### Raging Bull


 *Legends* common.  
*Legends* was not made for limited play; Raging Bull is the only red common creature that can attack for damage. The others are all walls or have 0 power.
 


**Card of the Day - lundi 4 mars 2002**


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=All%20Hallow's%20Eve)#### All Hallow's Eve


 *Legends* rare.  
All Hallow's Eve is one of a very few cards to be printed with the wrong card type. It says "Sorcery," but has been officially errataed to "Enchantment" since it remains in play for two turns.
 


**Card of the Day - vendredi 1 mars 2002**


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Reconstruction)#### Reconstruction


 *Antiquities* common.  
In a printing error, the expansion symbol was left off this card. It should have the anvil.
