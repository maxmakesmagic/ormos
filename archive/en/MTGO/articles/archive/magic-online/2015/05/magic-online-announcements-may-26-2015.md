**Known Issue Around Trading *Tempest Remastered* Cards Scheduled for Fix**


We added a new known issue in the April 23 [Bug Blog](http://magic.wizards.com/en/MTGO/articles/archive/magic-online/magic-online-bug-blog-april-23-2015) involving trading cards from *Tempest Remastered*. This issue is scheduled to be fixed in the Wednesday, May 27, *Magic Online* deployment.


The *Tempest Remastered* set is hidden if unowned. This means that if a player owns no *Tempest Remastered* cards, the *Tempest Remastered* filter cannot be selected as a possible format, even if the player has the quantity filter set to 0. Because of this issue, a player who doesn't own any *Tempest Remastered* cards cannot place any of those cards in their wishlist. This bug is scheduled to be fixed during the Wednesday, May 27 deployment. In the meantime, players can find a breakdown of how we expect this to affect trading *Tempest Remastered*. Thank you for your patience while we work on this!


**Trading *Tempest Remastered* without using wishlists:**


If a player who does not own any *Tempest Remastered* cards begins a trade with another player who has *Tempest Remastered* cards, then *Tempest Remastered* cards will be visible in the trade for both players.



* The player who did not own any *Tempest Remastered* cards is able to trade with that other player to get *Tempest Remastered* cards without issue.
* Once the trade is complete, the player who did not have any *Tempest Remastered* cards will now find that the *Tempest Remastered* filter in their collection is functional.
* Once the filter is functional, the player will only be able to see cards that they own.


**Trading *Tempest Remastered* using a wishlist:**


If a user owns no *Tempest Remastered*, the *Tempest Remastered* filter cannot be selected as a possible format, even if the player has the quantity filter set to 0. Because of this, a player who doesn't own any *Tempest Remastered* cards cannot place any of those cards in their wishlist. The only cards that can be added to the wishlist, are ones that a player already owns.

**Extended Downtime for May 27, 2015**


* All tournaments will close Wednesday, May 27, at midnight Pacific (7:00 UTC)
* Store and trade activity will be suspended at approximately 2:45 a.m. Pacific (9:45 UTC)
* The system will be down from 3:00 a.m. Pacific (10:00 UTC) until 1:00 p.m. Pacific (20:00 UTC)

**Known Issues for the *Modern Masters 2015 Edition* Deployment**



* Duel Scene| Be aware that the context menu for morph creatures and spells with evoke have been rearranged to list the basic “Cast” as the top option followed by evoke and morph options.
* Duel Scene | The prompt text where the card states "Choose up to X target... X is currently [#]." States 'zero' when the last valid target is clicked
* Duel Scene | Cannot search for 0 cost equipment with the triggered ability of [Taj-Nar Swordsmith](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Taj-Nar+Swordsmith)
* Duel Scene | Text in the prompt box when casting [Commune with Nature](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Commune+with+Nature) reads “Cancel” instead of “No”
* Duel Scene | [Necrogenesis](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Necrogenesis) continues to associate with cards it exiles
* Duel Scene | Incorrect text for the delayed triggered ability of [Otherworldly Journey](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Otherworldly+Journey), does not mention the +1/+1 counter in text
* Duel Scene | Delayed triggered ability of [Otherworldly Journey](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Otherworldly+Journey) has missing association arrows with the exiled card
* Duel Scene | The prompt box text for [Wayfarer's Bauble](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wayfarer%27s+Bauble) does not mention that the land enters the battlefield tapped

**Build Notes**


**Promo Grants**



* The [MOCS](http://magic.wizards.com/en/2015-magic-online-championship-series) and [MOPR](http://magic.wizards.com/en/content/2015-magic-online-player-rewards) Season 6 Promos will be granted during the downtime.


**Card Mechanic Improvements**



* Proliferate has been given a design update to make it clearer to the user what is being selected and what isn’t. Instead of choices being locked in, using proliferate will highlight available options, then changing to a green glow once a permanent or player has been selected. This visual indication will make selecting and deselecting while resolving proliferate much clearer for the user.
* Eldrazi Spawn tokens have been polished to ensure they will always appear correctly for the user, making those [Nest Invaders](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=397901) proud of their Spawn.
* Soulshift has received an update, clarifying the user’s options when using cards like [Scuttling Death](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scuttling+Death) and [Thief of Hope](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thief+of+Hope).
* Specific type cycling has received a reworking to help illuminate the exact type of card the user is searching for. The more generic search prompt has been updated with details for the type of cycling that is occurring and will better inform the user of what they’re able to find.
* Annihilator, everyone’s favorite ability, has been improved. Users will now see Annihilator rules text on the stack when zooming on the ability trigger to help make it clear exactly what is happening without having to recheck the card responsible for the trigger.
* Sunburst now has more accurate blue text indicating that the spell was paid for with a particular number of mana colors. We wanted to put this important information in the right place to make it clear what is going to happen and why.
* Evoke’s context menus have been rearranged to ensure the “Cast with Evoke” option will be found below the “Cast” option, reducing the potential for misclicks.
* Kicker and multikicker have also been updated to make cards on the stack clearer for users. Spells with only one kicker cost will appear as “kicked” when appropriate costs are paid, while spells with multiple kicker options will specify which kicker costs were paid, and state how many times the spell was kicked as part of multikicker. To go along with these updates, the context menu for kicker and multikicker spells have been updated to add more definition about which costs to pay from kickers and rearranged to list the basic “Cast” as the top option followed by kicker payment options.
* The context menu for morph creatures and spells with evoke have been rearranged to list the basic “Cast” as the top option followed by evoke and morph options.


For more information about these *Magic Online* improvements, check [MTGO.com](http://magic.wizards.com/en/game-info/products/magic-online) for an [article by Alli Medwin](http://magic.wizards.com/en/MTGO/articles/archive/magic-online/modern-design-modern-mastery-2015-05-25) in which she discusses stories and improvements around the development of *Modern Masters 2015 Edition* on *Magic Online*.


**General**

* General | Our event pairing algorithm has been updated to better avoid situations where players get multiple byes in the same event. It has also been updated to better avoid players getting paired multiple times within the same event.

* Replay | Replays of games now correctly identify the game number.
* Legality | Cards that have been moved to common in *Modern Masters 2015 Edition* are now legal for Pauper.

* DKA | [Gravecrawler](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gravecrawler) can now be cast from Graveyard with [Aluren](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aluren).
* C14 | The final loyalty ability of [Jace, Architect of Thought](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace%2C+Architect+of+Thought) can be properly activated on an opponent's turn with [Teferi, Temporal Archmage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Teferi%2C+Temporal+Archmage) emblem on the battlefield.
* NPH | [Spellskite](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spellskite) can now change targets of [Satyr Firedancer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Satyr+Firedancer)'s triggered ability.
* KTK | [Arrow Storm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arrow+Storm) damage, with raid is no longer prevented incorrectly by [Deflecting Palm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deflecting+Palm) or [Channel Harm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Channel+Harm).
* Duel Scene| Fixed a crash that was occurring due to colorless tokens being created.

**Look and Feel**
