 It'll be a long time before **Magic** players forget the outcome of Pro Tour–Berlin. From the avalanche of ELVES! decks to Luis Scott-Vargas's amazing run through the Top 8 where he won *six* elimination games in a row in the quarterfinals and semifinals, the season's third Pro Tour set up a fascinating Extended storyline to follow for the next few weeks as we hurtle toward the 2008 World Championships. Included in this podcast is 20-minute interview with Scott-Vargas recorded immediately after the event.



**PRO TOUR–BERLIN**






* [**Friday, 10:22 a.m.: We Have Lift-Off**](http://webcast2.wizards.com/podcasts/08berlin/berlin_1.mp3) (14.6 MB)

 It's Extended, it's massive, and it's looking pretty cool here in Berlin, with many players making the effort to turn up to the event thoroughly suited and booted. The fruits of their sartorial labours can be seen later today, but for now sharp suits have to play second fiddle to sharp minds. Those minds won't have time to hang about either, since this Extended format promises to be very, very fast. Indeed. Tune in and here a world of Pros talking our favorite language – Magic.





* [**Friday, 6:54 p.m.: Se7en**](http://webcast2.wizards.com/podcasts/08berlin/berlin_2.mp3) (11.9 MB)

 Having blogged his way around the building, Rich gets the mic back in his hand to report the goings-on at four top tables as we head for crunch time here in Day One. Featuring Luis Scott-Vargas, Charles Gindy, Rich Hoaen, Masahiko Morita and a talented supporting cast of opponents, get up close to the action as it happens, minute by minute. Round Seven at the top, courtesy of magicthegathering.com.





* [**Saturday, 3:13 p.m.: Top Twelve in Twelve**](http://webcast2.wizards.com/podcasts/08berlin/berlin_3.mp3) (15.9 MB)

 In our first audio show of Day 2, we go inside Round 12 at the top tables. Whichever six come out ahead will be in a great position to get a chair at the Sunday Showdown. If you were still in any doubt about the breakout deck of the tournament, every single one of our six featured games has Elves on one side of the board. That's a ton of little green men and forests, lording it over the princely Extended format. Great matches, great interviews, and a guest spot by Hall of Famer and R&D member Mike Turian make this the perfect audio accompaniment to your Pro Tour Saturday. 





* [**Saturday, 7:49 p.m.: To The Wire**](http://webcast2.wizards.com/podcasts/08berlin/berlin_4.mp3) (17.0 MB)


**Magic**  has an endless capacity to generate excitement, whether that's at home, with friends, at Friday Night **Magic**  or all the way here to the Pro Tour. In this final audio show of Pro Tour–Berlin, we bring you all the drama of the final two rounds of Swiss action. Incredible matchups, and an ever-changing Top 8 picture take you right to the wire. And whether you're wired or wireless, make sure to join us for all the action on Super Sunday.
