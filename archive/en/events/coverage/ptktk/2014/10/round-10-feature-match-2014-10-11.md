Ari Lax looked drained of energy. He slowly approached the table, sighed, took his decks and dice and hit them on the table, then sat down in silence. This was, of course, a ploy. Just an hour earlier, Lax was completely excited about his pretty crazy draft deck. His team, TCGPlayer, had developed a strategy that was apparently paying off.



 Though a deck tech is likely soon, a quick primer on the deck is take [Trail of Mystery](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Trail+of+Mystery) over everything, then lands. Lastly, gobble up every great three-color card and good morph in the world.



The deck has many benefits. Just to mention three of them, you take all the lands and good cards from everyone else, making their decks worse; you get to play those spells; and lastly, no one knows just what you have, because it could be anything.



 11th-ranked Yuuya Watanabe at least has that third part under control. He was able to watch Ari Lax's last match, so some of the surprise cards, including [Flying Crane Technique](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flying+Crane+Technique), [Savage Knuckleblade](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Savage+Knuckleblade), and [Zurgo Helmsmasher](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Zurgo+Helmsmasher) were at least known entities.



"I guess it's fair; he got to watch my last match; I got to watch his whole draft." Lax said. He was referring to the live coverage of the draft streamed for all of y'all's benefit. Watanbe's aggressive Red-White-based deck had been splayed on the internet for all to see.




*Both Ari Lax and Yuuya Watanabe had a thorough understanding of each others decks.*
