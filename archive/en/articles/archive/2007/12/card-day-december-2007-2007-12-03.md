**Card of the Day - lundi 31 décembre 2007**


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Wormfang%20Newt)#### Wormfang Newt


*Judgment* common. The black and red Nightmares from *Torment* (such as Mesmeric Fiend and Petradon) had beneficial abilities, removing cards or resources of an opponent’s from the game and then returning them when the Nightmare left play (or not, if one took advantage of a loophole by removing the Nightmare from play with its comes-into-play trigger still on the stack). The blue and red Nightmares of *Judgment* (such as Wormfang Newt and Worldgorger Dragon) introduced a twist on this ability as a drawback, removing their controllers’ cards or resources from the game until they left play (unless, of course, the opponent took advantage of a loophole…). (*Original date: January 1, 2007*)



**Card of the Day - vendredi 28 décembre 2007**


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Squire)#### Squire


 *Time Spiral* "timeshifted." Squire, originally printed in *The Dark*, has many uses. It can trade with top-notch tournament staples such as Mogg Fanatic and Savannah Lions, outright kill a Kird Ape (if its controller doesn't have a Forest in play), and even survive Wave of Reckoning, which kills many powerful creatures. (*Original date: May 25, 2007*)



**Card of the Day - jeudi 27 décembre 2007**


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Silent-Chant%20Zubera)#### Silent-Chant Zubera


 *Champions of Kamigawa* common. The *Champions* Zubera all five started development as one-mana 1/1s, but they proved far too abusive with the infamous Skullclamp, then legal in Standard. Equip a Zubera, put it in the graveyard, draw two cards, get the Zubera effect, draw a few more Zubera... To prevent this degenerate interaction (and some other combos that were too easy), the Zubera all had their cost and their toughness increased by 1. Skullclamp was later banned, but the little Spirits' new stats were locked in. (*Original date: May 24, 2007*)



**Card of the Day - mercredi 26 décembre 2007**


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Shaman%20en-Kor)#### Shaman en-Kor


 *Stronghold* rare. The Kor creatures in *Stronghold*—recently followed up in *Time Spiral* with Outrider *en*-Kor—were an attempt to revisit banding, perhaps the most notoriously confusing keyword in the game's history. By removing the need to define a "band" and the often counterintuitive rules regarding attacking bands and evasion abilities, the designers found a flavorful, powerful way to represent a team of creatures who can spread damage around to minimize its impact. (*Original date: May 23, 2007*)




**Card of the Day - mardi 25 décembre 2007**


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Ramosian%20Lieutenant)#### Ramosian Lieutenant


 *Mercadian Masques* common. Designers were puzzled and frustrated by the question "Why didn't *Masques* have any new mechanics?" They pointed to the Rebel/Mercenary "recruitment" mechanic of Ramosian Lieutenant and friends as one of several new mechanics in the set, but without a keyword, it was dismissed by many players. If it were printed for the first time today, "Recruit" would likely be an ability word, and it—along with "Gating" creatures such as Marsh Crocodile and "Spiritcraft" creatures such as Teller of Tales—became one of the strong arguments in favor of ability words. (*Original date: May 22, 2007*)



**Card of the Day - lundi 24 décembre 2007**


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Repentant%20Blacksmith)#### Repentant Blacksmith


 *Arabian Nights* rare. Repentant Blacksmith was the first creature printed with protection from red (though presumably creatures were enchanted with Red Ward before the release of *Arabian Nights*). This novel ability may explain why the Blacksmith was rare despite its unimpressive stats. It was downgraded to a common for *Fifth Edition*, an usual rarity jump. (*Original date: May 21, 2007*)



**Card of the Day - vendredi 21 décembre 2007**


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Mindslaver)#### Mindslaver


 *Mirrodin* rare. The Comprehensive Rules are a living document, with sections added to support rules changes, new mechanics and themes, and even, on occasion, individual cards. Mindslaver has its own section in the Comprehensive Rules ("Controlling Another Player's Turn"), as does Time Stop ("Ending the Turn"). The "Subgames" section applies only to Shahrazad in non-*Un-* **Magic** (which is all the Comp. Rules are concerned with), although with the banning of Shahrazad in Legacy and Vintage, there are now no tournament-legal subgame cards.



**Card of the Day - jeudi 20 décembre 2007**


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Martyrdom)#### Martyrdom


 *Alliances* common. Obscure even when it was in print, this card enjoyed a breakthrough performance at the 1996 World Championships. The premiere-level debut of the Type 1.5 format (now called Legacy), the degenerate combo deck of the format ("Storm Drain") was built around Fastbond, Storm Cauldron, and an arbitrarily large Drain Life. The white weenie+burn deck that would go on to win the format packed Martyrdom in the sideboard as a surprise answer to the Storm Drain combo. Back when a negative life total didn't mean death until the end of the phase, multiple Storm Drain decks launched Drain Life spells with X's in the millions only to see them redirected to the likes of Savannah Lions, giving only 1 life back to the unfortunate (and now dead) Storm Drain player.



**Card of the Day - mercredi 19 décembre 2007**


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Kaboom!)#### Kaboom!


 *Onslaught* rare. Kaboom! is one of only eight cards to feature one or more exclamation points in its title (the other non-*Un-* card? To Arms!). This puts the number of

 **Magic** card titles containing exclamation points behind those with colons (15, all on Circles or Runes of Protection) but ahead of periods (5, all *Un-* except for *Sarpadian Empires, Vol. VII*), parentheses (2, both *Un-*), ampersands (2—the "R&D" *Un-* cards), question marks, and quotation marks (1 each, both Un- cards). The winners are the comma (appearing in the titles of 229 cards), the hyphen (259 cards), and the apostrophe (which appears in the titles of a whopping 506 cards).



**Card of the Day - mardi 18 décembre 2007**


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Hypnotic%20Specter)#### Hypnotic Specter


 *Tenth Edition* rare. For a card known (and dreaded back in the day) for its discard ability, it’s ironic that the act of drawing a Hypnotic Specter proved to be so critical in the 2007 World Championships. In Game 4 of the finals, Uri Peleg was at 5 life and facing down a single Bogardan Hellkite from Patrick Chapin. A Specter off the top of his deck gave Uri a flyer to chump-block the Hellkite, allowing him to overload the board with threats and secure the champion’s trophy.


 **Card of the Day - lundi 17 décembre 2007**


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Silhouette)#### Silhouette


 *Legends* uncommon. The alternate-art promo version of the *Unhinged* card Circle of Protection: Art (click here to see a large version of the art) contained references to Stasis, the Alpha Nether Shadow, Reverse Polarity, Weakstone, Word of Command, Camouflage, the back of the Alpha Lord of the Pit's head, and Silhouette. But who could hate Silhouette? Look how happy it is! Incidentally, our Silhouette wallpaper was very popular.



 **Card of the Day - vendredi 14 décembre 2007**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Riftsweeper)#### Riftsweeper


 *Future Sight* uncommon. This *Time Spiral* Block Limited star proved instrumental in the Finals matchup at this weekend's World Championships, as Israel's Uri Peleg piloted a mostly green-black midrange deck against American Patrick Chapin's Dragonstorm Update. Uri's maindeck was packed with powerhouses like Doran, the Siege Tower, Tarmogoyf, Garruk Wildspeaker, Liliana Vess, Thoughtseize, and Profane Command, but his sideboard had Riftsweeper to fight suspend-based decks. The *Future Sight* elf kept Chapin's Lotus Blooms and Rift Bolts at bay long enough for Peleg's power cards to go the distance.



 **Card of the Day - jeudi 13 décembre 2007**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Boggart%20Shenanigans)#### Boggart Shenanigans


 *Lorwyn* uncommon. Before this weekend, it's safe to say that nobody expected Boggart Shenanigans—a frequent sideliner even in *Lorwyn* Limited—to make a splash in Standard. But that's exactly what happened when Sam Black piloted a decidedly unusual Goblin deck to victory in the Win a Car Tournament at Worlds. Eschewing Tarfire, Nameless Inversion, and Wort, Boggart Auntie for an all-out aggro plan, Sam ran *Lorwyn* Goblins such as Mudbutton Torchrunner, Mad Auntie, and Squeaking Pie Sneak alongside Siege-Gang Commander, Mogg Fanatic, and Greater Gargadon, with Boggart Shenanigans as a way to pump out extra damage and close the game quickly.



 **Card of the Day - mercredi 12 décembre 2007**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Coalition%20Victory)#### Coalition Victory


 *Time Spiral* timeshifted. Although it didn't make it to the main event, the absurdly expensive five-color sorcery appeared in this weekend's Worlds coverage twice—though admittedly, neither incident involved actually paying its mana cost. Eric Snyder ended the multiplayer side event by playing the win condition out from under a Spinerock Knoll (which had a good weekend). Meanwhile, a group of American players considered—though eventually decided against—a Legacy deck that *used* the enormous, multicolored cost of Coalition Victory and Karona, False God, among others, to power out Pyrokinesis, Vine Dryad, Blazing Shoal, and other "pitch" spells. You can check out the unusual decklist here.



 **Card of the Day - mardi 11 décembre 2007**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Mosswort%20Bridge)#### Mosswort Bridge


 *Lorwyn* rare. To activate Mosswort Bridge you have to control creatures with total power 10 or more. The simplest and most obvious trick is to have that 10 power only briefly, such as with the *Lorwyn* evoke Elementals. Director of Magic R&D Aaron Forsythe, however, did one better while gunslinging this weekend at the World Championships. Aaron played Nova Chaser onto an empty board, to which his opponent replied, “Yeah, but you got nothing to champion!” Aaron grinned and, with the champion trigger still on the stack, slipped a Deepfire Elemental out from under his Mosswort Bridge. (Assembled onlookers went crazy at this point.)



 **Card of the Day - lundi 10 décembre 2007**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Horde%20of%20Notions)#### Horde of Notions


 *Lorwyn* rare. If a 5/5 with haste, trample, and vigilance isn't sufficient incentive to somehow cobble together five colors of mana, Horde of Notions also comes equipped with a powerful and unusual activated ability. The ability was plays well with *Lorwyn*'s evoke Elementals, but its tribal-friendly template has an added bonus: it allows you to replay an Elemental instant or sorcery in your graveyard every turn, as Zvi Mowshowitz gleefully did with Consuming Bonfire at this weekend's World Championships.



 **Card of the Day - vendredi 7 décembre 2007**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Thran%20Tome)#### Thran Tome


 *Weatherlight* rare. *Weatherlight* before and after: Thran Tome, along with Null Rod, Touchstone, and Thran Forge, appeared in *Weatherlight* as an unassuming artifact. In time, however, these artifacts—along with several others—were revealed to be parts of the Legacy and components of the devastating Legacy Weapon. All three are pictured in the *Tenth Edition* Legacy Weapon art, which you can see a large version of here.



 **Card of the Day - jeudi 6 décembre 2007**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Shattered%20Crypt)#### Shattered Crypt


 *Weatherlight* common. *Weatherlight* before and after: Shattered Crypt and Haunting Misery show the aftermath of the assault on Crovax's ancestral home by Morinfen and Gallowbraid, two servants of Volrath. The *Weatherlight* crew invites Crovax to join them, and he accepts, leaving his dead family in the ruins. After Crovax's descent into madness and ascension as Evincar of Rath, his home appears again, on the *Apocalypse* card Overgrown Estate.



 **Card of the Day - mercredi 5 décembre 2007**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Desperate%20Gambit)#### Desperate Gambit


 *Weatherlight* uncommon. *Weatherlight* before and after: In Desperate Gambit, we see Gerrard, acting captain of the *Weatherlight*, taking on the deadly Maraxus of Keld in a duel. Maraxus is a tough opponent, but Gerrard seems to know the trick to besting him—but who's that running up behind the two duelists? Why, it's Starke of Rath, who has his own ideas about how the duel should end—take a look at the art of Debt of Loyalty to see the outcome.



 **Card of the Day - mardi 4 décembre 2007**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Master%20of%20Arms)#### Master of Arms


 *Weatherlight* uncommon. *Weatherlight* before and after: Master of Arms isn't a legendary creature, but you might notice that the art looks awfully familiar. The vest, the sword, the steely gaze... that looks like Gerrard, all right, but Master of Arms depicts him before he accepts his destiny as owner of the *Weatherlight* and a living component of the Legacy. Thus, he's shown as a typical Benalish Master of Arms. In *Apocalypse*, Gerrard appeared in full legendary mode as Gerrard Capashen.



 **Card of the Day - lundi 3 décembre 2007**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Ancestral%20Knowledge)#### Ancestral Knowledge


 *Weatherlight* rare. *Weatherlight* before and after: Ancestral Knowledge depicts Sisay, captain of the *Weatherlight*, before her kidnapping by the evil Volrath. The kidnapping itself is shown, appropriately enough, on the card Abduction. This sets in motion the events of the *Weatherlight* Saga.
