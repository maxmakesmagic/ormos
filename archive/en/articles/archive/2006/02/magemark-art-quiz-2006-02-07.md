Artist Brandon Kitkouski (new to **Magic** illustration as of *Ravnica* -- see [Glimpse the Unthinkable](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glimpse+the+Unthinkable) and [Necromantic Thirst](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Necromantic+Thirst)) illustrated the *Guildpact* cycle of **magemarks**. These local enchantments are like mystic tattoos that magically enhance the bearer's skill and extend power to other aura-bearing creatures.


Brandon Kitkouski's art for the magemarks includes the small sigils that the spells create. Can you recognize each magemark by its glowing symbol? We've grayscaled the cropped art below so the color cues don't give it away. Click each one to see the answer.
