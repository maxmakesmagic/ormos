 Lucas Siow is armed with a powerful midrange strategy that features a lot of board sweepers like [Death Frenzy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Death+Frenzy) and [Duneblast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duneblast). His opponent, Seth Manfield, has a brutal Mardu token strategy that has the ability to win out of nowhere.
