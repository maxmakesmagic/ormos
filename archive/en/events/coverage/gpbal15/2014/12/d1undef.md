From 1,235 players, a surprising total of eleven had hung on for the fight to undefeated in Round 9 at Grand Prix Baltimore. Earning the best tiebreakers available, and a seat in the first draft pod on Day 2, was a feat that put victors well on their way to a Top 8 appearance.



**Table 1: David [Foster](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Foster) vs. John Davis**



The top table for the round was also one of the fastest. [Foster](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Foster) used his powerful removal – [Duneblast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duneblast) and [Utter End](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Utter+End) – amid his suite of Abzan power to overrun Davis in three games, the first and third featuring blink-and-you'll-miss-it victories for the undefeated [Foster](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Foster).



**Table 2: Chris Pikula vs. Greg Sokol**
