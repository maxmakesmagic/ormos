Ken Yukuhiro has needed little introduction ever since he made it to the Top 4 of Pro Tour *Avacyn Restored*. With five Grand Prix Top 8 appearances and a Champion title under his belt, Yukuhiro has however slipped away from the competitive circuit.


Despite cashing in the last three Pro Tours (Pro Tour *Dragons of Tarkir*, Pro Tour *Magic Origins* and Pro Tour *Battle for Zendikar*), he finds himself not qualified for Pro Tour *Oath of the Gatewatch* next weekend.

*The bubbly and jovial Ken Yukuhiro*


His opponent Satou Rei is lesser-known on an international scale, but is well-known within the Japanese community. The last time he was seen performing at high level Premier Play was during Grand Prix Shanghai 2012, where he placed the Top 4 to qualify for his 8th lifetime Pro Tour.


Both players went 7-2 yesterday, but climbed back by winning the first two rounds of Day 2. The winner here would be the sole 3-0 player at the first Draft Pod, while the fallen will have their hopes of making the Top 8 dashed.


Despite both players understanding the stakes, the atmosphere was nothing but amicable. Both players were cheery and animated as always. Both players had Red-Green decks, dismissing the notion that Green was a lackluster color. However, Rei's deck was more controllish, Yukuhiro's the stark opposite. Let's see which strategy will work out better in this "mirror match"!


Game 1
======


Yukuhiro's blistering deck was engineered to kill. Leading with [Makindi Sliderunner](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Makindi+Sliderunner) and [Netcaster Spider](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Netcaster+Spider), both creatures were quickly Supported by [Saddleback Lagac](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Saddleback+Lagac). Within two attack steps, Rei had dropped from 20, to 17 and then 10.


Rei wasn't without a plan though, using [Pilgrim's Eye](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pilgrim%27s+Eye) to fetch his fourth land, enabling him to summon [Eyeless Watcher](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eyeless+Watcher). The Eldrazi Scions aided him in accelerating into a Turn 5 [Deceiver of Form](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deceiver+of+Form), hampering Yukuhiro's assaults.

Unable to attack, Yukuhiro could only attempt to flood board and win with sheer numbers, before Rei does the same and flips over a huge creature from the top of his deck. However, those worries were unfounded because Rei never revealed anything that could transform his team. Flipping over [Boulder Salvo](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Boulder+Salvo), Unnatural Connections, Mountain and [Outnumber](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Outnumber), that gave plenty of time for Yukuhiro to attain critical mass.


Now that Rei was outnumbered 7 to 4 in terms of creature count, all Yukuhiro needed to do was to convince [Deceiver of Form](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deceiver+of+Form) to switch sides with a topdecked [Press into Service](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Press+into+Service), and that was sufficient to push the final 6 damage.


**Satou Rei 0—Ken Yukuhiro 1**


Game 2
======


The combination of [Makindi Sliderunner](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Makindi+Sliderunner), [Retreat to Valakut](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Retreat+to+Valakut) and [Saddleback Lagac](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Saddleback+Lagac) was good enough to reduce Rei to 11 life, but not enough to close the game. Rei was unfazed and chose to develop his board with [Zada's Commando](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Zada%27s+Commando), [Eyeless Watcher](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eyeless+Watcher) and then ramping into [Birthing Hulk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Birthing+Hulk).

*Satou Rei evens the score quickly.*


Thereafter, Rei used [Seek the Wilds](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seek+the+Wilds) to find [Kozilek's Channeler](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kozilek%27s+Channeler), while a Surged [Boulder Salvo](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Boulder+Salvo) dealt with Yukuhiro's only dangerous threat, the trampling [Makindi Sliderunner](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Makindi+Sliderunner). The green men and Eldrazi soon flooded the board and Yukuhiro decided not to waste time on this futile mission.


**Satou Rei 1—Ken Yukuhiro 1**


Game 3
======


Since Rei was on the draw, the sideboarded [Jaddi Offshoot](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jaddi+Offshoot) would go a long way in preserving his life total. [Scion Summoner](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scion+Summoner) and the summoned Scion quickly received +/1/+1 counters from [Saddleback Lagac](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Saddleback+Lagac), creating a 3/3 threat that the 0/3 couldn't block.


Rei stumbled on mana, but was able to still summon a 2/3 [Tajuru Stalwart](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tajuru+Stalwart) and a 2/3 [Sylvan Advocate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sylvan+Advocate) on consecutive turns. [Tajuru Warcaller](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tajuru+Warcaller)'s [Overrun](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Overrun) trigger prevented them from blocking profitably, and a timely [Brute Strength](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brute+Strength) took both of them out when Rei chose to block the turn later. Yukuhiro was simply too far ahead, and all he needed to do was press the advantage.


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Tajuru+Warcaller+)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tajuru+Warcaller+)
"Please, please, please don't draw any Allies," Rei pleaded.


Yukuhiro ignored that request and summoned [Zada's Commando](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Zada%27s+Commando), hoping to close the game before Rei could recover from his mana problems. Another [Tajuru Stalwart](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tajuru+Stalwart) triggered [Tajuru Warcaller](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tajuru+Warcaller) for the finishing blow.


Rei revealed the [Chandra, Flamecaller](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chandra%2C+Flamecaller) that he couldn't cast with [Unknown Shores](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Unknown+Shores), [Crumbling Vestige](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crumbling+Vestige), 1 Mountain and 3 Forests and extended the hand with a round of well wishes.


"I'm so lucky!!!" cheered the happy-go-lucky Ken Yukuhiro.


**Satou Rei 1—Ken Yukuhiro 2**


**Ken Yukuhiro defeats Satou Rei and moves up to 10-2. If he wins out in the next Draft, he will get a shot at the Top 8!**
