It's easy to play. All you have to do is go to [Fantasy Pro Tour *Return to Ravnica*](https://apps.facebook.com/magicfantasyprotour/) on Facebook and decide what cards you think are going to make a splash at the Pro Tour. The format is Modern, and the list of available cards has been filtered by the top minds of **Magic**'s R&D department.

You'll select a Planeswalker, three sizes of creatures, an instant, and so on. And you'll get points based on the number of times your roster's cards appear in all decks scoring at least 18 points across the ten Swiss Constructed rounds at the Pro Tour. Full rules are, of course, available in [Fantasy Pro Tour *Return to Ravnica*](https://apps.facebook.com/magicfantasyprotour/).
