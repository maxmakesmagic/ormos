Alex is playing the [Blistering Firecat](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blistering+Firecat) version of the red deck, whereas Emmanuel is playing Suicide Black. Once again this match is very much in favor of the red deck.

### Game 1

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gprei02/a870.jpg)Alex started off with a [Grim Lavamancer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grim+Lavamancer), followed by a [Mogg Fanatic](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mogg+Fanatic). Emmanuel used [Duress](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress) and [Cabal Therapy](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cabal+Therapy) to reduce Alex to no hand. Even so the Lavamancer was always going to be a real problem for his deck.

Emmanuel managed to put a creature into play that wouldn't die to the Lavamancer, which was a [Flesh Reaver](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flesh+Reaver). Unfortunately for Alex he didn't know exactly how the card worked and ran his [Mogg Fanatic](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mogg+Fanatic) at it, sacrificing when damage was on the stack. Since the [Flesh Reaver](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flesh+Reaver) hadn't dealt damage successfully, Emmanuel didn't have to lose the four life.

Vernay played a [Carnophage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Carnophage) which was killed by the Lavamancer, but then he dropped a [Cursed Scroll](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cursed+Scroll). The Scroll took out the offending Wizard and suddenly it looked like Emmanuel had a chance in this game.

He dropped a [Carnophage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Carnophage) and a [Dauthi Slayer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dauthi+Slayer), but Alex topdecked a [Blistering Firecat](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blistering+Firecat). At that point he had the choice of just attacking with the [Fire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fire)cat, or using the [Grim Lavamancer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grim+Lavamancer) on Emmanuel's [Carnophage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Carnophage) and attacking with both the Cat and the [Mogg Fanatic](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mogg+Fanatic). He chose the first plan.

Emmanuel attacked with the [Slay](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Slay)er and dropped a [Skittering Skirge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skittering+Skirge), which died to the Lavamancer, and Alex made a second [Mogg Fanatic](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mogg+Fanatic). Despite missing out on three points of damage earlier in the game, Vernay was so low on life that Mack was able to burn him out.

### Game 2

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gprei02/a871.jpg)This game Alex had to take a mulligan and lost his [Seal of Fire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seal+of+Fire) to a first turn [Duress](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress). Mack summoned a [Goblin Cadets](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Cadets) and Emmanuel a [Flesh Reaver](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flesh+Reaver) and a [Sarcomancy](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sarcomancy). The [Sarcomancy](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sarcomancy) really isn't too hot in this match. Alex [Volcanic Hammer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Volcanic+Hammer)ed the token so that he could start dealing some damage.

Next turn Emmanuel made a [Planar Void](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Planar+Void) (Lavamancer protection) and a [Cursed Scroll](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cursed+Scroll). He was stuck on two land however, and Alex had two [Rishadan Port](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rishadan+Port)s, so for a few turns the only damage that was dealt was from Emmanuel's [Sarcomancy](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sarcomancy). After a few turns, however, Alex drew a [Cursed Scroll](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cursed+Scroll) effectively ending the game. He made a mistake by not attacking with the [Mogg Fanatic](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mogg+Fanatic) into the [Flesh Reaver](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flesh+Reaver) when it was going to die to Emmanuel's [Cursed Scroll](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cursed+Scroll) anyway.

Of course it didn't matter, as Vernay's deck had basically no way of dealing with the [Cursed Scroll](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cursed+Scroll), and after a few turns the Frenchman had to admit defeat.

**Final Result:** Alex Mack 2 â€“ Emmanuel Vernay 0
