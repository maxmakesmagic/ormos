By Reid Duke




Over the span of the last nineteen years, since he was five years old, Reid has been a player, a deck builder, a collector, and a lover of the Magic world. Today, he’s a full-time professional Magic player and writer. 





After more than a year with the Level One column, we've covered dozens of important concepts. We've also covered many terms that might be unfamiliar to a new player, but which are important for anyone interested in learning more about *Magic* strategy and theory.


Below is a list of the vocabulary words from Level One*.* This is meant as a reference for any time you might encounter an unfamiliar phrase—not just in reading Level One*,* but from anywhere in the wide world of competitive *Magic.* For further reading, nearly every phrase contains a link that will take you to the article pertaining to or addressing that term.
