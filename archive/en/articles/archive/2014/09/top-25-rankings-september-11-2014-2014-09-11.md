After a busy weekend in Salt Lake City at the [Grand Prix](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/gpslc14), it's time to take a look at the latest in our *Magic* Top 25 Pro Rankings. Of our Top 25, a full baker's dozen were in action at the *Magic 2015* Limited tournament, and several of them went deep into Sunday. Eric Froehlich went the furthest, dispatching the hugely talented Nathan Holiday in the quarterfinals before the eventual champion Brandon Nelson stopped him at the penultimate hurdle. Froehlich leaps eight places as a result, taking him inside the Top 10 at No. 8. Also joining him in the Top 8 at Salt Lake City was fellow [ChannelFireballer](http://store.channelfireball.com/landing) Paul Rietzl. The Hall of Fame Elect moves six places up the rankings, to just a couple of spots ahead of Froehlich at No. 7.



Although those were the two biggest movers, plenty of others deposited points into their Player of the Year accounts for 2014–2015. [Pro Tour *Born of the Gods*](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/ptbng14) champion Shaun McLaren finished in 9th place, gaining him 2 points and three places in our table, leaving him at No. 8, between Froehlich and Rietzl. Jacob Wilson, fresh from an unusual encounter with a snake on his Australian trip to [Grand Prix Sydney](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/gpsyd14), remains at No. 15, but with 2 pro points to show for his deep run in Salt Lake, where he finished 11th. Josh McClain also finished in the Top 16, good enough for 2 points, and a moves up the rankings to No. 19. Finally, Ben Friedman (No. 21) claimed the final pro point available in Salt Lake City, sneaking into 64th place.



So six players bolstered their early-season records, while Alexander Hayne, Owen Turtenwald, Sam Black, Chris Fennell, William Jensen, Tom Martell, and Josh Utter-Leyton failed to score. The leaderboard is going to remain static for a while now, with the next Grand Prix not scheduled until the doubleheader weekend in Orlando and Shanghai, the first weekend of October. But never fear! We'll be right here to talk more *Magic* Top 25 Pro Rankings next week, so join us then.
