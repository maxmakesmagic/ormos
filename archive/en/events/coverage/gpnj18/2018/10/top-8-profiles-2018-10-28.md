**What deck did you play this weekend, and why did you choose it?**


Boros because [Militia Bugler](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Militia+Bugler) into [Aurelia, Exemplar of Justice](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aurelia%2C+Exemplar+of+Justice) is nice.


**What was the best card in your main deck, and why?**


Aurelia, because it’s the highest quality creature card in Standard.


**What was the best card out of your sideboard, and why?**


[Bounty Agent](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bounty+Agent), because it kills [Lyra Dawnbringer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lyra+Dawnbringer).

[Dive Down](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dive+Down) from Oliver Tomajko, got blown out when I tried to Lave Coil his [Crackling Drake](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crackling+Drake)

17th at Grand Prix Atlanta 2015


**What deck did you play this weekend, and why did you choose it?**


Jeskai — seemed like [Deafening Clarion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deafening+Clarion) is really strong and [Teferi, Hero of Dominaria](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Teferi%2C+Hero+of+Dominaria) is still one of the most powerful things to do.


**What was the best card in your main deck, and why?**


[Deafening Clarion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deafening+Clarion). Three mana [Wrath of God](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wrath+of+God). That gains 10 life if you have a Drake in play.


**What was the best card out of your sideboard, and why?**


My sideboard kind of sucks. [Lava Coil](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lava+Coil) is often relevant.

I was surprised Boros Angels is good.

Dimir. And Azorius.
