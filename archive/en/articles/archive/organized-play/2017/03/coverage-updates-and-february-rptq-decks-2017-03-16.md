Hey everyone! This week's going to be short and sweet, with a couple of updates to the coverage schedule and a look at some of the Top 8 decklists from the latest Regional Pro Tour Qualifier round.


Coverage Team Updates
=====================


First up is an update to the coverage teams for both this weekend and the next.


**Porto Alegre**


For [Grand Prix Porto Alegre](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/premierplay/grandprix/fact-sheet-gppoa17), there's been a change in commentators. Tune in this weekend to live video of Grand Prix Porto Alegre featuring *Rich Hagon* and Paulo Vitor Damo da Rosa as your commentators! Coverage of Grand Prix Porto Alegre will begin Saturday at 9:30 a.m. local time (BRT). That's 5:30 a.m. PT/8:30 a.m. ET/12:30 p.m. UTC.


**Orlando**


[Grand Prix Orlando](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/premierplay/grandprix/fact-sheet-gporl17)'s coverage team for the following weekend has also been confirmed. It is as follows:


* Start Times: Saturday, March 25 (7 a.m. PT/2 p.m. UTC), and Sunday, March 26 (6 a.m. PT/1 p.m. UTC)
* Video Producer: Rich Hagon
* Video Director: Rashad Miller
* Camera and Graphics: BJ Ogden
* Play-by-Play Commentator: Marshall Sutcliffe
* Color Commentator: Paul Cheon
* Swing Commentator (will be in both Play-by-Play and Color seats): Luis Scott-Vargas
* Writer-Reporter: Corbin Hosler

Orlando's Limited main event will feature the first time that Luis Scott-Vargas and Paul Cheon are together on an official *Magic* stream for commentary. I'm sure they'll be upstanding professionals in the booth all weekend.

> [@lsv](https://twitter.com/lsv) is this why you posted this in our emails: "Does anyone have tips for how to handle PBP with a very inexperienced color commentator?"

Uh . . . moving on.


**San Antonio**


The coverage team for [Grand Prix San Antonio](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/premierplay/grandprix/fact-sheet-gpsa17) has been finalized. Details can be found below.


* Producer/Director/Graphics: ChannelFireball

Andy Cooperfauss of ChannelFireball fame will be managing this broadcast and has finalized a team consisting of Marshall Sutcliffe, Brian David-Marshall, Luis Scott-Vargas, and Patrick Chapin for its commentary. Finally, Marc Calderaro has subbed in Corbin Hosler on the writer-reporter front.


**Metz and Indianapolis**


[In my boss's 2017 coverage announcement back in January](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/news/magic-twitch-and-you-full-2017-video-coverage-picture-2017-02-01), Grand Prix Metz—which takes place August 26–27—was announced as receiving video coverage. We're updating that to switch video coverage to Grand Prix Indianapolis instead, which takes place the same weekend.


The format for both Grand Prix Metz and Indianapolis is Limited, and we'll have more info on the coverage teams for these shows in the coming months.
