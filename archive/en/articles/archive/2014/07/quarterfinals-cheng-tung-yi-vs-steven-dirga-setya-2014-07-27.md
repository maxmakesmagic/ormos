Game 1



 In the first game, both players led with rares of their own. Cheng presented [Goblin Kaboomist](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Kaboomist), but that wasn't very useful against Setya's [Spirit Bonds](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spirit+Bonds). Steven summoned [Sungrace Pegasus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sungrace+Pegasus) and [Shaman of Spring](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shaman+of+Spring), also creating two Spirit tokens in the process.




 Cheng shot down an untapped token with [Forge Devil](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forge+Devil) and tried to retaliate with [Juggernaut](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Juggernaut), but things started to go downhill after it got in for just a hit.
