It's the first pack of the draft. You open up a [Cruel Ultimatum](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cruel+Ultimatum) and nothing else that compares to the seven-mana game breaker, so you take it. Now it's going to take some serious convincing for you to switch out of Grixis.

New draft. You first-picked a [Branching Bolt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Branching+Bolt), and followed it up with a [Rhox Charger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rhox+Charger), a [Magma Spray](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Magma+Spray), a [Carrion Thrash](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Carrion+Thrash), a [Rockslide Elemental](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rockslide+Elemental), a [Blister Beetle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blister+Beetle), a [Blightning](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blightning), a [Jund Panorama](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jund+Panorama), another [Blightning](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blightning), a [Naya Obelisk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Naya+Obelisk), and some other less notable cards.

 Then you open up a [Battlegrace Angel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Battlegrace+Angel) in pack two, and suddenly your Jund deck turns into a Naya deck.
