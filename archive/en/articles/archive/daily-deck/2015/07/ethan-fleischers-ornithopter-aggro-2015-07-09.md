Ethan Fleischer's Ornithopter Aggro

 A Magic Pro player and strategy writer, Melissa's career Top 8s include PT Gatecrash and 2 GPs. She's currently a member of the Wizards of the Coast coverage team. 






Today's Origin Story deck probably looks a bit strange to most people. It doesn't look like a deck at all, just a pile of cards. Believe it or not, back when *Magic* first came out there were no deck building rules other than a 40-card deck minimum. You could play as many copies of a card as you wanted! The four-of one card, 60-card minimum deck building rule didn't come about until tournaments started in early 1994.



Later that year, *Antiquities* came out and young Ethan Fleischer was intrigued by this new card: [Ornithopter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ornithopter). It was a creature that you didn't have to pay any mana for! That had to be on the same power level as the Moxes and [Black Lotus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Black+Lotus), right?



Ethan collected as many [Ornithopter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ornithopter)s as he could and built his very first deck: an aggro/tempo deck based around the absurdly powerful zero-mana [Ornithopter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ornithopter). [Unstable Mutation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Unstable+Mutation) was the card that tied everything together and enabled the [Ornithopter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ornithopter)s to attack. [Unstable Mutation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Unstable+Mutation) was a pretty powerful card back in the early days of *Magic*. Creature removal was not as prominent and it was pretty rare for blue to have the ability to give a creature +3/+3. [Unstable Mutation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Unstable+Mutation) could also be used as a very slow removal spell, making this card pretty versatile.

This deck's plan is to cast one or more [Ornithopter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ornithopter)s on turn one, and then as many [Unstable Mutation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Unstable+Mutation)s as possible on subsequent turns. On turn two, you could attack for six with two [Unstable Mutation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Unstable+Mutation)s. On turn three you could attack for as much as thirteen, provided you have drawn five [Unstable Mutation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Unstable+Mutation)s.



The deck is aggressive and simple, but unfortunately Ethan never won a single game with it. It did, however, give him the foundation he needed to become a great deck builder and *Magic* designer. He went on to win The Great Designer Search 2 back in 2010. Ethan has been a designer at Wizards for about five years now, has been a lead designer on plenty of sets, and has certainly come a long way since his [Ornithopter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ornithopter) days.
