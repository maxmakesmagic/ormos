### Prizes


Booster pack prizes will be awarded based on attendance. Unless otherwise noted, top finishing players will receive current set boosters.


### Pro Tour Qualifiers


Qualifiers for individual and Two-Headed Giant format Pro Tour tournaments award an invitation and a travel award to a specific Pro Tour tournament for the top-finishing competitor or team.


### Grand Prix Trials

| 8 – 32 | 1 |

Trials for individual-format Grand Prix tournaments award a three-round bye to a Grand Prix tournament for one or more of the top-finishing competitors. The number of three-round byes awarded will be determined by the number of players in the Trial as shown in the table below. Grand Prix Trial byes no longer pass down.
