Are you ready? Weeks of spoilers have all led to the big day, just 48 hours from now. The *Magic 2010* prerelease! But first, how about your weekly dosage of **Magic** deck lists from around the world! Japan's Regionals season is inching to a close and we've got one more entry in that category from Kochi. If you're looking for what's been winning on the Pro Tour Qualifier circuit for Austin, check out the archived PTQ Top 8 lists. And for **Magic Online** Premier Events? All of them from the past week are here for your perusal!
