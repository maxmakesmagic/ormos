### Artist Information

**Anthony S. Waters**
  
 Anthony Scott Waters is a concept artist and illustrator based in Southern California. His career has taken him from the early days of interactive software all the way to Hollywood, with many stops in between. He’s known as a monster maker and environment designer for **Magic** as well as companies like Microsoft, Hasbro and Electronic Arts. His work has also been featured in **Spectrum: The Best in Contemporary Fantastic Art**, issues 9 through 14, and toured the country in the **MacExpo Digital Art Show**. His professional portfolio can be viewed at [www.thinktankstudios.com](http://www.thinktankstudios.com). His [Deviant Art](http://fyreant.deviantart.com/) contains a wide sampling of his work, possibly including things that could be considered deviant. [bloated-nose.blogspot.com](http://bloated-nose.blogspot.com) is where Anthony blogs, mostly about things much less disgusting than the blog's title might suggest.

**Mark Tedin**
  
 Mark came on board as a freelance artist at Wizards of the Coast in the summer of 1992. Since then, he's contributed artistically to nearly all the fantasy/adventure games the company produces, including most sets of **Magic: The Gathering**. When Mark's not working on Wizards of the Coast projects, he enjoys hanging out and drawing in Seattle cafes, designing sets for theatrical productions, or going to science fiction movies. In fact, it's Mark's fondness for the worlds of science fiction and fantasy that helped shape him into the artist he is today. 

From 1997-2000, Mark also worked on site at Wizards of the Coast as a staff conceptual artist. Since then, he's also been teaching illustration, visual composition, and figure drawing part-time at the Northwest College of Art near Seattle.
