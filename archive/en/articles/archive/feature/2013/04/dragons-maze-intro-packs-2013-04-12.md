Time to look at the Intro Packs for *Dragon's Maze*! Yesterday we got to see all the *Dragon's Maze* promos and tokens; today we get to see the five new Intro Packs featuring five of the set's maze runners.


Inside each of these packs is a ready-to-play sixty-card deck with a foil premium rare (the one you see pictured) and two sealed fifteen-card *Dragon's Maze* booster packs, as well as a insert with the deck's strategy and a **Magic** "learn to play" guide.


### Azorius Authority


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/arcana/arc1210_wu_q2h6kohtxn.jpg)Nothing succeeds like a brilliant plan, and no one plans better than the Azorius. Lay down the law with the "Azorius Authority" deck, detaining your opponent’s actions while legions of skyknights fly over with the final verdict.


 

### Orzhov Power


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/arcana/arc1210_wb_q2h6kohtxn.jpg)One thing the Orzhov know how to do is savor victory. With the "Orzhov Power" deck, let your devotees clog up the ground while bats and spirits fly overhead, leaving you to enjoy draining the life out of your foe.


 

### Rakdos Revelry


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/arcana/arc1210_rb_q2h6kohtxn.jpg)Rakdos is throwing a festival of fire, and your opponent is invited. With the "Rakdos Revelry" deck, amass your most depraved fiends to create a carnival of destruction, and then watch your enemies burn.


 

### Gruul Siege


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/arcana/arc1210_rg_q2h6kohtxn.jpg)The Gruul stand ready to beat down all who oppose them. With the "Gruul Siege" deck, creatures versed in battle tactics will thwart your enemies, setting up your bone-crushing brutes to deal the killing blow.


 

### Simic Domination


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/arcana/arc1210_gu_q2h6kohtxn.jpg)For the Simic, life is just raw material to mold into works of bizarre genius. With the “Simic Domination” deck, you’ll take a host of hungry creatures and grow them into a titanic army of mutated might.
