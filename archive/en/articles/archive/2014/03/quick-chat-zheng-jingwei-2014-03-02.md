Zheng Jingwei has been having a stellar fortnight. After returning from Pro Tour *Born of the Gods* with a Top 16 finish, he continued racking up wins in Melbourne and was one of the first players to lock up a spot in the Top 8.

Let's get to know Zheng a little more. An actuary by profession, Zheng is naturally gifted and precise when it comes to math and numbers. He has been playing **Magic** since *Shards of Alara* but got onto the professional scene a couple of years ago.


He used to game casually at HobbyMaster, one of the most prominent stores in Auckland. That was until he opened his own store, Cerberus Games, in Wellington, proof that he is a huge fan of the game.

"My best finish before this Pro Tour would be a Top 8 at the World **Magic** Cup 2013. New Zealand made it to the Top 8 and I'm glad to be part of the team." As the current Pro Point leader in his country, he could well be crowned the New Zealand National Champion at the end of the season if he continues his hot streak.


With his eye on one of the two Player Championship slots, the whole of Asia will be on his heels but he isn't discouraged one bit. Already qualified for the last two Pro Tours this season, his wish is to harness enough Points to reach Gold, or even Platinum level.


As we speak, he is taking a short break while preparing for the Top 8 playoffs and we wish him the best of luck today.
