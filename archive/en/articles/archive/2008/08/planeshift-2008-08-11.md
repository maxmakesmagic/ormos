T**he Darkest Chapter**


Once you experience the *Planeshift*, there's no turning back. And the Phyrexians are taking no prisoners. Will you survive?


Well, Gating allows you to play the biggest, baddest creatures, without the heavy cost. And Familiars give spell cost-reduction a new spin.


Factor in tricolor mana Dragon Lairs and double-Kicker Battlemages, and it's easy to see how the *Planeshift* expansion adds up to major carnage.


Arm yourself with *Planeshift* and live to fight another day... Or not.


**Two worlds. Many ways to perish.**
