What's good in Standard?

When *Odyssey* Block rotated out, it took with it [Psychatog](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psychatog) and all the Madness and Threshold cards that have defined the format for almost two years. It can be tricky to calculate a metagame from scratch, but that's where States comes in. These 479 decks cover a number of different archetypes, but they all have one thing in common: they took someone to the Top 8 of a big tournament.

This resource can be used in two ways. If you're not sure what to play, look through the decks until you see one that matches your play style. Or if you're already committed to a deck, you can use this as a prediction of the decks you might have to face. *(To navigate through the decks, use the state/province list on the [first page](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/feature/188) or the page navigation at the bottom of every page.)*
