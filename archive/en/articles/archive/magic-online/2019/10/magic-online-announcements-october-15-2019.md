CHAOS DRAFT! October 16
-----------------------


Flex your deck-building skills during this week's CHAOS DRAFT!, a format that requires players to contemplate meta-archetypes over the curated archetypes typically found in a cube. CHAOS DRAFT! starts tomorrow, October 16, and runs for a week—plenty of time to smash face amidst the [Pandemonium](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pandemonium).


Sets that can be opened in this CHAOS DRAFT! include:


*Return to Ravnica*, *Gatecrash*, *Dragon's Maze*, *Magic 2014 Core Set*, *Theros*, *Born of the Gods*, *Journey into Nyx*, *Magic 2015 Core Set*, *Khans of Tarkir*, *Fate Reforged*, *Dragons of Tarkir*, *Magic Origins*, *Battle for Zendikar*, *Oath of the Gatewatch*, *Shadows over Innistrad*, *Eldritch Moon*, *Kaladesh*, *Aether Revolt*, *Amonkhet*, *Hour of Devastation*, *Ixalan*, *Rivals of Ixalan*, *Dominaria*, *Core Set 2019*, *Guilds of Ravnica*, *Ravnica Allegiance*, *War of the Spark*, *Core Set 2020*, and *Throne of Eldraine*

*Innistrad* Flashback Draft October 30
--------------------------------------


To celebrate Halloween, players can enjoy frightful fights in the upcoming *Innistrad* Flashback Draft! Get in on all the spooky action starting Wednesday, October 30. *Innistrad* Flashback Draft runs through November 6, so you'll have plenty of time to enjoy the creepiest of creatures.




---

Banned & Restricted List Update Window
--------------------------------------


Next Monday, October 21, R&D will make an announcement regarding the banned and restricted lists for each format. If there is a change to any format, *Magic Online* will implement that change at 12 p.m. PT on the same day as the announcement.


If a card is banned or restricted, players using the newly banned card in a league can finish their league courses in the intervening four hours. At noon, however, any remaining players with newly illegal decks will be removed from the league with their entry option returned to their collection. If a card is unbanned or unrestricted, players can join existing leagues with decks containing those cards after the update.

* [Predict](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Predict) correctly yields two cards when its controller guesses the correct card name.
* Cards exiled by [Spell Queller](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spell+Queller) can again be cast by their controller when [Spell Queller](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spell+Queller) leaves the battlefield.
* If you cast an Adventure spell while controlling [Feather, the Redeemed](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Feather%2C+the+Redeemed), you can correctly choose which replacement effect to send the spell to exile (*Adventuring* or *Feather-ing*).
* [Lavabelly Sliver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lavabelly+Sliver) and [Constricting Sliver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Constricting+Sliver) now correctly trigger when [Irregular Cohort](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Irregular+Cohort) creates a [Shapeshifter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shapeshifter) token
