During the draft, I was happy to record the picks of Yuuya Watanabe in seat five, but I have to admit, my eyes started wandering as the draft went on over to seat six where seventh-ranked William Jensen was sitting.


You see, Watanabe was drafting a pretty straightforward aggressive deck that invited a few twists and turns, but ultimately, looked to attack and attack and attack. It looked good, great even, but not sweet.



 Jensen, on the other hand, caught my attention when the flash of a [Temporal Fissure](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Temporal+Fissure) grabbed my eye. I glanced over and was immediately blown away. [Psychatog](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psychatog), counterspells, rituals, and multiple storm cards were all sitting in Jensen's pile. [Mana Drain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Drain), a million ways to draw cards—it was as exciting a deck as you're going to see in this format.



We'll get to more on that in a moment, but first let's meet our competitors. Jensen—you can read his profile for more—finds himself at the top of the world standings once again, just a few years after coming back to the game. By any account, Jensen had a historic season, not only earning his trip to this field of 24, but also setting a record with eight Grand Prix Top 8s in a single season—breaking the record formerly held by friend, teammate, and first-ranked Owen Turtenwald.



 Lee Shi Tian had an excellent season himself, and he started off the new season strong by recently and memorably making the Top 8 of Pro Tour *Khans of Tarkir*. He qualified as one of the two representatives of the Asia-Pacific region and is currently ranked tenth in the world. You can read more about him in his profile as well.





*Seventh-ranked William Jensen's sweet storm deck packed some power, but tenth-ranked Lee Shi Tian's deck had a lot a lot of brute force, with the ability to beat down before he gets stormed out.*
