Last weekend was a mixture of Standard and Modern for many, with the first round of [2014 World *Magic* Cup Qualifiers](http://magic.wizards.com/en/content/world-magic-cup-qualifiers-event-types-events) running alongside the Pro Tour Qualifier season. For many, that meant a chance to compete in both formats, as many tournament organizers for last weekend's WMCQs ran a PTQ on the adjacent day, giving players more great events to try and qualify for.


The WMCQ Standard Top 8 decklists are starting to trickle in. We've got a small sample of them available for you this week and look forward to bringing you more next week.


The Pro Tour Qualifier season tied to Pro Tour *Khans of Tarkir* is winding down, as players spend these final weeks in hopes that their Modern decks will earn them a coveted invitation and airfare to Honolulu. With many of last weekend's PTQs coinciding with WMCQs on the adjacent day, the competition was fierce. Remember, if you want a chance to compete on the Pro Tour, be sure to find a [Pro Tour Qualifier](http://magic.wizards.com/en/protour/qualifierlist) near you.
