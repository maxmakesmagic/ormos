On April 18, **Magic Online** hosted an R&D Challenge where everyone was invited to play against members of Wizards R&D... and win their packs! **Magic Online** user Better\_then\_u took home the lion's share of the prizes, as the lone player to go 5–0 outside of **Magic** R&D.



![Rescue from the Underworld](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Rescue%20from%20the%20Underworld&options=)Better\_then\_u's deck of choice was one of the strongest decks in *Theros* Block Constructed, Junk Reanimator. While black, green, and white decks with reanimation elements were popular during last year's Standard season, due to Mulch and Unburial Rites, the *Theros* Block deck uses Commune with the Gods and Satyr Wayfinder to fill the graveyard and Whip of Erebos and Rescue from the Underworld to bring back large creatures. The large creatures of choice for this *Theros* Block deck are Ashen Rider and Abhorrent Overlord, both of which have enters-the-battlefield triggers to take advantage of Whip of Erebos.

Much like its Standard predecessor, this deck can play a normal midrange game if it can't get the reanimation pieces together. Elspeth, Sun's Champion remains one of the most powerful cards in the format, while Courser of Kruphix helps you hit enough land drops to be able to cast your large, expensive creatures. Once you put it all together, you have a deck that is both powerful and consistent.
