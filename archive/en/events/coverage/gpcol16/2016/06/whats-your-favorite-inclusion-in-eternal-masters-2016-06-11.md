Grand Prix Columbus is more than just a popular Eternal tournament where players can play some of their favorite cards from *Magic's* history. It's also the release weekend for *Eternal Masters*, *Magic's* newest set where players can find those cards made new again. We talked to some Legacy enthusiasts just what was their favorite thing about *Eternal Masters*.

“I really like the random commons and uncommons that didn't have foils before. I'm really excited to get foil [Pyroblast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyroblast) and [Baleful Strix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Baleful+Strix).”


### Kyle Boggemes

“[Karakas](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Karakas). I like the new art and it's a card that a lot of people have wanted to get.”


### Erin Campbell

“[Ichorid](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ichorid), because more people can play [Dredge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dredge)! And [Cabal Therapy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cabal+Therapy) as well, because now there's a version with the new art that isn't foil.”


### Ross Merriam

“[Wirewood Symbiote](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wirewood+Symbiote), for obvious reasons” (Merriam is widely recognized as an Elves master). “But the lack of [Elvish Visionary](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elvish+Visionary) does disturb me.”
