*Planar Chaos* is a journey through the alternate past. Seal of Primordium, for example, in effect adds a sixth card to the [*Nemesis* cycle of seals](http://ww2.wizards.com/gatherer/index.aspx?term=seal%20of&Field_Name=on&setfilter=Nemesis). Like much of *Planar Chaos*, it represents a slightly distorted perspective of the color wheel, yet makes sense in the flavor of its new color as well. In this case, the precedent is clearâ€”*Planar Chaos's*
[Seal of Primordium](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seal+of+Primordium), a "Seal of [Naturalize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Naturalize)" is a logical companion to the *Nemesis*
[Seal of Cleansing](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seal+of+Cleansing), a "Seal of Disenchant."

Christopher Moeller illustrated the original five seals, and was asked to return to paint [Seal of Primordium](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seal+of+Primordium) in the same style, as if the card were literally ripped out of the time-stream from an alternate *Nemesis*. This alternate *Nemesis* seems recognizable, yet slightly different through the hazy mirror of time. It makes you wonder what the other four alternate seals might have been...

*[Seal of Primordium](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seal+of+Primordium) art by Christopher Moeller*Note that [Seal of Primordium](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seal+of+Primordium) is shown destroying a recognizable artifact from the *Time Spiral* set. Perhaps the world from which [Seal of Primordium](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seal+of+Primordium) comes was plagued by this particular artifact.

[Seal of Primordium](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seal+of+Primordium) is blowing up [Gauntlet of Power](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gauntlet+of+Power).
