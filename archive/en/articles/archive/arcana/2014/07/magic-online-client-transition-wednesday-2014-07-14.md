We don't always do reminders in Arcana, but when we do, we drink...wait, wait, no, that's not right.

Ahem, we don't always do reminders in Arcana, but when we do, it means we think it's important enough to tell you a second time. In this case, we want to make sure everyone gets the memo about The Big Change coming to *Magic Online*.

In his article nearly two weeks ago, executive producer for *Magic Online*, Worth Wollpert, announced the official shut off of the current *Magic Online* client on July 16, 2014. Turning off the current client means that, as of July 16 (this Wednesday!), we will remove the beta tag, and that client will become the only way to play *Magic Online*.


Worth's article also covers how user feedback has, and will continue to, aid the *Magic Online* team in improving the client, as well as our plans for further advancement in the future. You can [read Worth's article](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/magic-online-v3-date-and-new-client-update-2014-06-26) for the full details.
