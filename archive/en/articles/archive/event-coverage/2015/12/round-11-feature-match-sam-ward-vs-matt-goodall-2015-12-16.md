With the cut to the Top 8 looking to be at 10-3, both players needed to win to ensure themselves a place.
Matt Goodall was playing a rogish deck, which looked like 5 Color Green beatdown with utility to back it up such as Disenchant and Incinerate, and it seems to be an excellent choice for the field.



**Game 1**


Goodall's deck was lightning-fast with first turn Savannah, Skyshroud Elite, and when Ward dropped a Flood Plain the Elite got its +1/+2 bonus. When Goodall followed up with second turn Treetop Village, Rancor, the board was getting way out of hand. A Land Grant for a Taiga revealed Goodall's hand of Disenchant, Skyshroud Elite, Granger Guildmage and it was then that Ward knew the lone Oath he held in hand would not be enough to regain control. After Swords to Plowsharing the Elite, Ward untapped, Wastelanded Goodall's only source of white and dropped his Oath. All Goodall needed to do to finish Ward off was to draw a white source off the top and he did, Disenchanting the Oath and taking game 1.



**Game 2**


Ward chose to play first but again it was a game where Goodall had all the answers. Although he could only open with a first turn Granger and a countered second turn Skyshroud Elite, Goodall's third turn River Boa Pyroblasted through Ward's Force of Will. Ward dropped a Treetop Village to attempt to stop the Village that Goodall had played the turn before, however Goodall Wastelanded it and Incinerated Ward, who scooped up his cards is disgust.



**Final Result:** Goodall defeated Ward 2-0
