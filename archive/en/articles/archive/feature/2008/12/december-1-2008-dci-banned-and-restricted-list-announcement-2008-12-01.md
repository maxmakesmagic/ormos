**Please note:** This announcement has been changed since it was originally posted. Kokusho, the Evening Star has been added to the Commander banned list, and Crop Rotation has been removed from the Prismatic banned list.


**Announcement Date:** December 1, 2008  
**Effective Date:** December 20, 2008  
**Magic Online Effective Date:** December 10, 2008


### DCI Policy Change: Timing of Changes to the Banned and Restricted Lists


Updates to the Banned and Restricted Lists will continue to be announced quarterly, but the timing is changing. Starting later this month, announcements will take place on the following schedule:




|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Announcement Date** | **Effective Date** |
| December 20 | January 1 |
| March 20 | April 1 |
| June 20 | July 1 |
| September 20 | October 1 |

  
If an announcement date falls on a weekend or holiday, it will be released on the preceding business day.


The **Magic Online** effective date will be the Wednesday closest to the effective date.


The next Banned and Restricted List Announcement will be published on December 19, 2008.


**Standard, Vintage, Legacy, Extended, *Shards of Alara* Block Constructed**  
 No changes


### Magic Online Formats


**Format: Pauper**  
 Pauper is a **Magic Online** format in which all cards used must have been printed at the common rarity in a **Magic Online** set or product. Other than that, the usual rules for Constructed decks apply (a minimum deck size of 60 cards in the main deck, an optional 15-card sideboard, and so on). If a common version of a particular card was ever released on **Magic Online**, any versions of that card printed at other rarities are also legal in this format.


*Example:* Counterspell was a common card in the *Seventh Edition* core set, which was released on **Magic Online**. Counterspell was reprinted in *Masters Edition* *II* with an uncommon expansion symbol. Both versions of the card can be used in the Pauper format. 


*Example:* Hymn to Tourach, another uncommon from *Masters Edition II*, is not legal for use in the **Magic Online** Pauper format. Even though Hymn to Tourach was printed as a common in the *Fallen Empires* set, that set was never released on **Magic Online**.


**The banned list for Pauper is as follows:**  
 Cranial Plating is banned


**Formats: Singleton, 100 Card Singleton, Commander**  
 Previously, **Magic Online** had the Classic Singleton format and the 100 Card Singleton/Commander format. With this announcement, Classic Singleton is being eliminated, and the banned lists for 100 Card Singleton and Commander will be maintained separately.
