Often when discussing playtest cards, we talk about how creative or silly the playtest names are. Well, that isn't always the case. Often, when cards are tweaks of existing ones, the names end up being simply tweaks as well. The four cards below have names that reflect their "inspirations," which include the older cards [Fireslinger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fireslinger), [Priest of Titania](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Priest+of+Titania), [Gaseous Form](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gaseous+Form), [Ensnare](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ensnare), and [Ray of Command](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ray+of+Command).
