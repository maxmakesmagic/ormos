*Welcome to an unusual Rise of the Eldrazi preview article double feature! Latest Developments author Tom LaPille had plenty to say about today's preview card ... but so did developer Mike Turian. As we tried to decide which of them should write today's article, a voice deep in my cold black editorial heart whispered, "Why not both?"*


*Mike and Tom are both previewing the same card, but these two articles—like their authors—offer two very different development perspectives. The two articles don't reference each other; they can be read in whatever order you wish, and they both include the preview card.*


*Enjoy!*
