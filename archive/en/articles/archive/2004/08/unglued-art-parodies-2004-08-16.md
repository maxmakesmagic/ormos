As you’ll be hearing quite a bit this week, at its heart *Unglued* was a chance for **Magic** to parody itself.One of the ways *Unglued* did so was by having fun with the art aspect of cards. As Mark Rosewater points out in [his column this week](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/daily/mr137), “*Any part of the game was fair play. The mechanics. The names. The flavor text. The art. The legal text line. Nothing was off limits*.” So, with that in mind, here are the cards of Unglued with art that parodied or referenced art from other **Magic** cards, starting with some of the easiest and working our way up.

| **Reparations...** | **and Clambassadors** |
| Okay, some of those were easier than others. These two cards both feature
 similar action in their art, but it’s the flavor text that links them more obviously. |
