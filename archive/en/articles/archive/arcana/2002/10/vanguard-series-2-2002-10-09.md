*Vanguard* cards are special over-sized **Magic** cards (3" x 5" as opposed to 2 1/2" x 3 1/2") that offer a different way to play. Each card has an instruction that acts like a personal global enchantment, plus modifications to your starting/maximum hand size (in the left-hand circle) and life total (on the right). Obviously, both players have to agree to use them before the game begins. Below is the Selenia card (placed next to the [Selenia, Dark Angel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Selenia%2C+Dark+Angel) card for comparison).

These cards were used in several Arena seasons (starting in 1997). If you look around, you can find them at card shops and for sale online today.

Popular variants include each player randomly choosing a *Vanguard* card to play, or rotating *Vanguard* cards at determined intervals during a multiplayer game. But, of course, you can use *Vanguard* cards any way you want.

Here are the "official" rules, followed by the other seven cards form the second *Vanguard* series:

***Vanguard* Card**  
 The *Vanguardâ„¢* supplements consist of oversized cards that modify the game. A *Vanguard* card is selected before the game begins, adjusting a player's starting and maximum hand size and starting life total. Any abilities printed on a *Vanguard* card are played exactly like those of an in-play **Magic** card; however, these abilities have no color, and damage from them isn't damage from a permanent of any type or a source of any color. A *Vanguard* card isn't a **Magic** card, so it can't be affected by spells or abilities.
