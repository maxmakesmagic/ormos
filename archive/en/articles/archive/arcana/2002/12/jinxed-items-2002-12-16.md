When the story "arc" for *Tempest* and the rest of the block was being fleshed out, the writers thought it would be cool if each of the major races on Rath--the Kor, the Vec, and the Dal--had a jinxed item that was part of some greater whole.

The original intent was to put [Jinxed Idol](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jinxed+Idol) in *Tempest*, [Jinxed Ring](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jinxed+Ring) in *Stronghold*, and Jinxed Brooch in *Exodus*. The Brooch would spell out what happened if all three were in play simultaneously. Unfortunately, the whole idea was scrapped before *Exodus* was designed, so it was never really determined what Jinxed Brooch would do by itself, or what would happen when all three were combinedâ€¦ although it was probably something catastrophic.

The art for Jinxed Brooch had been commissioned in advance, however, and ended up on the *Exodus* card [Null Brooch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Null+Brooch).
