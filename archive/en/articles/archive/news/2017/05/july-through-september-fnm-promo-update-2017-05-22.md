It's that time again: time to update you on what Friday Night *Magic* promos will be gracing (hopefully) your trade binders in just a few short months. We're smack in the middle of the *Kaladesh* run of FNM cards, so let's review those first before moving on to the *Aether Revolt* batch.


So, currently and in the near future, here are the cards you can pick up at Friday Night *Magic*â€”the format's best removal spell and its most-played card.


**May**

**June**

So for what's left of May, you can grab an [Unlicensed Disintegration](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Unlicensed+Disintegration), and for the entire month of June you'll have a chance at snagging that gorgeous [Aether Hub](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aether+Hub). I know I want four.


It's hard to top those, but we're going to try. The next batch of cards are all from *Aether Revolt*, and they're all strong options.


**July**

Improvise players will find this promo intriguing, as [Jason Kang](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&artist=+%5b%22Jason+Kang%22%5d) updates the card that fuels those fun [Paradox Engine](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Paradox+Engine) decks in Standard.


**August**

While it hasn't taken off in Standard, [Renegade Rallier](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Renegade+Rallier) actually has a strong spot in the Modern metagame as fetch lands enable the powerful ability basically at will. The updated art from [David Palumbo](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&artist=+%5b%22David+Palumbo%22%5d) isn't too shabby either.


**September**

This is the one everyone will be pushing their way to FNM to snag. Alex Konstad shows us just what happens when a Kaladesh resident meets the wrong end of a hard shove.
