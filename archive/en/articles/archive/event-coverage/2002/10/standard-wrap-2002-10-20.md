It's always exciting to see how the pros tackle a new environment. Common consensus had it that it was more what was leaving the environment than what was being added that would define it. It takes a lot of work to figure out what works, and taking a crib sheet from the previous format does a lot to speed up the process. Still, there were a number of cards in *Onslaught* that showed obvious potential, and they could not be ignored. To say nothing of the fetch lands, the best dual lands since the real deal. Everyone knew they wanted to run those.

Interestingly, it was the more radical designs that fared the best, on average. Nassif's 3-0 deck in particular is an unforeseen collection of cards. Just looking at the 2-1's, though, you see forward-thinking designs: Humpherys's 'Tog, Kibler's Wake, Walamies's Neo Punisher. It was also nice to see blue-green, that old standby, finish up with egg on its face. It's been the boogieman for a while now, and it really got put in its place.

Without further ado, a brief look at the Invitationalists' Standard decks, and how they fared.

![Wonder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Wonder)**Blue-Green [Wonder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wonder) Dog**  
 Brian Davis 1-2  
 Chris Pikula 2-1   
 Alex Shvartsman 0-3Well, supposedly one should go with what works when one has no idea what to do. [Wonder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wonder) Dog lost all of [Yavimaya Coast](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Yavimaya+Coast) in the rotation, and gained the potent sideboard card [Naturalize](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Naturalize). That seems like a pretty good setup. However, the blue-green madness decks only went a combined 3-6, with 1-1 of that coming when Pikula and Davis crossed swords. Interestingly, Davis chose to run no *Onslaught* cards.

**Blue-Green-White Threshold**  
 Gary Wise 1-2  
 Eivind Nitter 0-3

This innovative design was played by both Gary Wise and Eivind Nitter in both Online Extended and New Standard. Playing like an ordinary blue-green threshold deck with [Standstill](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Standstill)s and threshold creatures, the deck gets extra gas from the amazing Onslaugh fetch lands, and splashes [Mystic Enforcer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mystic+Enforcer). [Worship](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Worship) can also win some matches hands down. Who can blame them for sticking with it, after the deck went 5-1 in Extended and only lost [Yavimaya Coast](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Yavimaya+Coast) in the transition? Things did not exactly go as planned for the dynamic duo, who reversed their results to a disappointing 1-5. Maybe Coasts do far more than balance your mana. Their debacle came with extra sting, since both were in striking distance of a Top 2 finish.

![Battle of Wits](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Battle+of+Wits)**[Battle of Wits](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Battle+of+Wits)**  
 Jon Finkel 3-0Finkeltron wound up third on tiebreakers despite an impressive run with the Battle deck. At the start of the day, though, he would glady have changed to another deck, calling his "horrible". He was thrilled with his success, but his initial reaction suggests that these results may lie. It is very similar in design to the [Battle of Wits](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Battle+of+Wits) decks that showed up very late in the OBC qualifier season, and adds fetch lands as well as utility cards from *Onslaught* like [Blackmail](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blackmail), [Complicate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Complicate) and [Smother](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Smother). 

**'Tog**  
 Dave Humpherys 2-1

No surprises here, The Hump sticks to his guns and updates [Psychatog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psychatog) for the new era. The loss of [Fact or Fiction](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fact+or+Fiction) and [Nightscape Familiar](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nightscape+Familiar) hit the deck like a ton of bricks. Humpherys's design patches the holes with card drawing, and emerges looking similar to the deck Ryan Fuller used to claim his Masters title. With tons of cantrips and more bounce than removal, he packs the graveyard setting up a big 'Tog kill. A pair of [Upheaval](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Upheaval)s provide the usual endgame. Surprisingly, the deck is packed with one-of's like [Chainer's Edict](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chainer%27s+Edict), [Circular Logic](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Circular+Logic) and [Smother](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Smother). More [Smother](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Smother)s wait in the sideboard, but it's definitely curious.

![Rorix Bladewing](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Rorix+Bladewing)**Green-Red Beats**  
 Itaru Ishida 2-1The quiet mastermind shocked everyone by showing up with something that didn't shock. After playing Akira Asahara's crazy four-color control deck in Online Extended, the Invitationalists braced themselves for more insanity. Instead, Ishida went back to the basics: monsters and burn. He added a pair of [Blistering Firecat](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blistering+Firecat)s and [Rorix Bladewing](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rorix+Bladewing) for extra oomph, but other than that, the design is what you would expect.

**Wake Decks**  
 Brian Kibler, 4-Color Wake 2-1  
 Jens Thoren, [Cunning Wish](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cunning+Wish) Wake 2-1

Trust Brian Kibler to come up with something spectacular in a fresh environment. His deck looks on the face of it to be a descendant of Pat Chapin's [Burning Wish](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Burning+Wish) Wake deck that was supposed to blow the roof off OBC. With the help of more cardsets it seems to have become a finely-tuned killing machine. Fetch lands, [Krosan Tusker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Krosan+Tusker)s and [Rampant Growth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rampant+Growth)s make the mana very civilized, and [Burning Wish](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Burning+Wish) provides outs for a number of otherwise disturbing situations. That, and it plays with huge spells, so it's a blast to watch.

Thoren's deck, like Thoren himself somewhat, is more focused and less flamboyant. It is a straight port of the European Wake design that emerged as King of the OBC Wake decks. The versatility of [Cunning Wish](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cunning+Wish) is just outrageous, and the relegation of victory conditions to the sideboard makes initial draws smoother. That said, the lack of *Onslaught* cards except for lands probably means there's room for improvement.

**Black-Green-Blue Aggro-Control (?)**  
 Gabriel Nassif 3-0

There's nothing like a new deck to shake things up. Nassif's takes the best cards his colors have to offer (Braids, Call, [Opposition](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Opposition), Looter, [Shadowmage Infiltrator](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shadowmage+Infiltrator)) and jams them together in a way that looks almost accidental. Don't be fooled. The combination of efficient threats, removal, and disruption is a winning one.

![Discombobulate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Discombobulate)**Old-School Blue-White**  
 Diego Ostrovich 0-3Innovation can also be punished, unfortunately. Diego Ostrovich went hog wild with the *Onslaught* cards, starting with [Mobilization](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mobilization), [Future Sight](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Future+Sight) and [Complicate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Complicate), but then going all the way to [Discombobulate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Discombobulate) and [Akroma's Vengeance](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Akroma%27s+Vengeance). The theory is that classic of blue-white control, tax your opponent's resources, deny them their key cards, and then win at your leisure. It didn't quite work out that way.

**Mono-Red Beatdown**  
 Dave Price 0-3

If there was any justice, Dave Price would sport a winning record. The King of Beatdown couldn't help himself, and with Top 2 probably out of reach he decided to throw caution to the wind and play with goblins. He in particularl loved the new [Goblin Piledriver](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Piledriver), who could show up on turn three and be [Reckless Charge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reckless+Charge)d for ridiculous damage. Sadly, his sideboard technology of [Threaten](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Threaten) didn't come up when he needed it to, and he finished the tournament in a manner unbefitting a king. To be fair, he cobbled this deck together in half and hour, so there might be something here.

**Blue-Black Braids**  
 Carlos Romao 1-2

Another evolution of an OBC deck, Romao added only Looters, fetch lands and [Smother](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Smother) to an already solid design. The [Nightmare](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nightmare)s combine with [Duress](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress), [Smother](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Smother) and [Chainer's Edict](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chainer%27s+Edict) to put the hurt on the opponent's resources, with the potential for quick Braids victories or death by Finkel. At least [Nantuko Shade](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nantuko+Shade) kills in a hurry. The design looks solid, if uninteresting. He does, however, get huge style points for including [Visara the Dreadful](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Visara+the+Dreadful) in his sideboard.

![Ravenous Baloth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Ravenous+Baloth)**Blue-Green [Opposition](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Opposition)**  
 Olivier Ruel 3-0  
  
 Ruel's deck is an odd one. At first glance it's clearly [Opposition](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Opposition), but then you look at the numbers and the cards he's running, and you wonder how much of it is by design. The inclusion of [Ravenous Baloth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ravenous+Baloth) is interesting. However, without [Fact or Fiction](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fact+or+Fiction) to speed things along, the deck plays a lot like "[Opposition](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Opposition) or no?"**Neo Punisher**  
 Tomi Walamies 2-1

Walamies secured his place in the finals with two quick victories with this, his new design. He dipped heavily into *Onslaught*, gaining the interaction between fetch-lands and [Weathered Wayfarer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Weathered+Wayfarer), as well as [Whipcorder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Whipcorder). The Speculation skeletan of the original OBC Punisher deck is still in place, as are the Tribes and [Patrol Hound](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Patrol+Hound)s. The addition of [Opposition](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Opposition) gives it a ridiculous punch.
