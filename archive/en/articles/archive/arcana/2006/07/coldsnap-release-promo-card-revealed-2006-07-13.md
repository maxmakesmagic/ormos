Marit Lage: an epic sorcerer [Wrath of Marit Lage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Wrath%2Bof%2BMarit%2BLage). Her thundering steps haven't been felt on Terisiare since she was locked in the glacier, but you already know that she waits, not dead, in those [Dark Depths](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dark+Depths).

*Not the release promo card.*
If you attend a [*Coldsnap* Release Tournament](/en/articles/archive/coldsnap-release-tournament-locations-2006-07-10), you'll finally be able to summon that indestructible 20/20.

*Marit Lage walks the earth again.*

That's right. It's a token card as the release promo—and might we add that it's only the biggest, baddest, most eldritch creature token in the history of trading card games? Don't wait 20 turns and miss your opportunity to tap for some snow mana, ripple up a 4-of and get your copy of a sorcerer gone mad.
