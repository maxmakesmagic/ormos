Two quick notes:



* The dividing line between "aggro" and "midrange" was typically the inclusion of [Sylvan Caryatid](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sylvan+Caryatid)---if it is trying to ramp into big stuff, then the deck is midrange; if it has more aggressive two-drops like [Heir of the Wilds](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Heir+of+the+Wilds), then it's an aggro deck.
* Half of the green devotion decks splashed black for [Doomwake Giant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Doomwake+Giant). The others were either mono-color, splashing planeswalkers like Ajani, Kiora, or Xenagos, or splashing [Villainous Wealth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Villainous+Wealth).


Overall, [Mantis Rider](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mantis+Rider) and [Siege Rhino](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Siege+Rhino) are still the cards to beat, but Standard's diversity looks to be holding up strong: there's a whole slew of other archetypes that are being played today.
