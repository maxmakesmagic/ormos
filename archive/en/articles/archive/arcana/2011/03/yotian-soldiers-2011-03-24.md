The first [Yotian Soldier](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Yotian+Soldier) appeared in *Antiquities*. The flavor text explains that Urza created the soldiers to protect his allies while he was busy elsewhere.

So how could this creature show up in the *Mirrodin* set when it's native to Dominaria? What are the odds of Memnarch creating exactly the same creature as Urza made on a different plane? The flavor text on the *Mirrodin* version explains:


> *Poets dream the verses of otherworldly stories. Artificers dream the blueprints of otherplanar artifacts.*
