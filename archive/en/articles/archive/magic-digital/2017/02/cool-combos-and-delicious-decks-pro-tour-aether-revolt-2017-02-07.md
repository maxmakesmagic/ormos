 Better known as NumotTheNummy, Kenji is a lover of all things Magic. A "legendary streamer," you can almost always find him playing Magic Online over at his Twitch channel. When he's not playing Magic, Kenji enjoys long walks on the beach, romantic comedies, and devouring the hopes and dreams of the innocent. 






Another Pro Tour has come and gone, this time with the wonderful set of *Aether Revolt*, and so it's time to take another gander at some of the awesome decks to come from that event. [Pro Tour *Aether Revolt*](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/ptaer) was supposed to be all about the devastating "Copycat" deck, one that used the combination of [Saheeli Rai](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Saheeli+Rai) and [Felidar Guardian](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Felidar+Guardian) to create an exorbitant number of hasty Cat Beast creatures to deal lethal damage in one turn. While that deck turned up in droves, it certainly was not the only great deck to make an appearance.


As with every recent Pro Tour, I've compiled gameplay videos of some of the decks that either performed very well, or perhaps decks that were just too awesome to not show off. (I'm looking at you, [Aetherflux Reservoir](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aetherflux+Reservoir)). If you like any of the decks you see, I hope you sleeve it up and give it a try. Some of these decks are just too fun.


Now that I've gone and mentioned [Aetherflux Reservoir](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aetherflux+Reservoir), why don't we start things off with that? Below you'll find video of me playing the deck. You can find the decklist in this [article](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/ptaer/round-14-white-blue-aetherflux-reservoir-2017-02-04) by my buddy Meghan Wolff. Enjoy!

Next up we have a deck that proved to be the real contender of Pro Tour *Aether Revolt*, Mardu Vehicles. With a staggering six Mardu Vehicles lists in the Top 8, many of the pros seemed to have opted to try and go faster and underneath the combo decks by defeating them before they could assemble any shenanigans. I've opted to showcase Paulo Vitor Damo da Rosa's deck, which you can find on the Top 8 decklists page [here](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/ptaer/top-8-decklists-2017-02-04).

A similarly aggressive deck, though of different colors, Martin JÅ¯za's Jund Energy Aggro deck was another exciting take on how to punish slow decks. This was probably my favorite deck to try from the Pro Tour, one that manages to function off of only 20 lands! You can find the decklist once again on [this](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/ptaer/top-8-decklists-2017-02-04) page.

The last deck I've decided to showcase is Ken Yukuhiro's Black-Green Constrictor. With an astounding record of 9-1 in Constructed, this deck seems to be the real deal and one that has powerful synergies. You can find Yukuhiro's decklist, as well as all the other decks that went 9-1 or better, [here](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/ptaer/27-30-point-standard-decklists-2017-02-04).

This Pro Tour taught us that even if there is a known enemy (Copycat), there is still plenty of innovation and play to be had. In spite of the recent bannings of [Smuggler's Copter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Smuggler%27s+Copter) and [Emrakul, the Promised End](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Emrakul%2C+the+Promised+End), solidified strategies have continued to show their respective power. Whether you enjoy Vehicles speeding off to victory, Snakes powering up robotic creatures, or endless Cats being used to destroy the opponent with cuteness, this Standard format has plenty to offer everyone.


As always, thank you for joining me, and don't forget to check out [my stream](https://www.twitch.tv/numotthenummy/) if you have any questions or comments.

*Hey everyone,* Magic Online *Digital Product Manager Lee Sharpe here. You might have noticed that Kenji didn't talk about his videos in terms of the* Magic Online *Pro Tour Gauntlet. The play patterns we were looking for with that event didn't quite materialize, so we've decided to retire the Pro Tour Gauntlet and instead focus our Gauntlet-producing efforts on the "Throwback Standard" Gauntlets you can read about* [*here*](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/magic-online/flashback-favorites-and-throwback-standard-gauntlets-2016-12-15)*. The first one begins at the end of this month, and we'll have more details on what decks it contains for you soon!*
