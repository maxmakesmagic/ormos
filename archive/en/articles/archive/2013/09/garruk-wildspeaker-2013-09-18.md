GARRUK WILDSPEAKER
==================



 Posted in [NEWS](/en/articles?source=MX_Nav2020)
 on September 18, 2013 










This green mage originally specialized is creature magic: spells that coax mana from the land, summon wild beasts, and unleash the powers of summoned creatures. That was, until he was cursed … Now his nature spells are tainted by black magic.


Garruk is a hunter to the core, a planeswalking predator whose hunting ground is the entire multiverse. Gripped with a need to test his might against greater and greater challenges, his life's calling is to triumph over the most dangerous game each plane can offer. These dangers have pushed his magic and creature summoning abilities far past their prior limits, and each day his collection of trophies grows.


But now he's faced a new kind of prey: a fellow Planeswalker. The death-witch Liliana Vess used the power of the Chain Veil artifact to curse Garruk, corrupting his power to summon wild beasts. As the curse takes hold, his fierce predator companions are becoming sickly fiends, while Garruk gains new, chilling powers of death. This only enrages him more.


Garruk won't stop until he's cured of this intolerable death-tainted state … if he can survive it.
