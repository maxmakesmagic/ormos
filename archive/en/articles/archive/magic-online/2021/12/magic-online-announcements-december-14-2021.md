*Vintage Masters* Flashback Draft League Ends Tomorrow
------------------------------------------------------


Unfortunately, the Super Jump event mentioned in the *Magic Online* *Innistrad: Crimson Vow* release article in November has been postponed due to an unforeseen issue. We will be fixing this issue and debuting Super Jump during *Kamigawa: Neon Dynasty* season next year! Stay tuned for this awesome mix of *Jumpstart* and *Legacy Cube*!


So, over the last week, we've been running a Flashback League (Phantom) with *Vintage Masters*. The entry options for this League are 10 Event Tickets or 100 Play Points, and the event ends tomorrow with downtime, so now is your last chance to play! Due to an issue with [Misthollow Griffin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Misthollow+Griffin), we've temporarily removed it from the *Vintage Masters* collation while this event is active.
