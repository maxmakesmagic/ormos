It's December, and in Northern Hemisphere that means it's getting chilly. Here in Renton, Washington, the snow has mostly held off so far, but that doesn't mean we can't check out some snowy **Magic** cards.


Apart from the five snow-covered lands ([Snow-Covered Plains](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snow-Covered+Plains), [Snow-Covered Island](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snow-Covered+Island), [Snow-Covered Swamp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snow-Covered+Swamp), [Snow-Covered Mountain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snow-Covered+Mountain), and [Snow-Covered Forest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snow-Covered+Forest)), six cards in **Magic** have the word "snow" in the title.


**Can you identify these six snowy cards from their art?** Hint: like the snow-covered lands, they all appeared in the *Ice Age* set.
