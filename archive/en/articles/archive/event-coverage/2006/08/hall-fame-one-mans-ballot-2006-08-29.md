Hi everyone, this is Michael 'elf' Feuell, Senior Software Engineer here at Wizards of the Coast, taking some time away from ***Magic** Online* to discuss my picks for the Hall of Fame ballot!

First, I took a look at [all the statistics](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgevent/hof/stats2) we made public and then sorted each of them. (Statistics include # PTs, PT Top 8s, Top 8 Avg, Median Finish, GP Top 8s, Career Winnings, Pro Points, Avg Points.)

Each time a player was in the top 10 of a list I gave them one point, and each time they were in the top 5 of a list I gave them an additional point. This gave me an overall number that I labeled stats.

I then added points for some additional categories, such as; contribution to the community, Invitational winner, Pro Tour legend, and then finally deducted points for shadiness. In the end I summed it all up and came up with a list of five people who clearly stood ahead of everyone else.

- Robert Maher

- Robert Dougherty

- David Humpherys

- Scott Johns

- Mark Justice
Before I actually looked at and evaluated the data. I had some preconceived ideas as to the relative merit of each player. Once I had looked at the data, though, I was amazed by just how strong Bob's performances over the years had been. Likewise I was a bit surprised that Mike Long's overall performance was not even in the top 10.

All five people have at least four Pro Tour Top 8s, with only Justice having them all courtesy of individual performance.

The next few people on my list were Gary Wise, Raphael Levy and Itaru Ishida. Best of luck to them all.
