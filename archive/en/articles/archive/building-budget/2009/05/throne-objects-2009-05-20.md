How many of you made it to Regionals this weekend? I myself drove down to Edison, New Jersey to get in a few drafts in the afternoon. One thing was obvious to me as I wandered around the top tables: aggro is the name of the game right now in Standard. Decks with thirty or more creatures (I'm counting [Spectral Procession](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spectral+Procession) and [Bitterblossom](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bitterblossom)) are consistently doing well in the new Standard. This is pretty odd if you think about it, but I'm chalking it up to the natural progression of the game. I don't think there's ever been a Standard that required so much combat math.

Today I'm going to talk about a deck that beats all these pesky creatures.

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/boab/boab39_sigilSplash.jpg)  
[Sigil of the Empty Throne](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sigil+of+the+Empty+Throne) is a card that hasn't been talked about as much as one might expect. Normally, a card like this gets printed and everyone goes out and buys four of them so they can build a deck around it. That hasn't happened with this card, which is quite puzzling. When *Conflux* was first printed I read through the spoiler and stopped on this card. I remember thinking that the effect was pretty powerful. I spoke with Zvi Mowshowitz, and he told me that it was "a real card." The proper metagame for a deck built around a five-mana enchantment is pretty narrow, but I believe we have reached that point in time.

![Sigil of the Empty Throne](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Sigil+of+the+Empty+Throne)  
Many of you may be scared of Quasali Pridemage from the green-white decks. It's just a hunch, but I'm pretty sure all those decks will have upgraded to [Knotvine Paladin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Knotvine+Paladin) or [Steward of Valeron](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Steward+of+Valeron). (My testing has shown these two cards to be much better than Pridemage against the expected metagame.)



|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Knotvine Paladin | Steward of Valeron |

The deck is pretty basic. You play cards like [Recumbent Bliss](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Recumbent+Bliss) and [Pacifism](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pacifism) to slow your opponent down, and eventually you draw a [Sigil of the Empty Throne](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sigil+of+the+Empty+Throne) (or [Idyllic Tutor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Idyllic+Tutor)). The [Sigil of the Empty Throne](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sigil+of+the+Empty+Throne) acts as the deck's [Cruel Ultimatum](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cruel+Ultimatum). Your opponent is basically counting down to the point where you untap with Sigil. You can expect to make a free 4/4 flyer every turn afterward. The most exciting thing is that every 4/4 you make will shut off another of your opponent's threats.

I'll put a list together and explain the card choices.

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/boab/boab39_theCardsHeader.jpg)  
**[Sigil of the Empty Throne](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sigil+of+the+Empty+Throne):** The cornerstone of the deck. Drawing multiples isn't even the end of the world. You can simply double up on Sigils and make two Angels every turn. Remember to watch out for [Maelstrom Pulse](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Maelstrom+Pulse), though. I haven't seen many decks playing with the Pulse, but the power level of the card is high enough that it's worth mentioning that you should be careful to play around it.

**[Runed Halo](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Runed+Halo):** [Runed Halo](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Runed+Halo) is one of the most powerful cards in Standard. It's good against everyone. It's not just sideboard tech for beating [Anathemancer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Anathemancer) when you're piloting your [Vivid Creek](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vivid+Creek) deck. No, the Halo is the realness and it's about time it starts getting some respect.

**[Oblivion Ring](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oblivion+Ring):** The versatility of this card is key. It can take out important cards like [Story Circle](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Story+Circle) or planeswalkers or it can simply deal with a creature.

**[Endless Horizons](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Endless+Horizons):** Another underplayed card that is very powerful in practice. With [Endless Horizons](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Endless+Horizons) in play you draw an actual card every turn, and you also never miss a land drop. I'm planning on running 24 [Plains](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plains) as my lands, so [Endless Horizons](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Endless+Horizons) is almost a one-sided [Howling Mine](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Howling+Mine). Think of it as a [Phyrexian Arena](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phyrexian+Arena) without the drawback.

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/boab/boab39_theCardsCross1.jpg)  
**[Mind Stone](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mind+Stone):** Our deck has a lot of big spells that cost five mana. I want to play a spell that accelerates us into our [Sigil of the Empty Throne](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sigil+of+the+Empty+Throne) or [Hallowed Burial](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hallowed+Burial). If you draw it when you have [Endless Horizons](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Endless+Horizons) in play, you can simply sacrifice it for a new card.

**[Hallowed Burial](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hallowed+Burial):** I like [Hallowed Burial](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hallowed+Burial) better than [Wrath of God](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wrath+of+God) in a deck like this. Almost everyone is running [Kitchen Finks](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kitchen+Finks) or [Murderous Redcap](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Murderous+Redcap) these days, and a lot of the time you will be forced to play a [Pacifism](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pacifism) or [Curse of Chains](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Curse+of+Chains) on one of these creatures simply to prevent it from attacking you. If you play a [Wrath of God](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wrath+of+God) in a situation like this you're giving your opponent a free threat. I'd rather pay one more mana and ensure the "deadness" of my opponent's team. It obviously helps that [Hallowed Burial](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hallowed+Burial) is much more budget-friendly, but I don't think [Wrath of God](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Wrath%2Bof%2BGod) is a better card in a deck like this.

**[Pacifism](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pacifism):** Classic white removal. It's nice that it's an enchantment too.

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/boab/boab39_theCardsCross2.jpg)  
**[Recumbent Bliss](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Recumbent+Bliss):** The anti-Pillory is a pretty nice card. The extra life will help offset any attacking.

**[Curse of Chains](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Curse+of+Chains):** [Pacifism](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pacifism)s five through eight.

**[Idyllic Tutor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Idyllic+Tutor):** Where's my [Sigil of the Empty Throne](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sigil+of+the+Empty+Throne)?

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/boab/boab39_theCardsFooter.jpg)  
Many of you may be wondering, "Where's the [Story Circle](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Story+Circle)?" The truth is, I don't think [Story Circle](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Story+Circle) is a very strong card. I want to tap out for Sigil on turn five. I'll probably just die to an [Overrun](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Overrun) or Ajani if I've been busy pumping mana into a [Story Circle](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Story+Circle) instead of playing real removal.

**The Mana:** Nothing fancy, just twenty-four basic [Plains](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plains).

I play a land and pass. My opponent plays a [Ghitu Encampment](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ghitu+Encampment) and passes back. I draw a [Plains](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plains), play [Mind Stone](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mind+Stone), and pass again. My opponent plays a [Figure of Destiny](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Figure+of+Destiny) and makes it a 2/2. I draw another [Plains](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plains), play my land and [Idyllic Tutor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Idyllic+Tutor) (finding [Sigil of the Empty Throne](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sigil+of+the+Empty+Throne)) and pass. My opponent plays another land and plays a [Boggart Ram-Gang](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Boggart+Ram-Gang) and attacks me for 5. I draw [Endless Horizons](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Endless+Horizons), play my fourth land, and play [Hallowed Burial](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hallowed+Burial).

I play [Sigil of the Empty Throne](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sigil+of+the+Empty+Throne). My opponent makes his Figure a 4/4 and attacks me down to 11. I draw a [Runed Halo](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Runed+Halo), play the Halo naming [Flame Javelin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flame+Javelin), and play one of my [Recumbent Bliss](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Recumbent+Bliss)es on his Figure. My opponent plays a fourth land, plays a [Mogg Fanatic](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mogg+Fanatic), and passes. I draw a [Plains](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plains), play [Endless Horizons](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Endless+Horizons), attack for 4, and pass. My opponent [Flame Javelin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flame+Javelin)s one of my Angels. On his turn he draws a fifth land, and plays a [Flame Javelin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flame+Javelin) targeting my other untapped angel. He attacks for one. The next turn I draw another [Runed Halo](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Runed+Halo). I play it naming [Incinerate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Incinerate), then play another [Recumbent Bliss](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Recumbent+Bliss) on his Figure (just for the Angel and the life). I attack for another 4, and my opponent concedes.

The deck performed pretty well. I'm not sure if the matchup I lost is bad. It seems pretty good in the abstract, but being mana-light in one game and getting double Scullered in another makes matters pretty bad.

I hope everyone enjoyed this deck. Hit the forums and tell me what you think.

Happy brewing!
