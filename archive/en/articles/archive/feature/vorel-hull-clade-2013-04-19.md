When we began unveiling the maze runners of *Dragon's Maze*, we begin getting a better look at the stories of Ravnica. The Simic maze runner is Vorel of the Hull Clade and he's not what you might expect.


Here's an excerpt from the creative team's world guide:


*The human biomancer Vorel was formerly the leader of a small Gruul clan. But when he gave the order to concede territory to a growing Boros garrison in order to secure his own clan’s turf, the clan turned on him. He was nearly killed before escaping.*

The entry goes on to describe the fact that Vorel, as a member of the Gruul, was a shaman of sorts. He brought these skills and the mindset to the Simic, discovering that his strategic mind actually lent itself well to being a member of the Simic rather than the Gruul. He wasn't a perfect fit for the guild, though; his emotionally charged background still shines through from time to time, leading him to be a bit more emotionally driven than others in the Combine.


How will he fare in the Implicit Maze? You'll have to wait to find out!
