From time to time, we like to show the art description for a **Magic** card, followed by the art. This is so you can see how the artist interpreted the creative team's ideas. And it's good fun. But today, let's turn it around. First up, let's look at the art for [Grimgrin, Corpse-Born](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grimgrin%2C+Corpse-Born).

Neat, right? Ah, but there are things you don't know about Grimgrin. Things you *couldn't* know ... unless you had access to the art description, that is!



> 
> Color: Blue/Black creature 
> 
> 
> Action: Grimgrin is a notorious skaab, the undead creation of a mad alchemist, that is rampaging across the moorland. He's at least 10' tall with a misshapen body and humped back. One leg is longer than the other, and it drags behind him when he walks. His face is terrifying: a mass of stitches and lopsided features from different corpses. The fiend is yours to design. Perhaps instead of hands he has huge bladed weapons, or masses of chains, for example. His overall silhouette should be super-exaggerated and asymmetrical. 
> 
> 
> Focus: The zombie scourge
> 
> 
> Mood: Many have tried to stop him. All have failed. His homicidal march toward the city of Thraben continues. 
>

And now you know the *rest* of the story.
