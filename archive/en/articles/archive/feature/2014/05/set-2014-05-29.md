Although *Conspiracy* takes place on Fiora, not all of the art in the *Conspiracy* set was limited to that plane. An obvious example would be the new art for [Rout](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rout).

**Q:** What plane does this art take place on?


* Mirrodin - Right! This is during the war before Mirrodin succumbs to become New Phyrexia.
* New Phyrexia - Wrong!

All right, I got a little sneaky with the "easy" one, sorry about that. Now onto a few other arts to show:

[Mortify](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mortify) | Art by [Nils Hamm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&artist=%5B%22Nils%20Hamm%22%5D)


**Q:** What plane does this art take place on?


* Innistrad - Wrong!
* Mirrodin - Wrong!
* Ravnica - Wrong!


That one is actually not a new commission; it was first used in *Deul Decks: Sorin vs. Tibalt*, and as such was commissioned without a specific setting so that it is easier to be reused.


How about that awesome art—pretty amazing right? Major kudos to the artists and our creative team responsible for producing such amazing pieces.
