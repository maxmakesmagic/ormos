Listed below are the results from the Selection Committee and Players Committee for the 2010 Hall of Fame class. Voters were asked to vote for up to five candidates, and all players earning 40% or more of the weighted combined votes earned spots in the Hall.


The results were weighted using the following formula:  

(SC%\*.67) + (PC%\*.33)


This formula was adjusted after the initial ballot results were posted due to an inconsistency between the official rules and the formula that had been used in previous years.


There were 129 ballots cast by Selection Committee members and 102 ballots cast by Players Committee members. Individual ballots will not be made public.


*Note: Selection Committee votes for Marco Blume were inadvertently left off the original publication of these results. His updated total is reflected below.*
