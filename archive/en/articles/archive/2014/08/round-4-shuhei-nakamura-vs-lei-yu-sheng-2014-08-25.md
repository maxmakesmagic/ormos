 Being at the perfect score for the first third of the day is a good feeling but Lei was not pleased to be paired against Hall of Famer Shuhei Nakamura. [Armed](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Armed) with a Jund Monsters deck, splashing black for [Dreadbore](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dreadbore), [Reaper of the Wilds](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reaper+of+the+Wilds) and [Rakdos's Return](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rakdos%27s+Return), Lei would need to play exceptionally well to beat Nakamura's streamlined Mono Black Devotion deck.




**Game One**




 Nakamura kickstarted the game with double [Thoughtseize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtseize), quickly removing [Courser of Kruphix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Courser+of+Kruphix) and [Domri Rade](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Domri+Rade) from Lei's grip. He continued the disruption with a [Lifebane Zombie](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lifebane+Zombie) on turn three, netting [Reap](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reap)er of the Wild this time.




 Lei did manage to peel a replacement [Reaper of the Wilds](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reaper+of+the+Wilds), but Nakamura trumped with [Desecration Demon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Desecration+Demon), a much faster clock than the gorgon was. Lei could only attempt to race by attacking [Reaper of the Wilds](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reaper+of+the+Wilds), while finishing off the intimidating zombie with [Mizzium Mortars](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mizzium+Mortars).




 Nakamura denied him two mana and "demonic sacrificial fodder" by pointing [Bile Blight](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bile+Blight) at a pair of [Elvish Mystic](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elvish+Mystic)s, allowing Lei to Scry twice. This didn't net him anything useful, but [Domri Rade](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Domri+Rade) was able to help him tank a hit from the [Desecration Demon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Desecration+Demon).




 Turn 5 [Pack Rat](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pack+Rat) with 3 mana open was the final nail in the coffin though. When Lei passed the turn dropping a relatively-underwhelming [Courser of Kruphix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Courser+of+Kruphix), Nakamura simply made a copy of [Pack Rat](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pack+Rat)s, before untapping and casting another from his hand.






*A flurry of hand disruption from Nakamura quickly destroy's Lei's chances.*
