Blake is the content manager for DailyMTG.com, making him the one you should email if you have thoughts on the website, good or less good (or not good). He's a longtime coverage reporter and hasn't turned down a game of Magic in any format ever. 






A lot happened in the past week, so much so that it's possible you missed something if you weren't glued to your computer screen for the literal last seven days.


So let's break it down, day-by-day, what you might have missed, complete with links.


Monday
======


"[Metamorphosis 2.0](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/making-magic/metamorphosis-2-0-2017-06-12)" announced a number of ways we're reshaping *Magic* going forward, including no new small sets, the return of core sets, and much more. This one is definitely a must read.


Tuesday
=======


On Tuesday we had two items of note. In one, [Jeffrey Steefel talked about what's happening under our *Magic* Digital Next umbrella](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/magic-digital/magic-digital-next-update-2017-06-13).


[In the other](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/feature/june-13-2017-banned-and-restricted-announcement-2017-06-13), we banned [Aetherworks Marvel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aetherworks+Marvel) from Standard and announced there would be no B&R announcements until August 28.


Wednesday
=========


This was the big one! We announced a slate of many, many products for our 25th anniversary year—including a new *Un*- set; a return to Dominaria; and *Ixalan*, which features Pirates and Dinosaurs!


Check out [all of the text here](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/news/25th-anniversary-announcement-day-2017-06-14), and there's also a fun video we shot just for this occasion.

===========================================


Thursday
========


Organized Play announced two bits of information about the Pro Tour in 2018, including a Team Trios Pro Tour. [Read the whole announcement here](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/organized-play/playing-pro-tour-2017-06-15).


Friday
======


*Hour of Devastation* previews kicked off with the [Massive *Magic* event](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/gplv17/nicol-bolas-brings-devastation-to-vegas-2017-06-16) that featured a ton of cards. You can check out today's [Card Image Gallery](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/card-image-gallery/hour-devastation) to see the cards you might have missed.


We also showed off the set's new [mechanics](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/feature/hour-devastation-mechanics-2017-06-16) and [promo cards](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/card-preview/promos-and-planeswalker-decks-hour-devastation-2017-06-16)!


Saturday and Sunday
===================


If you watched the stream over the weekend, you might have caught the reveal of almost every single *Hour of Devastation Invocation*. Almost. We've saved two of them for when those cards are revealed. Stay tuned.


But if you missed any of that, you're in luck because we've published every *Masterpiece* that we previewed over the weekend in an article that's also up today. [Here it is!](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/feature/masterpiece-series-hour-devastation-invocations-2017-06-19)
