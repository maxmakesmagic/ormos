**Age:** 24



**Occupation:** IT consultant



**Hometown:** Paris, France



**Previous Magic accomplishments:**


Finished in the money at the last four Modern GPs. Played a couple of Pro Tours



**What deck did you play this weekend, and why?**


Grixis Twin, a good compromise between classic [Splinter Twin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Splinter+Twin) and Grixis Control. People sideboard in many useless removal spells.



**What was the best card in your main deck, and why?**


[Snapcaster Mage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snapcaster+Mage). Even better now with [Kolaghan's Command](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kolaghan%27s+Command).



**What was the best card out of your sideboard, and why?**


[Keranos, God of Storms](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Keranos%2C+God+of+Storms). Great to play a control game post-board. Awesome against Jund and Abzan.

Played [Magus of the Moon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Magus+of+the+Moon) against an Amulet/Bloom player who had just cast [Seal of Primordium](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seal+of+Primordium).

**What deck did you play this weekend, and why?**


[Scapeshift](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scapeshift). I love the challenge of playing in a field full of [Blood Moon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Moon)s. And it's secretly a control deck.



**What was the best card in your main deck, and why?**


[Scapeshift](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scapeshift) and [Cryptic Command](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cryptic+Command).



**What was the best card out of your sideboard, and why?**


[Inferno Titan](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inferno+Titan). After sideboarding it often goes unopposed.

I currently do not have the brain power to process this.
