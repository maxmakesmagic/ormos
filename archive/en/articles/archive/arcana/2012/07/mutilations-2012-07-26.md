The card [Mutilate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=35194) made its appearance in *Torment*, where it looked like this.

Then it went away for a long time, because it was very powerful. It made a reappearance in *Duel Decks: Garruk vs. Liliana*, where it looked like this.

But since its first apperance in *Torment* back in 2002, [Mutilate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mutilate) hasn't been in a regular set. Until ***Magic** 2013*! And now it looks like this.
