Blake is the content manager for DailyMTG.com, making him the one you should email if you have thoughts on the website, good or less good (or not good). He's a longtime coverage reporter and hasn't turned down a game of Magic in any format ever. 






We do love announcing our announcements, but you should pay special attention to this one.


All fall, we've been offering [small glimpses](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/competitive-gaming/2019-schedules-pro-tour-qualifying-and-magicfest-2018-10-04) into the [future of competitive *Magic* gaming](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/competitive-gaming/2019-feature-six-pro-tours-2018-09-06), and we know you have questions. On December 6 at The Game Awards (and on this website), you will get answers.


So, we ask that you're just a *little* bit more patient with us. It will be worth the wait.
