Very rarely, a submitted piece of art is "vast" enough that it provides enough material for *two* cards!

When *Odyssey* was being laid out, liberal art-shuffling left [Gallantry](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gallantry) "out in the cold" with no acceptable art at all. To solve the problem, the painting for [Repentant Vampire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Repentant+Vampire) was split in half, and the woman was used for Gallantry.

You can see the entire original painting below.
