Black-Green splashing blue, because two Mythics are great! 7-2.

3-0 and 2-0-1. Izzet and Dimir. My decklists are on my Twitter 

**What did you play in Sealed on Day 1? Why? What was your record?**


Record 6-1. Blue-Black splash red and green.


**What was your hardest choice building your Sealed deck?**


I could have built my mian deck a bit greedier, adding another red card and another green card. I went with the conservative build knowing I would have good options post-board.


**What did you Draft on Day 2? Why? What were your records?**


Black-Green – 3-0  

White-Green – 1-1, ID


**What card(s) surprised you this weekend, and why?**


[Necrotic Wound](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Necrotic+Wound). It was a valuable removal spell in a color pair (Black-Green) that needed to protect the skies.


**What does making this Top 8 mean to you?**


I think it locks me for Gold in the upcoming cycles.


**What’s your guild affiliation are you in real life, why? (Be honest)**


Izzet.

**Age:** 30


**Occupation:** Magic


**Previous Magic Accomplishments:**  

Grand Prix Los Angeles winner < 2 months ago


**What did you play in Sealed on Day 1? Why? What was your record?**


Izzet because the best cards in my pool were [Niv-Mizzet, Parun](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Niv-Mizzet%2C+Parun) and Expansion//Explosion. 7-2 record.


**What was your hardest choice building your Sealed deck?**


Whether to splash black for two removal spells with Niv-Mizzet in my deck. I did not and ususally boarded in black.


**What did you Draft on Day 2? Why? What were your records?**


3-0 Izzet because I saw a Blue-Red Guildmage pick three and I had two red cards.  

2-0-1 Boros because I opened [Boros Challenger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Boros+Challenger), [Izoni, Thousand-Eyed](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Izoni%2C+Thousand-Eyed), and Golgari Finebroker, so I took the standalone card and stuck to it.


**What card(s) surprised you this weekend, and why?**


Invert [Invert//Invent]. I attacked Vedalkan Mesmerist into [Wishcoin Crab](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wishcoin+Crab) and inverted the crab and an 0/4 [Crackling Drake](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crackling+Drake).

One step closer to Gold and the bigtime.
