The July 21, 2016 Update

The Daily *Magic* Update is a roundup of everything *Magic* you should know on July 21, 2016. Today's Update is brought to you by the third side to every story.


Today's Must
============


1. [*Eldritch Moon* Flavor Gems](http://www.gatheringmagic.com/snacktimewithmikeandant-07212016-snack-time-36-eldritch-moon-flavor-gems/) | Snack Time with Mike and Ant | Mike Linnemann and Ant Tessitore

Let's pause for a moment on all the brewing and new deck talk and just savor some flavor. Ahhh, flavor. Mike and Ant talk about their favorite flavorful cards in this week's podcast, coming in at a scant 37 minutes—slightly off pace from our No. 2.


After That, Read, Watch, or Listen to These
===========================================


1. [*Eldritch Moon* Set Review: Rare and Mythic Rare](http://lrcast.com/limited-resources-346-eldritch-moon-set-review-rare-and-mythic-rare/) | Limited Resources | Marshall Sutcliffe and Owen Turtenwald

Luis Scott-Vargas continues to be on baby vacation (i.e. paternity leave), so Owen Turtenwald gets to shoulder some of the blame for two and a half hours of Limited reviews of the rare and mythic rares of *Eldritch Moon*. I did the math. That's roughly 2.3 minutes per rare, if you count both sides of the double-faced and meld cards.


And now you have that bit of useless information rattling around in your head. At any rate, listen to the show. These are highlights of release season.


1. [My Hall of Fame Ballot](http://www.channelfireball.com/articles/my-2016-hall-of-fame-ballot/) | ChannelFireball | Luis Scott-Vargas

Well that's awkward. Don't tell Marshall that Luis is working during baby vacation. Though, given his ballot, I certainly don't think Owen will mind that this is what Luis is working on.


I will add, from the ballots I'm seeing online (I have no special insight into the votes we're receiving), Luis's ballot seems to be the most common ballot, or some close variation of it. I would not be shocked if his ballot ends up closely resembling the final inducted class.


And if you want more on the Hall of Fame, or just love parsing stats, Paul Jordan parsed them for you in [another article on ChannelFireball today](http://www.channelfireball.com/articles/the-2016-hall-of-fame-contenders/).


1. [*Eldritch Moon* with Sam Stoddard 2](http://www.commanderinmtg.com/2016/07/20/e056a-eldritch-moon-with-sam-stoddard-2-commanderin-mtg-podcast.html) | Commanderin' | Phil DeLuca, Nate Burgess, and Sean Whatson

Part 2 of the Commanderin' podcast's interview with *Eldritch Moon* Lead Developer Sam Stoddard, where he talks about the latest set as well as what it's like to work in R&D. The first part can be listened to [here](http://www.commanderinmtg.com/2016/07/13/e055-eldritch-moon-with-sam-stoddard-commanderin-mtg-podcast.html).


1. [Advice from a Political Parvenu](http://www.hipstersofthecoast.com/2016/07/command-etiquette-advice-political-parvenu/) | Hipsters of the Coast | Jess Stirba

This is rare—a rebuttal to a rebuttal *and* the original piece. Jess Stirba weighs in on the Commander politics discussion that took place yesterday between two writers and says they both have it wrong. They say there are two sides to every story—but Jess thinks if that's the case, you're not looking at enough sides.


1. [*Magic: The Gathering* Gameshow—Windmillionaire #6](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqqjcjT2jGI) | Windmill Slam

Part game-show, part multiplayer *Magic*, Windmillionaire is quickly becoming one of the most fun video series produced on *Magic*.

What to Watch TODAY
===================


1. [Streamer Showdown](http://magic.wizards.com/en/MTGO/articles/archive/magic-online/magic-online-announcements-july-19-2016#item4)

Today at 1 p.m. and 6 p.m. PT (4 p.m. and 9 p.m. ET), all kinds of *Magic* streamers will be competing in the Streamer Showdown, featuring some hot, hot *Vintage Cube* action. Each of the streamers will be streaming their own draft and play, so click the link above to get links to everyone involved, and you can pretty effectively hop between streams. It's a fun event with a lot of great personalities playing *Magic*, and a wonderful workout for your alt+tab reflexes.


What People Are Talking About
=============================


1. [*Magic* is Everywhere. Wanted to introduce our little community from the other end of the world.](https://np.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/4ts25j/magic_is_everywhere_wanted_to_introduce_our/)

We know *Magic* has a worldwide following. We translate into ten languages and have strong followings on Europe, Asia, and South America. But Almaty, Kazakhstan, was not on our radar. Regardless, they have a thriving, if small, community in Kazakhstan despite not having any local stores. Check out [all of the photos here](https://imgur.com/a/CRKwG).

So, yesterday, on Blogatog (Mark Rosewater's Tumblr), he was asked about Treefolk, said they were the hardest creatures to draw, and then drew one to prove his point. It became named Bark Rosewater, and the internet ran with it, as you can see from the tweet above ([and subsequent Reddit post](https://np.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/4tuktj/an_hour_after_maro_created_bark_rosewater_i/)).


The internet, everyone!


Decks of the Day
================


1. [Raphaël Lévy's Mono-Red Burn](http://magic.tcgplayer.com/db/article.asp?ID=13405&writer=TCGplayer+Staff&articledate=7-21-2016)

Okay, that's enough of a break from new decks. In today's [review of red on TCGPlayer](http://magic.tcgplayer.com/db/article.asp?ID=13405&writer=TCGplayer+Staff&articledate=7-21-2016) (and these group reviews are super cool if you haven't already checked them out), Raphaël Lévy gave his first draft of what he thinks a Mono-Red Burn deck could look like in new Standard. It leans heavily on creatures (though [Impetuous Devils](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Impetuous+Devils) is barely a creature) and includes a number of cards from *Eldritch Moon*, but that's about as much explanation as it takes. If you're not sure what an aggressive mono-red deck is supposed to do—well...


Welcome to *Magic*! We're glad to have you!
