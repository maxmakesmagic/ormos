![Azorius Signet: Silver frame. Evermind: Blue frame.](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/mtgcom/arcana1000/1064_eversignet.jpg)As the [Comprehensive Rules](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=magic/comprules) remind us, a card's color is identified by its mana cost, not by what its frame looks like.

So logically, an artifact, as a card that has no colored mana symbols, should be colorless.


But then there's that old Golden Rule:



> *103.1. Whenever a card's text directly contradicts these rules, the card takes precedence. The card overrides only the rule that applies to that specific situation. The only exception is that a player can concede the game at any time (see rule 102.3a).*

Which helps explain what's going on in this *Dissension* card:


[Transguild Courier](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Transguild%2BCourier)


Yep, it's an artifact. And yep, it has a gold (i.e. multicolor) frame. [Transguild Courier](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Transguild+Courier)'s rules text, rather than its mana cost, has taken precedence in determining the frame color. This is similar to [Evermind](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Evermind), a card that has no mana cost but bears the phrase "Evermind is blue" in its rules text. The frame of a **Magic** card is just a reminder, not the actual determiner of the card's color. 


But thanks to that funky line in [Transguild Courier](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Transguild+Courier)'s rules text, it interacts well with cards like [Blessing of the Nephilim](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blessing+of+the+Nephilim), [Might of the Nephilim](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Might+of+the+Nephilim), [Bound // Determined](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bound+%2F%2F+Determined), [Coalition Victory](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Coalition+Victory), [Spirit of Resistance](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spirit+of+Resistance), [All Suns' Dawn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=All+Suns%27+Dawn) and [Meteor Crater](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Meteor+Crater) (look 'em up!).


Then again, it's vulnerable to [Red Elemental Blast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Red+Elemental+Blast), [Western Paladin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Western+Paladin), [Lifeforce](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lifeforce), [Lawbringer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lawbringer), and [King Crab](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=King+Crab), along with just about every other color hoser in the game. So, benefit or drawback? Depends on the game! 


Note that, in John Avon's art, the [Transguild Courier](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Transguild+Courier) is constructed of gold-colored metals, and even has small gems along its belt to indicate its multiple-color allegiance.
