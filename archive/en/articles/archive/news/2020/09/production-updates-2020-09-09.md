*Update 9/17: The text below has been updated to reflect the current timeline.*


Due to production issues, some *Zendikar Rising* and *Commander Legends* products will experience delays at launch.


Initial allocations of *Zendikar Rising* will be arriving in North American locations in two waves. The first wave is facing delays in North America, and some locations may not receive their full shipment of Draft and Set Boosters in time for launch. This does not affect product for prerelease weekend. The second wave is subsequently delayed as well. As a result, some North AmericanÂ locations may experience limited availability until the second wave arrives. Please contact your local store to check on product availability.


Additionally, *Zendikar Rising* Bundles in North America and the Asia-Pacific region will be delayed and will arrive in stores as soon as possible, though they are unlikely to be available at launch.


Production delays have also pushed back the release of *Commander Legends* Collector Boosters, which will now release November 20. This shift only affects Collector Boosters. All other *Commander Legends* products are still on track to release November 6. However, in the Asia-Pacific region, Commander decks associated with *Commander Legends* will be released on November 20.


Finally, regarding *Jumpstart*, we expect to have updates on these shipments very soon and will share that information as soon as we are able.


We appreciate your continued patience during these delays. We know excitement for these products is high, and we plan to deliver them as quickly as possible under the circumstances.
