By now, you are aware that *Alara Reborn* is coming. Right? Because if you weren't, let us help you get on the trolley: *Alara Reborn* is coming! And when it comes, it's bringing intro packs with it!


First up, we have *Legion Aloft*, a saucy little blue-white number.

Next, blue-black has some *Unnatural Schemes*. That's just like blue-black, isn't it?

Look out! Black-red is *Dead Ahead*!

Unsurprisingly, the red-green Intro Pack is a real *Rumbler*.

And resolving the cycle, the green-white intro pack is called *Eternal Siege*.
