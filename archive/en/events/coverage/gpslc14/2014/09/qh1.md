 Stybs has played Magic the world over, writing and drafting as part of the event coverage team and slinging Commander everywhere his decks will fit. 







 Even as we finish up our tour of *Magic 2015*, the next set looms on the horizon. *Khans of Tarkir* is packed with new cards, mechanics, and opportunities to delight any player. At Grand Prix Salt Lake City we checked with several players to see what they thought of the previews shown so far.

 "I like Sarkhan, the Dragonspeaker. It's liken a [Stormbreath Dragon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stormbreath+Dragon) that can't be killed by sorcery speed removal, and even some instant speed I think. In general, I really like Planeswalkers."




**Sam Pardee, winner Grand Prix Portland 2013**

"I really like Mantis Rider. That card is sweet. I like aggressive creatures. It seems like the perfect aggressive midrange creatures; It can block the aggressive decks and clock the control decks pretty well."



**Craig Wescoe, Pro Tour Dragon's Maze champion**

 "[Windswept Heath](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Windswept+Heath). Without [Temple Garden](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Temple+Garden) anymore it's the best way to play green-white, and those are my two favorite colors."

 "Fetch lands and Mantis Rider. I'm most interested in playing is [Courser of Kruphix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Courser+of+Kruphix) with fetch lands. The new Lighting Angel, Mantis Rider, is really good too. I'm also looking forward to the Draft format: Any format with multicolor cards and triple color costs is going to be interesting."
