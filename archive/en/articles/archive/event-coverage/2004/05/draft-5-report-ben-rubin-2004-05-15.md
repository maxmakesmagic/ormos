![Rubin at the 2000 World's](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/ptsd04/dr9_1.jpg)Ben Rubin is a true veteran in Magic, despite his young age. He made his first Pro Tour Top 8 back during the 1997-1998 season, losing in the finals to Dave Price. Since then, he's been to the Top 8 stage three other times. Aside from that, he also won two individual Masters events, which added quite a bit to his lifetime winnings. He came to this pod in contention for Top 8, but would likely need a 3-0 record to pull it off.


Rubin's first pack had [Broodstar](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Broodstar) and noting to rival it, making the decision very easy. Enforcer came second, making affinity the focus right from the start. [Neurok Spy](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Neurok+Spy) was drafted third, and Rubin went into a second color by taking [Pewter Golem](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pewter+Golem) fourth. [Ancient Den](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ancient+Den) came fifth, and Rubin took AEther Spellbomb sixth over [Nim Shrieker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nim+Shrieker). As the pack wound down, Rubin passed [Nim Lasher](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nim+Lasher)s in favor of [Steel Wall](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Steel+Wall) and an off-color Spellbomb. The only playable cards in the second pack were [Arrest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arrest), [Barter in Blood](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Barter+in+Blood), [Lumengrid Augur](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lumengrid+Augur) and [Wizard Replica](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wizard+Replica), which was Rubin's first pick. A second Enforcer followed, and another [Pewter Golem](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pewter+Golem) came third. Rubin was happy to take [Terror](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Terror) fourth, although the pack also contained a Talisman, and you could tell that he wanted to get some sort of acceleration. Once again, he took AEther Spellbomb over [Nim Shrieker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nim+Shrieker), and picked up two [Necrogen Spellbomb](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Necrogen+Spellbomb)s to help with his affinity strategy.


Darksteel provided another bomb in [Arcbound Ravager](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arcbound+Ravager). He took [Spire Golem](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spire+Golem)s with his second and third picks, passing [Essence Drain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Essence+Drain) when picking up the second one. The fourth pick contained [Pulse of the Grid](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pulse+of+the+Grid), Spawning Pool, [Nim Abomination](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nim+Abomination) and [Arcbound Bruiser](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arcbound+Bruiser), but Rubin interestingly decided to take [Arcbound Stinger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arcbound+Stinger). Through the rest of Darksteel he counterdrafted two [Tel-Jilad Outrider](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tel-Jilad+Outrider)s, drafted two [Darksteel Citadel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Darksteel+Citadel)s, and managed to get back [Pulse of the Grid](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pulse+of+the+Grid) 12th pick.


**TW:** How do you think it went?


**Rubin:** Pretty well, I'm not ecstatic. I opened two huge bombs, so that was lucky.


**TW:** Why exactly aren't you ecstatic?


**Rubin:** I don't have a lot of removal, I didn't get an Engineer. An Engineer would have been ridiculous in my deck, and of course I didn't get one.


**TW:** You didn't get any Myrs or Talismans.


**Rubin:** Nope. I wish I did. That would have been nice.


**TW:** What I noticed is that every time one came around, there was a [Terror](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Terror) or something else you couldn't pass.


**Rubin:** Yeah, I passed a [Gold Myr](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gold+Myr) and a Lead Myr. This isn't a fast deck. And the trouble is, it's okay to have a slow deck. But a slow deck without removal is a problem, because if I get behind I don't have a lot of ways to correct that problem.


**TW:** Why did you pass [Essence Drain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Essence+Drain) then, taking a [Spire Golem](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spire+Golem)?


**Rubin:** I think [Spire Golem](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spire+Golem) is just a higher quality card.


**TW:** Even if you don't have removal?


**Rubin:** Yeah. The thing is, five mana for three damage is still slow, and I already had two five drops. It's removal, but it's too slow.


**TW:** The odd thing is you're saying your deck is slow, but I saw you taking cheap cards over things that were more expensive.


**Rubin:** Yeah, well I'm trying!


**TW:** I'd guess that eighty percent of players wouldn't have taken [Arcbound Stinger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arcbound+Stinger) fourth pick there. They would have taken the Pulse, or the Abomination, or the [Spawning Pit](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spawning+Pit), or the Bruiser.



![Broodstar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Broodstar)

**Rubin:** Yeah, I actually think that's an easy pick, honestly. A lot of people would have taken the Abomination, but the Stinger is really good in my deck. You need artifacts, especially with Ravager and [Broodstar](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Broodstar).


**TW:** You passed [Nim Shrieker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nim+Shrieker) twice over AEther Spellbombs. I'm guessing you just don't think they're that important?


**Rubin:** I think [Nim Shrieker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nim+Shrieker) is good and potentially very powerful, but sometimes it's not good. I also have no removal, so I can't kill a small flier that's in the way. And my deck is slow, and I need cards that aren't slow. AEther Spellbomb is like butter, it's the perfect card. It does something good and it's an artifact, and that's what I needed. I generally think that's the right pick. I would take Myr over [Nim Shrieker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nim+Shrieker), or anything like that.


**TW:** Lasher is no good either? A lot of people really like him.


**Rubin:** I don't like Lasher. Again, it's a card that every once in a while does something great, but most of the time it's poor. It's got one toughness, so it'll trade with anything. [Nim Shrieker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nim+Shrieker) is better and harder to deal with obviously, but it's the same thing.


**TW:** Is [Pulse of the Grid](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pulse+of+the+Grid) a twelfth pick?


**Rubin:** No. I think Ben (Stark) hooked me up. I think he was being nice.


**TW:** You need a 3-0 record here to make Top 8. Do you think this can do it?


**Rubin:** I don't know. I'd have to get lucky I think. There's gotta be a deck better than this one, I can't imagine that I have the best deck. It could happen, I could 2-1. I have some good stuff, but it's obviously going to depend on these two cards ([Broodstar](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Broodstar) and Ravager)
