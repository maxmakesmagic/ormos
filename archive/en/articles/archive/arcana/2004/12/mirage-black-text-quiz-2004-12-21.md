*Happy holidays! This Arcana originally ran on February 3, 2004. Magicthegathering.com will return with new content on January 4th, 2005.*Today's **Magic** Arcana takes a trip in the way-back machine to the *Mirage* era of the color black. How many black cards can you name from their rules text alone? To make it a bit more challenging, we'll only provide you with the text boxes from the cards' *playtest* versions, so their wording may not represent exactly what ended up on the card. (To protect the cards' anonymity, any references to the card itself have been blurred out.) Happy guessing! (You may want to keep this [*Mirage* spoiler list](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=magic/generic/cardlists/Mirage.txt) handy!)
