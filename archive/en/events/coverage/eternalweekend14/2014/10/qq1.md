**How has [Treasure Cruise](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treasure+Cruise) changed Legacy? How did the existence of [Treasure Cruise](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treasure+Cruise) affect your deck choice?**

***Reid Duke:** "[Treasure Cruise](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treasure+Cruise) makes it very difficult to play a fair deck and it makes discard spells much worse. I chose the deck I would've played anyway, but I have two [Red Elemental Blast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Red+Elemental+Blast) in the main and I'm playing two copies of [Dig Through Time](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dig+Through+Time) myself."*

***Shahar Shenhar:** "Blue/Red Delver wasn't quite a tier one deck and now it definitely is. [Treasure Cruise](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treasure+Cruise) upgrades Delver decks and makes them mulligan more efficiently. I'm actually surprised that it wasn't banned. It's extremely good. The existence of [Treasure Cruise](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treasure+Cruise) encouraged me to play Death and Taxes with [Kor Firewalker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kor+Firewalker) in the sideboard."*
