Standard Showdown has been in full swing for a few weeks now, and I'm hoping you have all had the chance to participate in these exciting events. While you're undoubtedly going to see some of the more common archetypes now solidified in today's Standard metagame, there are still fun and powerful strategies to be tried. I'm here to show off some of the lesser-known decks, perhaps in an effort to give you something new to try for Standard Showdown.


The decks I've collected and played are taken from an article by our very own Luis Scott-Vargas, who has been kind enough to compile an array of decklists for Standard Showdown these last few weeks. You can check out the article and the accompanying decklists (including the ones I'm about to play!) [here](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/top-decks/standard-showdown-check-2016-12-07).


Without further delay, let's jump right in! I've selected three decks that I think are fun and distinct to showcase this time around. Let's start things off with a deck and strategy that I've been piloting on my [stream](http://twitch.tv/numotthenummy) the last few weeks: Blue-Black [Metallurgic Summonings](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Metallurgic+Summonings).

Next up is another sweet deck, Black-Green Aggro. Unlike the delirium decks we've all become accustomed to, this list takes a slightly different approach to this color pairing.

Last on our list is red-green! This isn't your standard Red-Green [Aetherworks Marvel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aetherworks+Marvel) deck though; this deck is aggro based around [Electrostatic Pummeler](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Electrostatic+Pummeler). Let's take a look at what it can do!

Hopefully you've all enjoyed this quick rundown of some of the decks available to you for Standard Showdown. The last of these events runs on December 17, so get out there and battle in one of the premier Constructed formats!  
  

Whether you're summoning, emerging, or pummeling (and even if you're not doing any of those), I hope you enjoy. Until next time, Nummy out.
