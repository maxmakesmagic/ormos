It all comes down to this one last week of Vintage Super League action! The semifinals are Tuesday at 6:00 p.m. Pacific Time (UTC-7) and then the finals are on Sunday at the hopefully more euro-friendly time of 2:00 p.m. We’ll also have a special extended pregame show, starting an hour before the finals begin.

Each playoff match features a best three out of five matches format and each player is allowed to bring up to three new decks to the table. There’s no obligation to bring three different decks, so Eric is allowed to bring three copies of Dredge and go for the 0-13 mark if he really wants to.


Players will label their three decks ahead of time and the first match will be between the two players’ “A” decks, the second match is between their “B” decks, and the third match is between their “C” decks. If a fourth match is required for someone to get to three match wins then the players can choose whichever of their three decks they like for that match. If there is a fifth decision match, players can choose freely again.


The semifinal will be a rematch between the two players who played in last year’s semifinal: Eric and Luis. Luis was victorious that time, as well as in the tiebreaker match this year after these two wound up tied for second place at the end of the regular season. Can the newly crowned number one ranked player in the world avenge those losses? Or will Luis get another shot at the title that eluded him in last year’s final?

The winner will then advance to take on Chris Pikula in the special Sunday edition of Vintage Super League. Chris holds the mark for the best regular season record in the (admittedly short) history of VSL at 7-2, but can he close the deal on Sunday? It’s actually quite a big weekend for Chris as I know he’s also playing a regional Pro Tour Qualifier on Saturday.
