There are many perks to competing in the Magic Invitational. The travel, the glory, the free snacks. But those are available to all the competitors. The coveted reward - the one that goes only to the winner - is designing your own card. Each year, the winner of the Magic Invitational gets to work with R&D to design their own card featuring their mug in the artwork. 

It’s a unique chance to become even more a part of the game’s history, and many of the past winners’ submissions have gone on to become powerful and popular cards. Here then, with a little formatting help from Paul Barclay and Del Laugel, are this year’s submissions from the Invitational competitors.
