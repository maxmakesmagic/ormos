In the all-for-one, one-for-all world of Team Limited **Magic** tournaments, you need friends you can trust. Friends who will put their faith in you to make the right play for the team. Friends who can carry you when you lose. Most importantly, you need friends to have fun with! Get a glimpse of the uniquely awesome team dynamics in action at Grand Prix Providence. NOTE: No Hall-of-Famers were harmed in the filming of Walking the Planes Episode #14: "Too Old for This".
