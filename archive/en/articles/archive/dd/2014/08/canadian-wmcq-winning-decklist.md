Standard with eight sets legal often has some high-powered decks. With the largest card pool available for this year's Standard, many of the decks are at their fastest and most robust. With *Magic 2015*, being proactive has generally been more successful than trying to have answers for everything. While Ivan Floch won [Pro Tour *Magic 2015*](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/ptm15) with a white-blue control deck, aggressive decks have been the most successful in the World *Magic* Cup Qualifiers.

The Canadian WMCQ was won by one of the best decks to play in an aggressive format, Green-White Aggro. While this deck is definitely aggressive and threatens to overrun unprepared opponents, the true strength of this deck comes from its ability to compete with other aggressive decks. Simply put, the creatures in this deck are larger than the creatures in other decks. [Fleecemane Lion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fleecemane+Lion), [Loxodon Smiter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Loxodon+Smiter), and [Advent of the Wurm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Advent+of+the+Wurm) are huge creatures that will dominate other aggressive creatures in combat.



Congratulations to David Goldfarb, the Canadian World *Magic* Cup Qualifier winner! If you would like to play in a World *Magic* Cup Qualifier, [check out the schedule](http://magic.wizards.com/en/wmcq/schedule).
