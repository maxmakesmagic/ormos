Jacob Van Lunen began playing Magic in 1995. He has participated in organized play at every level of competition and was a member of the winning team at Pro Tour San Diego in 2007, thanks to an innovative draft strategy. As a writer, Van Lunen has had more than three hundred Magic strategy pieces published 





The first game started as Standard games often do. Creatures traded with removal spells and the game remained at parity. 



 The board quickly started to fill up with powerful threats as the game progressed. Eventually, Sperling had a [Wingmate Roc](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wingmate+Roc) token with two +1/+1 counters, a pair of [Rakshasa Deathdealer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rakshasa+Deathdealer)s, and [Anafenza, the Foremost](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Anafenza%2C+the+Foremost) to Pardee's pair of [Stormbreath Dragon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stormbreath+Dragon)s, [Goblin Rabblemaster](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Rabblemaster), and three Goblin tokens.



Both players were at precarious life totals and the combat math was complicated. Sperling made a pair of tight attacks and managed to squeak through exactly enough damage to take down the first game.
