Due to ongoing supply chain disruptions, we are moving the release date of Pioneer Challenger Decks 2022 for Europe and Asia to December 9, 2022. The previously announced date of November 4, 2022, remains for all other regions.


Thank you for your patience and understanding. We will update this article in the event of any further changes.
