**Mark Rosewater:** My favorite piece of flavor text that I wrote is from *Mirage*'s [Reparations](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reparations):



*"Sorry I burned down your village. Here's some gold."*


![Reparations](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Reparations)  
I wrote it very late at night and was a little sleep deprived. The art had just come in and the card didn't have flavor text, so I thought I'd write something. I looked at the art and tried to figure out what was going on. I wrote this flavor text to try to make my friend (onetime **Magic** editor and *Weatherlight* Saga co-creator Michael Ryan) laugh. We both thought it was the funniest thing at the time, and I submitted it. I never thought it would actually make it to print, but now that it has it's my favorite piece of flavor text I've done.


My favorite piece of flavor text I didn't write was *Ice Age*'s [Lhurgoyf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lhurgoyf):



*"Ach! Hans, run! It's the Lhurgoyf!"*  
*—[Saffi Eriksdotter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Saffi+Eriksdotter), last words*


![2576](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&multiverseid=2576)  
You can tell I like it because it spawned not only another piece of flavor text, *Stronghold*'s [Revenant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Revenant) (*"Not again." —Hans*), but two different card designs: *Time Spiral*'s [Saffi Eriksdotter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Saffi+Eriksdotter) and *Unhinged*'s ["Ach! Hans, Run!"](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=73935) (the only card, I believe, ever named after flavor text).
