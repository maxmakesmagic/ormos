Lorwyn's boggarts aren't the greatest at blacksmithing, weaponcrafting, or even whittling. So when it comes to arming themselves, they improvise what they can't steal.


There's actually a measure of ingenuity to their improvisation. Whether they're firing hedgehogs from a slingshot, lashing frogs to a stick, or gathering hornets in a fragile glass sphere, they exhibit a range of creative solutions for the goal of making someone hurt.

Most of the designs you see on boggart cards in the set came from one page in the *Lorwyn* style guide, where *Lorwyn* concept artist Cyril Van Der Haegen went wild coming up with designs for boggart weapons. (We suspect Cyril might be part boggart himself.)
