 Gather around everyone, and let me tell you a tale. A tale of a Platinum Pro who stuck to his guns against all odds and won a Pro Tour with four copies of [Judge's Familiar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Judge%27s+Familiar) in his deck. A man so devoted to white, that he activates Heliod all on his own. A man so dedicated to attacking with small white creatures that he's on his own personal Crusade. A man so successful with similar – or outright the same – styles of deck, that he's become synonymous with the archetype.



Let me tell you a tale of Craig Wescoe. 



 Craig Wescoe is a 31-year old with a startlingly accomplished resume. He has three Pro Tour Top 8s to his name, including a Block Constructed win from Pro Tour *Dragon's Maze* last year. He has as many Grand Prix Top 8s, but, more important to this weekend, he also has the highest win percentage in Block Constructed of anyone here this weekend at a whopping 70.9 percent. He has, oddly enough, never Top 8'd a Pro Tour outside of California, however, as all of his best work has been done out west.



He's also just a swell guy. Nice, soft spoken, friendly to all of his opponents. Even the ones crushed under the heels of his unrelenting white horde. He's a man in his element, armed with Brimaz and his bros, ready to take down a tournament by attacking, attacking, and attacking some more. 



 Coincidentally, his opponent this round, Kelvin Chew, had put in some good work on the West Coast himself. The Singapore native's only Pro Tour Top 8 came in Seattle at Pro Tour *Return to Ravnica*, and he also can claim a fifth place 2011 Worlds team finish.




 Chew also knows his way around an attack step, claiming that Pro Tour Top 8 on the back of Modern Infect. But he had opted for a starkly different approach this weekend, one that, color aside, couldn't have put him further from the Wescoe school of **Magic**.






*Both Kelvin Chew and Craig Wescoe have some huge accomplishments in the past two seasons.*
