It's not easy to make a giant creature look giant. **Magic** artists have a variety of techniques to show scale. A huge monster can be shown from below or off in the foggy distance. And another technique, the one we're talking about today, is called "scale birds."

See those little birds out there in the sky? They're there to show that [Sphinx of Uthuun](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sphinx+of+Uthuun) is bigger than them. The presence of tiny "scale birds" shows that the main creature is giant.

[Gaea's Revenge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gaea%27s+Revenge) is so big that those birds probably just think it's a mountain or something.

Without birds: a guy with a sword. With birds: a *titan* with a sword.

Technically, the art for [Primalcrux](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Primalcrux) has scale *bats*, not birds. But that's close enough, right? Wayne Reynolds is a master; he can do that.

That's actually not the original version of [Hedron Rover](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hedron+Rover). During development, the creature was a bit larger, so the first illustration looked like this:

See? Change the scale birds and you change the size of the creature!
