*Kaldheim* Season Alternative Play Calendar
-------------------------------------------


For *Kaldheim* season's alternative play, we have quite the variety for you. Please note that events change over from one week to the next on Wednesday mornings and last for one week unless specified otherwise.


* **March 3: *Vintage Cube***. We've got a three-week run of this classic experience from March 3 until March 24. March is a little unusual for this cube, but[nbsp] . . .[/nbsp] well, we live in unusual times and the MOCS Showcase events on March 13 and 14 are worth celebrating. Life's too short not to have a little more *Vintage Cube*.
* **March 24: *Time Spiral Remastered* Supreme Draft**. *Time Spiral Remastered* comes out on March 19. Before everyone has mastered this remaster, let's draft some truly absurd decks.
* **March 31: A new Spotlight Cube**. As usual, we'll have more to share when we get closer.
* **April 7: Another new Spotlight Cube**. Again, details will come as the event approaches.

*Ultimate Masters* Flashback
----------------------------


One of the most underplayed yet incredibly fun draft environments returns for a week starting tomorrow, February 24, and ending March 3. That's a whole week to draft your favorite bombs!


Players may enter with any of the following options: 10 Event Tickets; 1 *Ultimate Masters* booster + 3 Event Tickets; or 100 Play Points.




---

*Modern Horizons* Encore Ends Tomorrow
--------------------------------------


The set everyone loves, and back for one week only. This is an Encore Draft, not a Flashback, which means you'll keep the cards you draft! The *Modern Horizons* Encore event ends tomorrow, February 24, and features two leagues:

	+ 10 Event Tickets
	+ 100 Play Points
	+ 5 *Modern Horizons* Event Tokens
