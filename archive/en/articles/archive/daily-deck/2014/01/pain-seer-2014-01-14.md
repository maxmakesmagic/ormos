Let's take a look at one of the promos revealed yesterday, Pain Seer. Here's a look at the normal version you can get out of a booster pack and the Game Day promo you can earn at the event.

I love both versions of this art but let's take another look at the promo version of the card. First off, here's the initial sketch that Mark Winters turned in.

![](https://media.wizards.com/images/magic/daily/arcana/arc1409_sketch.jpg) Pain Seer (Game Day Promo sketch) | Art by [Mark Winters](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoileramp;method=visualamp;action=advancedamp;artist=%5B%22Mark%20Winters%22%5D)

What immediately popped out at me is that there are legs hanging in the art, something that was subtle enough that I didn't realize it when I looked at it. I also love seeing what the tools of the trade are for a pain seer. When it comes to the final piece it's largely the same concept with just a few things changed to clean up and simplify the piece.
