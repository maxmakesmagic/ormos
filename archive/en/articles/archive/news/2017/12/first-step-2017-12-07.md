I’ve been a part of the *Magic* community since 1994, and I’ve had the privilege of working for Wizards of the Coast for the past 19 years. In that time, I’ve seen the community grow by leaps and bounds, and I’ve been proud to be a part of it.


However, like many other fan communities, the *Magic* community is not immune to bullying and harassment. Last week we [shared some steps we are taking](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/news/taking-action-harassment-and-bullying-2017-11-28) to help foster a better, more inclusive *Magic* community. As part of this effort, today we took action against a number of players for violations of the *Magic* [Code of Conduct](https://company.wizards.com/legal/code-conduct).


As many of you know, our [Code of Conduct](https://company.wizards.com/legal/code-conduct) prohibits players from bullying and harassing other players.


This is a first step. Tackling harassment and bullying is a larger initiative for Wizards of the Coast, and we feel it is important to address the issues in the ways we can. We discussed [some initiatives last week](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/news/taking-action-harassment-and-bullying-2017-11-28), and you’ll see more in the coming months. The *Magic* community is a place where gamers of all kinds are welcome, and if you think we should be doing more or have other ideas or suggestions, please let us know. You know where to find us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/wizards_help), [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/MagicTheGathering/), [Tumblr](http://wizardsmagic.tumblr.com/), and [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/wizards_magic). We are listening.
