The five Oath cards from the *Exodus* expansion are very powerful enchantments, and many of them lends themselves to decks. [Oath of Druids](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oath+of+Druids) and [Oath of Ghouls](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oath+of+Ghouls) both power dominant *Extended* decks, and [Oath of Scholars](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oath+of+Scholars) was tried in blue weenie decks as a source of card advantage. Even [Oath of Lieges](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oath+of+Lieges) has seen play in weird creations featuring [Stasis](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stasis) and [Squandered Resources](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Squandered+Resources).


But what about the red one? [Oath of Mages](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oath+of+Mages)? The red Oath was a victim of cycle symmetry. It was initially designed to do one damage per turn to the person with the least life, not the most. Red decks tend to do better when the opponent is down on life, not up, and this card was a good fit. But it was changed to fit the other Oath templates, where the player with "less" benefited.
