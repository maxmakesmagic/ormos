It's 1983. It's Saturday morning. You douse a bowl of sugary cereal with milk and run over to the TV. (You try not spill, but you spill a little anyway. Someone else will get that.) After fiddling with the dials, you tune in for the first-ever episode of the *Dungeons & Dragons* TV show. Cartoon scientist and skilled artist Tyler Walpole has successfully distilled that feeling into *Magic* art. Just look at these things; they're spot on! Whether you're a fan of D&D, a fan of *Magic*, or just a fan of fun, you'll find what you're looking for in this drop.

Mark Poole is one of the all-time greats. He's been with the game since the start and continues to make awesome art to this day. We really wanted this drop to celebrate his rich history with the game. To that end, it includes both classic art—some of which has never before been seen in the modern frame—and brand-new masterpieces for beloved cards. Shocking no one, Mark delivered, big time.

You would not believe what Fiona Staples said when we asked her if she wanted to illustrate a *Secret Lair* drop. She said, "Yes." Well, since you're looking at this product page, you probably believe it pretty easily, but we still think we're dreaming. *The* Fiona Staples, award-winning comic book artist known for her emotive art and compelling characters, has entered the *Magic* arena! (Not that one.) She directed her unbelievable reserves of talent toward five sweet cards—cards that can be yours!

Jen Bartel is here, and she means business. She honed her skills on the mean streets of multiple major comic companies, and now she's come for *Magic*. When she karate-kicked the doors to Wizards HQ wide open, she immediately charged the artist pit. But it wasn't 'til she performed at least six different judo throws on several perplexed staff members that she told us what she wanted: her own *Secret Lair* drop. We immediately acquiesced—partially out of fear, but mostly out of a deep respect for her ridiculous talent. She immediately put her award-winning skills to work. Several weeks later, a flaming arrow crashed through the window of our boss's office, immolating a carefully manicured fern. These cards were attached.

Glory to Phyrexia! Celebrate the Praetors' inevitable victory over the rest of the Multiverse with these five terrifyingly awesome reprints. This is each of the original Praetor cards, lovingly restored to the original Phyrexian they were written in when we found them in a pool of viscous black fluid that had begun to seep out of the haunted R&D mini fridge. For good measure, we've placed them in the new legendary Praetor frame that debuted with *Kaldheim*. It's never too early to suck up to your future monstrous overlords.

We're celebrating Mother's Day with a tribute to *Magic*'s favorite mom: Mother of Runes. We brought in four different artists to give their own take on motherhood. You can feel the affection and protection in both Ejiwa "Edge" Ebenebe's and Livia Prima's gorgeous pieces. Real-life mother and child Rebecca Guay and Eliette Mitchell both created poignant pieces from different sides of the relationship. (And yes, you read that correctly—Rebecca Guay is back, too!)

You can't spell "classic *Magic* art" without "Dan Frazier." Ok, you caught us. You can. But metaphorically, you absolutely cannot. The man is a bastion of old-school art, having illustrated the original Moxen and countless more. So, when we decided we wanted to celebrate *Modern Horizons 2* with some retro frame cards, we knew exactly who to call. Dan went above and beyond, illustrating the allied signets as if the guilds were conceived almost 30 years ago. Some parts will look familiar. Others will not. Only one thing is for sure: Dan Frazier is back with a vengeance.

Same Great *Secret Lair*, New Slimmer Box!
==========================================






The sharpest sleuths among you may have noticed something even more surprising inside the images showcasing the tasty treats coming in the All-Natural, Totally Refreshing Superdrop—those little black boxes are now even littler!


The new packaging we'll be using for all *Secret Lair* drops, beginning with this superdrop, has been reduced to less than half the original volume, is made from all-recyclable paper (except the plastic card wraps, which we are looking to change in the future), and contains 91% less plastic by volume.


This updated packaging is another step on our journey to increase recyclability and reduce plastic across all *Magic* products in 2021 and beyond. As always, we're excited to share this journey with you and appreciate any and all feedback on how we can continue to improve our packaging in the future.


Login + Preorder = Free Booster!
================================


*Adventures in the Forgotten Realms* is almost here, and excitement in the lair has reached fever pitch. We need to share some of it ASAP lest we explode into excitement elementals! Here's the deal—each customer who places a preorder while logged in will receive an *Adventures in the Forgotten Realms* Set Booster with their shipment.


Customers will only receive one booster regardless of number of preorders, but we're happy to say that most customers with a Wizards account are eligible to participate (even those outside North America). May Bahamut's righteous glory be known across the land!
