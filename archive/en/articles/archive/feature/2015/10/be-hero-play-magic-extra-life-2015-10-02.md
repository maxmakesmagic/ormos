Born in a dimension of pure cake, Sean Gibbons was quickly sent into exile after leading a rebellion opposing The Great Margarine Edict. Arriving on Earth, he saved a school bus full of Mulldrifters from being evoked and was instantly adopted by Wizards of the Coast to serve as their associate community manager. Those Mulldrifters later died to removal.

[Extra Life's Tabletop Appreciation Weekend](http://extra-life.org/tabletopweekend) is this Saturday and Sunday, October 3–4, and the *Magic: The Gathering* team is celebrating with its first ever 24-hour live Twitch stream featuring *Magic Online*'s *nummiest* Twitch streamer (and recent [Community Cup champion](http://magic.wizards.com/en/content/2015-magic-community-cup)), Kenji Egashira! The action starts October 3 at 8:00 a.m. PT on the [*Magic* Twitch channel](http://www.twitch.tv/magic)!


Extra Life is all about helping kids in need. As humble Planeswalkers, we struggle against foes like the Eldrazi in the *Battle for Zendikar*, but that's a walk in the park compared to the thousands of hospitalized children who face far scarier challenges in life. Through the donations of our players, *Magic*'s goal is to raise as much money as possible in support of the Children's Miracle Network hospitals and their mission to help kids. If that weren't enough incentive to help the cause, we're throwing in some sweet *Magic*-themed rewards for our most generous donors. Including . . .

. . . uncut premium foil sheets for our top donors! We've also got full sets from the original *Zendikar* block, Duel Decks Anthologies, Premium Duel Decks, San Diego Comic-Con exclusives, and more!


For more details, see the [*Magic* Extra Life team page](http://www.extra-life.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=donorDrive.team&teamID=22659).
