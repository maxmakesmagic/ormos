![tinker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Tinker)With seven decks in the Top 8 of the Pro Tour featuring [Grim Monolith](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grim+Monolith)s, [Ancient Tomb](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ancient+Tomb)s, [City of Traitors](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=City+of+Traitors) and [Tinker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tinker), it was clear to many of the Pro Players here this weekend that the DCI's work was not done in regard to fixing Extended. By not banning [Tinker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tinker) when they took out the [Goblin Lackey](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Lackey), [Frantic Search](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Frantic+Search) and [Entomb](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Entomb) they merely pushed the [Tinker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tinker) and Charbelcher to the front of the line of broken decks.

What does this mean for those of us in the trenches trying to qualify for Kobe, Japan? Do we play the deck that occupies seven of the eight brackets for this Sunday's competition or does it merely mean that there is a foil deck we should be looking toward.

We asked a number of the Pros still lingering on the site and not staggering down Bourbon Street what they would play if they were (gasp\*choke) forced to play in the upcoming PTQ season. We also asked them if they thought there was anything wrong with the format and if so what they thought needed to be fixed.

**Osyp Lebedowicz:** I don't know what deck I would play. But definitely don't ban [Chrome Mox](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chrome+Mox). That's what I thought at the beginning. I think most people just underestimated [Tinker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tinker). People should just play decks with more artifact hate in the PTQs. 

If they had to ban something, [Tinker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tinker) or [Voltaic Key](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Voltaic+Key) wouldn't hurt...

**Tsuyoshi Fujita:** I would play [Mind's Desire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mind%27s+Desire)-the [Twiddle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Twiddle) deck-with four [Damping Matrix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Damping+Matrix) in the sideboard. [Hermit Druid](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hermit+Druid), [Ancient Tomb](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ancient+Tomb), [City of Traitors](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=City+of+Traitors), [Chrome Mox](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chrome+Mox), [Vampiric Tutor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vampiric+Tutor)...

...all banned!

[Grim Monolith](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grim+Monolith) is safe. If they did not want to ban all the cards I mentioned they could bring back Force of Will.

**Tomi Walamies:** Before the bannings? I think that both of the finals decks were very good. I'm not sure which one was better. I think you could splash red in the Nassif deck for [Rack and Ruin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rack+and+Ruin) out of the sideboard-yeah Nassif's deck. You could even Tutor for it-maybe run one in the main.

Extended seems like the worst format I have seen in a long time. It feels like all the games are too explosive and you get to see too few cards which makes it pretty random. I like it when the games go beyond your opening hand and two more cards. The best suggestion I have heard is to move the format toward online Extended but that would upset people with the old cards. I would try Online Extended as a Pro Tour format. 

That is just my pessimistic opinion.

**Masashi Oiso:** I would play either [Mind's Desire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mind%27s+Desire) or "George W. Bosh". The first because it was unknown before the tournament and the other because it was so interesting.

[Tinker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tinker) and mana acceleration need to be banned. [Goblin Recruiter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Recruiter), [Goblin Charbelcher](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Charbelcher) and [Hermit Druid](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hermit+Druid) are on the watch list.

**Jeroen Remie:** I would play the Rock-but that is just me. I don't think anyone should play the Rock but Darwin and me. As far as the format-ban [Tinker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tinker), [Chrome Mox](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chrome+Mox), [Goblin Recruiter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Recruiter)-basically just keep banning things until the Rock is good again.

Seriously, I think they should just ban Extended-just jump ahead to Online Extended.
