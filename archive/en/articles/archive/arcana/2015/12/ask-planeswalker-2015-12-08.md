Based in London, UK, Dan is responsible Magic’s community across Europe. He loves cats, running, and attacking for 2. 






Earlier this year at [Grand Prix London](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/gplon15), we spoke to a range of players about their experiences playing *Magic* and being a part of our community. In these videos, you can hear what they had to share.


First, how did they discover *Magic*, and what would they say to someone who's not played the game yet?

Next, we spoke to *Magic*-playing couples: What's it like playing and attending events together, and—dare we ask—who's the better player?

In this video, we asked about Grand Prix: Why should you go to one, and what are the many fun things to play, see, and do once you arrive?

Finally, what are some of our community members' *Magic* favorites: Planeswalker, deck, and moment?
