This week's "Sketches" looks at another piece by fan-fave Kev Walker--[Visara the Dreadful](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Visara+the+Dreadful), one of *Onslaught*'s five ultra-powerful Pit-Fighter Legends.

### 1. Art Description

These are the instructions given to the artist:

"Location: Great Pit-Arena (The Coliseum)  
 Action: Champion Black Pit-Fighter. This is a female Grgon, like Matthew Wilson's creature from *Judgment*. Instead of the claw, she has weird wings made out of the same plated material. She is unmasked, and her eyes glow with dark energy. She is in mid-combat (opponent unnecessary)."

As you can see, Kev was asked to base his work on *Judgment*'s [Masked Gorgon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Masked+Gorgon).

### 2. Sketch

This is the preliminary sketch submitted by Kev. Everyone liked it and no changes were necessary.

### 3. Final Art

Here is a large version of the final piece. The only noticeable change from the sketch is the marks on her shoulders are no longer there.

### 4. Card

Finally, here is the card as it appears in the set.
