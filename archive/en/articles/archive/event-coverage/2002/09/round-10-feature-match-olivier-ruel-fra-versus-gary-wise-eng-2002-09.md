![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gplon02/931.jpg)On 8-1 coming into the round, both players are looking good so far in the tourament. Gary Wise was playing mono-black control, and Olivier had the Infestation-[Upheaval](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Upheaval) deck. It’s not a good match-up for Gary. “My best plan is to watch my opponent carefully and then call a judge”, he said. Olivier asks when the last time Gary made a top eight was, and Wise responds with, “Well at least I won a PT”, a reference to the team event in Washington 1999. Both players are well known pros with many good finishes to their name.

### Game One

This game was pretty brutal, as so often happens when these two decks meet. Olivier was able to make a second turn [Standstill](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Standstill), which Gary was forced to break with a [Diabolic Tutor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Diabolic+Tutor). The Frenchman drew four cards off a [Deep Analysis](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deep+Analysis), while Wise had a very poor draw and was unable to put up any pressure. On turn eight Olivier had enough mana to just cast [Upheaval](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Upheaval) and put a [Zombie Infestation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Zombie+Infestation) into play, making four tokens. Gary had an [Innocent Blood](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Innocent+Blood) but it still wasn’t enough to prevent lethal damage inside four turns.

### Game Two

He was looking for a fourth Swamp, but instead turned over seven different non-Swamp cards, and then a second [Nantuko Shade](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nantuko+Shade) fizzled the Pact. 

Wise was attacking with a [Mesmeric Fiend](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mesmeric+Fiend), so with a poor draw, Ruel had to tap down for a [Deep Analysis](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deep+Analysis), giving Gary chance to resolve a [Skeletal Scrying](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skeletal+Scrying) for five cards. When the Canadian played a second Fiend, he was relieved to see that Olivier had an awful hand; three [Divert](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Divert), an Aether Burst and a [Faceless Butcher](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Faceless+Butcher) which he took. Once again Olivier had to tap out for a [Deep Analysis](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deep+Analysis) to find an answer, which allowed Gary to [Mind Sludge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mind+Sludge) his hand away. Wise dropped a [Screams of the Damned](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Screams+of+the+Damned) and six activations later it was on to game three.

### Game Three

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gplon02/933.jpg) Game three was brutal. Gary started out with a [Mesmeric Fiend](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mesmeric+Fiend) taking [Innocent Blood](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Innocent+Blood), although the Fiend was soon killed by a [Chainer's Edict](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chainer%27s+Edict). On his fourth turn Gary Wise played Braids, which Olivier had to Aether Burst and then [Cabal Therapy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cabal+Therapy) away.

Gary dropped both a [Faceless Butcher](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Faceless+Butcher), and then a [Nantuko Shade](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nantuko+Shade) on his sixth turn. Olivier’s only removal was an [Innocent Blood](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Innocent+Blood) and the Shade brought him down to ten. His [Faceless Butcher](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Faceless+Butcher) proved to be only a temporary measure to deal with the Shade, since Gary had a second Butcher. The [Nantuko Shade](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nantuko+Shade) ended the game in one hit.
