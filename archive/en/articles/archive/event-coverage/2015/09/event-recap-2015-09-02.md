Most of them were hoping to be able to travel back to wherever they live with perhaps some money and some Pro Tour points. Others again were hoping for more than that. They were hoping to take home the Champion trophy.


The first day consisted of seven rounds of Invasion Block sealed deck, and four players were able to fight their way through those seven rounds winning every single match. Two of them also managed to make it all the way to the top 8. The final playoff was played late Sunday night, and soon only two players were left in the tournament - Jesper "Manne" Thrane from Denmark and Jos Schreurs from the Netherlands. And after two close games, it was Schreurs who could enter the stage and jump up and down clutching his winner trophy.


"It's a great feeling. I know that's a clich√©, but . . . ahhhh! I don't know what to say. I'm a name player now. They cannot take that away from me," he grins. Schreurs hadn't expected to win, but after the draft he felt he had a chance. Now, he enters Magic history as the winner of 2001 Grand Prix Gothenburg. His main goal was to qualify for Barcelona, and he and Jesper joked around about meeting at the top table in Spain. Joss' plan is to take the future one match at a time though. "I just want to have fun playing Magic at a high level. I can still smile if I lose. But right now I'll keep smiling in my sleep tonight, and when I go to work tomorrow after four hours of sleep."
