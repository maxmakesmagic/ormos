The [*Planechase* Release Events](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/TCG/Events.aspx?x=mtgcom/events/planechase-facts) are this weekend, September 4-6. Whee!

There's more information about *Planechase* [on the *Planechase* page](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/tcg/productarticle.aspx?x=mtg/tcg/planechase/productinfo), including full decklists. But there's one more card you haven't seen yet!

Just for showing up and playing, each player will receive a Tazeem promo plane card (while supplies last). What's Tazeem? Oh, it's just a plane not included in any of the four *Planechase* decks, that's all. And it looks ... like *this*!

Tazeem is not included in any of the four *Planechase* decks. If you want one, the [*Planechase* Release Events](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/TCG/Events.aspx?x=mtgcom/events/planechase-facts) are the place to be!
