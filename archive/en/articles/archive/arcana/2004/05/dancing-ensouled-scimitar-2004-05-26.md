The flavor of [Ensouled Scimitar](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ensouled+Scimitar) is that it's an equippable weapon like [Leonin Scimitar](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leonin+Scimitar), but with a little mana it becomes animated, flying around and fighting for you like [Dancing Scimitar](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dancing+Scimitar)! The flavor is reinforced by the fact that the equipped creature gets +1/+5, "adding" [Dancing Scimitar](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dancing+Scimitar)'s power and toughness to the creature.
