Magic Online Store Refund Policy
================================



 Posted in **MTGO General Resources**
 on February 4, 2014 









We will be happy to return any product for a refund of the purchase price as long as the product is eligible for refunds per this policy.


Unopened theme decks, tournaments packs and booster packs may be returned up to 30 days from the date of purchase for a full refund of the product purchase price.  To be eligible for a refund, these objects must be in the account that originally purchased them and they must not have ever been traded.  Event tickets are not refundable; however, please note that they can be used for future events.


Sometimes, Event Packs will be available for purchase in the Magic Online store.  For example, the Masters Edition Value Pack was a single digital object that, when opened, became 40 Masters Editions booster packs.  The Masters Edition Value Pack itself would be refundable, but the 40 booster packs would not be, even if they were in the account that originally purchased the Value Pack.
