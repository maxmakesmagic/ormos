Here at Wizards of the Coast, we'd like to wish you all a Happy Holiday and an early Happy New Year from the *Magic Online* team. It's been a big year—from a new website to a new client—and we thank you for joining us along the way. We're looking forward to spending 2015 with you all, and continuing to improve *Magic Online*.


If you haven't already, go check out the [small gift](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/magic-online-announcements-december-16-2014#item1) we left for you. Spend it on something special, like the [Holiday Cube](http://magic.wizards.com/en/MTGO/articles/archive/magic-online-holiday-festival-2014-11-12#swissholidaycube)—maybe drink some egg nog while you're at it. Get into the spirit of the season.


Until next year, I leave you with this picture of Wizards wearing silly sweaters.

Happy Holidays!
