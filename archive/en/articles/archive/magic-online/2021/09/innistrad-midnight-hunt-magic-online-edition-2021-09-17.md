Welcome to *Innistrad: Midnight Hunt*—*Magic Online* Edition! As we return yet again to the haunted world of Innistrad, let this article be your beacon of information against the darkness of uncertainty. The clock is about to strike twelve, so we shan't waste any time!


Run with the Wolf
=================


This is the first set of two in our incredibly spooky double Innistrad "block," and with it, we have all the usual trappings: Constructed Leagues reset, Limited Leagues end (including *Modern Horizons 2*), Treasure Chests update, format legalities change. This time is especially important, though. With this set, Standard rotates (or enters renewal for our *MTG Arena* friends). So, say goodbye to *Throne of Eldraine*, *Zendikar Rising*, *Ikoria: Lair of Behemoths*, and *Core Set 2021*, and let's welcome our new Werewolf overlords. *Innistrad: Midnight Hunt* events begin at 10 a.m. PT on Thursday September 16, so by the time you're reading this, you should already be able to go out there and draft to your heart's content. Awooo!


I'm a Werewolf, Baby
====================


*Innistrad: Midnight Hunt* brings a couple new mechanics which you'll see on *Magic Online*.


First up is day and night. Once a player casts a creature with daybound and nightbound, each player will get a reminder displaying which time of day it is, much like how monarch or ascend functions, and it will usually start off as day:


![Daybound](https://media.wizards.com/2021/images/daily/J28duw83de.png)


*"I'm calling this Conclave Titan"*


And, of course, once the action calms down, it will become night and permanents with daybound will transform to their back face:


![Nightbound](https://media.wizards.com/2021/images/daily/J2jwuefsye.png)


*"He'll rip your arms out, Jim."*


Next up, we have disturb. This isn't too terribly complicated: if you have a card with disturb in your graveyard and you have priority and are able to cast it, it will be highlighted, and you'll be able to cast the back face as the spirit it's always longed to be:

***"****If wishes were horses, beggars would ride."*


Full Moon Man
=============


Redemption will be returning for *Innistrad: Midnight Hunt* per usual so that you can turn an entire set of digital Werewolves into paper ones for playing at home! The dates this time around are:


**Redemption Begins**: October 20, 2021


**Redemption Reprint Guarantee Date**: January 5, 2022


**Redemption Cutoff Date**: February 9, 2022


Running with the Pack
=====================


As mentioned before, Treasure Chests have been rebalanced, and many new promos from *Innistrad: Midnight Hunt* will be available! But that's not all: we've got eight cards from *Innistrad: Midnight Hunt* Commander that can be found in Treasure Chests. It's not every card from *Innistrad: Midnight Hunt* Commander, but we'll continue to bring you just as many cards as we are able to. While we're just as passionate as you are about this game, there have been a whole lot of sweet *Magic* cards released this year, and we'll bring as many as we can to *Magic Online*. The list of *Innistrad: Midnight Hunt* Commander cards included in Treasure Chests with this release are:


* Somberwald Beastmaster
* Heronblade Elite
* Empty the Laboratory
* Drown in Dreams
* Stalwart Pathlighter
* Eloise, Nephalia Sleuth
* Leinore, Autumn Sovereign
* Avacyn's Memorial

In addition, we've brought one more card from *Commander (2021 Edition)*, [Laelia, the Blade Reforged](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Laelia%2C+the+Blade+Reforged), which some folks (me included) have been waiting quite patiently for:

We've also included the sweet basic lands from *Unsanctioned* for you to . . . hunt down.

And, finally, we've brought *Secret Lair*'s *Showcase: Strixhaven* to Treasure Chests, so you might find yourself opening one of these proto-Mystical Archive Cards!

Werewolves of London
====================


Now, let's check out the Avatars you'll be able to find in *Innistrad: Midnight Hunt*:


First up, we have Arlinn, Unleashed, which you can find in the Deck Builder's Essentials item or the New Account Starter Kit, both of which can be found in the *Magic Online* Store.

Next, we have the three prestige avatars. The prestige avatars for this set will be using the now-familiar system: you earn five points for each Competitive Trophy and one point for every Friendly Trophy. At the end of the *Innistrad: Midnight Hunt* season, if you can scrounge up at least five points, you'll receive the uncommon Saryth, the Viper's Fang Prestige Avatar. If you cobble together twenty or more points, you will receive the rare Liesa, Forgotten Archangel Prestige Avatar. And finally, if you have proven yourself the alpha of the pack by claiming 40 or more points, you will earn the mythic rare Tovolar, the Midnight Scourge Prestige Avatar! Violence can be death—or a way of life.

And finally, here are the avatars you can find in Treasure Chests. These are always tradeable, and while some are beautiful and some are goofy, others . . . have issues. Watch out for those.


The Treasure Chest avatars for *Innistrad: Midnight Hunt* are:


* Delver of Secrets
* Insectile Aberration
* Jadar, Ghoulcaller of Nephalia
* Croaking Counterpart
* Can't Stay Away
* Gisa, Glorious Resurrector
* Jeren, Corrupted Bishop
* Stolen Vitality
* Sigarda, Champion of Light
* Fleshtaker

Hungry like the Wolf
====================


And here's a preview of the alternate play experiences you can expect during *Innistrad: Midnight Hunt.* All events run for a week, except for *Vintage Cube*, which runs for three weeks. The Moxen must be drafted!


* September 22: **Triple** ***Khans of Tarkir* Encore Draft** will return.
* September 22: We'll be running a **Four-Player Commander League** as an experiment with rebalanced voting similar to how *Commander Legends* ran.
* September 29: Harper O'Neill's *Core Set Cube* returns as ***Alpha Core Set Cube*.**
* October 6: **Standard: Through the Ages** will allow you to choose a Standard deck from some of the most popular in *Magic*'s almost 30-year history (yes, including Caw-Blade).
* October 13: Chris Kronenberger will unveil his ***Artisan Cube***, a cube consisting of only commons and uncommons.
* October 20: ***Vintage Cube*** returns for a three-week run leading up to the release of *Innistrad: Crimson Vow*.
	+ October 27: It isn't truly Halloween without an original **Triple *Innistrad* Encore Draft**, now is it?

Howling at the Moon
===================


And that's all we can fit in this howling. We plan on continuing to bring you awesome Standard sets, new ways to play *Magic* on *Magic Online*, and enough cubes for the whole pack. As always, we welcome your feedback on Twitter or Reddit. We read as much of it as we can, and it truly does help us prioritize what we focus on. Whether this is your first visit to Innistrad, or your third, thank you for joining us on this lycanthropic journey.


So, rally the pack, bask in the full moon, and let the hunt begin!
