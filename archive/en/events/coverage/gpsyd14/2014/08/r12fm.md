2014 is proving a great year for Park Jun Young, with a with a recent win at Grand Prix Minneapolis in May and a Top 8 at Grand Prix Kuala Lumpur in January. Both he and his opponent, Maitland Cameron, who was a member of the 2011 Australian national team, had drafted U/B control decks this morning.



 Game one was truly a match of mirrors, as Park summoned a [small blue bird](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=383437) plus an [underwater myriad of genetically identical polyps](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=383216) and their cephalopod companion to his side. Meanwhile Cameron hired a [Research Assistant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Research+Assistant) to study his own myriad of genetically identical polyps while [stabbing](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=383396) his opponent's . While Park slowly bled out, his island hopping squid companion and tiny bird continued to harass Cameron. Eventually Park formed a [covenant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=383217) with the blood he had lost, [signed](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=383383) his name to it , and threw both at Park's face to take the game.
