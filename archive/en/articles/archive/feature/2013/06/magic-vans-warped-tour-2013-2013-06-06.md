![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/arcana/arc1249_mano_logo.png)Vans Warped Tour and **Magic** are teaming up again this year! We're proud to be a sponsor for the 2013 Tour! We're teaming up with the band [Man Overboard](http://www.defendpoppunk.com/) this year. Also be sure to watch the Twitter hashtag [#mtgwarped](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23mtgwarped) again!


You can stop by the **Magic: The Gathering** tent throughout the tour for a chance to challenge Man Overboard to games of **Magic** as well as try out ***Magic** 2014—Duels of the Planeswalkers* on the iPad.


Now check this out, remember how we were part of the [Penny Arcade](http://www.penny-arcade.com) reality series [Strip Search](http://www.stripsearch.tv)? [We challenged the contestants](/en/articles/archive/magic-strip-search-2013-04-10) to design a skate deck using Chandra. We went back to the winner, Erika Moen, and had her finish out her design without the time pressure on the show and finalized an awesome design for a skateboard deck. Now we are excited to announce that attendees to the event can enter for a chance to win a skate deck featuring Erika's final design by Hooligan! See the full rules for entry at the bottom of this page.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/arcana/arc1249_board.png)The booth will be open on the tour days from 11:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m., the daily appearance of Man Overboard will be posted each day.
