![Tomb of Urami](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Tomb+of+Urami)**[Tomb of Urami](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tomb+of+Urami)** – *Saviors of Kamigawa* rare. The [Tomb of Urami](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tomb+of+Urami) is the long-sealed resting place of (naturally enough) the demon Urami. When he bursts free, he lays waste not only to the enemy, but also all the land around him. Wondering what he looks like? The token art was commissioned for **Magic Online**, so [here it is](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=global/images/mtgcom_arcana_841_pic2_en.jpg)!
 ![Reliquary Tower](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Reliquary+Tower)**[Reliquary Tower](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reliquary+Tower)** – *Conflux* uncommon. Through *Conflux* development, this was the slot reserved for versions of "Barry's Land" (which would count as a new type of Basic Land for Domain purposes). As you can see from the final card, none of the proposed solutions were accepted.
 ![Stangg](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Stangg)**[Stangg](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stangg)** – *Legends* rare. Originally, The Stangg Twin token's creature type was just "Stangg-Twin", while [Stangg](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stangg)'s was "Legend". The rules for creature types have been cleaned up a bit since then, so now putting [Stangg](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stangg) into play results in two Legendary creatures, both of them Human Warriors.
 ![Tattermunge Duo](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Tattermunge+Duo)**[Tattermunge Duo](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tattermunge+Duo)** – *Shadowmoor* common. It's a little hard to make out at card size, but the art for [Tattermunge Duo](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tattermunge+Duo) features a boggart shaman sitting on the shoulders of a larger boggart warrior. They're working together to fight something that's just offscreen.
 ![Clone](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Clone)**[Clone](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Clone)** – *Onslaught* rare. When *Onslaught* was being planned, several members of R&D wanted to put [Clone](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Clone) in, but it was on the Reserved List. But they *really* wanted to put it in. So Randy Buehler [ran a poll](/en/articles/archive/latest-developments/reexamining-reprints-2002-03-01-0) in his March 1, 2002 Latest Developments column essentially asking his readers if the policy should be changed. And that's why Latest Developments always includes a poll!
 ![Brothers Yamazaki](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Brothers+Yamazaki)**[Brothers Yamazaki](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brothers+Yamazaki)** – *Champions of Kamigawa* uncommon. Curious about the story behing the [Brothers Yamazaki](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brothers+Yamazaki)? Read the legend behind the legend(s) [right here](http://www.wizards.com/Magic/TCG/Article.aspx?x=magic/chk/yamazaki), written by Jay Moldenhauer-Salazar.
 ![Dandan](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Dandan)**[Dandân](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dand%C3%A2n)** – *Arabian Nights* common. According to Richard Garfield, "The dandân was a fantastic fish that, if memory serves--and it certainly doesn't; it rules--was as big as a man but could be killed by a clap of your hands. Hence, [Dandân](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dand%C3%A2n) is a 4/1 creature."
 ![Fork](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Fork)**[Fork](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fork)** – *Limited Edition Alpha* rare. As with many *Alpha* cards, [Fork](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fork) has an odd quirk: instead of making an exact copy of a spell, it retains [Fork](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fork)'s color. And it doesn't have to stay red; if you [Purelace](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Purelace) your [Fork](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fork), it makes a *white* copy of a spell!
 ![Auntie's Hovel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Auntie%27s+Hovel)**[Auntie's Hovel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Auntie%27s+Hovel)** – *Lorwyn* rare. The tree in the art for [Auntie's Hovel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Auntie%27s+Hovel) is the same tree seen in *Shadowmoor*'s [Fire-Lit Thicket](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fire-Lit+Thicket). And here's something unusual about this situation: the cards were painted by two different artists!
 ![Goblin Bowling Team](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Goblin+Bowling+Team)**[Goblin Bowling Team](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Bowling+Team)** – *Unglued* common. The [Goblin Bowling Team](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Bowling+Team) is based on the actual (at the time) Wizards of the Coast Bowling Team: Charlie Catino, Bill Rose, Paul Randles, Beverly Marshall Saling, and Darla Kennerud.
 ![Furious Assault](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Furious+Assault)**[Furious Assault](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Furious+Assault)** – *Mercadian Masques* common. The figures in the art for [Furious Assault](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Furious+Assault) are Merfolk, even though they have legs. Although Merfolk exist on many planes, only the Saprazzans can grow legs and become bipedal.
 ![Magister Sphinx](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Magister+Sphinx)**[Magister Sphinx](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Magister+Sphinx)** – *Conflux* rare. During playtesting, [Magister Sphinx](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Magister+Sphinx) was named "Two-Punch Steve." You can probably figure out why.
 ![Monkey Monkey Monkey](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Monkey+Monkey+Monkey)**[Monkey Monkey Monkey](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Monkey+Monkey+Monkey)** – *Unhinged* common. [Monkey Monkey Monkey](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Monkey+Monkey+Monkey) was originally named "Monkey Monkey Monkey Monkey," but that was too long to fit. So one of the monkeys got cut, leaving the card with 25% less monkey.
 ![Ivory Crane Netsuke](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Ivory+Crane+Netsuke)**[Ivory Crane Netsuke](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ivory+Crane+Netsuke)** – *Saviors of Kamigawa* uncommon. A "netsuke" is a miniature sculpture. So the art for [Ivory Crane Netsuke](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ivory+Crane+Netsuke), which shows a miniature crane carved out of ivory, is precisely on point.
 ![Snake Basket](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Snake+Basket)**[Snake Basket](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snake+Basket)** – *Visions* rare. If you want as many snakes as possible as quickly as possible, [Snake Basket](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snake+Basket) is probably the number one option. On a snake-to-snake basis, it blows [Orochi Hatchery](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Orochi+Hatchery) out of the water!
 ![Stalking Tiger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Stalking+Tiger)**[Stalking Tiger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stalking+Tiger)** – *Tenth Edition* common. [Stalking Tiger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stalking+Tiger) is probably more famous as a **Magic Online** avatar than as a card. It also got some prominence in 2001-2002 as part of the Pro Tour Team Name "Stalking Tiger, Hidden Gibbon" (Josh Ravitz, Matt Urban, and Paul Jordan).
 ![Mantis Engine](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Mantis+Engine)**[Mantis Engine](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mantis+Engine)** – *Tenth Edition* uncommon. The *Tenth Edition* printing of [Mantis Engine](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mantis+Engine) has flavor text spoken by Jhoira. But you'll only see it on the foil version, because *Tenth Edition* foils made room for flavor text by eliminating reminder text!
 ![Pang Tong, Young Phoenix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Pang+Tong%2C+Young+Phoenix)**[Pang Tong, "Young Phoenix"](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pang+Tong%2C+%22Young+Phoenix%22)** – *Portal Three Kingdoms* rare. *Portal Three Kingdoms* contains two of the only three **Magic** cards to have quotation marks in the name: [Pang Tong, "Young Phoenix"](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pang+Tong%2C+%22Young+Phoenix%22) and [Kongming, "Sleeping Dragon"](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kongming%2C+%22Sleeping+Dragon%22) The other one is ["Ach, Hans! Run!"](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=%22Ach%2C+Hans%21+Run%21%22).
 ![Wall of Ice](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Wall+of+Ice)**[Wall of Ice](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wall+of+Ice)** – *Limited Edition Alpha* uncommon. As time went on, it became increasingly clear that a card named "Wall of Ice" had no business being a green card. So it was no surprise that *Ice Age* featured a blue card called "[Glacial Wall](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glacial+Wall)", which promptly entered *Fifth Edition* as the resident three-casting-cost 0/7 Wall.
 ![Clockwork Beast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Clockwork+Beast)**[Clockwork Beast](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Clockwork+Beast)** – *Limited Edition Alpha* rare. In the [*Masters Edition* Oracle Update](/en/articles/archive/masters-edition-update-bulletin-2007-08-29), [Clockwork Beast](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Clockwork+Beast) got a correction to its (complicated) wording. That update was applied to the [Clockwork Steed](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Clockwork+Steed) and [Clockwork Swarm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Clockwork%2BSwarm) in the [*Lorwyn* Update](/en/articles/archive/lorwyn-oracle-changes-2007-09-26) and to [Clockwork Avian](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Clockwork+Avian) in the [*Shadowmoor* Update](/en/articles/archive/shadowmoor-update-bulletin-2008-04-16).
 ![Putrid Cyclops](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Putrid+Cyclops)**[Putrid Cyclops](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Putrid+Cyclops)** – *Future Sight* common. It would take more space than we have here to describe all the early versions that [Putrid Cyclops](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Putrid+Cyclops) went through before it was printed, so we'll just direct you to [Mark Rosewater's article from Scry Week](/en/articles/archive/making-magic/scrying-game-2007-05-14).
 ![Avenging Angel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Avenging+Angel)**[Avenging Angel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Avenging+Angel)** – *Tempest* rare. [Avenging Angel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Avenging+Angel)'s ability has been both black and white in the past. The difference? When it's on a white creature, you get a cool angel with a sword. In black, you get [Aphetto Vulture](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Aphetto%2BVulture)
