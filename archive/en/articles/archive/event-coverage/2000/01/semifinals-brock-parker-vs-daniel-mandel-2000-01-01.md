![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/GPDEN01/186sfparker.jpg)Mandel's counter-hippo deck is considered by many to be a nightmare matchup for Brock's Solution deck, with even the [Sunscape Familiar](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sunscape+Familiar)s being a very significant annoyance. Mandel's version bypasses [Eladamri's Call](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eladamri%27s+Call) and just uses four copies of his best available creatures: [Questing Phelddagrif](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Questing+Phelddagrif), [Mystic Snake](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mystic+Snake), [Sunscape Familiar](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sunscape+Familiar) and [Meddling Mage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Meddling+Mage), with two [Sabertooth Nishoba](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sabertooth+Nishoba) at the high end where Solution's high end is only [Voice of All](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Voice+of+All). Brock won the die roll and like everyone else chose to play first. But as Daniel said, of course "going first isn't important." Both players kept their opening hands.


Brock opened with [Stormscape Apprentice](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stormscape+Apprentice) then his second turn brought out a second Apprentice and a Plains. Daniel put out a [Meddling Mage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Meddling+Mage) on [Voice of All](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Voice+of+All) on his. Brock cast [Repulse](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Repulse) on the [Meddling Mage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Meddling+Mage) and went in for two before the Mage promptly came back down with the same target. Brock took the opportunity to cast a main phase [Fact or Fiction](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fact+or+Fiction) into four lands and a currently illegal to cast [Voice of All](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Voice+of+All). Daniel put the [Caves of Koilos](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Caves+of+Koilos) with the [Voice of All](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Voice+of+All), which Brock accepted. 


The [Meddling Mage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Meddling+Mage) came over for two on Daniel's turn, and he put out a second [Meddling Mage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Meddling+Mage). For this one he named [Spectral Lynx](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spectral+Lynx). Brock asked how many cards Daniel had, and when Daniel answered five and discovered Brock to have six he cursed his smaller hand size. Brock then put out the third [Meddling Mage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Meddling+Mage), this one on [Mystic Snake](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mystic+Snake). Instead, out came the giant purple hippo, [Questing Phelddagrif](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Questing+Phelddagrif). Brock sighed and could only play a land. When Daniel attacked, Brock chose to tap only the hippo, letting both [Meddling Mage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Meddling+Mage)s attack if they wanted to. This of course brought on another inquiry as to Brock's hand size, after which the Mages were sent in. The one that was on [Voice of All](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Voice+of+All) was blocked, and both Mages died leaving only [Spectral Lynx](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spectral+Lynx) out of bounds. The [Stormscape Apprentice](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stormscape+Apprentice) then drained Daniel for one with agreeable accompanying sound effects.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/GPDEN01/185sfparkermandel.jpg)With [Voice of All](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Voice+of+All) free to come out, Brock attempted to cast one but three [Absorb](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Absorb)s later Daniel gained a net of four life after the damage from his painlands and Brock had seven tapped lands but no [Voice of All](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Voice+of+All). With no mana available for the Apprentices they attacked for two, letting the Mage and Phelddagrif attack back for six. Then a second purple hippo joined the fray, letting [Meddling Mage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Meddling+Mage) get through Brock's tappers. At this point, Daniel had both [Absorb](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Absorb) and [Mystic Snake](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mystic+Snake) in his hand as backup as Brock dropped to eight, then six, then four without casting a spell. Daniel tried to add insult to injury with a [Fact or Fiction](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fact+or+Fiction) but it didn't turn up anything and he ended up taking a lone [Exclude](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Exclude). Still, it was more than enough. A [Voice of All](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Voice+of+All) got [Exclude](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Exclude)d, a [Meddling Mage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Meddling+Mage) got [Absorb](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Absorb)ed and that was game. Luckily for Brock, Daniel in his own words "had no idea what I'm doing." Still, Brock did not look happy.


Without knowing exactly what were the best cards to sideboard out but certain what cards he needed to bring in, Daniel decided to sideboard out three [Questing Phelddagrif](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Questing+Phelddagrif)s, three [Exclude](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Exclude)s and two [Rushing River](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rushing+River)s for four [Gainsay](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gainsay), two [Rout](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rout) and two [Sunscape Master](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sunscape+Master). Brock took out four [Galina's Knight](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Galina%27s+Knight)s and two [Absorb](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Absorb)s for a more efficient four [Gainsay](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gainsay)s, fourth [Exclude](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Exclude) and fourth [Stormscape Apprentice](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stormscape+Apprentice). 


The first creature of the game was a second turn [Meddling Mage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Meddling+Mage), which Brock used to try and slow down Daniel by naming [Sunscape Familiar](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sunscape+Familiar), but Daniel had a second turn Mage as well which he again named [Voice of All](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Voice+of+All) with. They both died on Brock's turn in combat, and Brock had no follow-up play. Both players sat back playing lands for a time, until the end of Daniel's fourth turn when Brock tried to [Fact or Fiction](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fact+or+Fiction), which was countered by [Mystic Snake](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mystic+Snake). That let Brock get out a [Voice of All](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Voice+of+All) with Protection from Blue, which Daniel's deck has no answer for beyond racing it or casting [Rout](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rout), which he had in his hand. He responded with the creature in his deck best able to race for less than six mana, the lone remaining [Questing Phelddagrif](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Questing+Phelddagrif). That kept the [Voice of All](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Voice+of+All) back for a while. Brock then put down an Apprentice to lock down the Phelddagrif, protecting it from [Absorb](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Absorb) with a [Gainsay](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gainsay). Knowing [Rout](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rout) would likely soon be in order, Daniel attacked with his [Mystic Snake](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mystic+Snake) and [Questing Phelddagrif](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Questing+Phelddagrif) into the [Voice of All](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Voice+of+All), willing to trade the Snake for four damage. In fact, he decided to cast it right there. Although Daniel was tapped out, Brock had nothing to rebuild with.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/GPDEN01/187sfmandel.jpg) With no creatures left, Daniel resolved a [Fact or Fiction](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fact+or+Fiction), but it accomplished little as all he received was a [Meddling Mage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Meddling+Mage) and a [Yavimaya Coast](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Yavimaya+Coast) and that Mage was countered by [Exclude](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Exclude). With nothing else to do, Daniel raised his shields with a [Sunscape Familiar](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sunscape+Familiar) and the next turn a second one. Having drawn a [Sabertooth Nishoba](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sabertooth+Nishoba), he cast it and all Brock had to say was "yep." A [Stormscape Apprentice](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stormscape+Apprentice) came out but Nishoba has protection from blue. A [Spectral Lynx](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spectral+Lynx) was next, but the Nishoba has trample. Brock tried cycling [Repulse](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Repulse) on a Familiar as he took another four points down to three. Brock had drawn a great deal of land, as the players noticed, and the Nishoba went over for the win.
