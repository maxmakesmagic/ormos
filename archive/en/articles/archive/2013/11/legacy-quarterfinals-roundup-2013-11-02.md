### Richard Nguyen (RUG Delver) vs. Micah Greenbaum (Death and Taxes)


Nguyen's [Delver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Delver) deck came out strong against Greenbaum's Death and Taxes deck, getting an early [Delver of Secrets](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Delver+of+Secrets) into play and transforming it. He was also able to stifle (but not [Stifle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stifle)) Greenbaum's early development with a [Wasteland](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wasteland) that killed a [Karakas](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Karakas), stranding Greenbaum on one land.


"That [Wasteland](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wasteland) was pretty good," Nguyen said after the game. Greenbaum had an [Æther Vial](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=%C3%86ther+Vial) that he was able to get into play, but it was far too slow to keep up, especially when Nguyen added a 4/5 [Tarmogoyf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf) to his side. Two turns later, and Greenbaum packed his cards in.

In the second game, Nguyen desperately tried to avoid Greenbaum's [Crackdown](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crackdown). Yes, you read that right. Against Nguyen's [Delver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Delver) deck, [Crackdown](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crackdown) would effectively keep all of his creatures tapped down, alleviating a great deal of pressure. If, that is, they ever reached three power. Nguyen tried to dodge hitting threshold and failed to reveal a card for his [Delver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Delver) to transform it in an effort to keep his offense alive.


In the final game of this match, things went incredibly well for Greenbaum, but only after they had gone incredibly poorly. After getting his [Æther Vial](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=%C3%86ther+Vial) countered with [Force of Will](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Force+of+Will) and his [Karakas](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Karakas)[Wasteland](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wasteland)ed, stranding him on one mana, Greenbaum was able to rally, drawing the cards he needed to not only get himself back into the game, but prevent Nguyen from winning. It took drawing the perfect set of cards, including a [Swords to Plowshares](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swords+to+Plowshares) for an [Insectile Aberration](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Insectile+Aberration), as well as Nguyen being unable to get his [Nimble Mongoose](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nimble+Mongoose) into threshold. Eventually, Greenbaum found a [Stoneforge Mystic](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stoneforge+Mystic) and a [Batterskull](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Batterskull), eking out a very close game to take the match.


### Osyp Lebedowicz (UR Delver) vs. Brad Jarman (RUG Delver)


Lebedowicz thought he had the advantage in this matchup, as his mana is much better than that of Jarman's RUG [Delver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Delver) deck. While that may be the case, it was Lebedowicz's aggression that carried the day in the first game, quickly overrunning Jarman with creatures.

The second game featured a bizarre moment where Lebedowicz accidentally played a second land at one point. Things were very confusing between multiple [Daze](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Daze)s from both players, but it was all fortunately caught on camera. These days are long, and it is easy to make mistakes at the end of them, and the judges were willing and able to rewind the clock to before that point and progress from there. Rather than take that, however, Lebedowicz chose to concede the game, admitting that he shouldn't be allowed to win this game if he had made such a big mistake. That wonderful display of sportsmanship sent things to a tense Game 3.


With everything in the balance, Lebedowicz managed to get the aggressive start he needed to put himself in the driver's seat. Holding a [Lightning Bolt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt) at the end of the game, Lebedowicz played it safe rather than go for the throat, giving Jarman an extra turn to draw out, but it didn't end up mattering in the end, as Lebedowicz was able to hold on and burn Jarman out.


### Matt Tocco (Ad Nauseam Tendrils) vs. Greg Price (Legacy MUD)


Tocco's first game in the Top 8 was anything but standard. Since this is Legacy, that should be a good thing. Unfortunately, he found himself in an unfavorable situation in an unfavorable matchup. Price's MUD deck comes equipped with a number of potent answers to Tocco's storm deck, including a full set of [Chalice of the Void](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chalice+of+the+Void) and [Trinisphere](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Trinisphere)s. Even with that on his side, Price didn't need them. He had a terrific starting hand, with a [Darksteel Colossus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Darksteel+Colossus) and the [Metalworker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Metalworker) needed to power it out. Faced with this dead end, Tocco took to his deck in an attempt to go off. He was missing a few of the pieces required to power to victory, but he had the eponymous Ad Nauseum, which he used to reveal card after card. And as the cards peeled off, he grew even more desperate, failing to find the kill card needed to actually win as life slipped away. Before he actually drew a kill condition or a way to go find one, he drew himself out of life, essentially killing himself before Price would get the chance.


In the next game, Price did draw his powerful hate cards, landing both a [Chalice of the Void](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chalice+of+the+Void) for one and a [Trinisphere](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Trinisphere). This would have been enough to lock up the game if it weren't for the pair of [Abrupt Decay](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Abrupt+Decay)s in Tocco's hand. This gave him a glimpse of light in an otherwise dark game, but the light was soon snuffed out. A second [Chalice of the Void](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chalice+of+the+Void) for one delayed Tocco just long enough that Price's [Kuldotha Forgemaster](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kuldotha+Forgemaster) was able to put out a hasty [Sundering Titan](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sundering+Titan), clearing Tocco's board.

The game seemed unlosable for Price, as Tocco had no cards in play and he was showing a lethal attack. Instead, Tocco managed to convert a single [Underground Sea](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Underground+Sea) into tons of mana via [Infernal Tutor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Infernal+Tutor)s and [Cabal Ritual](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cabal+Ritual)s, thankfully in threshold. Eventually, thanks to [Past in Flames](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Past+in+Flames), he was able to fetch out a [Tendrils of Agony](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tendrils+of+Agony) to steal the second game.


In the final game, Price once again found the right cards to deal with the situation. [Lodestone Golem](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lodestone+Golem) is very potent against the ANT deck, functioning both to slow them and to put a quick clock down. In addition to this, Price had a [Phyrexian Revoker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phyrexian+Revoker) locking down a pair of [Lion's Eye Diamond](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lion%27s+Eye+Diamond)s. In the end, the combination was too much to bear, and Tocco folded to the pressure.


### Paul Lynch (UWR Miracles) vs. Ari Lax (Death and Taxes)


Lax said earlier that his deck was about not allowing his opponent to actually play **Magic**, and he set up the first game of his quarterfinal match with that in mind. Against Lynch's Miracles control deck, Lax set up a pretty silly cycle with [Mangara of Corondor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mangara+of+Corondor) and [Karakas](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Karakas), where he was able to exile one of Lynch's lands every turn without losing his Mangara. With an [Æther Vial](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=%C3%86ther+Vial) on three counters, this was able to continue until Lynch had had enough.

*Ari Lax vs. Paul Lynch* 

In the second game of their match, it all came down to one tense turn. Lax had managed to deal with all of the major threats that Lynch was able to play. The only thing left on Lynch's side of the table that wasn't a land was a seemingly useless [Rest in Peace](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rest+in+Peace). On the final turn of the game, Lynch managed to find a [Helm of Obedience](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Helm+of+Obedience), which would combo with the [Rest in Peace](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rest+in+Peace) to completely mill Lax out. When he went for it, Lax used [Æther Vial](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=%C3%86ther+Vial) to slip in a [Flickerwisp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flickerwisp), resetting the [Rest in Peace](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rest+in+Peace) and giving him the breathing room. Lax had a [Sword of Fire and Ice](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sword+of+Fire+and+Ice) for his [Mirran Crusader](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mirran+Crusader), representing approximately a billion damage. Lynch took a swing with his Helm, looking for a creature that would allow him to block, surviving the turn and giving him the chance he needed to get to the [Terminus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Terminus) on the top of his deck. Instead, he found a [Wasteland](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wasteland). Game and match to Lax.
