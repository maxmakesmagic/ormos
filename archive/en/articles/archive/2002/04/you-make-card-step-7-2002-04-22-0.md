And the winner is…


**Number #10**  

Whenever a player plays a spell, you may put a +1/+1 counter on CARDNAME. At the beginning of your upkeep, you may remove all +1/+1 counters from CARDNAME and distribute them among any number of creatures.


The +1/+1 counters must have some kind of universal appeal, because #10 won by a decent margin. Here are the results:




|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Mechanic Run-Off** |  |  |
| #7 | 783 | 31% |
| #8 | 718 | 29% |
| #10 | 1016 | 40% |
| Total | 2517 | 100% |

As an honor of being a finalist, we allowed each person to give his mechanic a design name. The name will be used until we have an actual name. The winner’s design name, as submitted by its creator Alex Freeman, is … "Mr. Babycakes."


On Thursday, we will be voting on the creature’s size range. The choices will be as follows:


* Small (the creature’s power and toughness added together equal 4 or less)
* Medium (the creature’s power and toughness added together equal 5 to 9)
* Large (the creature’s power and toughness added together equal 10 or greater)

Then next week, you will have the opportunity to choose the creature’s actual power and toughness.


But you don’t have to wait until Thursday to vote. Before we vote on the size range we need to get one other issue out of the way. One of the ideas that has been tossed around on the message boards is the idea of making Mr. Babycakes (#10) a wall. Did we anticipate the sentiment to make a wall? Not really. But it seems to have enough support to warrant investigation, and the mechanic would function reasonably well on a wall. Plus it will have a big impact on the power and toughness, so we are doing a quick vote this week.


So, should Mr. Babycakes be a wall: yes or no?

The deadline for this vote is midnight this Wednesday, April 24th.
