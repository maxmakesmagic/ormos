GRAND PRIX ORLANDO 2017
-----------------------




* [DAY 2 COVERAGE](#tabs-0)
* [DAY 1 COVERAGE](#tabs-1)


DAY 2 COVERAGE



Nearly 1,300 players arrived in Orlando to battle it out under the bright sun of Kaladesh as they took their final shot at *Aether Revolt-Kaladesh* Sealed Deck, and just under 400 have returned for Day Two. In a world of shiny new invention, it was an old pro who led the way. Chris Pikula – who last made the Top 8 of a Grand Prix 12 years ago – leads the way as we enter the Draft rounds of Day Two.


*Aether Revolt* draft has been highly praised, and six rounds of it today will give us a Top 8 to battle it out for the title. Also undefeated are Stephen Neal, Luis Salvatto, Patrick Tierney and Jorge Mantilla. Will these five continue to lead the pack, or will others rise up to knock them off?


Coverage begins at 10 a.m. at [Twitch.tv/Magic](https://Twitch.tv/Magic).







DAY 1 COVERAGE




 Nearly 1,300 players arrived in Orlando to battle it out under the bright sun of Kaladesh as they took their final shot at *Aether Revolt-Kaladesh* Sealed Deck. In a world of shiny new invention, it was an old pro who led the way. Chris Pikula – who last made the Top 8 of a Grand Prix 12 years ago – finished Day One at 9-0 alongside Stephen Neal, Luis Salvatto, Patrick Tierney and Jorge Mantilla.




 All eyes will be on the group we enter Sunday and the competitors try their hand at *Aether Revolt-Kaladesh* draft. With aggressive vehicles driving the narrative on Saturday, we can expect to see more of the same as players take one final visit to Kaladesh.



Will the undefeated be able to convert their hot starts into a Top 8 berth? Or will the litany of pros lurking just underneath rise up?



 Find out Sunday. Coverage begins at 10 a.m. at [Twitch.tv/Magic](https://www.twitch.tv/magic).
