As this goes live, it’s less than 100 hours until the [*Planar Chaos* prerelease events](/en/articles/archive/planar-chaos-worldwide-prerelease-locations-2007-01-12) begin all over the world. The [minisite](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=magic/planarchaos/home) has its last batch of updates today, which should help tide you over until then.


Today’s update features:


* One last flavorful look at the storyline of *Planar Chaos* (delicious)
* Exclusive art previews (ridiculously mouth-watering)
* The final installment of Michael G. Ryan’s story, “Destiny” (melt-in-your-mouth delectable)
* Bonus puzzle and wallpaper (something we like to call “finger-lickin’ scrumptious”)

So, the plane may be in ruins, the coalition may be scattered, and the time rifts may be inundating the apocalypse survivors with alternate-history anomalies, but you get to check out brand-new content. 


Wednesday’s looking a little better already.
