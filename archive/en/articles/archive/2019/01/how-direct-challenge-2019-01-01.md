On the Direct Challenge play blade, there is now a Challenge Options drop-down that allows you to choose the format (best-of-one or best-of-three), as well as who goes first.


You can pick from Coin Flip (where the game randomly determines who goes first), You Win Coin Flip, or Opponent Wins Coin Flip. For reference, the winner of the coin flip will be on the play in best-of-one and will choose in best-of-three.


By default, the options are set to best-of-one and coin flip, and you'll want to coordinate with your friends if you make any changes.
