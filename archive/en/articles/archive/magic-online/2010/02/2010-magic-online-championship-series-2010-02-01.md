### Events Eligibility

* All **Magic Online** players who meet the eligibility requirements set forth herein are eligible to compete in this online tournament series. All **Magic Online** players are eligible to compete in the 2010 **Magic Online** Championship Series except (a) players who are otherwise ineligible to engage in tournament play pursuant to the [**Magic Online** User Agreement](http://wizards.custhelp.com/cgi-bin/wizards.cfg/php/enduser/std_adp.php?p_faqid=1358) and (b) employees or contractors of Wizards of the Coast LLC, Hasbro or each of their respective subsidiaries or affiliates or their advertising or promotion agencies, or those who are domiciled with any such person, or those who have been disqualified for other reasons (see below). This is a skill-based tournament based on a player's ability to defeat other players.
* Players will be disqualified if they are banned from the game for any reason, including without limitation a violation of the [**Magic Online** User Agreement](http://wizards.custhelp.com/cgi-bin/wizards.cfg/php/enduser/std_adp.php?p_faqid=1358).
* Although players may have multiple accounts qualified for a championship or championship event, players are not permitted to have more than one of their accounts entered in the event. Players are not permitted to have secondary accounts played by another person. If a player is discovered to have more than one account playing in a championship or championships before, during, or after the event, appropriate penalties will be applied (including disqualification from the event with no refund of product or event tickets).
* Playing on another person's account, selling your account, etc. are all violations of the [Terms of Service](http://wizards.custhelp.com/cgi-bin/wizards.cfg/php/enduser/std_adp.php?p_faqid=1358). If you play in these championships, win, and expect to get your prize, be very, very sure you are on your own account. We do not recognize "I and a friend jointly own the account," "It's my brother's account but he gave it to me," or similar. The only exception is an adult may authorize a single dependent child age 13-18 to play on an account that adult has purchased.
* Wizards of the Coast reserves the right to reschedule and/or restart games and matches as needed. Such decisions will be announced on the [**Magic Online** website](/en/articles/archive/2009-06-29) and/or within the **Magic Online** client as needed.

To be eligible to participate in an end-of-season championship, the following requirements must be met:

* All **Magic Online** players must be at least 13 or older. A championship player between the ages of 13 and 18 will be required to get a parent or guardian's signature on the required waiver and consent forms as explained below. In addition, the player must have Internet access as well as access to a personal computer.
* Player must be a **Magic Online** account holder in good standing and in compliance with the [**Magic Online** User Agreement](http://wizards.custhelp.com/cgi-bin/wizards.cfg/php/enduser/std_adp.php?p_faqid=1358).

### Championship Series Structure

* There are ten seasons in the 2010 **Magic Online** Championship Series. Each season consists of a number of specified tournaments (queues, daily, and premier events) that will offer the opportunity to earn Qualifier Points (QPs). Each season's start and end date are listed in the schedule below.
* At the end of each specified tournament, all participants may earn Qualifier Points (QPs) based upon their final rank in the tournament.
* At the end of each season, all players who have earned sufficient QPs are invited to participate in the appropriate end-of-season championship. The winner of each end-of-season championship will earn a slot in the 2010 **Magic Online** Championship.
* The 11th slot of the 2010 **Magic Online** Championship will be awarded to the winner of the [**Magic Online** Player of the Year Championship tournament](http://www.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/other/9212010mocs) held on October 30, 2010. This event will only be open to certain players, based on the various [**Magic Online** Player of the Year rankings](/en/articles/archive/magic-online/2010-magic-online-player-year-race-2010-01-14).
* The 12th and final slot of the 2010 **Magic Online** Championship will be awarded to the winner of the [MOCS LCQ](http://www.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/other/9212010mocs) held on October 31, 2010. This tournament will be open to all players not already qualified.

* Each scheduled LCQ will be a 4-round single elimination tournament. Players will need to provide the required product for the LCQ (their deck for a constructed LCQ, the required boosters for a limited LCQ) but otherwise the LCQ will be free to join for qualified players. All participants that finish 4-0 will qualify for that season's championship *(no other prizes will be awarded to these events)*.
