*What **Magic** card do you consider your personal nemesis?*

On that list of truly powerful and/or unfun cards, my choice is perhaps the most innocuous-seeming on the board. No, not [Grozoth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grozoth)—who hates [Grozoth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grozoth)? My personal nemesis is [Sage Owl](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sage+Owl) and, as indicated, my antipathy extends to [all of its filthy, top-four-card-looking-at, order-switching, non-scrying kin](http://archive.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?action=advanced&text=+%22look%20at%20the%20top%20four%20cards%20of%20your%20library%22+%22put%20them%20back%20in%20any%20order%22). There's a reason Nik Davidson dubbed it "the Bluebird of Unhappiness."

One of the great joys of **Magic** is ripping off the top—it's like Christmas every turn. [Sage Owl](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sage+Owl)? [Sage Owl](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sage+Owl) is peeking at your presents in October. If they're great, you still have to wait for them. If they're terrible, you have a long time to dread getting them. And either way, the surprise is ruined. Curse you, [Sage Owl](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sage+Owl)!
