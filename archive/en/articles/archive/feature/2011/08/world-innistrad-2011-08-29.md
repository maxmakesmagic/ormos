Innistrad is a dangerous plane filled with powerful magic. If you can overcome—or overpower—the evil here, you'll reap the rewards, unleashing those horrors on any who stand before you. How will your decks embrace this chilling new world?


Horrifying creatures have always existed on Innistrad. The humans of this world have always relied on their faith to shield them from vampires and werewolves, spirits and ghouls. But of late, the holy wards and runes have begun to fail. The protection of travelers' shrines and rustic prayers grows weak. The spells of vampire slayers and wolfhunters are no longer proof against the creatures that prowl the shadows. The Lunarch, head of the revered Church of Avacyn, knows what the village priests whisper: that the archangel Avacyn has abandoned Innistrad.
