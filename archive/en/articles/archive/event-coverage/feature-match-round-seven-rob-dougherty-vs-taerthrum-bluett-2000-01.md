At the opening of the round, each player was deck-checked. The check took so long that there was enough time to conduct an in-depth conversation about governmental airline subsidization. Who knew that airport security was paid minimal wage and had a 300% turnover rate!?


Anyways, Rob, part of Team Your Move Games, is playing No-Mar versus Taerthrum's Red/White/Blue Aggro deck.


### Game 1


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/GPMINN01/967.jpg)Rob started the game, but Taer had both a [Goblin Legionnaire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Legionnaire) and a [Goblin Trenches](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Trenches) on the table before Rob played his first card, a [Phyrexian Rager](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phyrexian+Rager). Unfortunately for Rob, he was still lacking his fourth land on his fifth turn and tried to slow Taer down by [Recoil](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Recoil)ing his [Coastal Tower](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Coastal+Tower). Rob found his fourth land, and his first white mana source on his sixth turn, but unfortunately it was a [Dromar's Cavern](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dromar%27s+Cavern) which set him back even further. Rob then dropped a [Spectral Lynx](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spectral+Lynx), but it was the target of a split Fire at the end of his turn, bringing him to eight life. Taer attacked with 4 Goblin/Soldier tokens and a [Galina's Knight](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Galina%27s+Knight) on his next turn and added a [Meddling Mage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Meddling+Mage) to the team. After some haggling over whether he should name [Treva's Charm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treva%27s+Charm), [Darigaaz's Charm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Darigaaz%27s+Charm), or [Dromar's Charm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dromar%27s+Charm), Taer finally chose the correct one and cut off any chance for Rob to mount a comeback, ending the game.

### Game 2


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/GPMINN01/966.jpg)Rob started off game two with two tapduals met by two basic lands and a [Meddling Mage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Meddling+Mage) naming [Spectral Lynx](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spectral+Lynx) from Taer. A third turn [Phyrexian Rager](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phyrexian+Rager) from Rob prevented any attacks during the next turn. Taer simply dropped another [Meddling Mage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Meddling+Mage), this time naming [Dromar's Charm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dromar%27s+Charm), and passed the turn. Rob played an [Addle](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Addle) on his next turn revealing his opponent's hand: Fire/Ice, [Galina's Knight](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Galina%27s+Knight), [Absorb](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Absorb), [Repulse](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Repulse), and Mountain. Rob chose Fire/Ice, prompting Taer to use his [Repulse](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Repulse) on the [Phyrexian Rager](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phyrexian+Rager) to clear the way for his Mage army. Rob cast [Vindicate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vindicate) on the [Meddling Mage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Meddling+Mage) naming [Spectral Lynx](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spectral+Lynx) and proceeded to drop one.


Taer used a recently top-decked Fire/Ice to clear out the Lynx while Rob was tapped-out and continued swinging with a [Meddling Mage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Meddling+Mage) and [Galina's Knight](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Galina%27s+Knight). Taer dropped an uncontested [Goblin Trenches](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Trenches), putting significant pressure on Rob to find an answer. Finally, at five life, Rob was forced to waste a [Dromar's Charm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dromar%27s+Charm) to gain life and a bit more time to exploit the fact that Taer wasn't drawing more land to supply his [Goblin's Trenches](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin%27s+Trenches). With only two land on the table, Taer generated just enough tokens to put Rob in [Urza's Rage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Urza%27s+Rage) range, but before combat damage resolved, Rob played yet another [Dromar's Charm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dromar%27s+Charm) to keep himself out of an unstable situation.


Taer dropped a [Battlefield Forge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Battlefield+Forge) next, and Rob's wisdom in predicting the red mana source showed. Rob played a second [Phyrexian Rager](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phyrexian+Rager) dropping him to six. Taer cast an end of turn Rage on Rob and, with only a [Lightning Angel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Angel) in hand, topped a fourth land to kill Rob and take the match.


**Final Result:** Taerthrum Bluett 2 - Rob Dougherty 0


Taerthrum Bluett advances to 6-0-1 and Rob Dougherty falls to 5-1-1; both will still be in day 2.
