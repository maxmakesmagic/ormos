Blue-Red Bad Cards with two [Balefire Dragon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Balefire+Dragon)s (1-0-2)


Toughest decision was whether to draft Black when it was open in Draft 2. I hate Black and I didn't.


**What card(s) surprised you this weekend – on your side of the battlefield or the other?**


Anger was super impressive on both sides. Hasty [Balefire Dragon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Balefire+Dragon) anyone?
