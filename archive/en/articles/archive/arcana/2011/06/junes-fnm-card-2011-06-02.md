It's Thursday, which means that tomorrow is Friday. And *that* means that tomorrow night is [Friday Night **Magic**](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/TCG/Events.aspx?x=events/magic/fnm)! Since we're now in June, there's a new card being given out at FNM. Check it!

Each month a different foil card will be given out. The cards feature the FNM logo and many have original flavor text and updated wordings.
