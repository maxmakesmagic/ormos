* [Format](#-tabs-2)
* [Tournament Length and Advancement](#-tabs-3)
* [Playoff](#-tabs-4)
* [Entry Fee](#-tabs-5)

The structure for Regional Pro Tour Qualifiers is modified Swiss-style.


Because Regional Pro Tour Qualifiers award invitations based on total attendance, the number of single-elimination matches that are to be played after the Swiss rounds is determined based on as follows:




|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Attendance** | **How Many Single-Elimination Matches?** |
| Up to 42 Players | Quarterfinals and Semifinals |
| 43-93 Players | Quarterfinals Only |
| 94+ Players | No Single-Elimination Matches |



* Modern Constructed.
* Decklists are required.


* Swiss rounds will be 50 minutes in length.
* Single-elimination playoff matches will have no time limit.
* Number of Swiss rounds based on attendance according to the following chart:



|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Attendance** | **Swiss rounds** | **Playoff** |
| 9—16 | 4 Rounds | Top 8 |
| 17—32 | 5 Rounds | Top 8 |
| 33—64 | 6 Rounds | Top 8 |
| 65—93 | 7 Rounds | Top 8 |
| 94—128 | 7 Rounds | None |
| 129—226 | 8 Rounds | None |
| 227—409 | 9 Rounds | None |
| 410 or higher | 10 Rounds | None |



* Playoff matches will be best two of three.
* Playoff matches will be single-elimination.
* While there are no time limits in the playoff rounds, players are expected to play at a reasonable pace and finish their matches within 60 minutes.
* Standings after the Swiss rounds will be used to determine final order in the standings for losing players in the quarterfinal and semifinal playoff rounds.
* For the first game of each match in the playoff, the player who finished higher in the Swiss rounds chooses either to play first or to play second. For subsequent games in each playoff match, the usual Play/Draw rule applies (loser of the previous game decides whether to play first in the next game).
* The [*Magic: The Gathering* Tournament Rules](http://wpn.wizards.com/en/document/magic-gathering-tournament-rules) and the [*Magic: The Gathering* Infraction Procedure Guide](http://wpn.wizards.com/en/document/magic-infraction-procedure-guide) are in effect for this event unless specifically overruled by information in this Fact Sheet.
* Players are responsible for bringing their own method of tracking life totals and appropriate counters or tokens.


Entry fees for Regional Pro Tour Qualifiers vary from organizer to organizer. Contact the tournament organizer of the Regional Pro Tour Qualifier you are planning to attend for exact information.

\*Travel


The players eligible to receive a travel award will receive instructions from Wizards of the Coast regarding whom they must contact and the deadline by which they must arrange their travel awards. Wizards of the Coast will not refund travel made outside this service. Wizards of the Coast reserves the right to award a cash equivalent award in lieu of any travel award in its sole discretion.


All travel itineraries must be from the international airport nearest the player's home and to the host city of the Pro Tour, and must include all the dates of that event.

This award must be redeemed through member's arrangement of travel itinerary no later than (30) days before departure. Failure to complete travel arrangements as directed by Wizards of the Coast prior to this deadline will result in forfeiture of the award. Every member receiving a travel award must provide to Wizards of the Coast an executed liability release, the appropriate US taxation form (W9 or W8) (or have one on file), [up-to-date contact information on your DCI membership](http://accounts.wizards.com/), and proof of ID and passport (when required by international destination). In all cases, all such documentation must be provided to Wizards of the Coast, or must have been previously on file, at least thirty (30) days before departure. Failure to timely provide such documentation will result in forfeiture of the award.


Players under the age of eighteen (18) at the time of the Pro Tour will receive a cash equivalent award in lieu of expenses, paid air ticket, and/or hotel accommodations. Such player must still attend, compete, and be listed in the finish of the tournament or forfeit this award.
