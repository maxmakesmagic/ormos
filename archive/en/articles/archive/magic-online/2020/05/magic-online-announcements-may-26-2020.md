*Ikoria* Commander and *Secret Lair*: Summer Superdrop
------------------------------------------------------


After a short delay, *Ikoria* Commander releases on MTGO with tomorrow's maintenance. You'll be able to find all the new commander cards in Treasure Chests, including powerful new Commander options like [Gavi, Nest Warden](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gavi%2C+Nest+Warden) and [Kalamax, the Stormsire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kalamax%2C+the+Stormsire). Check out [Gavin Verhey's article](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/card-preview/ikoria-commander-2020-04-03) to learn more about how these decks came to be.


In addition, *Magic Online* is happy to be part of the recently announced [*Secret Lair*: Summer Superdrop](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/news/announcing-secret-lair-summer-superdrop-2020-05-25). Each drop from the Summer Superdrop comes with a *Magic Online* code to redeem for the contents of that drop, though all *Magic Online* versions will be non-foil. Each drop is only available for a short time, so check out the schedule to make sure you get the drop you want (or just get the bundle to get all five!).

*Magic Online* Super Qualifiers
-------------------------------


As part of our initiatives to give you [more ways to play at home](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/news/FNM_at_Home), we wanted to provide options for you to play at the highest levels for competitive stakes. Therefore, in light of the [changes to the tabletop Players Tour Qualifiers announced earlier](https://magic.gg/news/changes-to-qualifiers-for-players-tour-series-2-events-and-schedule), we're adding a new series of qualifiers to [*Magic Online*](https://magic.wizards.com/en/content/what-magic-online-magic-online-products-game-info) to provide additional ways for players to compete and qualify for upcoming Players Tour events: *Magic Online* Super Qualifiers. These events will continue to qualify for [Players Tour events on *MTG Arena* in mid-June](https://magic.gg/news/whats-next-for-the-magic-esports-2020-partial-season).

*War of the Spark* Encore Draft May 27–June 3
---------------------------------------------


The most requested event of late is *War of the Spark* Encore Draft, so from May 27–June 3, we're delivering on just that. Don't forget: as an Encore draft, not only will you keep the cards you draft, but you can also use booster packs to enter the event! Event entry includes 12 Event Tickets, 120 Play Points, or 2 Event Tickets plus 3 boosters from *War of the Spark*.

*Ikoria* Season Alternative Play Calendar
-----------------------------------------


John Terrill's *Cultic Cube*, running from May 20 to May 27, is wrapping up tomorrow. You can see [John's article and cube list from Monday, May 18](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/magic-digital/cube-spotlight-series-john-terrills-cultic-cube-2020-05-18), and it's a must-read since it goes deep into the philosophy of cube design theory in general and the creation of *Cultic Cube* in particular. If you want to check out this awesome cube, do so soon.


Starting tomorrow, we have a week of *War of the Spark* Encore drafts. (Remember, Encore drafts aren't phantom; you'll keep everything you draft!) They're sweet, but not news.


What is news is that, starting June 3, [streamer and content creator Amaz](https://www.twitch.tv/amaz) will present his *Peasant Cube*! His article will be going up a few days before the event begins, and you can check it out then. In the meantime, you can watch Amaz stream *Magic Online* and other games on Twitch at [twitch.tv/amaz](https://www.twitch.tv/amaz).


Then, on June 10, the ever-popular *Legacy Cube* returns for a few weeks to round out the season.

Build Notes
-----------


Duel Scene | Using a clone effect on [Lavinia, Azorius Renegade](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lavinia%2C+Azorius+Renegade) will no longer cause a game to restart.


Duel Scene | [Kazuul, Tyrant of the Cliffs](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kazuul%2C+Tyrant+of+the+Cliffs) is now properly sated by a player paying his toll and will not make the Ogre token.


Duel Scene | [Spellskite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spellskite) and other redirection effects will now work properly with triggers that require targeting an opponent's permanent.


Duel Scene | The "No Possible Play: Yield All" function (associated with the hotkey "8") once again will allow players to take actions during combat.


Sound | The General sound slider found in the Account scene now properly controls the sound of card and in-duel sounds.


Deck Building | A display bug that caused [Zirda, the Dawnwaker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Zirda%2C+the+Dawnwaker)'s "Show cards incompatible with companion" function to see creatures with mutate and an activated ability ([Parcelbeast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Parcelbeast), [Porcuparrot](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Porcuparrot)) as not having an activated ability has been resolved.


General | All cards from C20 (*Ikoria* Commander) have been added to the system. [They can be found in Treasure Chests](https://magic.wizards.com/en/MTGO/articles/archive/magic-online/treasure-chest-card-list-info).
