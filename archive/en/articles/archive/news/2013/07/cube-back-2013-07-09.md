The Cube Is Back!
=================



 Posted in **News**
 on December 8, 2013 










The **Magic Online** Cube returns once more, kicking off after the downtime on July 17th, 2013.


A **Magic Online** Cube is a selection of a few hundred cards that can span the entire history of **Magic**. These are divided into fifteen-card “booster packs” for drafting, but there are no multiples of cards—each card is unique in the Cube. Playing a **Magic Online** Cube is like taking an action-packed tour of **Magic**’s past.


With the release of *Dragon's Maze*, **Magic** R&D has swapped in four new *Dragon's Maze* cards to the **Magic Online** Cube:



* Voice of Resurgence replaces Gaddock Teeg
* Deadbridge Chant replaces Abrupt Decay
* Ral Zarek replaces Fire // Ice
* Ætherling replaces Sphinx of Jwar Isle

[The full list of cards](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/other/07092013c#cardlist) is available at the bottom of this article.


You can find even more challenges by testing your mettle in the [*Rise of the Eldrazi*](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/tcg/productarticle.aspx?x=mtg/tcg/riseoftheeldrazi/productinfo) Draft Queues in the Limited Queues room. The single elimination Cube queues include *Rise of the Eldrazi* boosters as part of their prizes.
