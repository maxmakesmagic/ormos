First off, today's Election Day. Get your butt out there and vote.


Second, don't take the article's title personally. Just because I despise infinite (or "arbitrarily large," if you're in the presence of Paul Barclay) mana engines, it doesn't mean I don't like you. Well, I suppose you're off on the wrong foot, but there's still hope for you. And that's why when Aaron assigned this week's theme, I didn't paste a whole bunch of rolled-up **Magic** cards end to end with superglue to form a delicate-but-rigorous noose and hang myself in front of my local Wizards of the Coast store. (Yes, we have one in Minnesota! At the Mall of America no less -- get your booster packs, lingerie, *and* Wisconsin cheesehead helmets, all at one convenient thousand-acre location! Just please don't tell the rest of us why.)


My first goal for this article is to convince those of you playing casual **Magic** to abandon the idea of infinite mana engines. Failing that (and I assume I will fail for some percentage), I will fall back to my second goal: getting you to think more creatively about mana engines. Finally, if I can't get you to do even that much, I'll give you some ideas for what to do with all that infinite mana that won't completely bore your friends to tears while you "have fun."


Did I mention I don't like infinite mana engines? Let's get started.


### GENTLEMEN, STOP YOUR ENGINES


Before you start your really cool idea to generate infinite mana, I just need you to ask yourself one question, *Why do you need it?*


Infinite mana engines are, by definition, combo-deck components. You need a certain sequence to repeat over and over, so that you can get so many resources that you can do whatever you like with no challenge possible -- short of a counterspell (and even that can be touch-and-go, depending on your spell).


Repeating sequences that end in inevitable events is like, well, watching a robot on the floor of a car assembly line. The first time you see the robot arm with its cute little velvet-lined robot fingers test the car door by opening it and closing it, you think to yourself, how cute, the robot can open and close the door. The second time it does so, you think, *hmmm, it's doing it again . . . and see? The door still opens and closes, just like it's supposed to.* The third, fourth, and four-hundredth times, you're thinking to yourself, *y'know, I could teach my dog to do this, and she'd do it with more personality.*


Now, I understand the young man psyche. (Most **Magic** players are, as we are all continually depressed to find out about each other, young men.) The one-upmanship, the self-image of invulnerability, the need to boast about rendering other men impotent via your mere presence. But domination fantasies aside, you could consider **Magic** an opportunity to flex your *other* social and strategic skills. Wouldn't that be fun? Or at least dignified?


### ENGINE TROUBLE


So you're determined to make the darn things anyway? Fine. But if you can't preserve your dignity, at least shoot for style points, okay? I'm here to help, in as insulting a way as I can manage without triggering Aaron's editing instincts.


None of these are incredibly efficient. (Well, the last one's pretty easy to do.) But my aim isn't to make your infinite mana engine easy for you. My aim is to show you how to pretend you're an interesting player. Dig deep, my friends.


### Two Reaps, Dark Ritual, and Lotus Petal




![Reap](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Reap)


![Dark Ritual](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Dark+Ritual)


![Lotus Petal](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Lotus+Petal)


Note the relevant errata on [Reap](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reap):


*Return any number of target cards from your graveyard to your hand. You can't choose more cards than the number of black permanents that your opponents control.*


Because of the errata changing "target opponent" to "your opponents," this theoretical Type 1 combo actually shines brighter in multiplayer. In group, you're far more likely to find at least two black permanents that your opponents control -- and if you *do* get stuck, the game's pace will allow you to play something like [Sway of Illusion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sway+of+Illusion) or [Darkest Hour](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Darkest+Hour). (I hear that the serious [Reap](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reap) players, which sounds like an oxymoron, prefer [Prismatic Lace](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Prismatic+Lace), which can be retrieved multiple times by the [Reap](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reap)s.)


You need one swamp in play, and your opponents have to be kind enough to provide three black permanents for you. One [Reap](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reap) can be in your graveyard. (If it's not, the first [Reap](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reap) is for two cards instead of three.) You sack the [Lotus Petal](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lotus+Petal) for green and tap your swamp to play [Dark Ritual](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dark+Ritual) (![](https://web.archive.org/web/20220123123600im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/green.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227195556im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/black.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227195556im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/black.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227195556im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/black.gif) in your pool). Play [Reap](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reap) for three (![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227195556im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/black.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227195556im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/black.gif)). Bring back [Dark Ritual](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dark+Ritual), [Lotus Petal](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lotus+Petal), and the [Reap](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reap) that was already in the graveyard. (The [Reap](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reap) you're playing is not in the graveyard until after the spell resolves, so you can't target it.) Use one of your stored ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227195556im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/black.gif) to play [Dark Ritual](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dark+Ritual) (![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227195556im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/black.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227195556im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/black.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227195556im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/black.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227195556im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/black.gif)). Play and sack the [Lotus Petal](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lotus+Petal) for green (![](https://web.archive.org/web/20220123123600im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/green.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227195556im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/black.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227195556im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/black.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227195556im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/black.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227195556im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/black.gif)). Play [Reap](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reap) . . . and so on.


### Four Fertile Grounds, Telekinetic Bonds, and Compulsion


  


![Fertile Ground](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Fertile+Ground)


![Telekinetic Bonds](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Telekinetic+Bonds)


![Compulsion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Compulsion)


All [Fertile Ground](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fertile+Ground)s must be in play, *on the same land.* (No, don't ask me how you do this. This isn't "Get Four Silly Enchant Lands in Play" theme week.) [Telekinetic Bonds](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Telekinetic+Bonds) and [Compulsion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Compulsion) must also be in play. And you must have at least one card in your hand to discard to [Compulsion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Compulsion).


Tap your Enchant-o-Matic™ Land (![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227130050im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless3.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161115194122im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/blue.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161115194122im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/blue.gif) in your pool, where the "3" can be any color you want) to pay for [Compulsion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Compulsion)'s activation (![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161225105850im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless2.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161115194122im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/blue.gif) remaining). When you discard the card to [Compulsion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Compulsion), make sure to pay ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20211201201921im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless1.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161115194122im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/blue.gif) for the Bonds' option (![](https://web.archive.org/web/20211201201921im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless1.gif)). Untap your Enchant-o-Matic Land. Keep going.


At some point, you will either have enough mana (of any colors) to cast your winning card(s), or you will draw into something you don't want to discard, or you will mill your entire library away and look rather moronic. Design your deck appropriately. [I suggest two copies of [Dwell on the Past](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dwell+on+the+Past) to allow going arbitrarily infinite. --Aaron]

| *A classic infinite mana engine: Enduring Renewal combines with Shield Sphere and Ashnod's Altar.* |

### Ashnod's Altar, Enduring Renewal, and Shield Sphere


  


![Ashnod's Altar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Ashnod%27s+Altar)


![Enduring Renewal](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Enduring+Renewal)


![Shield Sphere](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Shield+Sphere)


This one's an old-school favorite, and there's a "damage variant" involved that uses [Goblin Bombardment](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Bombardment) instead of the Altar. Of course, you can use any zero-mana-cost creature, not just the [Shield Sphere](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shield+Sphere). ([Ornithopter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ornithopter) may be funnier.)


This one's easy to explain. Start with all three permanents on the board. Sack the Sphere to the Altar, Renewal sends it back to your (revealed) hand, and you cast it again. Repeat until you feel all dizzy and floopy inside.


### Living Death, Anarchist, Phyrexian Plaguelord, Cathodion, and Two Blood Vassals




![Living Death](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Living+Death)


![Anarchist](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Anarchist)


![Phyrexian Plaguelord](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Phyrexian+Plaguelord)


![Cathodion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Cathodion)


![Blood Vassal](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Blood+Vassal)


You have a [Phyrexian Plaguelord](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phyrexian+Plaguelord), [Cathodian](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cathodian), and two [Blood Vassal](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Vassal)s in play, and [Anarchist](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Anarchist) is either in play or in your graveyard. (With an extra ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20160830042801im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless4.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227130159im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/red.gif) to start, you can certainly have it in your hand, as well. Just get it on the board to start.) Obviously [Survival of the Fittest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Survival+of+the+Fittest) makes this whole plan rather easy to execute. Sack the [Blood Vassal](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Vassal)s for their mana abilities (![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227195556im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/black.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227195556im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/black.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227195556im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/black.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227195556im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/black.gif)) and the [Cathodian](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cathodian) to the Plaguelord (![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227130050im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless3.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227195556im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/black.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227195556im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/black.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227195556im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/black.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227195556im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/black.gif)). Play [Living Death](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Living+Death) (![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227195556im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/black.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227195556im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/black.gif)). In response to your own spell, make sure you sack [Anarchist](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Anarchist) to the Plaguelord, and then sack Plaguelord to itself, so that both are in your graveyard by the time [Living Death](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Living+Death) resolves.


As part of [Living Death](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Living+Death)'s resolution, [Anarchist](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Anarchist) comes into play. By the time the [Anarchist](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Anarchist)'s comes-into-play ability goes on the stack, [Living Death](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Living+Death) will be completely resolved and in your graveyard. Return it to your hand. You still have ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227195556im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/black.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227195556im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/black.gif) left, and can now restart the cycle, gaining ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227195556im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/black.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227195556im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/black.gif) each time for as many times as you care to do it.


Recursion is, by and large, a good way to keep the mana flowing. If you don't have one black *Tempest* rare, you can always use another one.


### Corpse Dance, Draco, Soldevi Adnate, and Intruder Alarm


  


![Corpse Dance](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Corpse+Dance)


![Draco](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Draco)


![Soldevi Adnate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Soldevi+Adnate)


![Intruder Alarm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Intruder+Alarm)


Start with [Draco](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Draco), the Alarm, and the Adnate on the board.

(and yes, at this point I'm just doing this to make you all count 33 ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227195556im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/black.gif)s . . . I may just have put 32 or 34 in there to give those of us who despise combos something more interesting to do).


### Sliver Queen and Mana Echoes




![Sliver Queen](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Sliver+Queen)


![Mana Echoes](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Mana+Echoes)


Both must be in play, and you'll preferably want enough mana to get at least two Slivers out (that'd be four mana of any type, last time I multiplied). Tap four mana. The first Sliver drone earns you one mana through [Mana Echoes](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Echoes) (because [Sliver Queen](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sliver+Queen) is a Sliver) (![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227130050im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless3.gif) in your pool). The second Sliver drone earns you two more (![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227130050im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless3.gif) still). Use two mana to produce another Sliver, which earns you three more (![](https://web.archive.org/web/20160830042801im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless4.gif)). Do it again (![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161005045835im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless6.gif)). And on and on. For my money, this is the most efficient two-card mana engine involving an *Onslaught* card.


### ENGINE EXHAUST


So now that you have all this lovely mana, whatever are you going to do with it? First off, let's try to be more original than [Fireball](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fireball), [Capsize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Capsize), or [Prosperity](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Prosperity). The win won't be as secure -- but you'll make a more lasting impression. Plus, people won't hate you. (Is that a plus for combo players?) Perhaps one or more of the following:


**[Cephalid Constable](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cephalid+Constable) and [Ghitu War Cry](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ghitu+War+Cry)** -- Assuming your X is all red (wash it through a [Skyshroud Elf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skyshroud+Elf), if you must), you can completely hose a player by attacking with a massive, firebreathing Cephalid, and then returning all permanents to your opponent's hand. Wait. That's overkill. Could be my central point, or I may just be confused. Let me try another one . . .


**[Goblin Offensive](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Offensive) and [Sparksmith](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sparksmith)** -- Man, this is *hard . . .* 


**[Goblin Offensive](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Offensive) and [Sword of the Ages](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sword+of+the+Ages)** -- I think I'm getting the hang of this . . . but, of course, this is just a one-shot deal . . .


**[Firecat Blitz](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Firecat+Blitz)** -- Barely acceptable. It's, in effect, a slower [Fireball](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fireball) (or more accurately, [Rolling Thunder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rolling+Thunder)). But it shows a bit more flair and daring, so no one should shout you off the table. Hey, they can always play [Tangle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tangle), right? Unless you follow up with [Last-Ditch Effort](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Last-Ditch+Effort).




|  |
| --- |
| *Don't be passé with all that mana! Fireball? Stroke of Genius? Bah!* |

**[Verdeloth the Ancient](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Verdeloth+the+Ancient)** -- Same basic concept, but without the haste. I suppose you could [Read the Runes](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Read+the+Runes) to get [Anger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Anger) into your graveyard. Then follow up with [An-Havva Inn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=An-Havva+Inn), and then maybe [Hatred](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hatred).


Let's just stipulate that there are at least a dozen creature-style X spells you could use . . . that way I won't have to list any more.


**[Snake Basket](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snake+Basket)** -- Okay, one more.


**[Anthroplasm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Anthroplasm)** -- Men who are secure in their masculinity put all the marbles on one nonblack creature, dare the [Terror](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Terror), and swing once for each opponent. (*Smart* men who are secure in their masculinity keep a [Misdirection](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Misdirection) handy.)


**[Masticore](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Masticore) and [Repercussion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Repercussion)** -- This one feels almost clever. Works even better if you force creatures on them with, say, [Varchild's War-Riders](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Varchild%27s+War-Riders).


**[Glyph of Delusion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glyph+of+Delusion) and [Ghitu War Cry](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ghitu+War+Cry)** -- How long can your Wall lock down a creature? As long as you want. The fact that you can play this *after* combat as long as your Wall is still around (so pump with Cry after damage) keeps this viable for all infinite engines, most of which move at sorcery speed.


**[Illusionary Mask](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Illusionary+Mask)** -- In the age of morph, this gets some serious style points. No, the X doesn't really do anything other than completely bury the possible identity of the creature. But you weren't really expecting *serious* uses of all that mana, were you? Good. Let's keep going.


**[Atogatog](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Atogatog), [Puffer Extract](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Puffer+Extract), and another Atog** -- "Puff" the other Atog up, then sack it to the [Atogatog](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Atogatog) for another temporary gain. No, I don't know why either. But it's [Atogatog](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Atogatog) -- no one's supposed to know why. [Berserk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Berserk) probably fits somewhere in here.


**[Kangee, Aerie Keeper](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kangee%2C+Aerie+Keeper)** -- With all the Bird Soldiers in the most recent two blocks, the kicker on this guy can go completely nuts. This is like your own flying [Snake Basket](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snake+Basket) . . . well, okay, not really.


**[Molten Hydra](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Molten+Hydra)** -- Nothing says "back off" like a Hydra with 1,345,924 molten heads.


**[Ventifact Bottle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ventifact+Bottle)** -- A good way to take all of your useful, colored infinite mana and force yourself to wash it into colorless and use it all during your next precombat main phase or die. I like it.


**[Energy Vortex](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Energy+Vortex)** -- *Now* we're talking! While you're getting your six-part combo out, get a few of these babies on the board, too, each targeting a different player. You get only 3 damage per upkeep, no matter how many counters you put on there -- and you have to replenish them every upkeep. So it's like [Barbed Wire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Barbed+Wire) -- yet better *and* worse, at the same time. Perfect!


Normally this is the point where I'd encourage my readers to write in and share their experiences on this week's topic. Hmmmmm . . .

Have a good week, everyone! And seriously, enjoy the game in whatever fashion suits you and your friends. Some groups love this stuff, and I hope this has spurred some ideas among them!
