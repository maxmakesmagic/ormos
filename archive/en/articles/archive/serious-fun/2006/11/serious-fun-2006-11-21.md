![Cackling Imp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Cackling+Imp)What is fun? 
 It's a pretty simple question, but almost nobody can answer it. 


What is fun? 


Everybody knows when they're *having* it, of course, but that's a very personal thing; quite often, one person's “fun” is another person's misery, as anyone who's ever played against a [Stasis](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stasis) deck knows. 


What is fun? 


Too many people think that their definition of “fun” is universal, but trust me – I've been writing **Magic** articles for over six years now, and I'm *still* surprised by what other people get a kick out of. So it's hard to tell what fun is.


But you know what's even harder? What's *not* fun. 


Lemme give you a (comparatively) short list of things that you might run into in the course of a **Magic** game; I guarantee you that *someone* reading these words has a very strong opinion on why these are Not Fun. 


* Combo decks
* Combo decks that you've seen before
* Counterspells
* Global removal
* Control decks
* Decks that win with fatties
* Decks that win with weenies
* That stupid, overpowered card that no right-thinking person should play in their deck (“What? *[Skullclamp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skullclamp)*?”)
* That stupid, underpowered card that no right-thinking player should play, because and why don't you just play with good cards?
* Decks that have too many rares in them
* Decks that have too many commons in them yet beat the decks with too many rares in them
* Decks that are more powerful than the decks I can afford to play (which is not the same as “decks with rares,” if you own older cards)
* Decks that aren't nearly as powerful as the decks I can afford to play (Some people like a challenge.)
* Decks that are too predictable
* Decks that are too unpredictable
* Decks that are taken from the Internet
* Decks that are too simple, because anyone could have built them
* Decks that win too much
* Decks that don't win often enough
* Decks that only won because you talked everyone else into ganging up on your opponents

As the editor of StarCityGames.com and a long-time **Magic** player, I've seen people go off on vitriolic rants on *every one* of these subjects. Clearly, the best way to devise a fun deck is to make an unpredictably predictable deck that's almost as powerful as every deck that it could ever face so that it can sorta-win but not always, and nobody should have ever thought of before but isn't something so simple that anyone *could* have thought of it. 


Oh, and it can't win through combo, control, or creatures. I'll get right on that. 


![Allied_Strategies](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/cardart/PS/Allied_Strategies.jpg)The boon of playing **Magic** is that it's fun for all *kinds* of people. In fact, we have four classic methods of enjoyment, all battling it out in the arena: Timmy, who loves to win with 13/13 tramplers; Johnny, who wants to pull off some crazy combo that nobody was expecting; Spike, who wants to win, period; and Vorthos, who wants to imagine vast armies struggling for dominance when he plays.


That makes **Magic** wonderful. Unlike simpler games, it allows **Magic** to attract all *sorts* of people, each of whom mines a different type of enjoyment from the game. That pulls more players in, and makes the game more popular, and means that you can find people to play with. 


Unfortunately, it makes finding common ground *really* tricky, because the very cards that attract Spike are the ones that turn off Timmy, and Johnny cards usually aren't Vorthos-friendly. 


Some folks have chastised me, both via private email and the forums, for valuing power over fun. “You build these decks that just concentrate on *winning*,” they say, which confuses me; it's not like my decks are unstoppable juggernauts (just ask my friends, who've smashed me any number of times). And I can't understand why I should try to feature decks that aren't as good as I can make them; if you're looking to build silly decks filled with one-ofs and containing no particular avenue to victory, you can do that without my help at all.


But I think what they're *really* saying, in a roundabout way, are two very important things: 


“Your decks would beat my decks too consistently.”


and


“I don't find the way your decks win to be interesting.” 


I can do almost nothing about either of those, sadly. 


![Moonlace](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Moonlace)The fact is that power is tied to fun in ways that we cannot understand. Nobody wants to play with sucko cards that do nothing, so a fun card has to have a little bit of force to back it up. You'll never hear someone raving about this: 
 
> 
> *“I was there, my back against the wall, facing down an army of Saprolings. The next turn, he would smash me. I drew my card, bringing it up slowly to see what I got… And it was [Moonlace](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Moonlace)! He killed me the next turn, of course.”*
> 
> 
> 


But you want *surprise* in your fun. You'll rarely hear people raving about this play, either: 



> 
> *“There I was, piloting an army of Saprolings, and I was about to win the next turn. Then I drew a card that **guaranteed** I'd win! Wow! What a great play!”* 
> 
> 
> 


The problem is that one man's dramatic reversal is another man's completely unfair loss to an overpowered card OMGWTFBBQ. The difference between “Wow, what an awesome reversal of fortunes!” and “How the heck can you feel good about such a cheap play?” is almost entirely based upon the level of play you're used to. That's one of the big problems with casual in general, since every group of players has a different dynamic and a different card pool; I'm used to shrugging off attacks from fourth-turn [Darksteel Colossus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Darksteel+Colossus)es and [Rorix Bladewing](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rorix+Bladewing)s, but a newer group of players might not have the cards or the experience to deal with it. And what fun would that be, losing all the time? 


It's simply *not possible* to develop decks that are balanced for every playgroup. And decks that win or lose all the time simply aren't fun for anyone. (Except masochists. And they're probably off playing some other card game. *Zing!*) 


What is fun when it comes to *casual*, though? 


![Phantom Wurm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Phantom+Wurm)The answer, I think, lies in partially being able to lose with a smile. That pretty much leaves poor Spike out of it, since his modus operandi is to win… But I think even Spike can appreciate the hilarity of an 84/82 [Doubling Cube](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Doubling+Cube)d [Phantom Wurm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phantom+Wurm) that can't attack because it's *not big enough* to kill the other players. (And yeah, that happened.)
 I think that fun involves being able to laugh as you watch your hard-earned lead evaporate – because even though you're suddenly behind the eight-ball, you *totally* didn't expect to lose in that way, to something so unique and fresh and *silly* that you never saw it coming. You have to look at your imminent demise and think, “Well, if I gotta go… That's the way to do it.”


(And if you're winning? Well, it's *even cooler*.) 


I also think that fun involves *interaction*. You may have never seen the [Izzet Guildmage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Izzet+Guildmage)/[Desperate Ritual](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Desperate+Ritual)/[Lava Spike](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lava+Spike) infinite damage combo, but it's not something you have much of a chance against. If the first spell resolves with the Guildmage still on the table, it's not fun. 


…Unless, of course, it comes from a guy who was literally going to die the next turn to not one, but *two* Sliver decks working in conjunction, and it was One Lone Wizard pulling off a victory from a single life, triumphing against the Horde of Slivers Who Had Decimated Three Other Players Before Them.


Then it's the coolest thing in the frickin' *world*… At least to Vorthos. 


So what's fun? You're gonna debate whether it's fun. Maybe you can even tell me something more fun you've done in the forums. 

 But for now? We have this. ### Maybe Fun Is….


**…Infinite Removal With A Slow, Silly Combo?**

I gotta say, Stefan. It's fun. But I don't know how often you could pull it off, since it's probably a little fragile and a *lot* slow.

Mildly fun. The fact that you keep your copy of the creature is entertaining (people usually prefer to kill the original before the copy, weirdly enough), and it's an excellent political analysis, but it's not monkeys. 


Why monkeys? Monkeys are fun. You can't think of monkeys without laughing. Every game of Magic should be as fun as a barrel of monkeys, preferably live ones. 


In fact, from now on, I'm rating all of these cards on the monkey scale. Take that, Alongi! Screw your “Rattlesnake” and “Cockroach” comparisons! *Monkeys in yo' face!*


Monkeys: One mangy chimp in a zoo!

I gotta say that I have laughed at seeing [Norin the Wary](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Norin+the+Wary). I own a copy, for I got him fifteenth-pick in a draft. How could people pass on power like that? I held it up to the table, shouting, “What were you people thinking? *Now I win the game*!” 


But that said, I've actually played against Norin. And he's not as fun as you'd think he would be, at least in the two obvious combos he has. I've played against the [Confusion in the Ranks](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Confusion+in+the+Ranks), and having someone steal all of my best stuff? Not as fun as you'd hope! And the [Pandemonium](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pandemonium) combo, while entertaining, is more of a power play. 


Thus, I'd say that Norin is fun if you don't play with [Confusion in the Ranks](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Confusion+in+the+Ranks) or [Pandemonium](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pandemonium). If someone can come up with a deck that abuses Norin for some other reason, why, I'd laugh until my head exploded.

Everyone is going to be thinking “Dang, my hand is going to go away in four turns; I might as well play everything I can while I have the chance.” And that is bound to lead to fun of some sort. Sitting around and staring at everyone else waiting for someone to do something is not that much fun (because my friends are ugly, but I didn't say that). When people start unloading on each other, things are bound to get interesting.*

When I discussed multiplayer threat assessment a few weeks ago, people bitterly complained how some multiplayer games were slow. Apparently, there are whole tables where everyone turtles up, refusing to attack anyone for fear of retaliation!


I agree! That's no fun at all. That's *zero* monkeys. The fun of multiplayer comes from when someone takes a big chance and it either succeeds wildly or blows up in their face – and if everyone's waiting for The Perfect Moment, nothing happens. 


[Wheel of Fate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wheel+of+Fate) is a veritable monkey *engine*. It can speed up games that would otherwise be as boring as watching paint dry, forcing people's hands because they won't *have* hands when it's done. Anything that encourages people to get out from behind their walls and start swinging with everything they have is a good time; may I suggest combining this with Grand Melee to get the party *really* started? 


The only thing that makes this slightly less simian-licious is the stupid control and combo players. Handing a guy a fresh set of Counterspells involves no monkeys at *all*. Thus, the monkey rating must be knocked down a peg.

![Patriarch's Bidding](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Patriarch%27s+Bidding)Oh, Paul. You came so close to inadvertently stepping on the spirit of the game. Like Charlie Bucket, you have touched my heart with your innocent generosity. 
 Look at the other nominees here. Look at how *selfish* their writings are. “You'll win with this.” “This spell will let you win.” But you – you giving man, you – nominated a card because it let someone *else* win, a loopy little deck that had no chance whatsoever otherwise to win in that sea of Counterspells and control. And in doing so, you proved Skyler Jones's point about [Wheel of Fate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wheel+of+Fate) shaking up established game plans.


It's so noble. “I did not win,” you tacitly admitted. “The *right* man did.” And for that, you are a monkey's uncle – and I mean that in the most positive way! You came within inches of winning this contest….

It makes friends.** In multiplayer the urge, and need, to enhance your own side of the board is far greater than in duels. Indeed where the duelist creates card advantage by gaining his and destroying his opponents cards, the multiplayer must advantage himself against many foes. This makes players very eager to gain any form of power. They will want the genesis to activate. At very least you will have a few temporary friends, who will keep you around as long as it's convenient.*
> 
> 
> *“And if a player goes against it, usually the mono blue control abomination, then the others can easily identify and obliterate him. People react in a primal way when you take something from them, even if it might not even have happened or was a bad idea. In addition people will heap their creatures in their hands, because if the ‘genesis activates, the mono blue abomination cannot stop your creatures.*

It has incredible synergy.** Coupled with the Love Me! strategy, you could run cards such as [Wheel of Fate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wheel+of+Fate) and [Vision Skeins](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vision+Skeins) to pump up other's hands along with yours. Their opinion of you can never be great enough. But besides that you can have massive card draws just before the activation or discard others' cards to create advantage.*

> 
> *“And the very nature of the card is for you to place better/larger creatures on the table than anyone else. This gives opportunity for some good deck design and forethought.* 
> 
> 
> ***“3. It swarms the board.** “With every player “layin' it down'” the game will be over in a flash, something that is sometimes sorely needed in multiplayer. And usually the types of characters at a multiplayer game would want the experience of seeing their hand on the table and having massive fights with their creatures. It makes playing interesting at very least.*

> *![Scion of the Wild](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Scion+of+the+Wild)“In addition to this you can then use the number of creatures to your advantage.

The reverse of this, of course, is to eliminate the hoard. [Wrath of God](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wrath+of+God) and [Magus of the Disk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Magus+of+the+Disk) will suddenly claim a very large prize.*

It is repeatable.** “When a game ends with everyone having played seven fatties and beating each other to a pulp, rather than the combo guy just saying ‘My opening hand was perfect!' everyone is happy. They will want to play multiplayer again, with you! – Something that is also sorely needed from time to time. And every time the card activates it might be a completely different story. Who knows what the others will have in their hands next time.

A card that destroys mono-blue players and guys who want to retain power? Gosh, that *does* sound fun! Or how about this testimonial? 



> 
> *“It doesn't get old. Because there's so much to do with this card, and because you can run it in virtually any deck with green in it (just pair with the color or colors of your choice), this is not like your one-shot-combo deck that everyone is sick of and never lets you use again after they've all been killed by it once.

> ![Platinum Angel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Platinum+Angel)*“Even better, because of the variety of things to do with the card, your opponents never really know whether they should drop stuff or not. It's a thinking card, a finesse card, and one with a lot of room for messing with your opponents' heads. And no matter how many times they've learned that they would have all been better off ignoring your [Hypergenesis](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hypergenesis) completely, there will always be at least one sucker who thinks that ‘this time will be different' and hands you their Platinum Angel. Again.*
> *“Finally, [Hypergenesis](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hypergenesis) is a great multiplayer card because it can backfire in spectacular fashion. Yes, it's great for the game because it can turn on you. It fast-forwards a long game straight to the epic battle of seven- to fifteen-mana titans, and sometimes, you'll lose. But aside from the combos, it lets your group get at their inner Timmy, and, so long as you're the casual player who can stand to lose sometimes (which if you're playing in multiplayer, you'd better be) those games are often the best.”*

Multiplayer Magic isn't about a handful of counterspells and a [Stalking Stones](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stalking+Stones), or shutting your opponent down before he can actually play his deck. With these things in mind, a single card stands out as the best (“best” meaning “most fun”) card in Time Spiral.

Through land destruction, counter magic, removal, bounce, or other effects, many strong decks focus on frustrating your opponent. You can win by watching your opponent stare at seven cards they will never get to use, while your [Psychatog](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psychatog) swings in the air, but that's really not what it's all about at the kitchen table.

I can get behind that. Too often, we're screwed by mana, or mass removal, or what-have-you, but Brian sums up what I want to see in a multiplayer game: people's decks working as well as they darn well can.
