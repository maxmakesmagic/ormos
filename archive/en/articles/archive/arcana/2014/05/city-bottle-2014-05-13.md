Starting with *Vintage Masters*, an old favorite joins **Magic Online**. Originally printed in *Arabian Nights*, [City in a Bottle](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=City+in+a+Bottle) introduces a unique and interesting effect. Notably, when it was originally printed, it specifically only recognized cards printed in the same expansion: *Arabian Nights*. Why was that? *Arabian Nights* was the only expansion at that point!



![City in a Bottle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=City%20in%20a%20Bottle&options=)


The Oracle text for this card now reads:


Whenever a nontoken permanent originally printed in the *Arabian Nights* expansion other than City in a Bottle is on the battlefield, its controller sacrifices it.  

Players can't play cards originally printed in the *Arabian Nights* expansion.


The change that took place for the card is a subtle, but important, change. The new rules text now states that it only cares about cards which were originally printed in *Arabian Nights*, and it no longer cares about what the actual expansion symbol on the card is. This means that you can safely play your *Arabian Nights* Mountains against [City in a Bottle](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=City+in+a+Bottle), but you can't play your [Ali from Cairo](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ali+from+Cairo) that was printed in *Masters Edition IV* or [City of Brass](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=City+of+Brass) printed in *Modern Masters*.


Since few players know all the cards this affects, we are creating a reference page that will help players understand which cards this effects on **Magic Online** when it comes time to play that [City in a Bottle](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=City+in+a+Bottle).
