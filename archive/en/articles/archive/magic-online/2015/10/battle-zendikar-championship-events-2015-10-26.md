The *Battle for Zendikar* Championships are coming soon to *Magic Online*, beginning with Limited Qualifiers!


There are different schools of thought on a landbase for your Limited deck. Is it wise to only use 17 lands so that you can jam a few more sweet spells in? Maybe you're a bit more cautious and use 18? What about 100 lands? 1,000? Crawl through the Blind Eternities, seeking the next source of delicious mana and consume all land. CONSUME ALL! Anyway, it's your call, but the more land the merrier when it comes to Eldrazi. Get your land game figured out and mark your calendar for the [*Battle for Zendikar* Limited Championship Qualifiers](#ltdqualifier), beginning on Wednesday, October 28, at 12:30 p.m. Pacific (UTC-7) and running until Tuesday, November 3, at 9:30 p.m. Pacific (UTC-8).


Please note the tricky time change in the previous paragraph. **On November 1, we transition from Pacific Daylight Time (UTC-7) to Pacific Standard Time (UTC-8),** so make sure to double-check those time zones before deciding on an event. Once Limited Championship Qualifiers conclude, we move onto the Standard Championship Qualifiers!


Whether you ramp into huge Eldrazi, sort out a squad of rallying Allies, or build a deck that will allow you to beat your opponent with *nothing but your lands*, plan to compete at the [*Battle for Zendikar* Standard Championship Qualifiers](#strdqualifier) between Wednesday, November 4, 12:30 p.m., and Tuesday, November 10, 9:30 p.m. Pacific (UTC-8). All qualifiers run every three hours, on the half hour, so make sure to plan out which event you want to join ahead of time. Four or five wins in any Qualifier earns you a non-premium promo [Radiant Flames](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Radiant+Flames) and an invitation to the corresponding Championship Finals!


Remember, we changed up how promo cards are awarded during the *Magic Origins* Championship—all promo awards revolve around Qualifier events now. This way, if you are only in it for the promos, the Qualifier will be the only event you need to play in. Participation in any Qualifier will nab you a non-premium alternate-art version of [Stasis Snare](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stasis+Snare) for your collection and, as mentioned above, four or five wins in a Qualifier Event will get you a non-premium promo version of [Radiant Flames](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Radiant+Flames).

But if it's the sweet taste of victory you're after, the Championship Finals are the way to obtain it!


[*Battle for Zendikar* Limited Championship Finals](#ltdfinals) are up first on Sunday, November 8, 7:00 a.m. Pacific. The [*Battle for Zendikar* Standard Championship Finals](#strdfinals) follow closely behind on Saturday, November 14, 9:00 a.m. In addition to big prizes, the first place winners will be heralded across [MTGO.com](http://magic.wizards.com/en/game-info/products/magic-online) in an article that regales readers with a play-by-play of their victories, as well as the Championship-winning decklists.
