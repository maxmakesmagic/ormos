As Mattias Leveratto approached the feature match area, Grand Prix Santiago 2009 Finalist Andres Monsalve shook his head.


"We always play against each other in every event," said Monsalve about this match-up. It does not matter how large or small the event is; these two happen to get paired against each other a lot. 


The two gave each other a heartfelt handshake before the match quickly got underway.



**The Decks**




 This match-up is not one that you will be unfamiliar with if you've been following Standard prior to *Born of the Gods*. Leveratto was sporting a traditional White-Blue Control deck, with all of the recognizable cards such as [Sphinx's Revelation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sphinx%27s+Revelation) and [Jace, Architect of Thought](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace%2C+Architect+of+Thought). Monsalve's Blue Devotion deck was more the white-blue variety, sporting [Detention Sphere](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Detention+Sphere)s as a catch-all for anything that troubles him.




**The Games**




 Monsalve led off early with [Judge's Familiar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Judge%27s+Familiar), while Leveratto started slow with his [Temple of Enlightenment](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Temple+of+Enlightenment). Monsalve matched scry lands with his own [Temple of Enlightenment](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Temple+of+Enlightenment) before attacking in for 1. An attack before any lands or action on the next turn though elicited a decision for Monsalve: before damage was dealt, Leveratto attempted to draw a card with [Azorius Charm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Azorius+Charm). Monsalve thought for a moment before sacrificing his bird to counter Leveratto's draw, following this up with [Thassa, God of the Sea](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thassa%2C+God+of+the+Sea). Another [Judge's Familiar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Judge%27s+Familiar) came down on the next turn, and Monsalve kept the pressure up with an attack from [Mutavault](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mutavault).
