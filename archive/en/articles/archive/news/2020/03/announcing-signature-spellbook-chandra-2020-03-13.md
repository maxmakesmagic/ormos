With Chandra's signature flare and a style that evokes the best the fiery Planeswalker has to offer, *Signature Spellbook: Chandra* boasts a collection of powerful red spells featuring *Magic*'s favorite flame-haired torch of defiance. And you can only get your copy at your [local game store](https://locator.wizards.com/)!


Each *Signature Spellbook: Chandra* comes with eight cards plus one premium foil version of one of those eight cards at random. It's the ideal way to show your love of Chandra, stylize your Commander deck, or just help the world burnâ€”in a good way.


As a special treat, here's a sneak peek at two of the cards that you'll find in *Signature Spellbook: Chandra*.
