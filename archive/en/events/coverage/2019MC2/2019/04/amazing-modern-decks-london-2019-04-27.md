Modern is one of *Magic*'s most popular formats, and for good reason. With so many legal cards and new additions shaking up the format regularly (hello, [Arclight Phoenix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arclight+Phoenix)), Modern offers a world in which any of dozens of decks are viable. To wit, players on a full dozen different Modern decks finished Day 1 at 7-1 or better.


These are all the deck techs the coverage team broadcast over the tournament.


Izzet Phoenix
=============


The most-feared Modern deck entering the tournament. Izzet Phoenix, with its myriad of cantrips and [Faithless Looting](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Faithless+Looting) to fill the graveyard with spells and [Arclight Phoenix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arclight+Phoenix) while flipping [Thing in the Ice](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thing+in+the+Ice) or powering up [Pyromancer Ascension](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyromancer+Ascension), has been tearing up the Grand Prix scene for the last several months. It’s led many players to start including [Surgical Extraction](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Surgical+Extraction) in the main deck, or even [Noxious Revival](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Noxious+Revival) to protect the birds from removal.

Hardened Scales
===============


The poster child for a fringe deck that has grown into a format staple, [Arcbound Worker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arcbound+Worker) proves that anything can be playable in Modern. Adept at both explosive starts and playing around spot removal, the deck improved its meta share from 5% on Day 1 to 6% on Day 2.

Humans
======


Another staple deck of the format, Mythic Invitational champion Andrea Mengucci broke down the deck that made [Meddling Mage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Meddling+Mage) cool again.

Orzhov Eldrazi
==============


Our tentacled overlords are alive and well in Modern, whether they come attached to [Æther Vial](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=%C3%86ther+Vial)s, Urza’s Tower or… [Kaya, Orzhov Usurper](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kaya%2C+Orzhov+Usurper)?


Joe Soh provided yet another innovation and put together a midrange Orzhov deck that takes full advantage of Eldrazi, including the synergy between [Wasteland](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wasteland) Stranger and [Tidehollow Sculler](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tidehollow+Sculler).
