### ANNOUNCEMENT


Grand Prix Professional Point Changes
=====================================

Wizards of the Coast




October 31, 2014
 










After reviewing the current system for the distribution of Professional Points based on match points at Grand Prix, we have decided to make some adjustments.


* All players who finish with 39 or more match points at an individual Grand Prix will receive 4 Pro Points (previously 3)
* All players who finish with 36–38 match points at an individual Grand Prix will receive 3 Pro Points (previously 2)
* All team members who finish with 31–32 match points at a *team* Grand Prix will receive 2 Pro Points (previously 1)


These changes will be retroactive to the start of the 2014–2015 Premier Play season (the first events for this season were Grand Prix Utrecht and Grand Prix Portland, which took place August 9-10 this year).



The new Pro Point structure changes will be reflected on the Planeswalker Points website by the end of the year. However, the Professional Point changes will be accurately reflected on the current season’s [Player of the Year](http://magic.wizards.com/node/259396) page starting this week.


The worldwide prize structure found on the [Grand Prix events page](http://magic.wizards.com/en/content/grand-prix-event-types-events) as well as the information for all published Grand Prix Fact Sheets in the 2014–2015 Premier Play season have been updated to reflect these changes.
