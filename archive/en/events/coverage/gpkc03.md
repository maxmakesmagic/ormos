Live Coverage of 2003 Grand Prix Kansas City
============================================












Antonino DeRosa is the Grand Prix-Kansas City Champion!


Antonino rarely finished outside the money in any Grand Prix he had ever played in but winning the whole shebang remained on his to-do list. He drafted a nasty little green-red deck and made short work of all of his competition—including Michael Krumb and Brian Kibler before squaring off with Nate Heiss in the finals.


It was a hard fought match—as all finals should be—going the full three games. Game one was an ugly affair with Nate stuck on land while Antonino rode his Liar’s Pendulum to a card advantage-fueled victory. Nate came back in game two with his full arsenal of removal. Antonino took the final game despite being stuck early on three lands. A tap on the top of his deck from Gerard Fabiano yielded a fourth land and he was able to play the game breaking Glissa Sunseeker—and that was the game, set, and Grand Prix for the transplanted Italian.


Steve Ferrell and his Feral Events crew ran a sparkling event and everyone went home happy—none happier than DeRosa but happy nonetheless.
