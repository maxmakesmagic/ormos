What do you think about when you hear the words "multiplayer **Magic**?" Do you think of a popular format, like [Commander](https://archive.wizards.com/Magic/tcg/article.aspx?x=magic/rules/edh)? Do you recall [ways and wonders of making multiplayer happen](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/sf/208)? Perhaps [historic principles of battling for supremacy among many](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/daily/aa136)? 

 When I think about multiplayer, it's what many of us call Free-for-All: each player is out for him- or herself, and the last player standing wins. It's multiplayer at its essential core and it's how I imagine the Gruul would play **Magic**, given their penchant for demonstrating strength within groups.
