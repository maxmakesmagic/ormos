As you know, Zendikar is a dangerous place, what with all the deadly perils and traps and whatnot. There are a few cards which demonstrate how the land itself provides dangers to the unwary adventurer.


Consider [Rumbling Aftershocks](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rumbling+Aftershocks). Apparently it's set in a part of Zendikar where the slightest tremor can cause giant boulders to plummet down onto helpless passersby.

Can you identify the place these two goblins are standing?

They're journeying through the teetering peaks! Too much magic in this area could easily dislodge one of those boulders. Better step carefully!
