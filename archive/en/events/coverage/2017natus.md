DAY 1 COVERAGE



Over 550 players arrived at the Greater Richmond Convention Center to take part in the U.S. National Championship, the first since 2011. Over the next two days, they'll play six rounds of Standard and six rounds of Ixalan draft, vying for a spot in the Top 8.


The Standard portion of the event could prove to be especially challenging, as players are still building, testing, and playing in a new and volatile Standard environment. While last season stand-byes Temur Energy and Ramunap Red have had strong showings, other strategies like Vampires and Abzan Tokens could be poised to make a breakthrough.


The first and second place players from this weekend's competition will earn a place alongside team captain Reid Duke at the World Magic Cup this December. Tune at  [twitch.tv/magic](http://twitch.tv/magic) to catch coverage of the event!
