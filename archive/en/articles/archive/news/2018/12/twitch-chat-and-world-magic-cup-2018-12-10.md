For this year's World *Magic* Cup—happening December 14–16 in Barcelona, Spain, and streaming on [twitch.tv/magic](http://twitch.tv/magic)—we will be testing Twitch chat in subscriber-only mode just for the duration of the event. We are doing this to see how sub-only mode impacts the stream, and whether it can further our goals of creating a better-quality conversation around what is happening on stream and being a positive place for the community.


We strive to continuously improve the quality of chat during our events, and this is a further exploration of the best possible ways to better the experience. Wizards is dedicated to bringing people together with our games and creating safe, inclusive environments for players of all types, whether in physical spaces or online.
