 During round 6 of Pro Tour *Return to Ravnica*, competitor Jackie Lee was disqualified without prizes for Fraud/Cheating. She was found to not be announcing a recognized disparity in the life total sheets between her and her opponent. This was not found to be a premeditated action and as such there will not be a suspension to follow this disqualification. 

Players are expected to be clear about life totals and bring any noticed discrepancies to their opponent's attention. This prevents the game states from degenerating to a point where fixing mistakes becomes more difficult.
