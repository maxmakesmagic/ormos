Decks Krumb'led by Ichorid
==========================











![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gpchar06/f2.jpg)Step aside Affinity, [Ichorid](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ichorid) is your new daddy. 11 of the 64 decks on Day 2 ran [Ichorid](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ichorid)s, and by the time the dust settled, they still comprised 3 of the Top 8 decks. The rest of the Top 8 contained [Tooth and Nail](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tooth+and+Nail), Affinity, Gifts Rock, 2 Boros decks, a diverse blend of almost exclusively aggro decks. The star power of the Top 8 wasn't as great as many of the Grand Prix we saw earlier in the year, but it still contained a National Champ (Antonino De Rosa), one of Magic's rising stars (Kyle Goodman), and Mike Krumb, who already had two Grand Prix Top 8s to his name and was not to be denied this weekend.


It takes a ridiculous deck to make the Affinity mechanic look mundane, but that's exactly what Krumb and Friggorid managed to do in a tension-filled finals, as [Psychatog](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psychatog) and the house of horrors brought the pain again and again, pummeling Alex Majlaton into submission. It's shocking just how much this deck can do with only two mana sources in play. Game 1 of the finals saw Tim Aten zombie tokens drag Majlaton's life total past zero, but the bad robots and [Shrapnel Blast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shrapnel+Blast) quickly struck back in game 2 to even the match at one game a piece. Game 3 saw both players get off to a fast start, but three dredged [Moment's Peace](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Moment%27s+Peace)s kept the robots at bay, allowing flying [Ichorid](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ichorid)s and zombies to steal through Majlaton's defenses and give Krumb his first Grand Prix title.


Other stories from this weekend included big names like Osyp Lebedowicz, Gabe Walls, and Jon Sonne falling on Day 1, the continued diversity of the metagame, and the overall excitement of the tournament competitors as they took their one final shot at an invitation to Honolulu. In the end it was Krumb and the dredge menace that seized the trophy, the money, and the title of new best deck in Extended as this PTQ season comes to a close. Congratulations to Mike Krumb, winner of Grand Prix-Charlotte 2005.

Â 


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gpchar06/top8p.jpg)*Antonino De Rosa not pictured*

**Antonino De Rosa** - The U.S. National Champion needs little introduction to most fans of the game. Over the last two years his game has improved dramatically, and he is now a frequent member of North American Grand Prix Top 8s.


**Kyle Goodman** - Goodman is a former JSS star who had his coming out party at Pro Tour-Columbus last season where he finished 9th. He also posted a solid finish at Pro Tour-Philadelphia, and then made the Top 8 at U.S. Nationals this year. This is his first Grand Prix Top 8, at least in part because his high school schedule keeps him too busy to attend many others.


**Mike Krumb** - This is Krumb's third Grand Prix Top 8. He was part of the monster Top 8 back at Grand Prix-Detroit, and ran the table here in Charlotte until he locked up a Top 8 slot.


**Alex Majlaton** - Majlaton is Maryland native who will turn 21 "soon." Alex was already on his way to Honolulu via PTQ slot, but will be going there a bit richer from whatever he pockets here in the Top 8.


**David Shiels** - Shiels is seventeen and lives in Boston. His first Pro Tour was in Los Angeles where he played Goblins to a 4-2 record before losing his last two rounds and missing the cut.


**Alan Hubbard** - Hubbard is a 25 year-old golf pro who made Top 8 in his first Grand Prix. He's not sure whether or not he's going to Hawaii, but admits that the lure of great golfing and even better Magic is strong for him.


**Chris Boozer** - Chris is a 21-year-old Magician from Atlanta, Georgia who already won a PTQ in this format, but is still an amateur so will therefore be receiving a flight, Grand Prix prize, and amateur prize for his performances this season.


**Thomas LaPille** - Fans of PTQ decklists might recognize LaPille's name, as he's always listed in the Top 8 of Ohio Valley PTQs. He posted an 0-5 at his first Pro Tour in Los Angeles, but won the PTQ the next day and was already qualified for Hawaii before this weekend.





* **Sunday, December 18: 6:08 p.m. - Quarterfinals: Kyle Goodman vs. Alan Hubbard**
  

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gpchar06/qf1_1.jpg)*Alan Hubbard*
He may not be the most renowned person in this Grand Prix Top 8, but Kyle Goodman has a rather impressive resume. He finished 10th at PT Columbus, 44th at PT Philadelphia, and a few months ago, Top 8 at U.S. Nationals. As was previously noted, Goodman qualified for Hawaii last weekend. His opponent, amateur Alan Hubbard, just started playing tournament Magic last April. He says that most of his experience was gleaned from Magic Online. To his credit, he has played in six PTQs and finished in the Top 8 of four of them. Hubbard is playing Boros Deck Wins, while Kyle is playing the same deck that qualified him for Hawaii, [Tooth and Nail](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tooth+and+Nail). Before the match, Kyle commented how he had to play the card-for-card mirror match round 13; someone actually copied his decklist prior to the Grand Prix!


### Game 1


Hubbard won the roll and, after muilliganing, led off with a [Sacred Foundry](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sacred+Foundry) and a [Savannah Lions](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Savannah+Lions). Goodman played an [Urza's Tower](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Urza%27s+Tower) and what Hubbard rightfully called [Tooth and Nail](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tooth+and+Nail)'s MVP, a [Sensei's Divining Top](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sensei%27s+Divining+Top). After playing a mountain and attacking with the Lions, Hubbard was forced to pass the turn without a play. Goodman contended himself with taking the Top for a spin. On his next turn, Hubbard found a [Windswept Heath](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Windswept+Heath) and played his second creature, a [Silver Knight](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Silver+Knight). On his third turn, with a Tower, a Power Plant, a [Forest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest), a nd a Talisman in play, Goodman cast [Sylvan Scrying](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sylvan+Scrying) for the final Urzatron piece. Hubbard attacked Goodman down to 12 and played another [Silver Knight](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Silver+Knight), but Kyle simply played the [Urza's Mine](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Urza%27s+Mine) and cast a more-than-fair turn 4 [Tooth and Nail](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tooth+and+Nail). He debated for awhile before ultimately choosing the "Boom-Boom" route, dropping a [Darksteel Colossus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Darksteel+Colossus) and a [Sundering Titan](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sundering+Titan) into play. Hubbard had a [Magma Jet](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Magma+Jet) he wanted to play in response to the [Sundering Titan](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sundering+Titan)'s triggered ability, but since he waited until Goodman chose lands, he no longer had that option. Kyle attacked with both of his monsters. Hubbard chumped the Titan to falol to an 11-4 life total deficit, and a Goodman [Triskelion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Triskelion) ended Hubbard's dreams of any form of counteroffensive.


Goodman 1 Hubbard 0


### Game 2


Between games, Hubbard flabbergasted the judge by asking if he could go to his car and get some [Molten Rain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Molten+Rain)s in a skillful deadpan. Apparently, he was not confident in his chances with only a 15-card sideboard. Hubbard agonized over a questionable opening seven before ultimately cashing them in; his 6-card hand was a keeper, though. Once again, Hubbard had a Foundry and a Lions, and once again, Goodman had a Tower and a Divining Top. Hubbard smashed in with his Lions and trumped the Top (in a manner of speaking) with [Kataki, War's Wage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kataki%2C+War%27s+Wage). Goodman peeked at his top three cards during his upkeep, then decided to simply let the Top hit the graveyard. The Lions and the Legendary Spirit took Kyle down to 14 before being joined by a [Grim Lavamancer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grim+Lavamancer) and a [Silver Knight](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Silver+Knight). Goodman's turn was spent playing his third land (and second Urza land) and a [Sakura-Tribe Elder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sakura-Tribe+Elder), which Hubbard promptly [Firebolt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Firebolt)ed. The White creatures took Kyle down to 8 and threatened to kill him next turn unless he could play something impressive. All he had was another [Sakura-Tribe Elder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sakura-Tribe+Elder), but he passed the turn with two lands untapped, representing [Moment's Peace](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Moment%27s+Peace). He in fact had two [Moment's Peace](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Moment%27s+Peace) and was hence able to nullify Hubbard's attacks for the next four turns. On the last possible turn, Kyle plucked a [Mindslaver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mindslaver) and activated it. Hubbard cast a [Magma Jet](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Magma+Jet) to put Kyle at 6 and ensure that the Slaver turn wouldn't be too devastating. The [Mindslaver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mindslaver) ended up being little more than a glorified [Fog](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fog), but that's really all Kyle needed; a [Tooth and Nail](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tooth+and+Nail) flew off the top of his deck the next turn. He searched for [Platinum Angel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Platinum+Angel) and [Leonin Abunas](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leonin+Abunas), then cast an [Eternal Witness](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eternal+Witness) to retrieve his Tooth. Hubbard wasn't about to go down without a fight. On his turn, he drew the [Lightning Helix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Helix) he had safely buried with his [Magma Jet](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Magma+Jet), then used it and Lavamancer to scorch the Abunas. Following a [Purge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Purge) on his [Platinum Angel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Platinum+Angel), Goodman scooped in the face of lethal combat damage.


Goodman 1 Hubbard 1

### Game 3


To start off Game 3, Hubbard decided that, if he could still win after mulliganing once, he'd better mulligan twice just to make sure Kyle would advance to the Semis. "This is how [Tooth and Nail](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tooth+and+Nail) wins," quipped Goodman. Kyle blah blah Top turn one blah blah. Kyle elected not to block Hubbard's turn one Isamaru, signalling gas at the top of his tank. On his third turn, he dropped a second Urzatron piece and--surprise, surprise--had the [Sylvan Scrying](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sylvan+Scrying) to find the third. Kyle responded to Hubbard's [Pithing Needle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pithing+Needle) by fetching a forest with his [Sakura-Tribe Elder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sakura-Tribe+Elder); perhaps he would be able to make good on his threats of another turn 4 [Tooth and Nail](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tooth+and+Nail). Instead, he played and activated an [Oblivion Stone](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oblivion+Stone), clearing away three creatures and the Needle. Hubbard came back with a pair of Lavamancers, but Kyle was sitting at a robust 14 life with actualll literally infinite mana on the table. Literally. Thanks to his trusty Top, Goodman had no difficulty finding a [Tooth and Nail](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tooth+and+Nail) for [Triskelion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Triskelion) and [Sundering Titan](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sundering+Titan). The artifact monsters cleared Hubbard's board of all but a solitary [Plains](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plains), and a gratuitous second [Tooth and Nail](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tooth+and+Nail) sent him packing.


Kyle Goodman defeats Alan Hubbard 2-1.
