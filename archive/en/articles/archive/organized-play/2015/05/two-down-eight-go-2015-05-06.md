Paris and Atlantic City
=======================



This weekend, the Grand Prix circuit makes stops in Europe and North America.

Paris will continue to highlight the Standard format as it has evolved from week to week since the Pro Tour. Will this European GP be ruled by Dragonlords of the Esper variety, or will this Standard event be swarmed with Den Protectors like last weekend in Toronto?



Everyone who competes in the Grand Prix Paris main event also receives one of these!

And of course, the month of May is building up to what is sure to be a weekend to remember. *Modern Masters* Weekend features three Grand Prix taking place on three different continents, with one very special format making for a memorable celebration of all things related to Modern *Magic*.



![](https://media.wizards.com/2014/images/daily/GP-City-Only-Chiba-Black%202.png)



Grand Prix Chiba, one of the three events taking place that weekend, has already cemented itself as an event to remember. Here are a couple of facts about GP Chiba:



* Pre-registration for this event was so popular that initial seats (that's 4,000, by the way) sold out within 12 hours of pre-registration opening.
* After combing through the initial pre-registrations for any mis-registerered/twice-registered players, a few hundred of the initial seats were opened up.
* At the time of writing this, there are still around 50 seats left in the Grand Prix Chiba main event, so if you're still sitting on the fence about going, [you should probably make a decision now](http://www.hareruyamtg.com/gp/en/). Chances are, if you hesitate, then you won't have another opportunity.


Hareruya Inc., the tournament organizer for Grand Prix Chiba, also previewed a card that you'll find in *Modern Masters 2015 Edition* today. You can find that card over at [their web site](http://www.hareruyamtg.com/article/category/detail/806)!

The Flashback
=============



Last weekend featured the first two of *ten* Premier Play events taking place this month.



![](https://media.wizards.com/2014/images/daily/GP-City-Only-SaoPaulo-Black%202.png)



Grand Prix São Paulo was a momentous event for Brazil for two reasons. Aside from being the first Latin American Grand Prix to feature [John Avon as an artist](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/gpsao15/art-of-john-2015-05-02), it was also the largest South American GP with 1,297 players.



The weekend showcased the evolving metagame, some new faces, and a few familiar ones. One of those most familiar faces was Hall of Famer Paulo Vitor Damo da Rosa, who secured his 17th Grand Prix Top 8 and his second win on the back of Dragonlord Ojutai and the other 71 cards that makes up his Esper Dragons deck.

However, São Paulo wasn't the only Standard Grand Prix going on. Toronto also played host to Standard goodness, and 1,613 players made their way to the flagship city of Ontario's downtown to battle in the main event.



The story of this event, however, was not all about Dragonlord, but about Den Protectors instead. 25 out of a possible 32 Den Protectors found their way in the Top 8. Hometown hero Lucas Siow finally earning his Grand Prix trophy, after a couple of near-misses in previous years, courtesy of Den Protector and the rest of his Abzan Control deck's suite of creatures of removal.
