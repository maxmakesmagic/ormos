As many of you may know, we had planned to hold our next Announcement Day—where we announce upcoming products—on March 31. However, we will be moving that date back until June.


Why the wait? Well, as we began working on the announcement, we started wanting to do more and more. *Magic*’s 25th Anniversary and *Magic Online*’s 15th Anniversary are coming up, and we have a number of awesome products and events associated with the momentous year.


So we started packing more into the announcement. “Well, if we’re going to announce *that* we have to announce *this* too! They’re so cool!” We started working on themes, we found a fantastic store to live stream from ([Meeples Games in Seattle, WA](http://meeplesgames.com/)), and we started to gather all of the things we wanted to say and show off.


However, *Magic* works on a pretty long timeline. We know what we’re doing for our 25th Anniversary (and *Magic Online*’s 15th), and we know it’s going to be awesome—but much of it is still in development. We wanted to highlight a year’s worth of celebration and fun new products, but the larger the announcement got, the further out we wanted to announce things, and the further out products were, the less we had to show.


After much discussion and looking at our calendars, we opted to do one large, 25th Anniversary Announcement in June rather than one now and one then. While we don’t like shifting the date on you, we do know that shifting the date will provide a much bigger, better experience for everyone.


I don’t have an exact date for you yet because we’re still finalizing some of those cool things we plan to show you, but we’re aiming for June. To give you an idea, the Summer announcement will feature announcements on the fall block, digital products, Organized Play programs, and wild ancillary releases, many of which stretch into 2018. We’re not going to waste a single day celebrating our 25 years, so we’ll be giving you a long vision of the future.


So watch DailyMTG, Facebook, and Twitter for further details on our upcoming 25th Anniversary Announcement Day. It’s going to be a big one.
