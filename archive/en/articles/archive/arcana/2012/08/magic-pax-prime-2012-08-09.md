![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/arcana/1034_paxlogo.jpg)There are **Magic** events at most big gaming conventions. And PAX Prime is practically right in Wizards of the Coast's backyard! So here's what's going on:

### The 2012 Magic Players Championship

If you're not one of the sixteen people invited to the 2012 **Magic** Players Championship, you'll only be able to follow the action online. But if you're one of [these sixteen players](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/tcg/events.aspx?x=mtg/event/playerschamp/2012/main), this is the main event where they'll be battling for a prize purse of over $100,000 and the Player of the Year title. They'll be playing at the Showbox at the Market from Wednesday through Friday.

### The Booth

The Wizards of the Coast booth is the hub for Wizards of the Coast action at PAX Prime. During the last two hours of each day, you can play against the members of [Loading Ready Run](http://www.loadingreadyrun.com) in **Duels of the Planeswalkers** 2013. It'll be your first chance to see the expansion!

### Magic Tournaments

There are tournaments the whole weekend, being run by Cascade Games. Their full list is [right here](http://www.cascadegames.com/events/923). There are drafts, sealed decks, Legacy, Standard, and more. And a surprising number of the tournaments give away uncut sheets of ***Magic** 2013*!

### The Magic: The Gathering Creative Panel

From 1:30 pm to 2:30 pm on Sunday in the Raven Theatre. Come and talk with the **Magic** creative team and get insight into how they build new worlds for the **Magic** multiverse. Get preview of the world of Ravnica, the setting for this year’s fall **Magic** release. You’ll see new art, new cards, and you’ll even have a chance to pick up some **Magic** swag! **Panelists**: Brady Dommermuth, Jeremy Jarvis, Richard Whitters, Adam Lee and Doug Beyer.

### Submitting For Success: Develop an Illustration Career

From 2:30 pm to 3:30 pm on Saturday in the Raven Theatre. This multi-part panel, led by Wizards of the Coast Art Directors, will cover portfolio building, soliciting your work, what do when you GET the job, and a Q&A with the panel members. **Panelists**: Jon Schindehette, Matt Cavotta, and Jeremy Jarvis.

### Experience Ravnica – The Magic *Return to Ravnica* Party

For the fourth year in a row we will be throwing a bash at PAX to kick off the fall set! You’ll get to experience Ravnica, see all sorts of exclusive sneak peeks for the set, and answer some very exciting questions about *Return to Ravnica*. The party will be on Saturday, Sept. 1, 2012. You’ll be able to earn an invitation to the PAX Prime party, so stop by the **Magic: The Gathering** booth for details!

And finally, Wizards of the Coast employees will probably be roaming around the convention having fun. Say hello if you see one of us!
