Kamigawa: Neon Dynasty Product Overview
=======================================

It's a beautiful day in Kamigawa as you ride your neon-wheeled motorcycle through the city center. Even in the daylight, the many neon signs glow bright with a magical aura, and you see a being made entirely of noodles walk into a coffee shop. You smile and brake for a group of Jukai historians crossing the street before maneuvering your bike into a park bursting with Japanese maple trees. Red leaves float through the air, and one lands on your picnic basket as you lift it and a blanket from your saddle bags. You settle on the bank of the river, close enough to the water to remove your boots and dip your toes in. As you do, water rises and begins to take shape. It's the river kami, and you're just in time for your lunch plans together.


*Kamigawa: Neon Dynasty* is bursting with color, kami, and a little bit of chaos. Let's get into what you can find in this set as well as which products are perfect for you to build a personalized deck to bring into battle. Whether you want to create a Samurai deck, stack your library with ninjutsu cards, or play a softly glowing kami-based deck, there's a place just for you on Kamigawa.


Set Boosters
============


Set Boosters are an exciting way to add to your collection. You're much more likely to open multiple rares in Set Boosters than in Draft Boosters. *Kamigawa: Neon Dynasty* Set Boosters always contain a card with the Ninja or Samurai treatment, a traditional foil card, and an art card. Between foils and non-foils, 45% of Set Boosters contain at least one of the ukiyo-e lands. The commons and uncommons in Set Boosters tell little stories about Kamigawa, and there's always the chance of opening a card on *The List*.

Starting with *Innistrad: Midnight Hunt*, we've been including more Commander content in Set Boosters. In addition to the four legendary creature "face" cards from *Kamigawa: Neon Dynasty* Commander decks, you can find eight more new-to-*Magic* Commander cards that aren't found in those Commander decks.


*Kamigawa: Neon Dynasty* Set Boosters contain:


![NEO Set Booster contents](https://media.wizards.com/2022/images/daily/en_qkixzKwLq3.jpg)


* At least 1 rare or mythic rare card (approximately 27% of Set Boosters contain 2 rares or mythic rares, 3% contain 3, and less than 1% contain 4.)
* 1 Traditional foil card of any rarity, including Booster Fun cards
* 1 Common or uncommon with the Ninja or Samurai treatment
* 1 Land or foil land, including ukiyo-e lands
* 1 Art card or foil-stamped art card
* 1 Double-faced common or uncommon
* 3 Common cards that are connected thematically
* 2 Uncommon cards that are connected thematically
* 2 Wildcards of any rarity, including double-faced cards, ukiyo-e lands, and Booster Fun cards
* 1 Token, ad, or helper card, or a card from *The List*

Set Boosters are available individually and in displays of 30 packs. If you purchase a display, you may be eligible for this special foil Buy-a-Box promo featuring art by Yoji Shinkawa—ask your local store!

Draft Boosters
==============


Draft Boosters are perfect for the classic Draft or Sealed *Magic* experience. These packs are optimized for drafting, so they don't include those twelve Commander cards found in Set Boosters, but they do contain all the same Booster Fun versions of cards you can open in Set Boosters, including foil versions.


![NEO Draft Booster Box](https://media.wizards.com/2022/images/daily/en_Jnweu238sD.png)


*Kamigawa: Neon Dynasty* Draft Boosters contain:


![NEO Draft Booster contents](https://media.wizards.com/2022/images/daily/en_uV6TSNyNy6.jpg)


* 1 Rare or mythic rare card
* 1 Double-faced common or uncommon card
* 3 Uncommon cards
* 9 Common cards (in 33% of *Kamigawa: Neon Dynasty* packs, a traditional foil of any rarity replaces a common.)
* 1 Land card, featuring an ukiyo-e land in 33% of Draft Boosters
* 1 Token, ad, or helper card

You can purchase Draft Boosters individually and in displays of 36 packs. Like Set Boosters, your display purchase may be eligible for the Buy-a-Box promo—ask your local store!


Collector Boosters
==================


Collector Boosters are the best way to collect the hottest cards in *Kamigawa: Neon Dynasty*. You'll find five rares or mythic rares and tons of Booster Fun variants and traditional foils in every pack. Exclusive to *Kamigawa: Neon Dynasty* Collector Boosters are foil-etched cards, extended-art cards, and even a new, special neon ink card treatment. For more information on those treatments, check out the [Collecting *Kamigawa: Neon Dynasty* article](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/feature/collecting-kamigawa-neon-dynasty-2022-01-27).

Each *Kamigawa: Neon Dynasty* Collector Booster contains:

* 1 Non-foil extended-art or borderless rare or mythic rare. The only borderless cards that drop in this slot are the borderless planeswalkers; if you open a legendary land or a Dragon in this slot, you'll get an extended-art version.

Commander Decks

Vehicles and modified creatures headline the two *Kamigawa: Neon Dynasty* Commander decks. Kotori, Pilot Prodigy commands Buckle Up, a white-blue deck full of Vehicles in the fast lane to victory. Chishiro, the Shattered Blade commands Upgrades Unleashed, a red-green deck with creatures just begging to be upgraded and set loose on the battlefield. Both decks contain 15 new-to-*Magic* Commander cards from *Kamigawa: Neon Dynasty* plus a foil-etched display commander.
