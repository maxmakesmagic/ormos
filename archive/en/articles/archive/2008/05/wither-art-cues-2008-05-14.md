In the creepy, cruel world of Shadowmoor, some damage is worse—and decidedly more *permanent*—than usual. Mechanically, something with the wither ability deals damage to creatures in the form of -1/-1 counters. But what's the flavor of wither? We're glad you asked.


According to the *Shadowmoor* Style Guide, the boggart warrens have become gangs—loose, semi-nomadic, wolfpack-like social groups. The boggarts seek out new sensations relentlessly, but they also have a strong destructive urge. They hunt with rusty weapons, which have lasting effects on their victims:

Contrariwise, some cards effectively start out already being affected by wither. The reason that [Witherscale Wurm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Witherscale+Wurm) treats other sources as having wither is because its skin is constantly sloughing off:

The flames of their counterparts in Shadowmoor, the cinders, have guttered, but their bodies still glow warm enough to heat a blade—and what they lack in fire, they make up for in sheer cruelty.
