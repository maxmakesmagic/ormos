Last week it was revealed that we are reprinting [Magma Jet](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Magma+Jet) in *Theros*, and there was much rejoicing. Not only because the card is back (and boy do I love casting [Magma Jet](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Magma+Jet)) but also because of the gorgeous new art by Maciej Kuciara.

[Magma Jet](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Magma+Jet) | Art by [Maciej Kuciara](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&artist=%5B%22Maciej%20Kuciara%22%5D)


Let's take a look at the art description that brought this beautiful painting to life:

Color: Red spell   
 Location: Your choice   
 Action: This spell represents a damaging blast of molten lava. Start with the reference on pg. 49B. Using the reference as inspiration, design a female cleric from Akros. She's summoning a blast of molten lava out of the ground. It shoots up like a fiery geyser. She's in a dynamic pose as she casts her spell. The location is your choice. Maybe sheâ€™s on a rocky hillside with a Greek-inspired temple in the background.   
 Focus: The lava   
 Mood: I wield the power of fire!
