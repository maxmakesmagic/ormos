"You know, you, Marcel and Noah would make a great National Team," said Anderson


"What about you?" asked Lanthier


"Me? I'm terrible."


Terrible or not, Marc Anderson is having a great weekend. His Twin-Pod deck ran over Paul MacKinnon in the quarterfinals. Now he just needed to beat Dan Lanthier, former National Champion, who had torn up the competition all weekend with his [Splinter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Splinter) Twin deck.


Anderson led out with [Raging Ravine](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Raging+Ravine) after an island from Lanthier. Lanthier paid two life for [Gitaxian [autocard]Probe](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gitaxian+%5Bautocard%5DProbe)[/autocard], seeing two [Birthing Pod](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Birthing+Pod), three land, [Dismember](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dismember) and [Deceiver Exarch](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deceiver+Exarch). He played a mountain and [Spellskite](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spellskite).

*Dan Lanthier*

Anderson played an island and passed. Lanthier [Preordain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Preordain)ed, keeping one. He played island and passed it back. Anderson paid three and two life for a [Birthing Pod](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Birthing+Pod). Lanthier continued to [Preordain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Preordain) and [Ponder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ponder). Anderson tried tapping three for [Sea Gate [autocard]Oracle](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sea+Gate+%5Bautocard%5DOracle)[/autocard], and Lanthier [Mana Leak](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak)ed. Anderson [Dismember](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dismember)ed the [Spellskite](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spellskite), and ended his turn.


Lanthier paid two life for another [Probe](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Probe), this time revealing [Birthing Pod](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Birthing+Pod), [Splinter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Splinter) Twin, [Deceiver Exarch](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deceiver+Exarch) and [Misty Rainforest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Misty+Rainforest). He passed the turn. Anderson passed back and had his [Birthing Pod](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Birthing+Pod) bounced by [Into the Roil](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Into+the+Roil).


They played draw-go with some [Ponder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ponder)s and [Preordain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Preordain)s thrown in. Lanthier managed to catch a [Birds of Paradise](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Birds+of+Paradise) with [Twisted Image](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Twisted+Image). Anderson had an end-of-turn Exarch [Mana Leak](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak)ed. Lanthier stuck a [Spellskite](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spellskite), and when Anderson went for [Phyrexian Metamorph](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phyrexian+Metamorph), returned it to hand with [Into the Roil](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Into+the+Roil). Still, Lanthier made no moves toward a kill.


Anderson got [Birthing Pod](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Birthing+Pod) down, and then the following turn turned a [Birds of Paradise](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Birds+of+Paradise) into [Spellskite](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spellskite). When Lanthier did nothing on his following turn, Anderson played [Deceiver Exarch](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deceiver+Exarch), then untapped and traded it in for [Solemn [autocard]Simulacrum](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Solemn+%5Bautocard%5DSimulacrum)[/autocard]. Lanthier played another [Gitaxian [autocard]Probe](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gitaxian+%5Bautocard%5DProbe)[/autocard], seeing two more Pods, the [Splinter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Splinter) Twin, and an island, but had no follow-up.


Anderson turned his [Solemn [autocard]Simulacrum](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Solemn+%5Bautocard%5DSimulacrum)[/autocard] into Urabrask, the Hidden, and attacked. Lanthier was down to eight life. If he had anything, he would have to go for it. He didn't, and died in short order.


Anderson 1 - Lanthier 0


Lanthier, shockingly, had neither [Ponder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ponder) nor [Preordain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Preordain) to start things off. Anderson played a [Preordain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Preordain), then passed. Lanthier made a [Shrine of Piercing Vision](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shrine+of+Piercing+Vision). Anderson dug further with a second [Preordain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Preordain), keeping one. He followed up with [Copperline Gorge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Copperline+Gorge) and [Nature's Claim](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nature%27s+Claim) on the Shrine.


Lanthier finally [Preordain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Preordain)ed, keeping both. Anderson passed on three mana. Lanthier tried a [Spellskite](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spellskite). Anderson responded with [Deceiver Exarch](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deceiver+Exarch), tapping Anderson's island. He drew mana, and [Ponder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ponder)ed, keeping the cards. He played an island and passed.

*Marc Anderson*

Anderson paid two life for a three-mana [Birthing Pod](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Birthing+Pod), then two more to turn his Exarch into a [Solemn [autocard]Simulacrum](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Solemn+%5Bautocard%5DSimulacrum)[/autocard], searching out an island. Lanthier untapped and [Shatter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shatter)ed (Ice Age art!) the Pod. Anderson added [Spellskite](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spellskite) to his side of the board, then [Ponder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ponder)ed, and played [Birds of Paradise](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Birds+of+Paradise).


Play continued at its glacial pace. Lanthier [Preordain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Preordain)ed and played [Halimar Depths](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Halimar+Depths). Anderson played [Sea Gate [autocard]Oracle](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sea+Gate+%5Bautocard%5DOracle)[/autocard] and [Ponder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ponder)ed. They sell you the whole seat, but you only need the edge.


Still on five mana, Lanthier made no move. Anderson had had enough of waiting. He tapped five for Urabrask, the Hidden. Lanthier considered his options, then went for [Mana Leak](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak). Anderson fetched out a land and paid. Urabrask resolved, and hit the ground running with [Solemn [autocard]Simulacrum](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Solemn+%5Bautocard%5DSimulacrum)[/autocard] and [Sea Gate [autocard]Oracle](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sea+Gate+%5Bautocard%5DOracle)[/autocard]. Lanthier took the hit, down to seventeen.


Lanthier played [Deceiver Exarch](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deceiver+Exarch) at end of turn, then untapped and got rid of the opposing [Spellskite](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spellskite) with [Into the Roil](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Into+the+Roil). His last four mana he spent on [Splinter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Splinter) Twin. Urabrask forced him to wait a turn, and that was all Anderson needed. [Nature's Claim](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nature%27s+Claim) killed the [Spellskite](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spellskite), and then [Dismember](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dismember) finished off the Exarch. From there, victory was academic.
