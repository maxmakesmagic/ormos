These were the cards that shaped the tournament, that sparked discussions and were the most debated, the cards that won games and turned Grand Prix Brussels into an event to remember ...


### 5. Oblivion Sower


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Oblivion+Sower)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oblivion+Sower)
[Oblivion Sower](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oblivion+Sower) was part of one of the most memorable moments of the weekend. A turn-three [Crumble to Dust](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crumble+to+Dust) had exiled all the copies of [Shrine of the Forsaken Gods](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shrine+of+the+Forsaken+Gods) and then came [Oblivion Sower](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oblivion+Sower) followed by none other than [Ulamog, the Ceaseless Hunger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ulamog%2C+the+Ceaseless+Hunger), all on turn five! Especially in the light of the upcoming World *Magic* Cup the results of Eldrazi Ramp may be of further interest. After all, Team Unified Standard Constructed only allows four of every card, except for basic lands, across three different decks, and Ramp is one of the few Standard strategies that don't rely on fetch lands for their mana fixing.

### 4. Anafenza, the Foremost

Going into this event, most everyone was working under the assumption that [Rally the Ancestors](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rally+the+Ancestors) was bad against Abzan because [Anafenza, the Foremost](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Anafenza%2C+the+Foremost) shuts the deck down all on its own. But this traditional view was challenged by Team Eureka. They found that Anafenza really wasn't enough, not against their own [Murderous Cut](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Murderous+Cut) and [Sidisi's Faithful](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sidisi%27s+Faithful). In fact, Team Eureka was 23-1 against Abzan over the weekend and landed three players—Magnus Lantto, Simon Nielsen, and Martin Müller—in the Top 8. However, Anafenza is still good against the deck and part of the reason why Abzan was the most represented deck on the second day by a wide margin.

### 3. Infinite Obliteration


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Infinite+Obliteration)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Infinite+Obliteration)
[Infinite Obliteration](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Infinite+Obliteration) already performed well this weekend, and going forward we'll likely see more people infinitely obliterated. It's a decent sideboard card against [Ulamog, the Ceaseless Hunger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ulamog%2C+the+Ceaseless+Hunger) and of course the perfect disruption against [Rally the Ancestors](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rally+the+Ancestors). Ideally taking all of their [Nantuko Husk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nantuko+Husk)s or, failing that, all of their [Zulaport Cutthroat](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Zulaport+Cutthroat)s, will have Rally players railing. The card might even come in handy against the other breakout deck of the weekend, Esper Dragons, to take away the control mage's favorite toy, the otherwise hard to kill [Dragonlord Ojutai](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragonlord+Ojutai).

### 2. Rally the Ancestors


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Rally+the+Ancestors)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rally+the+Ancestors)
Team Eureka had two people go undefeated on Day 1, put three people into the Top 8, and had Simon Nielsen go all the way to the finals. All with [Rally the Ancestors](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rally+the+Ancestors), one of the two breakout decks of the tournament. The deadly combination of [Nantuko Husk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nantuko+Husk), [Zulaport Cutthroat](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Zulaport+Cutthroat), and [Grim Haruspex](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grim+Haruspex), assembled via [Collected Company](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Collected+Company) and or [Rally the Ancestors](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rally+the+Ancestors), took many people by surprise. Especially Abzan players who relied on Anafenza as their foremost, and often only, line of defense.

### 1. Dragonlord Ojutai


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Dragonlord+Ojutai)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragonlord+Ojutai)
"The more people play Abzan, the better Esper Dragons gets," explained Thomas Hendriks of Team Cabin Crew, the mastermind behind their deck for this event. "[Foul-Tongue Invocation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Foul-Tongue+Invocation) is great against Abzan especially when some of them are cutting [Hangarback Walker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hangarback+Walker) for [Heir of the Wilds](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Heir+of+the+Wilds). And no one respects Esper Dragons right now; it’s super under the radar." That would of course change now with Lukas Blohon's victory at Grand Prix Brussels.
