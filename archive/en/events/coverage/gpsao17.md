Day 2 Coverage



Exactly 1200 players from around the region converged at São Paulo, each hoping to be crowned a Grand Prix Champion. By nightfall, local hero Joao Lelis hoisted the trophy, keeping the title on Brazilian soil.


Piloting Bant Knightfall, he first defeated Julian Reyes in the quarterfinals before dispatching Rafael Costa Zaghi in the semifinals. Then, Lelis faced off against Vitor Grassato’s Titan Shift deck, a matchup he did not like very much. Despite that, he was able to secure the victory in two swift games.


25-ranked Carlos Romao could have been dropped from the [rankings](http://magic.wizards.com/en/content/top-25-rankings-top-players-coverage-events) but his Top 8 performance this weekend took care of that little issue. Making his tenth lifetime Grand Prix Top 8, he was the hot favourite to win it all, but fell in the quarterfinals in three tight games. Rounding off the rest of the Top 8 were semifinalist Danilo Ramos Mopesto and quarterfinals Jean Sato and Fabian Nunez, happy to be qualified for Pro Tour Ixalan in Albuquerque.


Once again, hearty congratulations to Joao Lelil, your Grand Prix São Paulo 2017 Champion!
