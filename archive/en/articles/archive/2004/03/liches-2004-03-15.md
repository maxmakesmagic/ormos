Let us confirm your suspicions: R&D is very fond of liches.


The word "lich" (pronounced "litch") literally means "corpse," but in the fantasy genre it means more than that: a lich a corpse that, through powerful magic, has risen from the dead to carry out foul deeds.


In **Magic**, [Lich](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lich)-type cards prevent you from dying provided you pay for the damage you take with another resource, like permanents in play or cards in your graveyard.



![Lich](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=lich)

The original lich card was [Lich](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lich) from way back in **Magic**'s first set, *Alpha*. Like many **Magic** cards, [Lich](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lich) bends **Magic**'s own rules: You don't lose the game from having zero life or less. Also, whenever you gain life, you draw that many cards. Being an unnatural animated corpse seems like it has its benefits -- until you read the fine print. The price is that if you take damage, you must sacrifice that many permanents, and if [Lich](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lich) leaves play, you lose: game over, the end, you're a pile of dusty ex-lich. So it's not exactly immunity to damage; it's more like trading your life total for your permanent count. It's tricky to pull off -- but incredibly powerful in the right circumstances.



![Nefarious Lich](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Nefarious+Lich)

It was a long time before we saw another [Lich](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lich)-type card, but R&D enjoyed the effect so much they tried again. [Nefarious Lich](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nefarious+Lich) was next, in *Odyssey*. Since *Odyssey* block was the graveyard-matters block, instead of demanding your permanents in play, [Nefarious Lich](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nefarious+Lich) demands cards from your graveyard. Again, if [Nefarious Lich](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nefarious+Lich) gets [Naturalize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Naturalize)d, you're done -- and if you run out of payment to the ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227195556im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/black.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227195556im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/black.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227195556im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/black.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227195556im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/black.gif) enchantment, you're done. But again, lifegain becomes a potent card-drawing resource.



![Lich's Tomb](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Lich%27s+Tomb)

But R&D wasn't done. *Mirrodin* block is the artifact block, so this [Lich](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lich) variant naturally became an artifact. Like the original [Lich](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lich), [Lich's Tomb](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lich%27s+Tomb) demands a payment of permanents in exchange for dismissing that pesky you-die-at-zero-life rule. It doesn't have the card-drawing ability of the original, but conveniently also doesn't have the you-lose effect if it leaves play. And it's much handier to cast at ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20160830042801im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless4.gif) instead of ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227195556im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/black.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227195556im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/black.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227195556im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/black.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227195556im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/black.gif).


Will **Magic** see [Lich](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lich) variants in the future? As long as there are still players willing to take the diabolical plunge of becoming an animated corpse, you can bet on it.
