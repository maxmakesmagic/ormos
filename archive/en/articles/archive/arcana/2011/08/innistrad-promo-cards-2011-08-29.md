Hey you! Yes, *you*! You look like someone who'd be interested in seeing what various *Innistrad* promo cards are going to look like! But first, you probably want to look at [our coverage of **Magic** stuff at PAX](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/feature/158), because it's full of *Innistrad* news, and will also explain some of the things you're about to see.

Done? Good. *Now* let's look at promo cards!
