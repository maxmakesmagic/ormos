With three Grand Prix Top 8s, including a win, Christian Calcano is certainly no slouch, but he's still in search of his first Pro Tour Top 8, and sitting in his way in Round 4 is none other than Hall of Famer and generally well respected pro player and coverage guru Luis Scott Vargas.


(look, us coverage people gotta stick together, alright?)


(oh wait, Calcano just owned up to doing some coverage a couple of weeks ago, too. Okay, he's also awesome.)


Both players would be looking to take an aggressive stance in this match. Calcano's Red-White Aggro deck would seek to get creatures on the table as quickly as possible, and back it up with a handful of burn spells to turn that into quick reduction in his opponent's life total. Scott-Vargas on the other hand, would be less interested in what's going on over on the other side of the table, and mostly concerned with setting up his Jeskai Ascendency combo and destroying Calcano in One Big Turn.




*Gold-level pro Christian Calcano squares off with Hall of Famer Luis Scott-Vargas in the first of five Standard Constructed rounds for the day.*
