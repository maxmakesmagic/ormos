There's a card in ***Magic** 2013* called [Courtly Provocateur](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Courtly+Provocateur). It looks like this:

 The art description that was given to artist James Ryman was this:



> 
> Color: Blue creature
> 
> 
> Location: A corpse-filled ballroom
> 
> 
> Action: Show a female mage who holds a mask of your design that covers only the top half of her face. Below the mask, we can see her grinning mouth. She bows slightly as if she is being applauded by an unseen audience. Around her are several newly dead bodies (but keep it bloodless) – these are the victims of a multi-way standoff she orchestrated. She is dressed in an expensive-looking costume of your design (what would a mage wear to a party?).
> 
> 
> Focus: The mage
> 
> 
> Mood: You will fight if I say so. You will die if I wish.
> 
> 
> 


And here's how the provocateur got from that description to the final art!

**Initial Sketch**: This sketch achieves the goal of "corpse-filled ballroom," but the Creative team asked for the grin to be toned down and for there to be a wider variety in victims.

**Second Sketch**: This sketch changes the background and turns one of the victims into a man. The Creative team gave the go-ahead.
