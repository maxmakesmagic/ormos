It was a fairy tale finish for Steve Aplin. Not only was he crowned Australia's National Champion, he faced and defeated all in his path with his Aggressive Rakdos deck, including the reigning champion Tim He and his trusty Solar Flare in the finals. Joining Aplin and He representing Australia at the World Champs, are James Zhang and Craig Chapman. Perhaps one of the strongest National teams in a long time, perhaps ever. Look out New York, Australia is coming.

Sunday, July 22: 10:22 a.m. - Round Eight: Levi Hinz vs. Craig Chapman
----------------------------------------------------------------------


Everyone who comes to Nationals wants to win, I'm not going to deny that, but at this point in the tournament, some people need to win more than others. Levi Hinz and Craig Chapman are both X and 2 at this point, and winning out from here will get them to the top 8 without much trouble. But once they start picking up a loss or two, things could be looking a considerably dicey.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/aunat07/R8_hinz_chapman.jpg)Hinz took control of Game 1 proactively, launching into the Red Zone early and often with his tiny white friends, while Chapman appeared to showing a growing interest in real estate, playing out land after land. [Judge Unworthy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Judge+Unworthy) took the sting out of Hinzes attack force, brushing aside a [Sinew Sliver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sinew+Sliver) and reducing the impact of a [Sidewinder Sliver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sidewinder+Sliver) at the same time. Chapman finally began to fill his side of the board with flyers, a [Duskrider Peregrine](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duskrider+Peregrine) coming off suspend and unmorphing a [Whip-Spine Drake](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Whip-Spine+Drake), while holing the ground with a [D'Avenant Healer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=D%27Avenant+Healer). Hinz eventually found a fourth and fifth land which gave him something to reestablish an offense with, but by now Chapmans flyers were taking large slices of Hinz home for dinner. Having only 3 life left and facing a pair of 3/3 flyers, Hinz went all in, hoping he could trick Chapman into doing something that meant that he wouldn't be wearing either one of the flyers next turn. Chapman pondered his options and blocked sparingly, leaving one of his team safe for retaliation. Hinz shook his head minutely and packed up his cards for Game 2.


"Gah, you were makin' me sweat!" Chapman exclaimed.


Hinz again started out fast in Game 2, and things looked very good for him when Chapman stalled on two lands, having to use a [Judge Unworthy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Judge+Unworthy) again on a [Sinew Sliver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sinew+Sliver). This time however, scrying a non-land card to the top of his deck to ensure the Sliver died would mean he wouldn't be drawing a third land next turn. However, Chapman untapped and cycled a [Marshaling Cry](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Marshaling+Cry) to dig up and play an [Island](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island), knowing he had fourth land waiting for him next turn. Hinz continued to apply pressure with a [Bonesplitter Sliver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bonesplitter+Sliver), and added a [Lymph Sliver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lymph+Sliver) to the table, making interactive combat potential problematic for Chapman, who has developing an army of his own, starting with a pair of [Amrou Seekers](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Amrou+Seekers) and nudging back Hinzeses attacks with a [Vedalken Aethermage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vedalken+Aethermage) (saucy!) The race looked to be favoring Hinz, who maintained a head start from the word go, but one declined black later and Chapman was laying out a [Fortify](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fortify) to turn six damage into twelve and all but blowing Hinz right out of his chair to win the match.
