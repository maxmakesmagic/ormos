Eight became four and now four will become two. Take a look at the roundup of the Semifinals at Grand Prix Kobe 2015.


Joe Soh (White Black Warriors) vs. Akio Chiba (Esper Dragons)
=============================================================

Joe Soh started off the first game of the Semifinals quickly with two copies of [Chief of the Edge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chief+of+the+Edge). Chiba was able to deal with one of the 3/2's, but Soh pulled further ahead with [Gideon, Ally of Zendikar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gideon%2C+Ally+of+Zendikar). By the time Chiba was able to deal with the Planeswalker, Soh had already amounted an army. Chiba scraped by an extra turn with [Foul-Tongue Invocation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Foul-Tongue+Invocation), but fell the turn after.


Game 2 looked like it was going Chiba's way; he was able to transform an early Jace and deal with Soh's early threats. Eventually the match turned into a battle between Planeswalkers: [Jace, Telepath Unbound](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace%2C+Telepath+Unbound) versus [Gideon, Ally of Zendikar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gideon%2C+Ally+of+Zendikar). Gideon won the battle and Soh was able to power out an army with it.

Chiba was able to stabilize a little bit, but eventually, Soh closed the game out with [Secure the Wastes](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Secure+the+Wastes) and [Chief of the Edge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chief+of+the+Edge) and guaranteed himself a spot in the finals.


Takuma Morofuji (Atarka Red) vs. Shota Takao (Esper Tokens)
===========================================================

In the first game, Shota Takao was able to stabilize against Morofuji's quick start. Takao's [Gideon, Ally of Zendikar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gideon%2C+Ally+of+Zendikar), came out and allowed him to take the first game of the semifinals.


Morofuji's start for the second game was more aggressive than the first. He quickly dropped Takao down to 1 life before Takao was able to land his prized Gideon. Gideon by itself is a very strong card, but it didn't immediately deal with Morofuji's army and Morofuji forced a game third game.

Despite a slow start out of Morofuji in game three he was able to play an [Outpost Siege](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Outpost+Siege). Although Takao was able to find three copies of [Seeker of the Way](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seeker+of+the+Way), he couldn't find a way to activate its Lifelink. When Morofuji attacked with his army and used [Atarka's Command](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Atarka%27s+Command) to make sure that Takao couldn't gain life from his Seekers, Morofuji found him a spot in the finals.
