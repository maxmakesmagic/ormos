### Jared Kohler (Merfolk) vs. David Gleicher (Team America)


### Game One


Gleicher started the party with turn-one [Thoughtseize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtseize) and took a [Lord of Atlantis](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lord+of+Atlantis) after Jared Kohler's [Æther Vial](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=%C3%86ther+Vial) hit like clockwork. While Kohler spent his time sculpting the perfect board, with [Coralhelm Commander](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Coralhelm+Commander), [Cursecatcher](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cursecatcher) and another [Lord of Atlantis](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lord+of+Atlantis), Gleicher sculpted the perfect hand playing multiple [Ponder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ponder)s and a [Brainstorm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brainstorm).


Gleicher's grip looked nice with a [Dismember](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dismember), [Tombstalker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tombstalker), [Force of Will](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Force+of+Will) and [Jace, the Mind Sculptor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace%2C+the+Mind+Sculptor). But the scores were 20-10 in Kohler's favor and the Commander was gaining levels. Hands mean diddly without some oomph on the board.


The pivotal turn was when Kohler drew an [Umezawa's Jitte](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Umezawa%27s+Jitte), but was a land short to cast and equip it. So he used [Æther Vial](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=%C3%86ther+Vial) to add a [Silvergill Adept](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Silvergill+Adept) and dig. It was not a land. Kohler then leveled the Commander up to optimal strength and attacked with it and the now 3/3 [Cursecatcher](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cursecatcher). Gleicher's [Dismember](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dismember) took out the non-attacking [Lord of Atlantis](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lord+of+Atlantis), and the lack of pumps and islandwalk allowed Gleicher to take out Kohler's entire board with his blocking [Tarmogoyf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf) and [Tombstalker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tombstalker).


Jace, Sculptor Extraordinaire came down the next turn, and that was all she wrote.


**David Gleicher 1 – 0 Jared Kohler**

### Game Two


When Gleicher went to five after mulligans he said, "You might have to win this way. Sorry."


After Kohler went, [Silvergill Adept](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Silvergill+Adept), [Lord of Atlantis](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lord+of+Atlantis), [Cursecatcher](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cursecatcher), [Force of Will](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Force+of+Will) your [Pernicious Deed](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pernicious+Deed), then [Back to Basics](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Back+to+Basics), it appeared he did.


**David Gleicher 1 – 1 Jared Kohler**


### Game Three


Game three proceeded much slower than the previous two. Slight, incremental advantage was used by both players, because without the [Æther Vial](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=%C3%86ther+Vial) early, Kohler had to shift his deck into a less aggressive mode. He used two early [Wasteland](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wasteland)s to foil Gleicher's mid-game plans, or at least delay them.


And delay them Kohler did. But said plans came out eventually, in the form of a [Tarmogoyf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf). Kohler [Submerge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Submerge)d Gleicher's larger, newer threat, [Tombstalker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tombstalker), rendering it unable to be re-cast. However, the currently 3/4 Goyf was still able to make the totals 17-15 in Gleicher's favor.

Kohler had an [Æther Vial](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=%C3%86ther+Vial) at two and a [Merrow Reejerey](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Merrow+Reejerey), but that wasn't good enough to get some offense going against Gleicher's America deck in grind-out mode. Gleicher made sure of that with a [Ghastly Demise](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ghastly+Demise), taking out the Merfolk pumper (with the help of [Wasteland](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wasteland)ing his own [Wasteland](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wasteland) to fill his [Tombstalker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tombstalker)-emptied graveyard).


Kohler paid in full for a [Force of Will](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Force+of+Will) on Gleicher's [Thoughtseize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtseize), and Gleicher paid the much cheaper alternate cost on his on Force to counter the first counter. The black discard spell took Kohler's only [Sower of Temptation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sower+of+Temptation) and he was left with a [Back to Basics](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Back+to+Basics) and a [Pithing Needle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pithing+Needle), joined shortly by [Coralhelm Commander](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Coralhelm+Commander). It was 12-9. Then 12-5.


Just then, Jared top-decked something that caused his opponent to groan – another [Sower of Temptation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sower+of+Temptation). The Faerie took the 4/5 Tarmo-rocket and now it was three creatures to none. Gleicher put his face on his fist when he passed back, and soon changed the fist into a handshake.


**Jared Kohler 2 – 1 David Gleicher**


Jared Kohler advances to the finals!

### Reed Hartman (NO-RUG) vs. Bernie Wen (U/W [Standstill](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Standstill))


### Game One


Reed Hartman started with a [Noble Hierarch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Noble+Hierarch) that was quickly taken out with a [Swords to Plowshares](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swords+to+Plowshares). Bernie Wen then cast a [Standstill](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Standstill) that was quickly broken with a second Hierarch.

Wen stabilized early with multiple [Mishra](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mishra)'s Factory, but things started happening when Hartman was able to protect his [Green Sun's Zenith](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Green+Sun%27s+Zenith) against [Force of Will](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Force+of+Will) with a Force of his own and got a large [Tarmogoyf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf). The two players fought back and forth. [Jace, the Mind Sculptor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace%2C+the+Mind+Sculptor) kept the green threat off the board, but it couldn't do the same for the [Vendilion Clique](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vendilion+Clique). Well, it could have, but at quite a disadvantage for Wen. So he didn't do it.


Eventually, the flying beats and green monsters were too much, and Hartman took the first game.


**Reed Hartman 1 – 0 Bernie Wen**


### Game Two


Game Two was similar to the first in that it started with a [Noble Hierarch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Noble+Hierarch) putting down the swords and picking up the plowshares. Wen's [Mishra](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mishra)'s Factory was hit by an [Ancient Grudge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ancient+Grudge), and though Wen had the [Spell Snare](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spell+Snare) to stop [Tarmogoyf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf), Hartman had the Red[Elemental](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elemental) Blast to neutralize the Snare.

After Hartman then resolved a [Jace, the Mind Sculptor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace%2C+the+Mind+Sculptor), you would have assumed the game would have a more clear leader, but surprisingly, even with ten cards across both graveyards, the green beater was only a 2/3. The ugly monster was soon joined by the three pretty faeries on [Vendilion Clique](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vendilion+Clique) and Hartman made the totals 17-15, then 17-10 in his favor.


Wen had an Elspeth to stem the bleeding, but he still sunk to five life, and the final turn of the game went as follows: [Lightning Bolt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt) at Wen's face, [Mental Misstep](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mental+Misstep) to stop it, Red[Elemental](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elemental) Blast to say "No" to the stopping, then [Lightning Bolt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt) #2 at aforementioned face.


**Reed Hartman 2 – 0 Bernie Wen**


Reed advances to the finals.
