Despite his usually jolly appearance, he plays the game with a quiet intensity. That's just fine with Jin Okamoto, one of Japan's most lettered players. He plays a very careful game. These two clashed at 2-1, and Romao was not optimistic about the matchup. Romao couldn't contain a smile as he kept his opening hand. It turned out it was a smile of resignation. While his first play was a [Skeleton Shard](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skeleton+Shard) on turn three, Okamoto was firing with Aether Spellbomb, [Copper Myr](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Copper+Myr) and [Tel-Jilad Exile](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tel-Jilad+Exile). [Irradiate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Irradiate) took care of the Myr, complicating Okamoto's mana, but he had [Chromatic Sphere](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chromatic+Sphere) at the ready. It let him bounce Romao's next play of [Pewter Golem](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pewter+Golem) and send for more damage. Next came [Mask of Memory](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mask+of+Memory), and Romao was in serious trouble.

He had to chump with his replayed [Pewter Golem](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pewter+Golem), then Shard it back and put it into play again. Of course by that tim Okamoto had [Neurok Spy](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Neurok+Spy) to inherit the Mask, and he started doing some very unfair things. [Skyhunter Patrol](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skyhunter+Patrol) and another Spy soon showed up, while Romao's ground pounding team of [Pewter Golem](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pewter+Golem), [Frogmite](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Frogmite) and [Malachite Golem](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Malachite+Golem) had to stay home.

It was a silent slaughter.

Okamoto 1 - Romao 0

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/ptams04/fm5_2.jpg)This time around, Romao had a second-turn Myr while Okamoto had nothing to do. However, all Romao could accelerate into was [Thoughtcast](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtcast). Okamoto's third turn came and went with three untapped mana. Romao played a [Soldier Replica](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soldier+Replica) and held back for fear of [Raise the Alarm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Raise+the+Alarm) sabotaging his Myr.

Finally Okamoto got in the game with [Tel-Jilad Exile](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tel-Jilad+Exile). Romao upped the stakes with a [Malachite Golem](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Malachite+Golem), but Okamoto showed him who was boss with a mighty [Molder Slug](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Molder+Slug). Romao didn't even flinch. He untapped, [Irradiate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Irradiate)d the Exile and [Terror](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Terror)ed the Slug, losing his lowly Myr. Then he bashed for six.

Okamoto hoped to buy time with an Aether Spellbomb on the big Golem, and [Journey of Discovery](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Journey+of+Discovery) got him his second plains and an island. However, Romao ripped his sixth land and replayed his 5/3. All Okamoto could do was pay full price for a [Somber Hoverguard](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Somber+Hoverguard), quickly [Irradiate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Irradiate)d by Romao. He played a [Skyhunter Patrol](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skyhunter+Patrol), but Romao's men kept hitting. At least it would hold off Romao's [Pewter Golem](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pewter+Golem). The problem was the rest of the monsters on the table. Okamoto chumped with Den-Guard, then scooped.

Okamoto 1 - Romao 1

Okamoto used a [Talisman of Unity](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Talisman+of+Unity) to fire out an early [Skyhunter Patrol](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skyhunter+Patrol), making Romao's turn-three [Thoughtcast](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtcast) off [Leaden Myr](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leaden+Myr) somewhat underwhelming. Okamoto hit, then dropped Den Guard and fetched blue mana with [Journey of Discovery](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Journey+of+Discovery). Romao bought a [Frogmite](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Frogmite) for three and passed it back.

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/ptams04/fm5_3.jpg)Okamoto was short on action. He popped a [Chromatic Sphere](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chromatic+Sphere) but drew nothing, and burned for one before swinging for two in the air. Romao started with his heavy hitters. [Malachite Golem](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Malachite+Golem) fell to [Creeping Mold](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Creeping+Mold), but [Pewter Golem](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pewter+Golem) got to stay. Okamoto cycled a Spellbomb, but just turned up more land. [Irradiate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Irradiate) cleared away the Patrol and let [Pewter Golem](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pewter+Golem) start bashing.

Finally, Okamoto turned up a non-land: [Luminous Angel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Luminous+Angel). Romao tapped eight and showed him Riever Demon, while Okamoto made a sound like deflating. His next draw was a [Mask of Memory](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mask+of+Memory), and that was it.

Afterwards, Okamoto asked Romao to pose for a photo.
