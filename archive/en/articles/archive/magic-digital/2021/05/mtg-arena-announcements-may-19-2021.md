Recent Issues and Resolutions
=============================


We deployed an update recently that addressed the issues experienced during the Arena Open on May 8. This update requires a client restart.


We also took steps to resolve a problem on Sunday, May 16, during the Day 2 Qualifier Weekend in which the event had been accidentally configured as a Historic event rather than a Standard event:


* A replacement event correctly configured as Standard format was created a few hours later that most players successfully joined.
* Players who signed up for the first event were granted 4,000 gems for the inconvenience and were able to keep any gems they had earned before the misconfigured event was deactivated.

We appreciate your patience and your participation!


Only Two Tests Remain in the College Cup
========================================


The [College Cup](https://admin.magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/magic-digital/college-cup-here-strixhaven-2021-05-05) showdown is underway as Strixhaven's colleges battle for supremacy in *MTG Arena*.


The Test of Knowledge has ended, and Witherbloom has swamped the point totals, holding on to the top spot. But Silverquill appears intent on writing a new chapter in this competition with their team in the lead! Keep up with the latest on Twitter [@MTG\_Arena](https://twitter.com/MTG_Arena).

There are just two tests remaining: the Test of Wit and the Test of Leadership. Prove your *Magic* prowess before the event ends on May 31 and hone your skills by playing as often as you like.


Don't forget that when you represent your college by using your college's sleeves, avatar, and pet, you earn your team extra credit points:


* **College sleeves**: Take that Strixhaven quiz to get the email containing your sleeve code, then redeem it in [your Wizards Account](https://myaccounts.wizards.com/) or through the Store on PC or Mac.
* **College avatar**: Each college's avatar is available in the second position in the *Strixhaven* Mastery web.
* **College pet**: Each college has a tome pet available within the first ten levels of the *Strixhaven* Mastery Pass rewards levels.

Get all the [details on earning points in the College Cup](https://admin.magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/magic-digital/college-cup-here-strixhaven-2021-05-05) in David McDarby's article.


When the College Cup has concluded and the point totals have been tallied, the winning college will change the face of *MTG Arena* itself!
