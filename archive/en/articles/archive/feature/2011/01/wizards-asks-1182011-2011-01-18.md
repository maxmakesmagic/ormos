*What's your favorite planeswalker card, and why?*

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/mtgcom/authorpics/authorpic_kellydigges.jpg)**Kelly Digges:** This is a close one. [Sorin Markov](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sorin+Markov) is a heavy hitter who does a lot of things I love. [Garruk Wildspeaker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Garruk+Wildspeaker) epitomizes my love of green and ramps up my mana *while also* ramping up for an [Overrun](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Overrun). [Venser, the Sojourner](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Venser%2C+the+Sojourner) has been doing very silly things with [Mulldrifter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mulldrifter), [Reveillark](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reveillark), [Sun Titan](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sun+Titan), and others in my [Grand Arbiter Augustin IV](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grand+Arbiter+Augustin+IV) Commander deck.

But I'm a Timmy at heart, and only one planeswalker can be the biggest, baddest monster of them all: [Nicol Bolas, Planeswalker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nicol+Bolas%2C+Planeswalker).

![Nicol Bolas, Planeswalker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Nicol+Bolas%2C+Planeswalker)  
When I opened him first-pick, first-pack at a "bring your own packs" draft, I had to take him. Eight mana? Whatever. Three colors? No problem. He showed up, and *it was on*. Someone who does not share my sensibilities in the first-pick department immediately passed me a [Garza Zol, Plague Queen](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Garza+Zol%2C+Plague+Queen), and in the surprise bonus fourth pack (!), I managed to snag [Nicol Bolas](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nicol+Bolas) (original recipe) out of a rather ostentatious copy of *From the Vault: Dragons* that brand manager Mark Purvis snuck in there.

I couldn't bring myself to cut any of the three, and I ended up playing 45 cards just to bring my average mana cost down a littleâ€”but it was all worth it when Bolas hit the board, surveyed the mess I'd gotten myself into, and did what he does best: *win*.
