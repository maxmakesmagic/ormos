Having written “Making **Magic**” for over two years now, I've realized that I've begun to get a pretty dedicated group of readers. I just wanted to take a moment to tell you all that I know you're there. It's more obvious that I recognize my newer readers as I have to often explain things to them. But nonetheless I know my die-hard readers are there. Many of you write in to me on occasion so I do get to occasionally hear how some of you are doing.

I'm a big fan of the series *Buffy, the Vampire Slayer*. One big reason is that the show rewarded longtime viewers by often throwing in subtle references to older shows. (My favorite was when Oz was looking in the glass case and mentioned how one of the trophies' eyes moved. That was a throwback to the third show in the first season.) I try to also do that in my column. So when I make a reference to not always knowing the difference between damage and combat damage or why how I've offended someone, sir, those references are for all of you.

I hope you've enjoyed my little experiment today. Hopefully it's given you a little insight into part of the game you might have never thought of before.

Join me next week as I give all of you a voice.

Until then, may you know why the squirrels aren't waiting in the weeds.
