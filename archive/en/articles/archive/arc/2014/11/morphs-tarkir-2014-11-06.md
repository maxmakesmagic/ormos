Not all the art created by *Magic* artists is intended to wind up on cards. In creating any given world, we have artists create reams of concepting work that helps define and flesh out a new world or part of that world.

To illustrate this new form of morph concealment magic, Senior Art Director Jeremy Jarvis asked Raymond Swanland to illustrate a Mardu rider concealing himself in morph magic and then bursting out to take care of business.
