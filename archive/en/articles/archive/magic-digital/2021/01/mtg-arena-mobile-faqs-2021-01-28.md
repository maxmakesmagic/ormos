General Q&A
===========


When is *MTG Arena* launching on mobile?
----------------------------------------


The early access for *MTG Arena* on Android mobile devices is currently planned for January 28, 2020 with the release of *Kaldheim*. It will be available on iOS, additional Android devices, and tablets later this year.


When will it be available on the Google Play Store?
---------------------------------------------------


We will be releasing the app on January 28 as part of our scheduled maintenance. It may take some time (up to several hours) for it to appear on the Google Play store, and it may appear in some regions before others.


For more information, please refer to the [MTG Arena Status Page](https://magicthegatheringarena.statuspage.io/).


Early Access?
-------------


Early access, open testing—in other words, this isn't even our final form! Our initial release for Android mobile devices is aimed at **players who can meet our planned "recommend specs,"** which will require players to have access to a newer/higher-end device.


Mobiles devices that exceed our recommend specs will work as well, and we're aiming to lower some of these requirements (e.g., "minimum specs") alongside additional performance improvements when we fully release on Android, tablets, and iOS later this year.


How do I participate?
---------------------


Starting on January 28, you'll be able to download and play *MTG Arena* by searching for it on the Google Play store. Once you find the listing, you can install and use the app!


What's the app called?
----------------------


*Magic*: *The Gathering Arena*! You can also search for *MTG Arena*.


When will you be releasing on iOS?
----------------------------------


Our goal is to release on additional devices as soon as we're ready. We want fans to have fun, enjoyable experiences with the long-awaited mobile version of *Magic*, and we want to make sure our releases are polished and ready to play.


You should expect to learn more about what's next for our mobile launch plans with the release of *Strixhaven*.


What features will be available for the Android Early Access?
-------------------------------------------------------------


Almost everything currently available in *MTG Arena*! This includes all the current card sets (yes, *Kaldheim*, too), formats, events, mastery system, direct challenge, deck building, daily deals, etc.


It's probably easier to list the things that ***won't*** be supported for the Android Early Access:


* Social features (Friends List, In-Game Messaging)
* Sideboarding during draft
* Code redemption
	+ Codes can be redeemed by using the PC/macOS client, or through the [Wizards Account](https://accounts.platform.wizards.com/) web page.
	+ If you redeem a code through the Wizards Account web page, you will need to navigate to the in-game store for the items to appear on your account.

Does this include cross-platform support?
-----------------------------------------


Yep! Whether you're playing on PC, macOS, or mobile—if you sign into your Wizards Account, you will have access to your collection, be able to complete quests, earn daily win progress, matchmake against other players, etc. regardless of platform.


Will the Android early access be open to everyone who wants to participate?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------


Android early access will be available everywhere *MTG Arena* and the Google Play store are currently available, for all players with a compatible device. Additionally, we will be supporting the following languages on mobile devices (hint: it's all the ones we currently support):


* English
* French
* Italian
* German
* Spanish
* Brazilian Portuguese
* Russian
* Korean
* Japanese

Anything else we should expect when playing during the Android early access?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------


Players should expect a full *Magic* gameplay experience, with various UX/UI changes to support the smaller screen size and touch controls (you'll *literally* tap your lands to add mana to your mana pool).


There are a few performance areas we plan to optimize before we launch on additional mobile devices, however, if there are situations or game states that seem especially taxing on your phone's resources (including battery life), please let us know!


Beyond that, all feedback and bug reports are appreciated.


How do I report bugs/provide feedback?
--------------------------------------


Players can report any bugs or feedback related to playing on mobile devices, [here](https://feedback.wizards.com/forums/918667-mtg-arena-bugs).

Will updates to *MTG Arena* require a full game app re-download?
----------------------------------------------------------------


We do not anticipate you needing to re-download the full game to receive updates. Most of our game updates will be differential (you'll only need to download things that are new or have been changed).


Account Q&A
===========


What permissions are required to launch and use the app?
--------------------------------------------------------


You do not need to grant *Magic*: *The Gathering Arena* any special permissions (e.g., location, access to microphone/camera, etc.) in order to play.


Can I be logged into both the mobile and desktop apps at the same time?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------


Players may only be logged into one device at a time. If you are already logged in and connect to a new platform, you will be disconnected from your current device.


If I change an account setting on the mobile app, will it also change on the desktop version (or vice versa)?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Most account and gameplay settings are tied to your account, while others are saved locally—you may have experienced this already if you play on multiple PCs (such as a desktop and a laptop, or Windows and macOS).


Don't worry—your decklists and collection are tied to your account and will be available regardless of which platform you play on.


*Magic* Esports
===============


Can I compete in *Magic* Esports events on mobile?
--------------------------------------------------


We do not recommend competing in *Magic* Esports events on a mobile device, and per the [Digital *Magic* Tournament Rules](https://e3b4b4k4.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Magic-Digital-MTR-2.pdf), players who choose to do so assume all responsibility for gameplay or connection issues they experience.

How does attacking and blocking work?
-------------------------------------


During the declare attackers step, tap the creatures you wish to attack with. When declaring blockers, tap the creature you wish to block with, then tap the creature you intend to block.
