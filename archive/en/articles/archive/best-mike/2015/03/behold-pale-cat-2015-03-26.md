I was asked this morning, "What's the story behind [Ashen Rider](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ashen+Rider)?"


[![](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Ashen+Rider)](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ashen+Rider)
Well, that gave me an excuse to jump into our super-cool internal database, Multiverse (and to send emails to a bunch of people in R&D), to see what I could find out. Here is a developer note for the card:


9/8/12: No Angels here. Could be an Archon, though, or a Demon that serves Athreos.


Okay! So there you go, the Rider became an Archon really early in development. To refresh your memory (or impart you with **Magic** lore if you didn't know!), an [Archon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&subtype=+%5B%22Archon%22%5D) in **Magic** "is a mysterious figure riding a winged animal."


Wait... what did I just quote? The art description, of course! (You knew that was coming, didn't you?)


Color: White and black creature  

Location: A fantastical arch at the edge of the Underworld  

Action: In Magic, an "archon" is a mysterious figure riding a winged animal. Start with the reference. Design a masked archon who can travel to and from the realm of the dead. Show a massive, fantastical archway inspired by Greek architecture. Its entrance is blocked with a "veil" of shadows. Show the archon and his winged mount emerging dramatically from these shadows. His winged mount is yours to design, but it shouldn't be a Pegasus. Maybe it's like an undead winged hound that's the size of an minivan.  

Focus: The archon  

Mood: He transcends the lines between life and death.


Now, the art description uses the male pronoun by default, but Chris Rahn decided to paint the Archon as a female, which you can see in the card's art and is referenced in the flavor text. Oh wait, it's hard to see that she's a she at that scale, right? Well then, here is the full art:

*Très magnifique!*
