Patrick "Trick" Jarrett oversees web content and social media for Magic, and acts as the publisher of DailyMTG.com and Magic content on the web. He's an ardent Commander player and lover of the game he's played since Ice Age. 







Whenever a new set comes out, it releases a veritable treasure trove of new art into **Magic**. The vast majority of those are pieces on new cards with only occasional new art pieces on reprinted cards. With *Modern Masters* we have a bunch of cards with completely new art, as well as a handful of cards with art never before put in booster packs (such as art from promos, From the Vault, or other places.)


Today, I'm going to do a quick look at all the cards with completely new art, as well as showing you a select few in the larger view. I don't want to do this for all of the cards because, well, I need topics for future Arcana.


So, with that said, here we go! A side-by-side of old art versus the new *Modern Masters* art on cards. You can also see how the rules have changed since the card was originally printed.
