Satoshi Nakamura is one of the best-known Japanese players, for his play skill and his wide assortment of funky hats. The crowd was silently cheering him on against Marco Blume, Germany's two-time Pro Tour champion.

### Game 1

Blume had a two-drop in [Skirk Drill Sergeant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skirk+Drill+Sergeant), while Nakamura summoned [Sparksmith](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sparksmith). Blume charged straight ahead, attacking for two and playing [Goblin Taskmaster](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Taskmaster). [Sparksmith](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sparksmith) shot down the Sergeant, and Nakamura played [Goblin Sledder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Sledder). It blocked and traded with the Taskmaster, leaving [Sparksmith](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sparksmith) as the lone Goblin. It seemed that [Ascending Aven](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ascending+Aven) might be safe, but Nakamura had [Skirk Outrider](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skirk+Outrider), and shot down the flyer. [Keeneye Aven](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Keeneye+Aven) would be able to survive, however, as would [Warped Researcher](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Warped+Researcher). [Glowering Rogon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glowering+Rogon) came out as merely a 4/4, but it did make the Outrider big enough to get through for damage. The Aven attacked through the sky for two damage, and was joined by [Mistform Stalker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mistform+Stalker).

The Outrider and Rogon attacked- [Warped Researcher](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Warped+Researcher) and [Mistform Stalker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mistform+Stalker) ganged up on the beast. [Sparksmith](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sparksmith) shot the Stalker, and the Researcher died. [Goblin Clearcutter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Clearcutter) gave Nakamura even more of an advantage on the board, as he had plenty of big creatures while Blume had only [Keeneye Aven](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Keeneye+Aven). A turn later, Blume conceded.

Blume- 0 Nakamura- 1

### Game 2

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/ptyok03/a900.jpg)Blume started with a Taskmaster, which Nakamura matched with [Patron of the Wild](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Patron+of+the+Wild)- a trade occurred immediately. [Sparksmith](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sparksmith) came out once again, but this time Blume was ready with [Erratic Explosion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Erratic+Explosion) to deal with it. Both players summoned morph creatures, and Nakamura's was enchanted with [Crown of Fury](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crown+of+Fury) and attacked for three damage. Blume's attacked and flipped over to reveal [Skirk Commando](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skirk+Commando), killing Nakamura's morph, which happened to be [Skirk Commando](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skirk+Commando) as well.

Blume's Commando traded with Nakamura's morph creature on the next attack ([Patron of the Wild](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Patron+of+the+Wild)), and [Screaming Seahawk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Screaming+Seahawk) put the German ahead. Nakamura cycled [Krosan Tusker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Krosan+Tusker), Blume attacked with the Seahawk, and followed up with a morph creature along with a [Sparksmith](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sparksmith) of his own.

[Treespring Lorian](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treespring+Lorian) gave Nakamura a lone, fat creature on the ground, but Blume had his air assault at full power. The Seahawk attacked once again, and was joined by [Mistform Stalker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mistform+Stalker) and [Ascending Aven](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ascending+Aven). [Snarling Undorak](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snarling+Undorak) made Nakamura's pressure on the ground better, and [Erratic Explosion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Erratic+Explosion) slowed down the beats by killing [Ascending Aven](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ascending+Aven). Blume's team attacked and the Undorak blocked the Stalker, which became a Goblin to power the [Sparksmith](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sparksmith) enough to force a trade. The Lorian attacked back for five, and [Skirk Outrider](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skirk+Outrider) came out to hold down defense. Blume attacked with all his creatures, and the Outrider blocked a morph creature. After damage went on the stack, it flipped up to reveal [Echo Tracer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Echo+Tracer), which bounced back the beast and caused the Outrider to die. [Keeneye Aven](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Keeneye+Aven) added to Blume's already impressive board. Nakamura had nothing but lands out, and it was on to Game 3.

Blume- 1 Nakamura- 1

### Game 3

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/ptyok03/a898.jpg)Nakamura started off with a Sledder, and Blume played a Drill Sergeant. A trade occurred when Nakamura attacked, and his morph ([Serpentine Basilisk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Serpentine+Basilisk)) died to [Chain of Plasma](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chain+of+Plasma). Nakamura played an Outrider on turn four, while Blume missed his fourth land drop (and had only mountains), and simply played a morph creature. [Shaleskin Plower](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shaleskin+Plower) hit the board face up to make the Outrider 4/4, and it attacked for damage.

Blume finally drew a fourth land and a blue source, but was disappointed since it was a [Lonely Sandbar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lonely+Sandbar). His morph ([Ascending Aven](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ascending+Aven)) traded with [Shaleskin Plower](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shaleskin+Plower), while Nakamura had a 4/4 Rogon to keep his Outrider big and swinging. [Erratic Explosion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Erratic+Explosion) killed Blume's morph ([Mistform Seaswift](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mistform+Seaswift)), clearing the way for an attack. Facing an impossible board position to recover from, Blume conceded.

**Final Result:** Blume- 1 Nakamura- 2
