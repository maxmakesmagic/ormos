**Card of the Day - mercredi 31 juillet 2002**


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Tidal%20Visionary)#### Tidal Visionary


*Invasion* common.  
The reason it looks like a Merfolk was that it was designed to be a Merfolk. But after playtesting, R&D decided that the Merfolk deck didn't need one-cost creatures with a moderately useful ability. So the creature type was switched to Wizard to push it out from under cards like Lord of Atlantis.


**Card of the Day - mardi 30 juillet 2002**


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Phantom%20Nomad)#### Phantom Nomad


*Judgment* common.  
This card was originally supposed to be Phantom Hound, the dead version of Patrol Hound. But art problems, and difficulty in finding a name that didn't seem too silly, prompted its alteration into a departed nomad.


**Card of the Day - lundi 29 juillet 2002**


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Rout)#### Rout


*Invasion* rare.  
See that castle burning in the background? That's Capashen Manor, Gerrard's family home, that's being razed. Since Yawgmoth knew that Gerrard was part of Urza's plan to defeat him, Gerrard's home of Benalia was one of the first to fall in the invasion.


**Card of the Day - vendredi 26 juillet 2002**


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Dromosaur)#### Dromosaur


*Urza's Saga* common.  
Dromosaur is an exact reprint of *Visions'* Raging Gorilla, but it was reconcepted as a lizard. Gorillas were not prominent during the Urza block, but lizards (mainly the Viashino) were.


**Card of the Day - jeudi 25 juillet 2002**


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Reverent%20Mantra)#### Reverent Mantra


*Mercadian Masques* rare.  
The original name for Reverent Mantra was "Communion," but that carried some unnecessary religious baggage.


**Card of the Day - mercredi 24 juillet 2002**


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Squirrel%20Mob)#### Squirrel Mob


*Odyssey* rare.  
Squirrel Mob originally received a bonus for each other token creature, but it was changed to only squirrels for flavor reasons.


**Card of the Day - mardi 23 juillet 2002**


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Forsaken%20Wastes)#### Forsaken Wastes


*Mirage* rare.  
Forsaken Wastes was almost the first non-creature card to have protection from a color. It was slated to have protection from white, but the rules team decided against it, and replaced it with the "lose five life" clause.


**Card of the Day - lundi 22 juillet 2002**


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Morphling)#### Morphling


*Urza's Saga* rare.  
Morphling was originally designed to be an update on Clone. But the rules surrounding cards that copy other cards we're really messy back then, so they took a new approach: cram tons of abilities onto it. That way, it can sort of copy things by altering itself every turn. Or just be the best creature ever.


**Card of the Day - vendredi 19 juillet 2002**


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Boiling%20Blood)#### Boiling Blood


*Weatherlight* common.  
Pre-*Weatherlight*, all "cantrips" instructed the player to draw a card "at the beginning of the next turn's upkeep." Because of the confusion that arose from forgetting to draw the card at the right time, the cantrip ability was changed to "draw a card (right now)". For a while, the new cantrips were nicknamed "fast-trips", but the vernacular has reverted back to "cantrip" since.


**Card of the Day - jeudi 18 juillet 2002**


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Thought%20Lash)#### Thought Lash


*Alliances* rare.  
Before there was Battle of Wits, there was Thought Lash. This blue enchantment encouraged the use of large decks because it could prevent damage at the cost of one card per point. Decks of well over 100 cards saw tournament play when this card was legal in Standard.


**Card of the Day - mercredi 17 juillet 2002**


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Sedge%20Troll)#### Sedge Troll

Alpha rare.  
Although used often now, off-color activation costs were once almost non-existent. Sedge Troll from Alpha was the first; another wasn't printed until *The Dark*.


**Card of the Day - mardi 16 juillet 2002**


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Timberland%20Ruins)#### Timberland Ruins


*Odyssey* common.  
Timberland Ruins was originally called "Elven Ruins" to hammer home the point that elves would not be appearing in the *Odyssey* block. But the creative team decided that was a little too harsh, and didn't want to convey the idea that elves were dead forever.


**Card of the Day - lundi 15 juillet 2002**


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Lightning%20Surge)#### Lightning Surge


*Judgment* rare.  
Called "Hot Damage" for most of playtesting, Lightning Surge was the victim of some last-second changes. Its mana cost was 2RR and its flashback 4RR for a long time, but the numbers were bumped up when red burn started dominating the FFL.


**Card of the Day - vendredi 12 juillet 2002**


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Sky%20Weaver)#### Sky Weaver


*Invasion* uncommon.  
When cycles are made, some colors get to "bend the rules" a little bit. Blue doesn't normally get 2-power creatures for 2 mana with no drawback, but since a cycle of such creatures was created, blue was allowed to have one.


**Card of the Day - jeudi 11 juillet 2002**


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Darkness)#### Darkness


*Legends* common.  
Occasionally a set's development team breaks up a cycle. The *Legends* designers decided "Fog" shouldn't be confined to green, and created a one-mana instant "Fog" card in every color. The development team killed the red and blue versions and didn't reprint the green one since it was in the base set. The white one (Holy Day) and black one survived.


**Card of the Day - mercredi 10 juillet 2002**


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Serra's%20Embrace)#### Serra's Embrace


*Seventh Edition* uncommon.  
Sometimes one piece of a cycle breaks free and is put into the base set because it stands up well on its own. Serra's Embrace, part of an cycle of 4-mana creature enchantments in *Urza's Saga*, is one such card.


**Card of the Day - mardi 9 juillet 2002**


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Tolaria)#### Tolaria


*Legends* uncommon.  
Everyone is aware of the power of the legendary land Tolarian Academy from *Urza's Saga*; it is the most degenerate of a cycle of very good cards, including Gaea's Cradle and Phyrexian Tower. Its namesake, however, is just the opposite. Tolaria is the weakest of a cycle of mediocre legendary lands from *Legends*, upstaged by Pendelhaven and Karakas, among others.


**Card of the Day - lundi 8 juillet 2002**


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Vigorous%20Charge)#### Vigorous Charge


*Invasion* common.  
Some cards are part of very subtle cycles. Vigorous Charge is one card in a cycle of *Invasion* common spells with kickers of the clockwise allied color on the wheel. The other four cards in the cycle are Dismantling Blow, Probe, Agonizing Demise, and Savage Offensive.


**Card of the Day - vendredi 5 juillet 2002**


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Soulgorger%20Orgg)#### Soulgorger Orgg


*Judgment* uncommon.  
The original *Fallen Empires* Orgg had creature type "Orgg," while Trained Orgg in *Seventh Edition* had creature type "Beast." Soulgorger Orgg returns to "Orgg," since R&D feels it's a cool, iconic creature type that deserves its own name.


**Card of the Day - jeudi 4 juillet 2002**


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Lightning%20Angel)#### Lightning Angel


*Apocalypse* rare.  
Lightning Angel is the only card that is only red, white, and blue, and has garnered the nickname "Miss America". Happy Fourth of July!


**Card of the Day - mercredi 3 juillet 2002**


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Eladamri,%20Lord%20of%20Leaves)#### Eladamri, Lord of Leaves


*Tempest* rare.  
Eladamri is "Irma Dale" backwards. Irma and Dale are the parents of Mike Ryan, a former employee that was the story manager during the *Tempest* block.


**Card of the Day - mardi 2 juillet 2002**


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Mist%20of%20Stagnation)#### Mist of Stagnation


*Judgment* rare.  
Rules clarification: You can untap any permanents, not just ones that you control. And you must untap as many permanents as you can. So, if the cards in your graveyard outnumber the permanents you control, you must untap some of your opponent's permanents. You choose which ones to untap. You can untap permanents that are not tapped, and you can also untap enchantments.


**Card of the Day - lundi 1 juillet 2002**


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Griffin%20Canyon)#### Griffin Canyon


*Visions* rare.  
In some strange burst of synchronicity, Griffin Canyon was assigned to the artist Stuart Griffin. No, Kev Walker did not illustrate Phyrexian Walker.
