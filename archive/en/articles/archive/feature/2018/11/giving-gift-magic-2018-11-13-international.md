Giving the Gift of Magic in 2018
================================

 Stybs has played Magic the world over, writing and drafting as part of the event coverage team and slinging Commander everywhere his decks will fit. 






*Magic* is a pretty incredible game. While there's 25 years of history, tournaments, players, and cards to discover, there's just one reason the game has grown leaps and bounds since its 1993 beginning: you.

If you're just discovering *Magic*, the odds are good a friend familiar with the game made the introduction, perhaps at [your local game store](http://locator.wizards.com/) or through the [*MTG Arena* Open Beta](https://magic.wizards.com/en/mtgarena). If you've been playing *Magic* for a while, it's not only likely a friend made the connection first, but you too have probably shared *Magic* with someone new as well.


Giving the gift of *Magic* is natural since it's the greatest game there is. Fortunately, there are a ton of options around to share the game with anyone.


For Introducing Friends to *Magic*
==================================


While [*Magic*  Open House events](https://magic.wizards.com/en/event-types/magic-open-house) are perfect for making an in-store introduction to the game, they aren't available all the time. But local stores also carry an out-of-the-box way to start a game.


![<em>Magic: The Gathering</em> Spellslinger Starter Kit (2018)](https://media.wizards.com/2018/images/daily/coMWUMtMwr.png)


The Spellslinger Starter Kit is two decks, two spindown life counters, two 60-card Standard-legal decks, and instructions on how to start playing *Magic*. Teaching the game is easier when the decks are set and designed to do that, but handing this off for a friend to try on their own terms makes this even better. Some players really want to learn on their own before playing a "real" match!


![<em>Core Set 2019</em> Deck Builder's Toolkit](https://media.wizards.com/2018/images/daily/bEsoCqutTi.png)


Of course, changing decks and storing cards goes hand in hand with *Magic* too, so the *Core Set 2019* Deck Builder's Toolkit is the obvious companion gift to the Starter Kit. New cards to try in their two decks *plus* a convenient box to hold it all makes *Magic* portable and easy to store. Looking over a deck and making your first changes is a fond memory for everyone who learns *Magic*, which is what makes this toolkit perfect for newer players.


![<em>Guilds of Ravnica </em>Planeswalker Decks](https://media.wizards.com/2018/images/daily/p5q3f0G1mH.png)


Planeswalkers aren't *just* characters in *Magic*—they're also among the most exciting cards to use. The right planeswalker card can turn the tide of battle and decisively take over a game. Planeswalker Decks, such as the two from *Guilds of Ravnica* featuring Vraska and Ral, are great pick-ups for showing *Magic* to someone, and they're also a pair of decks ready to play against each other. Like the Spellslinger Starter Kit, you can use these two decks together to teach and practice *Magic* rules. Unlike the Spellslinger Starter Kit, these two decks take the power up a notch and offer exclusive versions of powerful Planeswalkers.


Who wouldn't want to tap into the power of allies across the Multiverse?


For Introducing *Magic* to the Friend Who Plays *Dungeons & Dragons*
====================================================================


If you're around a local game store, you might be more familiar with friends who roll dice rather than play cards all night. The popularity of [*Dungeons & Dragons*](http://dnd.wizards.com/) as a roleplaying game means there are always folks looking for a new story to tell.


![<em>Guildmasters' Guide to Ravnica</em>](https://media.wizards.com/2018/images/daily/fqjDCcYr4I.png)


The [upcoming *Guildmasters' Guide to Ravnica*](http://dnd.wizards.com/products/tabletop-games/rpg-products/guildmasters-guide-ravnica) is one way to introduce *Magic* without it being exclusively about the cards. While knowing *Magic* is helpful, the plane of Ravnica is an incredible city to explore, filled with stores to be told. If you're a dungeon master yourself, telling a one-shot tale taking players from the Tin Street Market into Bane Alley and beyond sets up *Guilds of Ravnica* as a way to continue the Ravnica adventure in *Magic*.


![<em>Magic: The Gathering</em> Game Night](https://media.wizards.com/2018/images/daily/HNJSJDrDXn.png)


Of course, the flip side of the coin is what to do if the dungeon master (or enough player characters) can't make a session: *Magic: The Gathering* Game Night. Game Night is the *Magic* version of a one-shot adventure into spellslinging, each player getting a premade deck, life counter, and rules reference, then playing together. Of course, the goal here is to eliminate your opponents rather than being cooperative, but as a break from being a party, it can be good to get the murderous urge out without affecting the campaign.


And if you wanted to take it to the next level, everyone could choose to keep and update their deck for another showdown later. Characters do hold grudges from time to time . . .


For the Friend Who Plays Less Than You Do
=========================================


Every *Magic* player plays the game at their own pace. Sometimes, they take off full speed into Commander or Standard or Modern or Draft. But some of your friends might be into playing in Prereleases and catching a few lower-stakes games in between. *Magic* friends might even play totally different than you do, but that doesn't mean there isn't something for them.


![<em>Commander (2018 Edition)</em> decks](https://media.wizards.com/2018/images/daily/P8Gxrmp7oS.png)


![<em>Guilds of Ravnica </em>Theme Booster](https://media.wizards.com/2018/images/daily/fdTmRWsDZ2.png)


*Commander (2018 Edition)* decks and *Guilds of Ravnica* Theme Boosters look quite different at a glance, but they're perfect when you know a little bit about the player you're giving to. If you know they enjoy Commander every now and then, it's hard to go wrong with the reprints and new cards they can use in a Commander deck they don't yet have. And if smaller decks are their thing, a Theme Booster for their favorite color gives them a taste of the newest set focused on the cards they're most likely to love.


![<em>Guilds of Ravnica</em> Bundle](https://media.wizards.com/2018/images/daily/3ea5ghnslU.png)


A *Guilds of Ravnica* bundle is a pile of booster packs plus a life counter, storage box, and lands—all excellent tools for someone to continue exploring *Magic* on their own terms. Catching up on the latest set with a guide and enough boosters to open for fun makes this an easy way to keep the *Magic* going.


![<em>Magic: The Gathering</em> Gift Pack](https://media.wizards.com/2018/images/daily/EGtWjYBiYj.png)


If a bundle is a bit overwhelming, the Gift Pack might be a better fit. Instead of *Guilds of Ravnica* booster packs, it's *Core Set 2019*, filled with flavorful *Magic* fantasy. And instead of more storage, it's a few exclusive cards found nowhere else. Adding *Magic* intrigue for a friend who already has some collection and storage is what makes the Gift Pack stand out.


For the Friend Who Plays *More* Than You
========================================


Maybe you're not the biggest *Magic* player—or not even a player at all!—but you have a friend or family member who is. Someone who knows all the guild names, talks about going to Friday Night *Magic*, and seems to have more cards than you could ever imagine needing.


![](https://media.wizards.com/2018/images/daily/7BPKHqojQe.png)![](https://media.wizards.com/2018/images/daily/5InuC7ozKW.png)


*Dominaria* and *Guilds of Ravnica* booster packs are a go-to for any invested *Magic* player. Whether it's practicing Draft or the simple joy of opening new cards, a booster pack is pretty perfect as a gift of any size. Plus, they're among the easiest bits of *Magic* to find anywhere you shop.


![<em>Guilds of Ravnica</em> Guild Kit](https://media.wizards.com/2018/images/daily/LEcBRkU2Sk.png)


![<em>Guilds of Ravnica</em> Guild Kit](https://media.wizards.com/2018/images/daily/mK1DhkUSXT.png)


And if you happen to know your friend's favorite guild, the Guild Kits available at their local game store are [packed with new and old cards they can use in a variety of ways](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/how-build/getting-kitted-out-guilds-kits-2018-11-02). Powering up their Commander deck, adding to their Modern staples, or even just showing off a fun card they totally forgot about from years ago makes each Guild Kit a trip through Ravnica history for your friend—even if you're not familiar with any of that yourself.


Of course, if your friend plays enough to have a favorite guild, then they probably want to protect their powerful decks with sleeves and deck boxes. Ultra PRO® puts both together by offering sleeves and deck boxes for all ten guilds on Ravnica, and you'll find even more official *Magic* accessories in your local game store. From playmats to sleeves to even bigger cases, binders, and storage for cards, a large *Magic* collection can always be better organized and better protected.


![<em>Ultimate Masters </em>Booster Packs](https://media.wizards.com/2018/images/daily/XYTRpvnnXu.png)


![<em>Ultimate Masters </em>Blisterpack](https://media.wizards.com/2018/images/daily/GNzAUXXfcQ.png)


For perhaps the ultimate gift a *Magic* player can get this year, look no further than the recently announced *Ultimate Masters* set. Packed with powerful cards across *Magic*'s history, *Ultimate Masters* promises to be the ultimate celebration to end the year.


A few booster packs will go a long way, and whether it's from your local game store or the big box store, it's worth noting that a good friend will give *Magic*, but the ultimate friend will give *Ultimate Masters*. (And I hope my friends are reading this!)


Gathering *Magic: The Gathering*
================================


As always, the best place to start your hunt for amazing *Magic* gifts is at [your local game store](http://locator.wizards.com/). While you should keep an eye out for *Magic* wherever it appears, local game stores will always have the best selection and knowledge to ensure you get the right gift for your *Magic* friend.


Through the end of the year and well into 2019, your friends near and far will appreciate the right *Magic* landing in their hands. Happy gifting!
