The Red deck... It's the ire of many, and the weapon of choice for few. In most formats, the Red deck is a fringe entity, something that can steal wins from anyone, but rarely a serious contender. This Standard is strange, though. The last two major Standard events were won in convincing fashion by two very different Red strategies. Over the last week, we've seen three distinct Red archetypes emerge as real contenders. Let's take a look at the hottest Red deck that showed up in Chicago this weekend.


**Hyper Aggro "Boss Sligh"**


The most aggressive variant of the Red deck is a relative newcomer to the mainstream. Tom "The Boss" Ross has been advocating the deck for months, but it failed to garnish the respect it deserved until last weekend when Ross used it to win the StarCityGames Invitational in convincing fashion. The deck plays twenty one-mana creatures, meaning that it's going to hit the ground running faster than any other deck in the format. It's common for the deck to have three bodies in play before the opponent plays their second land. The other creature decks find themselves too far behind to contend while the control strategies struggle to make it to the fourth turn where they can cast [Supreme Verdict](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Supreme+Verdict) and stabilize. Ross was able to catch the Standard format off-guard last weekend with this brutally aggressive brew, but will players have adapted for this weekend's Grand Prix?
