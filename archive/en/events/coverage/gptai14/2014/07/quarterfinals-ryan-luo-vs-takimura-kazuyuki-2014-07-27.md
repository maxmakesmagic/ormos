Game 1


Luo curved out perfectly, putting a duo of [Welkin Tern](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Welkin+Tern)s, [Aeronaut Tinkerer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aeronaut+Tinkerer) and [Razorfoot Griffin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Razorfoot+Griffin) on the board. Kazuyuki tried to defend with [Raise the Alarm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Raise+the+Alarm), [Sungrace Pegasus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sungrace+Pegasus) and [Wall of Essence](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wall+of+Essence), after destroying [Rogue's Gloves](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rogue%27s+Gloves) with [Solemn Offering](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Solemn+Offering).

However Luo drew into a second [Rogue's Gloves](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rogue%27s+Gloves) and attacked with his entire force. On the next turn, [Void Snare](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Void+Snare) on Kazuyuki's lone flyer prompted him to scoop up his cards.

Game 2


Both player's first flyers clashed in the air, but it was Kazuyuki's [Sungrace Pegasus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sungrace+Pegasus) which survived the fight against [Welkin Tern](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Welkin+Tern), thanks to [Necrobite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Necrobite). Luo was unfazed and replenished with two [Aeronaut Tinkerer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aeronaut+Tinkerer)s, [Razorfoot Griffin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Razorfoot+Griffin) and [Oreskos Swiftclaw](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oreskos+Swiftclaw).


It would seem that Kazuyuki was in danger, but [Wall of Essence](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wall+of+Essence) and [Triplicate Spirits](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Triplicate+Spirits) mounted an impressive defense. At least it looked that way...

... until Luo tapped down [Wall of Essence](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wall+of+Essence) with [Frost Lynx](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Frost+Lynx) and added [Rogue's Gloves](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rogue%27s+Gloves) to his board, giving both his [Aeronaut Tinkerer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aeronaut+Tinkerer)s flying. This attack prompted Kazuyuki to block [Oreskos Swiftclaw](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oreskos+Swiftclaw) with a token he left back, but still lost 6 life from this all out attack.



[Solemn Offering](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Solemn+Offering) dealt with [Rogue's Gloves](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rogue%27s+Gloves), but Luo was ready with [Master of Predicaments](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Master+of+Predicaments). Guessing "lower" when the sphinx hit him, Kazuyuki allowed [Raise the Alarm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Raise+the+Alarm) to be cast for free. Next turn, Luo peeled [Peel from Reality](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Peel+from+Reality) from the top of his deck, returning his own [Frost Lynx](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Frost+Lynx) and an opposing flying, resummoning the [Frost Lynx](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Frost+Lynx) to tap down [Wall of Essence](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wall+of+Essence) for the win.


"Hey, I peeled a peel!"
