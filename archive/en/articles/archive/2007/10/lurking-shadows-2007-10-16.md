**Magic** art often tells a story, and sometimes you can tell more about what's going on in the story by what's looming in the background than by what's front and center. Tricks of light and shadow often put clues of subtle truth into **Magic** art, and almost always creates a fun Easter egg for the attentive art appreciator.


[Nath's Buffoon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nath%27s+Buffoon) from *Lorwyn* is a boggart in the employ of Nath, the imperious elf. The art shows the shadow of his elf master.

The card [Sleeper Agent](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sleeper+Agent) looks like a human woman, but her shadow shows that she's actually a minion of Phyrexia.

Check out the art of [Summoner's Pact](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Summoner%27s+Pact). We don't see the creature summoned by the green-aligned mage, but we certainly see its shadow. Usul has called a big one.

*Time Spiral's* [Divine Congregation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Divine+Congregation) shows a circular time rift. Through the center of it, we see the shadows of a group of aven who have gathered together there, to join in the congregation (the card is a suspend riff on [Congregate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Congregate)).
