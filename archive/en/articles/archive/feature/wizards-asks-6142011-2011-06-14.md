*Which of the five [**Magic: The Gathering** Commander decks](http://www.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/arcana/732) is your favorite?*

They're all awesome, and I certainly plan on getting all five. Unsurprisingly, the two that call to me the most are the two that contain green and blue, my favorite two-color combination: the green-blue-black "Devour for Power" deck and the blue-red-green "Mirror Mastery" deck.

"Devour for Power" has two amazing three-color commanders: The Mimeoplasm and Damia, Sage of Stone. But ultimately I've got to hand it to "Mirror Mastery." Riku of Two Reflections feels like it was designed for me specifically (it wasn't); Edric, Spymaster of Trest is both an attack deterrent and a card-draw engine; Animar, Soul of Elements is weird, but *extremely* silly when he (it?) builds up steam. Collective Voyage has already proven its mettle in one of the few games I've gotten to play with the new cards, searching up five lands on turn three and catapulting us straight into the Awesome Stuff Happens stage of the game. And Hydra Omnivore might just be the dumbest thing ever. Pile in all the great reprints, many of which are especially good when copied with Riku, and you've got a hundred cards that I can't wait to shuffle up come this weekend's Launch Parties!
