**OCTOBER EPISODE**


* The tables are turned on Randy Buehler when special guest Brian David-Marshall takes over the microphone, putting Randy on the hot seat. The two longtime **Magic** players discuss *Time Spiral*'s nostalgia-triggering cards, the state of **Magic** and Wizards of the Coast, Randy's changing role in the game and company, and word of a new digital game on the 2007 horizon codenamed "The Goblin Game."
* *Time Spiral* has hit the shelves, so it's time to see what impact it will have on the metagame. R&D members Aaron Forsythe and Devin Low look at the refreshed Limited and Constructed formats, highlighting overlooked cards, the differences in drafting *Ravnica* and *Time Spiral*, and much more.
* This Month in **Magic** showcases the upcoming events, and there are some big ones. [Pro Tour-Kobe](http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=mtgcom/events/protour?x=protour/kobe06/facts) is only a week away -- if you're hankering to see how the Pros draft the set, you won't want to miss it. Then on October 28, Time Spiral explodes on the Standard scene at [Champs](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/TCG/Events.aspx?x=events/magic/champs). Included in the enhanced iTunes podcast is your first look at the special-frame participation and prize cards **Urza's Factory and **Serra Avenger.****
