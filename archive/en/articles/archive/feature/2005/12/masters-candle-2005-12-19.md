***Magicthegathering.com** is running "best of" content during the holidays, and will return with new content January 4, 2006. This Magic Arcana originally ran January 13, 2005.*


Tallowisp (a *Betrayers* card **[previewed today](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/daily/mg158)** by Mark Gottlieb) is the spirit of a candle's flame. According to the art description provided to Ron Spears, it once lit the scrolls and tomes of the legendary kitsune wizard, [Autumn-Tail, Kitsune Sage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Autumn-Tail%2C+Kitsune+Sage), as indicated by the scrolls in [Tallowisp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tallowisp)'s art. In addition, the shape of [Tallowisp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tallowisp)'s flames are intended reflect the shape of a kitsune's ears.

Of course, [Tallowisp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tallowisp) probably only helped [Autumn-Tail](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Autumn-Tail) *before* the kami went to war with the mortals. It looks a bit angrier now than the quiet tapers shown in the art of [Kitsune Mystic](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kitsune+Mystic).
