It's a weekend for parties! If you're anywhere near Seattle, you should try to make it to PAX Prime. And if you're anywhere near Amsterdam, you should try to make it to Pro Tour–Amsterdam. Both events are going to have puzzle hunts, followed by big, **Magic**-themed parties, in which the mysteries of *Scars of Mirrodin* will start to be revealed.


Of course, we've mentioned this before (in [this Arcana](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/arcana/518)). But it bears mentioning again, don't you think? It's the **Magic** social event of the season!


Of course, the parties aren't the only reason to stop by PAX Prime or the Pro Tour. Let's run it down.


### PAX Prime


Cascade Games is running a [huge list of tournaments](http://www.cascadegames.com/events/819). Prizes include uncut sheets and full foil sets. And there will probably be something cool to do at the Wizards of the Coast booth. Oh, and the party!


PAX will be crawling with Wizards of the Coast employees (not literally crawling, you understand), so keep an eye out for Mark Rosewater, Aaron Forsythe, Monty Ashley, and more!


### Pro Tour–Amsterdam


Meanwhile, over in Europe, there are even more tournaments! [The complete list](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/protour/amsterdam10-public#schedule) has more details. Hence the word "complete." And both [rk post and Igor Kieryluk](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/TCG/Events.aspx?x=mtgcom/protour/amsterdam10-artists) will be signing their artwork. And, again, there will be the big party on Saturday!


Pretty much everyone who's not going to PAX is going to be at Amsterdam. Mark Gottlieib, Dave Guskin, Kelly Digges, and more will be roaming around. Find one and say hello! It's good luck, you know.
