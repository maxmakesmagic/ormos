KHANS OF TARKIR SUNDAY CHALLENGE ROUNDUP

 A longtime member of the Pro Tour and Grand Prix coverage staff, Nate Price now works making beautiful words for all of you lovely people as the community manager for organized play. When not covering events, he lords over the @MagicProTour Twitter account, ruling with an iron fist. 





This is the beginning of the end.


The eight players of the Community Cup have inscribed their names into the annals of history.


Björn Andreasson. Paul Cheon. Scott MacCallum. Erin Campbell. Mariah Pagliocco. Sean Plott. Tom Ross. Frank Lepore.


Champions all.


The bonds they had forged over a weekend of tumultuous battle were ironclad and unbreakable. That is until someone waved a booster pack of *Khans of Tarkir* under their noses! Where once stood compatriots now stood bitter enemies. The fight for supremacy of the clans had begun!


Each player was assigned a pick order based on their record from the previous two days of play. Then, they selected a clan to which they pledged their allegiance. But the clans are fickle, and no more than two players were admitted to any one clan. Both Paul Cheon and Scott MacCallum quickly pledged allegiance to the bear-punching Temur clan. Up next, Tom Ross conceded that Sidisi of the Sultai was, in fact, the boss. Sean “Day[9]” Plott followed that up by being the first to pledge himself for the undying sands of the Abzan. Erin Campbell and Mariah Pagliocco rounded out the Sultai and Abzan ranks, leaving Frank Lepore and Björn Andreasson to represent the Jeskai and Mardu respectively.


With battle lines drawn, the eight champions set about crafting their weapons for the upcoming battle.

Nearly all noticed the embarrassment of mana fixing that exists in *Khans of Tarkir* Sealed Deck. With all of the multicolored lands and banners in the Sealed Pools, many players opted to stray from a strict clan allegiance, dipping into fourth and even fifth colors. One player who was not swayed by the enticements of another clan was Day[9], the sassiest magician.

As he explained, “With all of the pretty colors and lands people have, they’re trying to play four or five colors, and their decks can be a little slow. My deck is straightforward and aggressive… If anyone stumbles with their slow, pretty decks, I’ll crush their faces.”


His fellow Abzanite (the obvious demonym for Abzan), Mariah #TeamPanda Pagliocco, was less pleased with her concoction than her compatriot Day[9].

On the more insidious side of things, Tom Ross set about advancing the machinations of the avaricious Sultai brood.

One of the players that opted for a bit of a departure from his clan’s base intentions was Scotty Mac and his tenuous connection to Temur.

His fellow Temurian (again, the obvious demonym), Paul Cheon, opted for a stricter definition of savagery.

The lone clan representatives, Frank Lepore of the Jeskai and Björn Andreasson of the Mardu, seemed quite proud of their accomplishments.

With weapons chosen, the fight began! Andreasson and his Mardu horde made very short work of Paul Cheon and his unresponsive Temur frontier. Andreasson was one bear who refused to be punched.

In the next quarterfinal, control of the Sultai Brood came down to a fight between Tom Ross and Erin Campbell. This match was all about Ross’s Sultai Ascendancy, allowing him to fill his graveyard and select his draws. As Randy Buehler put it, “The most interesting thing for me was that we really got to see how important the delve mechanic is to Sultai decks, and how they are able to really make the mechanic work.” In the end, Boss was able ascend over Campbell, carrying the Sultai banner into the next round.


The match that followed pitted the two Abzan players against one another.

In the end, #TeamSassySocks’s highly aggressive version of Abzan was able to outpressure #TeamPanda’s more controlling one, sending Day[9] to the next round.


The final match of the Quarterfinals found Frank Lepore of the Jeskai Way facing off against Scotty Mac of the expanded Temur Frontier.

Frank Lepore couldn’t come up with the tools needed to stop MacCallum’s Temur Frontier from expanding, sowing salt as he fell by the wayside.

With all of the quarterfinals finished, only Jeskai would remain unrepresented. Up first, Andreasson and Ross began the next round of play.

Perhaps the finest moment in this match came in the closing seconds of the second game. Ross held a supreme advantage, but Andreasson crafted a perfect line for him to find a way to win. [Act of Treason](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Act+of+Treason) stole one of Ross’s biggest attackers, and he swung in, hoping things would work out in his favor. Ross blocked in such a way that would keep his blockers alive…leaving the door open for [Trumpet Blast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Trumpet+Blast) to finish him off with exact damage! To make matters worse, Ross had opted to not play the Dismal Backwater on his turn, a decision that turned Andreasson’s attack into exactly enough damage to be lethal!

Scott MacCallum and Sean Plott were the final players attempting to earn a spot in the Finals. Scotty Mac’s deck was a five-color monstrosity, filled with powerful cards…

While Plott’s was straightforward and “smashy”. In the end, Plott’s aggressive Abzan deck was able to take out the prismatic powerhouse Scotty Mac brought to bear.

Mardu was the last pick, a clan *forced* upon Andreasson, yet here he was, happily in the finals. His deck was highly aggressive, featuring one of the finest morphs in the format.

However Andreasson was able to fight back thanks to his impressive Scandinavian musical prowess.

Overcoming his fear, Plott was able to outwit, and more importantly *outlast*, Andreasson’s aggressive Mardu Horde, winning the *Khans of Tarkir* Sunday Challenge for the Abzan Houses!
