You make the Duel Deck!

Wizards of the Coast is going to release a *Duel Decks* product on **Magic Online** called "*Mirrodin Pure vs. New Phyrexia*." As you might remember, one of those two is the name of "Action," the third set in *Scars of Mirrodin* block. But this isn't about that. It's about your chance to submit a deck list that will be used in *Duel Decks: Mirrodin Pure vs. New Phyrexia*.

The full details are available [in the contest announcement](http://community.wizards.com/go/thread/view/75846/26875685/MIRRODIN_PURE_VS._NEW_PHYREXIA_DUEL_DECKS_CONTEST), but here are the most important details:

* You can submit up to one deck for each side.
* Each deck must be 60 cards.
* The *Mirrodin Pure* deck will be based on [Platinum Angel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Platinum+Angel) and the *New Phyrexia* deck will be based on [Phyrexian Plaguelord](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phyrexian+Plaguelord). These are the only mythic rares allowed.
* No opposite-faction cards are allowed.
* Each deck should have 4-8 rare cards and 20-28 land cards.
* Include a 250-word explanation of the deck.

The deadline is 11:59 p.m. (PST) on February 13, 2011. Go read the [full details](http://community.wizards.com/go/thread/view/75846/26875685/MIRRODIN_PURE_VS._NEW_PHYREXIA_DUEL_DECKS_CONTEST) and [official rules](http://www.wizards.com/company/downloads/mtgo_build_a_deck_contest.pdf) and get to work!
