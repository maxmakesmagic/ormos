The youngest player invited to the 2013 **Magic** World Championship, Shahar Shenhar has an incredibly bright future ahead of him if the results of his fairly young career are anything to judge by. Of all of the players invited to the World Championship, Shenhar has the highest career win percentage. He has a trio of Grand Prix wins already in his career, all earned with only five Grand Prix Top 8s. He has one of the highest median finishes of any player in the game, and all of this has happened before his 20th birthday!


Playing competitive **Magic** since the first time he held a card, Shenhar has moved quickly up through the professional ranks. Now traveling full time for **Magic**, it is rare to attend a Grand Prix these days and not see Shenhar in attendance. In fact, he has spent more time traveling for **Magic** than at his home in Israel over the last year.


This diligence has paid off though, as recently as Grand Prix Houston, where Shenhar made it look easy, defeating even the mighty Hall of Famer Shuhei Nakamura on his way to the title. Thanks to his success, Shenhar has fallen in and become good friends with many of the other top pros in the game today. This is a busy weekend for him, as he will be doing his part to represent Israel as the top player in the country in the World **Magic** Cup as well. Still, if Shenhar has proven anything, he can handle the pressure despite his young age.
