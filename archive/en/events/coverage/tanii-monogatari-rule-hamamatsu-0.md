GRAND PRIX HAMAMATSU 2006
-------------------------


Tanii Monogatari Rule Hamamatsu!
================================




April 7-9












[日本語の取材へ](/en/node/556846)


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gphama06/champ.jpg)When you come to a Constructed Grand Prix in Japan, you expect a couple of things to be true. First, you expect that there will be some crazy decks in the field that come out of nowhere and do surprisingly well. Second, you expect a host of Japanese stars to battle it out for spots in the elimination rounds, and third, you expect a big name to walk away with the title. Just look at the 2005 season, where the Grand Prix here were won by legendary team P.S.2, Akira Asahara, Katsuhiro Mori, and Tomohiro Kaji.


Only one of those expectations came true this weekend. Asahara was the only name listed above to make it to Day 2, while players like Masashi Oiso, Tsuyoshi Fujita, and even Player of the Year Kenji Tsumura were left on the sidelines to cheer Asahara and his relatively unknown teammates Masay Kitayama and Shouta Yasooka (collectively known as Stardust Crusaders) on in the Top 4. Itaru Ishida, Ryo Ogura, and Takuya Oosawa (Limit Break) provided the rest of the star power in this Top 4, cruising into the elimination rounds as the number one seed, only to see their rampant run ended by Ziggy's Japanese fans.


On the other side of the bracket, unknowns Kiosk squared off against Tanii Monogatari, with Tanii and company coming out on top. This set up a finals of stars vs. "guys", and just like at Grand Prix-Madison two weeks ago, the "guys" came out on top. Yasooka's Full Burn deck was hopelessly overmatched by Yusuke Tanii's [Greater Good](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Greater+Good) deck, giving Monogatari the early lead in the match. Masay Kitayama and his Hand in Hand deck struck back however, killing off Katayama's Izzetron deck in three games, leaving the entire tournament riding on Akira Asahara's shoulders. Asahara was able to push his match to three games via Meloku's amazing effect on games, but the Clouded Mirror of Victory did not emerge victorious this time. Kotatsu Saito used [Castigate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Castigate) to remove it from Asahara's hand before it could see any action, while Asahara's Divining Top failed to produce enough gas for him to get another Grand Prix victory.


Congratulations to Tanii Monogatari, the 2006 Grand Prix-Hamamatsu champions!
