Grand Prix Fukuoka Coverage
===========================











![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gp_lg.gif)It was an epic finals. On one side, Masahiko Morita in his second Grand Prix finals appearance in three months. On the other, Grand Prix mainstay Alex Shvartsman in the fight for his third title. A drawn-out first game saw Morita take advantage of a mana-flood on Shvartsman's part. But then Shvartsman taught him respect in a second game that was little more than a bludgeoning. It all came down to the third game. Shvartsman was in control the whole way, but two big draws from Morita turned the tide. And just when it looked like Morita would walk away with it, Shvartsman pulled Balshan Collaborator to take the championship. Congratulations to Alex Shvartsman, Grand Prix - Fukuoka Champion!
