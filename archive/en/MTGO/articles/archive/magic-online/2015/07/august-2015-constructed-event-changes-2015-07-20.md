July 2015 Event Changes

*Magic Online* is an awesome place to play *Magic*. We think it could be better with some changes, particularly focused on Constructed events. Recent player feedback supports this as an area where we can improve, especially when alternative Limited events such as the *Tempest Remastered* or Cube Drafting are available. In this spirit, today we are announcing some changes to *Magic Online* events.




---

What are your goals with making these changes?
==============================================


We focused on what Constructed players want to do with their prizes and made sure our prize offerings reflected those goals:


1. Provide a prize that allows a Constructed player to immediately jump in another event.
2. At least some events provide players with prizes that allow for better deck customization as preferences and sets change.



---

What are those changes?
=======================


Play Points will now be used as prizes for Constructed queues and Daily Events. Eight-Player Queues and Daily Events will award prizes that are a combination of Play Points and boosters, while two player queues will award prizes that are entirely in Play Points. Additionally, all three of these plus many other *Magic Online* events will have an additional entry option that consists entirely of Play Points.

We believe Play Points will do a great job of achieving the first goal, which is to allow players to play events more easily. To make sure the second goal is also met, we are still awarding some prizes as booster packs. Players can trade or open these boosters to help them get new cards for their decks.


In the future, we plan to look at other ways to use prizes to promote deck customization besides booster packs (mainly because they are mostly used currently to join Limited events). However, for now we want to focus on the changes that we’re announcing today.

DETAILS OF THE NEW CONSTRUCTED EVENTS
=====================================


Before we talk about additional ways to use Play Points, here are the details of the events where you can win them!


### Constructed Two-Player Queue



**Start Times:** Fire on demand  



* Option 1: 2 Event Tickets
* Option 2: 20 Play Points

**Size:** 2 players  






| Place | Prizes | QPs |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1st | 30 Play Points | 0 |
| 2nd | 5 Play Points | 0 |



---

The Two-Player Queue is available for Standard, Modern, Legacy, Vintage, Pauper, and Momir Basic. If you win, you get enough Play Points to play in another one, plus you’re halfway to the one after that. If you lose, you’re a quarter of the way to a free one. Keep earning more points!


### Constructed Eight-Player Queue



**Start Times:** Fire on demand  
**Location:** Constructed Queues  
**Entry Options:**


* Option 1: 6 Event Tickets
* Option 2: 60 Play Points

**Size:** 8 players  
**Play Style:** Single Elimination  
**Duration:** Three rounds, each round up to 50 minutes.  
**Prizes:**





| Place | Prizes | QPs |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1st | 2 *Magic Origins* booster packs and
 140 Play Points | 2 |
| 2nd | 1 *Magic Origins* booster pack and
 60 Play Points | 1 |
| 3rd-4th | 60 Play Points | 0 |



---

The Eight-Player Queue is available for Standard and Modern. Winning the first match gets you enough Play Points to play in another eight-player queue. Winning the second match gets you enough Play Points to play in another eight-player queue, plus a booster. Finally, if you can win all three matches, you’ll receive more than enough Play Points to enter two more eight-player queues, on top of two boosters!


### Constructed Daily Event


**Start Times:** [See Schedule](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/events-schedule-2015-04-29)  
**Location:** Constructed Scheduled  
**Entry Options:**


* Option 1: 12 Event Tickets
* Option 2: 120 Play Points

**Size:** 16-256 players  
**Play Style:** Swiss  
**Duration:** Four rounds, each round up to 50 minutes.  
**Prizes:**





| Match Wins | Prizes | QPs |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 4 Wins | 6 *Magic Origins* booster packs and
 360 Play Points | 3 |
| 3 Wins | 3 *Magic Origins* booster packs and
 180 Play Points | 1 |



---

Constructed Daily Events are available for Standard, Modern, Legacy, Vintage, and Pauper. They reflect the highest level of regularly available competition on *Magic Online*. As such, we are increasing the number of event tickets used to join to reflect this and help distance it from the eight-player queues. Since the quality of play in Constructed Daily Events can be quite intense, we expect some players will stick to the queues. Choose the level of event that is right for you.


You’ll also see the prize structure provides some very good rewards for those who do well under this system: Three wins gets you three boosters as well as enough Play Points for another Constructed Daily Event entry and halfway to one after that. Four wins is six boosters, plus enough Play Points for three more Constructed Daily Event entries. We hope these events are exciting—and the prize structures different enough from each other—that no matter what kind of player you are, you will be able to find the event offerings that are right for you.




---

What else can I do with Play Points?
====================================


We want players to have the options to select a variety of ways to use their Play Points. You can see above how you can use them in Constructed Queues and Daily Events. Play Points, like Phantom Points before them, are untradeable, and we’re excited to be able to use them creatively in new and exciting ways because of that. Also like Phantom Points, Play Points will be available as an entry option for Phantom Queues, and we are expanding their use as entry options in the following other events:




|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Event Type | Current Entry Options | New Additional Entry Option |
| Booster Drafts | Option 1: 14 Event Tickets
 Option 2: 3 Boosters and 2 Event Tickets | Option 3: 140 Play Points |
| Four-Booster Sealed Events | Option 1: 18 Event Tickets
 Option 2: 4 Boosters and 2 Event Tickets | Option 3: 180 Play Points |
| Sealed Daily Events | Option 1: 26 Event Tickets
 Option 2: 6 Boosters and 2 Event Tickets | Option 3: 260 Play Points |
| PTQ Preliminaries
 (Constructed and Sealed) | Option 1: 30 Event Tickets | Option 2: 300 Play Points |

The prize structures of these event types are unchanged. They will not award any additional Play Points. But we believe this new structure will provide players Constructed players with the opportunity to use Play Points beyond events that award them as prizes.




---

When are the events changing?
=============================


The new structures will begin after the August 12 downtime, when release events for *Magic Origins* end.




---

Can I use Play Points already in my account for these events?
=============================================================


Yes! As I stated in the [June Events article](http://magic.wizards.com/en/MTGO/articles/archive/magic-online/june-2015-magic-online-event-updates-2015-06-08), Play Points will be introduced and Phantom Points will be retired during this Wednesday’s downtime. However, each account will receive 6 Play Points for every Phantom Point they have in their account at that time.




---

Can I buy Play Points in the *Magic Online* store?
==================================================


No. The only way to get Play Points is through events (although sometimes they also may be available through special promotions). Most events that support a Play Point entry option will also support an event ticket entry option, and those tickets are available in the *Magic Online* Store.

Where should I send my feedback?
================================


You can send detailed feedback to [magiconlinefeedback@wizards.com](mailto:magiconlinefeedback@wizards.com). This email goes directly to Worth Wollpert, Mike Turian, Chris Kiritz, and me—the team making the day-to-day business decisions about *Magic Online*. I generally read everything the same day it comes in.
