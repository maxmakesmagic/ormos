Brad Nelson finally put together some wins in Week 6. The Standard superstar has been dominant in recent years at the Grand Prix level, but only managed to win one match in the first half of the Standard Super League season. Last week he crushed everyone with a Green Devotion deck that splashes red for [Dragonlord Atarka](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragonlord+Atarka) and [Xenagos, the Reveler](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Xenagos%2C+the+Reveler) and now finds himself one good week away from playoff contention.

With just two weeks left in the regular season, players are really starting to stare at the standings and worry about the playoffs. Owen Turtenwald has all but clinched the no. 1 seed and the associated bye into finals. He can’t miss the playoffs, and the only way he can fail to win the regular season is to make a first round exit in each of the next two weeks and have one of Gerry or Paul win both weeks.


Mathematically speaking, everyone is still alive, though it will be pretty tough for either Brian or Andrew to make the playoffs—they would need to win both weeks and also get some help just to get up to third place. Realistically, it will come down to five players for the last two spots and there are very realistic scenarios for every combination of them to advance.
