Lunch can be a good time to get work done. Sometimes you use lunch to go over a file or to make new cards. Other times it lets you read all the comic books you bought earlier in the week.

When you eat alone you go to your favorite restaurant. This is the place where they ring you up without you having to say a word because they already know what you want: good ol' lunch special #3.

The food is good and you get some work done.
