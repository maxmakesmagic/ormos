Hélène Bergeot started her career with Wizards of the Coast in France in December, 1995; afterwards, she spent a few years in the European headquarters based in Belgium and eventually relocated to the Renton office. She is currently the director of organized play and trade marketing. 





With the conclusion of the 2013–2014 Premier Play season, it's time to look ahead into next year. We've finalized the dates and locations for the Pro Tours and nearly all Grand Prix that are taking place in 2015 and, today, we reveal all of the events that you can look forward to next year.


Let's start off with the Pro Tours, the World *Magic* Cup, and the *Magic* World Championship.


*Editor's Note: The 2015 schedule has been revised. Please see the asterisk (\*) near the information that has changed since the time of this publishing.*





|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Date** | **Event** | **Location** | **Format** |
| February 6–8, 2015 | Pro Tour | Washington DC, USA | \*Modern, Booster Draft |
| April 10-12, 2015 | Pro Tour | Brussels, Belgium | Standard, Booster Draft |
| July 31, August 1-2, 2015 | Pro Tour | Vancouver, BC, Canada | Standard, Booster Draft |
| October 16-18, 2015 | Pro Tour | Milwaukee, WI, USA | Standard, Booster Draft |
| December 4–6, 2015 | World *Magic* Cup | Barcelona, Spain | TBD |
| December 11–13, 2015 | World Championship | Barcelona, Spain | TBD |


The World *Magic* Cup and World Championship will take place on separate weekends in 2015, showcasing both tournaments with three days of dedicated coverage. Both tournaments will still take place in the same location.


In 2014, there were 46 Grand Prix. In 2015, there will be 54. More Grand Prix means more chances to earn Pro Points, more chances to qualify for the Pro Tour, and more chances to meet many in your region who love *Magic*. While not every GP location and date has been finalized, we are excited to announce 50 confirmed dates and locations.


[As we announced earlier this week](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/2014-2015-premier-play-updates-2014-07-29), we've made some enhancements to Grand Prix, starting with this Premier Play season. Players will now earn Pro Points based on their match-point total at the end of the event, instead of by ranking, rewarding consistent play and providing an improved experience to players seeking Pro Points as Grand Prix continue to scale in size. In addition, we've also increased the prize payout if a Grand Prix exceeds an attendance of 3,600 players. Just as in previous years, players who enter a Grand Prix main event in 2015 will receive a foil promo [Griselbrand](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Griselbrand).

The 2015 Grand Prix schedule starts in December with Baltimore and Milan; then moves into January with Denver, Manila, Omaha, Shizuoka, San Jose, and Mexico City. After the first Pro Tour of 2015, February finishes up with Seville, Vancouver, and Memphis. Players who finish in one of these Grand Prix with 39 match points or a Top 8 finish will earn an invitation to the Pro Tour in April 2015.
