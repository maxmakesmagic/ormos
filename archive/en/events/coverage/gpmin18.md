Day 1 Coverage



What started as over 1,300 players battling *Core Set 2019* Sealed Deck ends the first day with 285 still in contention—and the race to become Grand Prix Minneapolis champion turned a corner closer to conclusion.


Among those standing tall after nine rounds include six 9-0 players: 9th-ranked Ken Yukuhiro, Craig Wescoe, Alex Sittner, Rob Pisano, Riku Kumagi and Quinn Kotecki. Not far behind there's a scrum of players ready to take the lead back: Kentaro Yamamoto, Thiago Saporito, Shota Yasooka and more are just one round back.


With the switch from Sealed Deck to Draft, the masters of pick orders and Limited ranked will put their knowledge to the test as we run two drafts to determine a Top 8. Will the players at the front of the pack keep up their run and convert it into a Top 8 and the accompanying Pro Tour invite, or will those further back make an upset run? You can watch all the drama unfold Sunday morning at Twitch.tv/Magic!
