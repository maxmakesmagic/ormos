![The Cheese Stands Alone](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=The+Cheese+Stands+Alone)**[The Cheese Stands Alone](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=The+Cheese+Stands+Alone)** – *Unglued* rare. *Eighth Edition* contained a never-before-reprinted card from every set in **Magic**. The plan at one point was to bring [The Cheese Stands Alone](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=The+Cheese+Stands+Alone) into "real" **Magic**, but the rules regarding silver-bordered cards made it impractical. The mechanic finally made it into *Future Sight*, though, in the form of [Barren Glory](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Barren+Glory).
 ![Offering to Asha](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Offering+to+Asha)**[Offering to Asha](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Offering+to+Asha)** – *Alara Reborn* common. [Offering to Asha](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Offering+to+Asha) is an exceedingly balanced card. The converted mana cost is four, the mana mentioned in the rules text is ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20160830042801im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless4.gif), the spell gains the controller 4 life, and the flavor text is four lines.
 ![Rise // Fall](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Rise+%2F%2F+Fall)**[Rise // Fall](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rise+%2F%2F+Fall)** – *Dissension* uncommon. If you look carefully at the left side of the art for the "Fall" side of [Rise // Fall](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rise+%2F%2F+Fall), you can see the Rakdos symbol carved into the wall of the pit!
 ![Tarpan](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Tarpan)**[Tarpan](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarpan)** – *Ice Age* common. A tarpan is a kind of wild horse, which has been extinct since the last one died in captivity in 1909 in Russia. So if you've been trying to summon one and have been having trouble for the last hundred years, that's why.
 ![Scryb Sprites](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Scryb+Sprites)**[Scryb Sprites](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scryb+Sprites)** – *Limited Edition Alpha* common. For something clearly out of the color pie (a common flier for green? For one mana?), [Scryb Sprites](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scryb+Sprites) stuck around for a surprisingly long time, appearing in every core set through *Fifth Edition*.
 ![Cheatyface](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Cheatyface)**[Cheatyface](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cheatyface)** – *Unhinged* uncommon. [Cheatyface](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cheatyface) essentially introduced a new minigame into silver-bordered **Magic**, in which players of a certain mindset strove to come up with new and more devious ways of getting it into play. Randy Buehler, for example, once used his baby as a shield while getting it into play. That's a lot of work for a 2/2 flier!
 ![Tahngarth, Talruum Hero](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Tahngarth%2C+Talruum+Hero)**[Tahngarth, Talruum Hero](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tahngarth%2C+Talruum+Hero)** – *Planeshift* alternate-art rare. *Planeshift* had secret alternate-art foil versions for three of its legends. They were [Tahngarth, Talruum Hero](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tahngarth%2C+Talruum+Hero), [Skyship Weatherlight](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skyship+Weatherlight), and [Ertai, the Corrupted](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ertai%2C+the+Corrupted). The fourth legend in the set was [Nemata, Grove Guardian](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nemata%2C+Grove+Guardian), which did not receive the alternate-art treatment.
 ![Soraya the Falconer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Soraya+the+Falconer)**[Soraya the Falconer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soraya+the+Falconer)** – *Homelands* rare. [Soraya the Falconer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soraya+the+Falconer) got better with the Grand Creature Type Update; now, even owls, albatrosses, and rukhs can get benefit from Soraya. This suggests that Soraya is an excellent falconer, as opposed to that [Sunastian Falconer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Sunastian%2BFalconer), who doesn't actually interact with the beasts of the air at all.
 ![Belfry Spirit](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Belfry+Spirit)**[Belfry Spirit](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Belfry+Spirit)** – *Guildpact* uncommon. [Belfry Spirit](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Belfry+Spirit) implies one of two things. Either bats naturally hang out with ghosts (which sounds logical) or there are, in fact, bats in almost every belfry.
 ![Chicken Egg](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Chicken+Egg)**[Chicken Egg](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chicken+Egg)** – *Unglued* uncommon. [Chicken Egg](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chicken+Egg) is, of course, a reference to the classic [Rukh Egg](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Rukh%2BEgg) from *Arabian Nights*. Sure, it's randomly instigated instead of happening when the egg goes to the graveyard and a Chicken instead of a Rukh, but Christopher Rush's egg is clearly the same one he drew the first time.
 ![Root-Kin Ally](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Root-Kin+Ally)**[Root-Kin Ally](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Root-Kin+Ally)** – *Ravnica: City of Guilds* uncommon. In *Ravnica* block, the suffix "-kin" indicates an elemental, as seen in the [Root-Kin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&name=+%5Broot-kin%5D), [Wood-Kin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=96853), and [Flame-Kin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&name=+%5Bflame-kin%5D) (no relation to the [Flamekin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&name=+%5Bflamekin%5D) of *Lorwyn*).
 ![Rogue Elephant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Rogue+Elephant)**[Rogue Elephant](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rogue+Elephant)** – *Weatherlight* common. [Rogue Elephant](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rogue+Elephant) comes with a pretty harsh drawback for a one-mana 3/3. But it was printed in the same set as [Harvest Wurm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Harvest+Wurm), which could help counteract that drawback at two mana. Add in [Fallow Wurm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fallow+Wurm), and you can see how lands were going in and out of the graveyard a lot during *Weatherlight*.
 ![Giant Octopus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Giant+Octopus)**[Giant Octopus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Giant+Octopus)** – *Ninth Edition* common. Thanks to the printing of [Lorthos the Tidemaker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lorthos+the+Tidemaker), [Giant Octopus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Giant+Octopus) is actually the smallest octopus available for summoning (non-Changeling division).
 ![Form of the Dragon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Form+of+the+Dragon)**[Form of the Dragon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Form+of+the+Dragon)** – *From the Vault: Dragons* rare. On the *From the Vault: Dragons* printing of [Form of the Dragon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Form+of+the+Dragon), [Sarkhan Vol](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sarkhan+Vol) can be seen turning into a dragon. If you want to see this presented as a piece of sequential art, stay tuned for part two of [Awakenings](/en/node/629371), which will arrive on Thursday.
 ![Brilliant Ultimatum](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Brilliant+Ultimatum)**[Brilliant Ultimatum](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brilliant+Ultimatum)** – *Shards of Alara* rare. [Brilliant Ultimatum](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brilliant+Ultimatum) depicts [Tezzeret the Seeker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tezzeret+the+Seeker) discovering the truth about Esper. The scene is depicted in more detail in [part two of The Seeker's Fall](/en/node/628166).
 ![Selective Memory](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Selective+Memory)**[Selective Memory](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Selective+Memory)** – *Worldwake* rare. Jace is a master of affecting other people's minds and memories (you might even call him a [Jace, the Mind Sculptor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Jace%252C%2Bthe%2BMind%2BSculptor)). He can be seen doing just that to Chandra in [Fuel for the Fire, Part III](/en/node/626866).
 ![Karrthus, Tyrant of Jund](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Karrthus%2C+Tyrant+of+Jund)**[Karrthus, Tyrant of Jund](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Karrthus%2C+Tyrant+of+Jund)** – *Alara Reborn* mythic rare. Who could command the great and powerful Karrthus? According to [Part 3 of Flight of the White Cat](/en/node/627616), the answer is [Sarkhan Vol](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sarkhan+Vol), who prevents Karrthus from eating Ajani.
 ![Anowon, the Ruin Sage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Anowon%2C+the+Ruin+Sage)**[Anowon, the Ruin Sage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Anowon%2C+the+Ruin+Sage)** – *Worldwake* rare. The flavor text for [Anowon, the Ruin Sage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Anowon%2C+the+Ruin+Sage) refers to a map in the hands of "the arrogant child Chandra Nalaar". Their confrontation appears in [Part 3 of Journey to the Eye](/en/node/629226), a Planeswalker webcomic.
 ![Mercadian Atlas](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Mercadian+Atlas)**[Mercadian Atlas](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mercadian+Atlas)** – *Mercadian Masques* rare. [Mercadian Atlas](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mercadian+Atlas) doesn't want you to play a land. But if you also had [Walking Atlas](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Walking+Atlas), you could get around that by putting the land directly onto the battlefield. Atlases have synergy!
 ![Ranger of Eos](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Ranger+of+Eos)**[Ranger of Eos](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ranger+of+Eos)** – *Shards of Alara* rare. [Ranger of Eos](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ranger+of+Eos) was created as part of the prize for Hall of Famer Antoine Ruel winning the [2006 **Magic** Invitational](/en/events/coverage/ruel-invokes-invitationalists-victory). He's also in the art (hint: not the bird or the dog).
 ![Chronozoa](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Chronozoa)**[Chronozoa](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chronozoa)** – *Planar Chaos* rare. Does it seem strange that [Chronozoa](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chronozoa) has Vanishing? After all, its ability ensures that when it runs out of counters, it doesn't really "vanish" so much as "double itself."
 ![Chisei, Heart of Oceans](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Chisei%2C+Heart+of+Oceans)**[Chisei, Heart of Oceans](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chisei%2C+Heart+of+Oceans)** – *Betrayers of Kamigawa* rare. Chisei represents the essence of intelligence, and its very presence heightens the intellect of other beings. That was pretty much all the direction artist Matt Cavotta was given, since the spirits of Kamigawa were notoriously strange and abstract.
 ![Hyperion Blacksmith](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Hyperion+Blacksmith)**[Hyperion Blacksmith](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hyperion+Blacksmith)** – *Legends* uncommon. Although we now call [Hyperion Blacksmith](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hyperion+Blacksmith) an uncommon, it was officially a "U1", meaning that it appeared once on the uncommon sheet. The five *Legends* rarities were C1, C2, U1, U2, and R1.
