Let's jump in to the good stuff first: more decks.

The Flashback
=============


There was only one Grand Prix last weekend, but it was a big one.


![](https://media.wizards.com/2015/images/daily/GP-Seattle-Tacoma-Black.png)


Grand Prix Seattle-Tacoma featured around 2,000 players from all over the world as they battled in two days of the timeless Legacy Constructed format. Some traveled from nearby regions for their hometown Grand Prix, while others came from across the Pacific *or* Atlantic to take part in one of the year's three Legacy Grand Prix.


In the end, longtime Pro Tour Qualifier regular Jarvis Yu from Rockville, Maryland, displayed mastery of his Lands deck, besting Christian Calcano 2-0 in the finals.

[Asia's Grand Prix Globetrotters](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/gpsea15/asias-grand-prix-globetrotters-2015-11-07)—I had a chance to talk to Team MTG Mint Card's Huang Hao-Shan and Yam Wing Chun about why they made the trek out to North America, and what their schedule was looking like this month.
