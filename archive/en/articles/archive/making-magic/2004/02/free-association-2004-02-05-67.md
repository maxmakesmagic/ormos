The philosopher Descartes walks into a bar. As he sits at the bar, the bartender notices that Descartes is in a [bad mood](/en/articles/archive/making-magic/free-association-2004-02-05-0). Trying to cheer up his friend, he says, “Descartes, would you like a beer?”


Descartes looks up and says, “I think not.”


And then, he disappears!


  
  
  
  
If this joke doesn't make any sense to you, find a friend who took [philosophy](/en/articles/archive/making-magic/free-association-2004-02-05-47) in college.
