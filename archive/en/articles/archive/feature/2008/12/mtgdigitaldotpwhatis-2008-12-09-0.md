Coming this summer\*, the newest version of the successful video game franchise **Magic: The Gathering** *Duels of the Planeswalkers* will bring 10 new decks, tutorial, and other exciting features. 



*Duels of the Planeswalkers 2013* will be available on Xbox LIVE Arcade, PC/Steam, PlayStation Network and for the first time ever on iPad. Now players will have more opportunities to play when they go face to face with the evil **Magic** genius Nicol Bolas, the planeswalker dragon! 


 Thanks to the easy to use tutorial system, *Duels of the Planeswalkers* is the best method for new players to learn how to play **Magic: The Gathering**. Players already familiar with **Magic** will appreciate a new multiplayer mode called Planechase. Planechase simulates the combat of Planeswalkers taking place across the Multiverse using plane cards and effects which greatly change the rules during the game. 



*\*Les dates de sortie peuvent varier selon les plateformes et les régions.* 




**Key Features**



* 10 New Decks
* Planechase mode for Multiplayer games
* New Challenges
* When *Duels of the Planeswalkers 2013* becomes available, the game offers several promo cards from the ***Magic** 2013* Core Set.
