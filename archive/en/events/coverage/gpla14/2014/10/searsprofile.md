 When perusing the American team members for the 2014 World *Magic* Cup, you'd be forgiven if you passed over Isaac Sears. Alongside names like Grand Prix Las Vegas Champion Neal Oliver and No. 1–ranked Owen Turtenwald, Sears' name lacks some pedigree. But he's got a plan to change that real quick. And sitting at 10-0 right now at Grand Prix Los Angeles, after scalping Pro Tour Hall of Famer Brian Kibler to become the new King of the Hill, his plan is working pretty well.






*Sears on His Way to Beating Brian Kibler to Become King of the Hill.*
