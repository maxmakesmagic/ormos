| **Theme deck color vote**  |
|  Red/Blue | 4112 | 25.7% |
|  Red/Green | 3635 | 22.7% |
|  Green/Blue | 3130 | 19.6% |

We would now like you to vote for one of several possible themes for this deck.


A theme unites the deck along a common idea. It provides a framework for card choices. It gives insight into how the deck should play.


Themes can be of different types; a theme could be based around a mechanic that an expansion uses, such as phasing or first strike. A theme can be a type of play, like control or beatdown.




| **VOTE SCHEDULE** |
| Color Pair | October 6 |
| Theme | October 10 |
| Rares | October 13 |
| Creatures | October 24 |
| Spells | October 27 |

Themes can also be conceptual. That's harder to describe, but examples might be 'Two Elements: Fire and Air', or 'Mystical Spirits.'


The color pair Red/Blue would seem to suggest the following vote.
