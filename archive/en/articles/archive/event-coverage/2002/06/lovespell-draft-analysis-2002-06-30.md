Lovespell, made up of Eric Froelich, Chris Benafel and Alex Borteh, went up against ODB (Mike Long, Pete Leiher, Sam Fog) in the first draft of the day. Benafel opened to start, "kicking off" for his team. The pack included [Painbringer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Painbringer), [Mortivore](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mortivore), [Second Thoughts](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Second+Thoughts), [Crashing Centaur](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crashing+Centaur), [Diligent Farmhand](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Diligent+Farmhand), [Pardic Firecat](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pardic+Firecat), [Dusk Imp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dusk+Imp) and [Whispering Shade](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Whispering+Shade). Surprisingly, Lovespell gave the [Mortivore](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mortivore) to ODB. Benafel picked [Diligent Farmhand](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Diligent+Farmhand), Froelich took [Second Thoughts](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Second+Thoughts), and Leiher gladly scooped up the [Mortivore](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mortivore). The pack swung around to Leiher's opponent Borteh, who took [Dusk Imp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dusk+Imp) and [Whispering Shade](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Whispering+Shade) to threaten Leiher's black deck. 

In the second pack, Froelich took a Looter, going into blue/white. Leiher picked [Aven Cloudchaser](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aven+Cloudchaser), and Benafel got a late [Nantuko Disciple](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nantuko+Disciple). Leiher then opened his pack and gladly took a [Psychatog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psychatog), while Long got [Rabid Elephant](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rabid+Elephant). Froelich had an impressive wheel of [Aven Fisher](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aven+Fisher) and [Dreamwinder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dreamwinder). Fog then got a [Repel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Repel) in the next pack, while Long got his second [Rabid Elephant](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rabid+Elephant). Long then cracked his pack, and it was quite strong. It contained [Overrun](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Overrun), [Wild Mongrel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Mongrel), [Firebolt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Firebolt) and [Hallowed Healer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hallowed+Healer). Interestingly, Long took the Mongrel instead of [Overrun](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Overrun). Borteh got [Firebolt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Firebolt), Benafel happily took [Overrun](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Overrun), and Froelich picked up the Healer. Things got even better for Lovespell in the next pack, as Froelich obtained a [Persuasion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Persuasion). 

At this point, Borteh was locked into black/red in the A seat, which is optimal since it allows that drafter to get the most out of *Torment*. It paid off, as Borteh collected plenty of *Torment's* goodies, including a wheel of [Possessed Barbarian](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Possessed+Barbarian), [Fiery Temper](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fiery+Temper). In addition, Benafel got [Narcissism](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Narcissism) to go along with his [Overrun](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Overrun). 

*Judgment* saw Long develop his deck much better, as he picked up [Arcane Teachings](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arcane+Teachings), [Jeska, Warrior Adept](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jeska%2C+Warrior+Adept), [Phantom Centaur](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phantom+Centaur) and [Thriss, Nantuko Primus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thriss%2C+Nantuko+Primus). Fog drafted a pair of [Wormfang Drake](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wormfang+Drake)s as well. At one point during the draft, Pete Leiher drafted out of order for a second time. The resulting penalty was a game loss, and some unpleasant words were exchanged between Benafel and Long in the ensuing argument. 

Sideboard: How do you guys think it went?

Benafel: Probably about the best it can possibly go for you. They have a game loss too, so that's not too bad.

Froelich: Alex (Borteh) has about the best black/red deck I've ever seen, versus a fairly shady black/white splash blue deck. All of them are three colors for the most part, and Chris' deck is pretty phenomenal against a pretty bad blue/red deck that has about nine three-drops. 

Sideboard: What do you think about Long taking [Wild Mongrel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Mongrel) over [Overrun](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Overrun)?

Benafel: It's the right call.

Sideboard: Why?

Benafel: I just think the Mongrel is better.

Borteh: I'd just like to say, my deck is Der Gas, Chris' deck is Der S#$%, and EFro has a Der-Suasion. So, I think the winds of change are blowing in our favor. 

Sideboard: You guys shipped the [Mortivore](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mortivore) first pick, first pack. Why was that?

Borteh: Actually, I'd like to clarify: Bortevore. 

Benafel: There were just a lot of black cards in that pack, and there was no way they could "D" them all up.

Sideboard: Chris managed to get a [Narcissism](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Narcissism) and an [Overrun](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Overrun).

Benafel: (sarcastic) Right, which is key, because you want to have both in a green deck.

Sideboard: Any specific bad blood between you and Mike Long? That seemed kind of...

Benafel: I feel like if we had made mistakes, he definitely would have chimed in and said something about it. So, you know, that's the penalty, I know it's the penalty, and he was awarded the penalty. 

Sideboard: Any predictions?

Benafel: Yeah, we're gonna smash.
