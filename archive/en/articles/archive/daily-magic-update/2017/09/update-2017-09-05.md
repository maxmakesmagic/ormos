The September 5, 2017 Update
============================

The Daily *Magic* Update is a roundup of everything *Magic* you should know on September 5, 2017. Today's Update is brought to you by long weekends, honeymoons, and other reasons for not writing the Daily *Magic* Update.


(I was off yesterday, and starting Friday Nick Wolfram will be at the helm of the Update again while I celebrate my marriage with food, beaches, food, old things, food, and not working. My wife will be there, too.)


Today's Previews
================


1. [Journey to the Maze (Exclusive Ixalan Preview)](https://www.mtggoldfish.com/articles/journey-to-the-maze-exclusive-ixalan-preview?src=wizards) | MTGGoldfish | SaffronOlive

Another double-faced card revealed, and this one is pretty a-maze-ing.


1. [マジック：ザ・ギャザリング「イクサラン」プレビューカード《指名手配の獄道者/Wanted Scoundrels](http://tocage.jp/pages/1504339108.html)》| Tocage.jp

You have to appreciate an outlet that shows off the card in both its native language and English.


Also, the flavor of these Wanted Scoundrels is on point. Plus, they might just be very good.

I find it fascinating that Korean preview cards always go unnoticed for quite a while, unlike basically any other language or outlet. In this case, Wildgrowth Walker was live for 8 hours before it was noticed. At least someone was [able to translate it](https://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/6y82w2/xln_new_uncommon_from_korean_mtg_facebook/dmlac6l/).


1. [Overflowing Insight](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1-jfFrte58&feature=youtu.be) | Magic The Amateuring | Meghan Wolff and Maria Bartholdi

It says "Draw seven cards." That's good enough for me.

A Pirate's life is literally for he, so Trevor Williams (who plays for the Pittsburgh Pirates and plays *Magic*) got to show off a pair of Pirate-y cards.


1. What to watch for today, or #whereismypreviewcard

We've got one preview card scheduled still for today. [Mark Rosewater has a Twitter preview](https://twitter.com/maro254) coming, so sharpen your puzzle skills. 


After Those, Read, Watch, or Listen to These
============================================


1. [Interview with the Editor: Brad Nelson and Corey Baumeister](http://www.starcitygames.com/article/35761_Interview-With-The-Editor-Brad-Nelson-And-Corey-Baumeister.html) | StarCityGames.com | Danny West, Corey Baumeister, and Brad Nelson

In which brothers talk about playing *Magic* together. But it's *these* brothers.


Note that, judging from the way the interview was written, I believe it was conducted before this past weekend.


1. [How to Blind Prerelease *Iconic Masters*](https://www.hipstersofthecoast.com/2017/09/blind-prerelease-iconic-masters/) | Hipsters of the Coast | Zach Barash

Barash will be one of those fortunate folk to play in an *Iconic Masters* event this weekend at HASCON, and he walks through how to play in a Prerelease without knowing any of the cards. If you're reading this, chances are that's not something you can do for *Ixalan*, seeing as how I pointed you to a bunch of previews above. But if you know anyone who likes to play in Prereleases without any previews, maybe point them toward this how-to article—the advice can apply to any set.


1. [New Patriot Cassius Marsh is a serious *Magic: The Gathering* player](https://www.bostonglobe.com/sports/patriots/2017/09/04/new-patriot-cassius-marsh-serious-magic-the-gathering-player/43fsT5bTzKU9OntEW34WDJ/story.html) | Boston Globe | Hayden Bird

We're really sorry to see Cash go. He was a regular presence in the *Magic* scene around here, a number of people in the office considered him a friend, and it just felt like we were getting into the groove with him. So that sucks.


See ya around, Cash. I still want a rematch in Commander.


What People Are Talking About
=============================


1. > 
> Congratulations to [@CoreyBaumeister](https://twitter.com/CoreyBaumeister) who just made a third top 8 IN A ROW at [#GPDC](https://twitter.com/hashtag/GPDC?src=hash)
>

I'm a day late on this, but even I take holidays. Still, I couldn't let this moment go past unacknowledged by the Update. What makes Baumeister's run even more remarkable is that he did it with three different decks—Black-Green Constrictor one week, Temur Energy the next, and, finally, Mono-White Eldrazi.


Deck of the Day
===============


1. [Robin Dolar's Blue-Black Control](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/gptur17/top-8-decklists-grand-prix-turin-2017-09-03)

Last week we pointed to [The Scarab God](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=The+Scarab+God) as The Next Big Thing, and this week, it wins a Grand Prix. Coincidence? Probably mostly. But the deck it did it with was a bit of a surprise.


Blue-Black Control has been overshadowed by Blue-Red Control for quite some time and by White-Blue Control (specifically [Approach of the Second Sun](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Approach+of+the+Second+Sun)) lately. But Dolar, who's no stranger to Grand Prix success, took the top spot this past weekend in Turin. The deck is remarkable, like most we've been highlighting lately, in that most of it doesn't rotate.


The main deck loses [Flaying Tendrils](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flaying+Tendrils), [Grasp of Darkness](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grasp+of+Darkness), and seven of its dual lands. [Drowned Catacomb](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Drowned+Catacomb)s will replace four of the dual lands, so the mana doesn't take much of a drop. Whether [Flaying Tendrils](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flaying+Tendrils) is necessary is more of a metagame question, though [Grasp of Darkness](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grasp+of+Darkness) is certainly a loss. On the other hand, Vraska's Contempt is certainly a welcome addition to the deck.


The sideboard will certainly have to change, but it always does. So long Kalitas. *Arrivederci* [Liliana, the Last Hope](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Liliana%2C+the+Last+Hope). You will be missed.
