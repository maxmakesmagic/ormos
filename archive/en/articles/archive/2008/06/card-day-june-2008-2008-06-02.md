**Card of the Day - lundi 30 juin 2008**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Dawn's%20Reflection)#### Dawn's Reflection


*Fifth Dawn* common. Originally Dawn's Reflection was designed as an aura that had "Enchant Artifact" but R&D was concerned there would be flavor problems. Because the color green was supposed to be anti-artifact in the *Mirrodin* block, Dawn's Reflection was switched to working with lands, something more on flavor for green, instead of artifacts.

![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=New%20Frontiers)#### New Frontiers


*Odyssey* rare. New Frontiers is an interestingly narrow card, in that it's one of the few X-spells that provides mana instead of using it up. Since it provides the opponent first use of the land, it's never been all that popular, although it's usually a fairly high pick in Reject Rare Drafts... and it's ridiculous in Emperor using the "range of influence 1" option. If the Emperor plays New Frontiers, only his or her allies get search for lands!
 


**Card of the Day - jeudi 26 juin 2008**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Adventurers'%20Guildhouse)#### Adventurers' Guildhouse


*Legends* uncommon. The ability "bands with other legends" (which is "bands with other legendary creatures" in the Oracle text) doesn't do what it sounds like. Instead of just being able to form a band with any other legendary creature, a creature with "bands with other legendary creature" can only band with other creatures that also have "bands with other legendary creature". Creatures with regular, garden-variety Banding can join in as well, but other legendary creatures without banding or the "bands with other legendary creatures" ability cannot.
 


**Card of the Day - mercredi 25 juin 2008**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Search%20for%20Tomorrow)#### Search for Tomorrow


*Time Spiral* common. Even the land-searching in *Time Spiral* followed the time travel theme. In this piece, an elf has traveled from a barren past in search of life. The landscape in the greyed-out past suggests that he's come from a craggy, mountainous land.
 


**Card of the Day - mardi 24 juin 2008**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Castle%20Sengir)#### Castle Sengir


*Homelands* uncommon. Before Baron Sengir raised up a castle, his barony consisted of several small villages encircling a graveyard. Whenever a villager was buried, he or she would be promptly raise as a zombie servant of the Baron. Eventually, this self-sufficient system provided him with an army with which to assault the rest of Ulgrotha.
 


**Card of the Day - lundi 23 juin 2008**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Street%20Wraith)#### Street Wraith


*Future Sight* Uncommon. The bells that are hanging off the Street Wraith's cloak are in the shape of little skulls, to make it creepier.
 


**Card of the Day - vendredi 20 juin 2008**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Rune%20of%20Protection:%20Green)#### Rune of Protection: Green


*Urza's Saga* common. Did you know that there aren't any cards in **Magic** with the word "green" in the title that are neither green themselves nor do they have anything to do with green cards? Neither did we until we started this week of Card of the Day cards!
 


**Card of the Day - jeudi 19 juin 2008**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Red%20Cliffs%20Armada)#### Red Cliffs Armada


*Portal Three Kingdoms* uncommon. One of the things that the Grand Creature Type update did was to take away illogical phrases like "Creature–Ship" from **Magic** cards. The Red Cliffs Armada obviously *used* ships, but the Oracle type line now reflects the actual creatures involved: Human Soldiers.
 


**Card of the Day - mercredi 18 juin 2008**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Repentant%20Blacksmith)#### Repentant Blacksmith


*Arabian Nights* uncommon. In the process of being punished for his crimes, the blacksmith became invulnerable to fire itself. This proved not only a useful skill at his job, it let him provide some value to **Magic** players in the form of Protection from red.
 


**Card of the Day - mardi 17 juin 2008**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Urza's%20Blueprints)#### Urza's Blueprints


*Urza's Legacy* rare. The scene in the Urza's Blueprints art appears to come after the blueprints have already been used, since we can clearly see the mostly-built *Weatherlight* on the left. One can only assume that the blueprints were being used for a last-minute checklist before the voyage began.
 


**Card of the Day - lundi 16 juin 2008**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Whiteout)#### Whiteout


*Ice Age* uncommon. Back before Squee made it easy, people who wanted a way to discard cards over and over again (say, to Stormbind) had to jump through a few hoops. 
 


**Card of the Day - vendredi 13 juin 2008**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Acceptable%20Losses)#### Acceptable Losses


*Odyssey* common. At first glance, the costs attached to Acceptable Losses seem a little high; to get five damage, you have to spend four mana at sorcery speed and discard a card. And like all the other red *Odyssey* cards with that mechanic, the card gets discarded at random. But the price must be okay. After all, it says right in the card name that the losses are acceptable!
 


**Card of the Day - jeudi 12 juin 2008**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Despondency)#### Despondency


*Urza's Saga* common. The mechanic of "giving a creature -X/-0" has appeared all over the color pie, including artifacts, green, black, and even white. Starting in *Saviors of Kamigawa*, it became rooted in blue.
 


**Card of the Day - mercredi 11 juin 2008**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Bargain)#### Bargain


*Portal Second Age* uncommon. When making a deal in **Magic**, it's important to know who you're talking to. If you've got Yawgmoth on the other end of the phone, you're probably going to make all right, although it will cost you some life. A no-strings-attached Bargain, however, goes the other direction, giving your *opponent* a card, while giving you seven life. If you like, you can pretend that you're getting Yawgmoth's end of that deal, but it still doesn't seem worth it most of the time.
 


**Card of the Day - mardi 10 juin 2008**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Anger)#### Anger


*Judgment* uncommon. All of the *Judgment* Incarnations had built-in advantages as creatures, because opponents generally didn't want to kill them. But Anger was the only one that effectively made the cards in your hand more powerful, as opposed to giving powers to creatures in play or in the graveyard.
 


**Card of the Day - lundi 9 juin 2008**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Arcane%20Denial)#### Arcane Denial


*Alliances* common. As a counterspell with a drawback, Arcane Denial is sometimes useful. But since it generated so many cards, it also had an emergency backup plan: instead of countering an opponent's spell, it could be used to counter your *own* spell, putting you a card up on the deal!
 


**Card of the Day - vendredi 6 juin 2008**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Spike%20Soldier)#### Spike Soldier


*Stronghold* uncommon. The Spikes, not to be confused with the player type of the same name, were introduced in *Tempest* with the printing of Spike Drone. They appeared in full force during the Rath block's second set *Stronghold* and while Spike Feeder may be the most famous of the group, the hard charging Soldier was envisioned as being just a bit tougher than the rest of the brood. This is clearly reflected in its art through its spiky armor as it rests in Volrath's gardens. Like other Spikes it could pass its +1/+1 counters amongst other creatures but to reflect its more aggressive nature it could also permanently remove the counters to give a bigger, short term bonus.
 


**Card of the Day - jeudi 5 juin 2008**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Elephant%20Ambush)#### Elephant Ambush


*Odyssey* common. Unlike its cousin Call of the Herd, Elephant Ambush could hit play completely unannounced as an instant (Call of the Herd was a sorcery). For that reason the spell had an additional green mana tacked on to its cost during development and its flashback was greatly increased to prevent the card from being too powerful. Despite its ability to hastily put a 3/3 token into play, the common failed to see much use on the competitive circuit.
 


**Card of the Day - mercredi 4 juin 2008**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Richard%20Garfield,%20Ph.D.)#### Richard Garfield, Ph.D.


*Unhinged* rare. This *Unhinged* rare pays homage to the creator of all things **Magic**, Richard Garfield. Even for an *Un*-set Richard Garfield, Ph.D. caused rules headaches as the design team and rules gurus alike were uncertain whether they could proceed with an ability like the one on the card. Originally players had to produce the actual cards they were trying to replicate but eventually it was decided Richard Garfield, Ph.D. would simply reproduce the popular Mental Magic method of play in an actual game. Well, an actual *UN*game.
 


**Card of the Day - mardi 3 juin 2008**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Land%20Grant)#### Land Grant


*Mercadian Masques* common. Land Grant was part of the "pitch spells" cycle re-introduced during Masques block. Originally designed in *Alliances*, the pitch spells were cards one could play by means other than their mana costs. The return of the mechanic marked one of the first times in the game's history a set utilized mechanics from previous sets. Additionally Land Grant was the first card worded to reveal a player's hand as a cost. It has seen tournament success in decks like "10 Land Green" and "2 Land Belcher."
 


**Card of the Day - lundi 2 juin 2008**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Fraction%20Jackson)#### Fraction Jackson


*Unhinged* rare. Fraction Jackson took heavy advantage of one of the quirkier developments from *Unhinged*: the ½ mechanic. Because of its quirky toughness each Fraction Jackson could return a previously destroyed Fraction Jackson from the graveyard. Of course abilities weren't the only aspect of the card that utilized the ½ mechanic. Jackson's art took advantage too as the artist's assignment was to show everything in the background cut in half. You can see the results in the table, the vase, the room, even the card's border itself.
