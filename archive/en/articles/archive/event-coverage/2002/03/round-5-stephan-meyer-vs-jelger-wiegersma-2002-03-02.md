He'd also taken the amateur prize despite being previously qualified for a Pro Tour as an absent team-mate had prevented him from competing. Jelger Wiegersma is a strong Dutch player who finally got his breakout performance with a top 4 at PT New Orleans. A recent top 8 at Grand Prix-Heidelberg shows he's on form with this format. 

### Game 1

Game 1 was short and bloody. Meyer's turn 2 Barbarian Outcast was sent straight to the graveyard by a Firebolt and he didn't make another monster until a Pardic Lancer came onto the table on turn 5.

By this time Wiegersma was nibbling for two through the air with a Skywing Aven and had a Chainflinger on the ground. He matched Meyer's Lancer with a Zombie Assassin.

Meyer was in no mood to get defensive and attacked with the remaining Lancer and before sacrificing a Ravaged Highlands so he could summon a Rabid Elephant. Wiegersma cleared this out of the road with a Faceless Butcher and another swing for seven was too much for Meyer.

Wiegersma 1-0 Meyer

### Game 2

Wiegersma had to mulligan but Meyer didn't really capitalize as his only play was a Pitchstone Wall. He then failed to lay a fifth land while Wiegersma developed his board with Psychatog, Dreamwinder and Zombie Assassin.

Wiegersma cast Deep Analysis and then flashed it back while Meyer was finally able to drop a fifth land to make a Zombie Assassin.

Psychatog in combination with a Flame Burst bust though the wall and then the card advantage from the Deep Analysis started to show as Wiegersma sent in the 'tog with a full hand of seven cards to back it up.

Wiegersma let the 'tog die and summoned a Chainflinger. Meyer took that down with a Torturer and Afflict. A Firebolt soon got rid of the nuisance Torturer.

When Wiegersma dropped a Caustic Tar on one of his lands Meyer was in real trouble as he also had a Skywing Aven to contend with. He tried to race but couldn't keep a creature on the table and eventually a Morbid Hunger brought the game to an abrupt end.

**Final Result:** Jelger Wiegersma beat Stephan Meyer 2-0
