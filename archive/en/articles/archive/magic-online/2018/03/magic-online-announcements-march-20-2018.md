*Masters 25* Is in Full Swing
-----------------------------


*Masters 25* has arrived to *Magic Online*! Offering cards from *every single tournament-legal set ever printed*, the set is overflowing with possible archetypes and synergies. (#crabcombo forever!) What's the weirdest combo (or nonbo) you can put together? We literally don't even know! *Masters 25* is made to be explored, so let your creativity shine.


For more information, and to see the full schedule of *Masters 25* events, check out Alli Medwin's helpful article [here](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/magic-online/masters-25-plus-treasure-chest-updates-2018-03-06).


 
More Team Modern Super League
-----------------------------


The Team Modern Super League fun continues tonight, with Team Play Design facing off against Team ChannelFireball. Every week so far has been exciting, and many different decks and players have had their moments in the spotlight. (Lessons learned include: Hollow One is a rather powerful deck, and people are weirdly scared of Bogles!)


TMSL airs Tuesdays (like this one!) at 5 p.m. on [twitch.tv/magic](https://www.twitch.tv/magic). Learn more about Team Modern Super League [here](https://vintagesuperleague.com/tmsl-info/), or check out the video below.

Two PTQs This Weekend
---------------------


This is a good weekend to qualify for the Pro Tour! Both Saturday and Sunday bring Pro Tour Qualifier events to *Magic Online*. The format on Saturday will be Standard; the format on Sunday will be Modern. Both events will begin at 9 a.m. PT, and players can enter either with 30 tickets or 300 Play Points. The winner of each event will qualify for Pro Tour *Dominaria*, so this could be your chance to join the ranks of real-world *Magic* legends!
