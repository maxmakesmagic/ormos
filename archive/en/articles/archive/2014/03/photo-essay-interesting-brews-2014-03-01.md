You might think that only "serious" decks like Mono-Black Devotion are capable of winning but some creative players are here to make you think otherwise! Near the top of the tables, we see some really interesting brews featured an assortment of goodies from *Born of the Gods*, proving that being unconventional can have its rewards too!

An unfair graveyard deck attempting to abuse [Grisly Salvage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grisly+Salvage), [Commune with the Gods](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Commune+with+the+Gods) and [Satyr Wayfinder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Satyr+Wayfinder) was witnessed in action and [Deathrite Shaman](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deathrite+Shaman) finds a new home in Standard now that it is banned in Modern. Load up your graveyard and finish the game with colossal monsters like [Nemesis of Mortals](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nemesis+of+Mortals) and [Nighthowler](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nighthowler)!


![](https://media.wizards.com/legacy/mtg/images/daily/events/gpmel14/002.jpg)
Relying on [Elvish Mystic](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elvish+Mystic), [Kiora's Follower](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kiora%27s+Follower) and [Nykthos, Shrine to Nyx](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nykthos%2C+Shrine+to+Nyx) to fuel the mana-hungry deck, this Simic mage never seems to be short on cards since he also harnesses the power of [Jace, Architect of Thought](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace%2C+Architect+of+Thought), [Kiora, the Crashing Wave](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kiora%2C+the+Crashing+Wave) and [Courser of Kruphix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Courser+of+Kruphix). Eventually, this deck strives to ramp into stylish bombs like [Primeval Bounty](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Primeval+Bounty), [Polukranos, World Eater](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Polukranos%2C+World+Eater) and even [Sylvan Primordial](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sylvan+Primordial)!

A white weenie deck attempting to grow [Hero of Iroas](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hero+of+Iroas) with the help of bestow creatures, including the pictured [Nyxborn Shieldmate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nyxborn+Shieldmate) and the unpictured [Hopeful Eidolon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hopeful+Eidolon) and [Eidolon of Countless Battles](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eidolon+of+Countless+Battles). Throw in [Heliod, God of the Sun](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Heliod%2C+God+of+the+Sun) and [Nykthos, Shrine to Nyx](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nykthos%2C+Shrine+to+Nyx) for added fun!

Rakdos "suicide" Aggro gets a boost from aggressively-costed creatures like [Pain Seer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pain+Seer) and [Herald of Torment](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Herald+of+Torment). With its improved manabase thanks to [Temple of Malice](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Temple+of+Malice), it is so much easier to cast [Spike Jester](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spike+Jester) and still find space for [Mutavault](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mutavault). Greedy is good!

Rounding off this short photo essay of interesting brews is Terry Soh piloting Mono-Black Devotion. Whoops! Not quite an interesting brew but his [Pack Rat](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pack+Rat) tokens are cute enough to warrant a mention. Pika-pika!
