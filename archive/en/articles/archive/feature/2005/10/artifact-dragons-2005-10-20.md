M*irrodin's*  **[Clockwork Dragon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Clockwork+Dragon)** is only the most recent member of an elite group: it is one of only four artifact creatures in **Magic** with the Dragon creature type. This illustrious gang of clanking lizards has been ravaging opponents' life totals since *Mirage*.
