By Blake Rasmussen and Alison Luhrs











This week we're on to the most magical of *Commander (2017 Edition)* tribes, Wizards. Tomorrow is Wizards day in preview world, so we'll share a few tidbits about what you can expect out of tomorrow's Wizardly previews.


Also, since people requested it, our good friend and community member Cary Thomas ([@Vronos](https://twitter.com/Vronos)) took it upon themself to transcribe the episode, which [you can read here](https://vronos.com/magic-story-podcast-transcripts/magic-story-podcast-wizards/). Of course, then you're missing out on the dulcet tones of our voices, but, hey, you do you.
