The player with the most QP points over the course of all of the seasons of the [*Magic Online* 2009 Championship Series](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/other/031009a) will be identified as the 2009 Magic Online Player of the Year. In addition to the title, the Magic Online Player of the Year will receive an invitation to the 2009 Magic Online Championship and will be pre-qualified to compete in *all* Season Championships in the 2010 Magic Online Championship Series.

In addition the players that earn the most QP points in the following categories will be named the 2009 Magic Online Champion for that format. The categories that will be tracked and awarded are:




* [Standard Constructed play](/en/articles/archive/magic-online/2009-magic-online-player-year-standings-2009-12-15-0)

In recognition of the end of the first Player of the Year season, we would like to offer top finishers some free drafts to relax with now that the race is over. As the week following the conclusion of the 2009 MOCS features OLS Nix Tix, we will be granting boosters (an equal amount of *Onslaught*, *Legions*, and *Scourge*) to the top finishers shown below.
