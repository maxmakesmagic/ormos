GRAND PRIX KOBE 2008
--------------------


The Faerie Tale Continues
=========================




August 1-3













[日本語の取材へ](/en/articles/archive/event-coverage/japanese-coverage-2008-grand-prix%E2%80%93kobe-2008-07-30)



![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gpkob08/victoryshot.jpg) Yuuta Takahashi and the Fae, it’s a match that can’t be beat. Quite literally, it turns out. After taking home the title in Shizuoka earlier this year, Takahashi has once again come out on top, with what practically amounts to the same deck. Showing an incredible aptitude with the archetype, he bested Katsuya Ueda in the mirror to take the quarterfinals, Masaya Tanahashi with Kithkin, also known as The Other best Deck in the semifinals, and Takayuki Takagi and his Doran, the Siege Tower deck in the finals. Congratulations to Yuuta Takahashi, the first back to back Japanese Grand Prix Champion!


Meanwhile, the Summer of Magic is set to continue. Next stop, Denver, Colorado August 9-10. Will Faeries continue to take home titles, or will one of the many other decks, as we’ve seen here in Kobe this weekend, step up to take down the Fae? Keep it locked here at magicthegathering.com and we’ll keep you in the know.
