Battle of the Planes Starts Tomorrow
------------------------------------


Prepare for some badass interplanar chaos! Battle of the Planes is returning to *Magic Online*. Choose a plane, make a Sealed deck from booster packs of various sets that took place on that plane, and battle against decks built from different planes. It's unlike any other Limited format you can find, and even we don't know all the wild interactions that might come up.


Battle of the Planes runs June 6 through 13. For more information, check out Lee Sharpe's article [here](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/magic-digital/battle-planes-returns-2018-05-30).


*Battlebond* Is Coming to MTGO
------------------------------


The good news: *Battlebond* cards are coming to *Magic Online*! The slightly less good news: for now, not all of them are. We're really excited to be bringing such a fun and different set to the MTGO world, but we've run into a few unexpected delays. However, we're actively working on it, and the plan is to get as many *Battlebond* cards as possible into your electronic hands.


For more information, head over to [the MTGO Tumblr](http://wizardsmtgo.tumblr.com/).


Team Standard Super League Tonight
----------------------------------


The latest offering in our roster of Team Super League shenanigans is Team Standard Super League. The format is a bit different from the "Conqueror" rules used for TMSL and TVSL, but the basics are the same: team-wide deck-building restrictions, rotating players, and weekly elimination tournaments. See what kinds of crazy brews these teams bring to the table in the world of *Dominaria* Standard!


TSSL will air each Thursday at 6 p.m. on [twitch.tv/magic](https://www.twitch.tv/magic). Learn more about it (and see who's playing) [here](https://vintagesuperleague.com/).


Team Vintage Super League Thursday
----------------------------------


Get your weekly dose of ridiculously complex, powerful *Magic* every Thursday evening. The team-based deck-building rules and tournament structure make it even more interesting and unpredictable. You don't have to play (or even understand) Vintage to enjoy TVSLâ€”in fact, it's a great way to learn more about *Magic*'s most complicated format!



TVSL will air each Thursday at 6 p.m. on [twitch.tv/magic](https://www.twitch.tv/magic). Learn more about it (and see who's playing) [here](https://vintagesuperleague.com/format-details/).



MOCS Monthly Events June 9 and 10
---------------------------------


This weekend offers two *Magic Online* Championship Series Monthly Events in two different formats. **Saturday, June 9**, the format will be Standard, and the tournament will begin at 7 a.m. PT. **Sunday, June 10**, the format will be *Dominaria* Phantom Sealed Deck, also beginning at 7 a.m. PT. Players can enter either event with 35 Qualifier Points, and top finishers in both events will qualify for the MOCS Playoff Event on August 11.
