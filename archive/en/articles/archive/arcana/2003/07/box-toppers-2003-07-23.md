Each display box of *Eighth Edition* will contain a special collectible "box topper" card. There are 34 different box toppers, each picturing a card in *Eighth Edition* that had never before been reprinted in the Core Set. The cards are larger than normal **Magic** cards—approximately 4.25" x 6".

On the front is the card image as it appears in *Eighth Edition*. On the back is a blow-up of the art, plus the original expansion logo and date.

There are no rarity differences between the different box toppers; they are distrubuted in the displays equally. Six of them are being used as giveaways at shows and conventions over the summer ([Two-Headed Dragon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Two-Headed+Dragon), [Avatar of Hope](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Avatar+of+Hope), [Savannah Lions](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Savannah+Lions), [Phyrexian Plaguelord](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phyrexian+Plaguelord), [Lord of the Undead](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lord+of+the+Undead), and [Obliterate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Obliterate)).
