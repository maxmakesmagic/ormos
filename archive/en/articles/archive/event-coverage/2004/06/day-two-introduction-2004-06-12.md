We've returned to Osaka for another day of competition, as we bring the field down to the final eight. Shuuhei Nakamura and Kazumasa Shiki entered the tournament venue without a loss, looking to continue their momentum onto Sunday. Shiki has added yet another impressive performance to an already stellar debut season, where he came in 17th at Pro Tour New Orleans, won Grand Prix Okayama, and missed Top 8 on tiebreakers at Pro Tour Kobe to come in ninth. Even though he's the leader of the Rookie of the Year race, Shiki is already showing the swagger of a veteran. He came into the venue today wearing a sweater that proclaimed "Undefeatable", although he has promised to take it off if he loses. Below Nakamura and Shiki with 6-1 records are veterans Ken'ichi Fujita and Tsuyoshi Fujita. With these players at the top of the standings, there's a good chance that the Top 8 will have plenty of players that are capable of making the Japanese National team this year very strong.


Today will feature three rounds of draft, followed by four rounds of Standard. With only three rounds of Standard in the books it's hard to gauge what the metagame is like, but indicators point to more of the same, with [Skullclamp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skullclamp) hanging out everywhere, while Ravagers and Goblins fight it out. Stay with our coverage throughout the day, as we post the decklists and a metagame breakdown, and find out who will play tomorrow for the right to represent Japan at Worlds.
