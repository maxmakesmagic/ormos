* Top 4 playoff matches will be best 2 of 3 games per individual match, with no time limit. (Players are still expected to play at a normal pace and complete playoff matches in a reasonable amount of time.)
* Each team member will be randomly paired against an opposing team member. Only 1 round will be played in the semi-finals and finals.
