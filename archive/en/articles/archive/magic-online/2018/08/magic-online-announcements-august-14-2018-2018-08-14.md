*Ixalan* and *Rivals of Ixalan* Redemption Reprints Arrive
----------------------------------------------------------



After some unforeseen delays, the reprints for the regular versions of both [Ixalan and Rivals of Ixalan redemptions](https://magic.wizards.com/en/gameinfo/products/magiconline/redemption) have finally arrived will be available in the *Magic Online* for one week, from August 15 until August 22. While we believe that we've printed enough to meet demand, the sets will only be available while supplies last, so don't dally on placing your order.

New Cube Spotlight Starts Tomorrow
----------------------------------



A new Cube approaches! Introducing . . . *Pro Tour Cube*! This Cube, created by Eric Klug, features cards from Constructed Pro Tour decks over the years. You will have 540 memorable cards to choose from and create some wicked decks with. Find more information about this Cube [here](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/magic-online/cube-spotlight-series-pro-tour-cube-2018-08-08).

The following day, August 19 at 7 a.m. PT, we're having a Pro Tour Qualifier featuring *Core Set 2019 Sealed*.

Build Notes
-----------


Modern | [Angel's Grace](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Angel%27s+Grace) now correctly prevents opponents from winning with "you win the game" effects from cards such as [Laboratory Maniac](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Laboratory+Maniac).


Modern | If multiple creatures are returned to an opponent's hand with [Reflector Mage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reflector+Mage) on the same turn, they are both correctly unable to be cast until your next turn.


General | If a planeswalker card leaves the battlefield while being attacked, the creatures attacking it will correctly not deal damage.


Account | Red Limited PTQ Tokens have been removed from all accounts.


General | [Thornbow Archer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thornbow+Archer) no longer causes opponents to gain life.


Legacy | Miracle cards drawn this turn will now identify themselves as such until the trigger to cast them for their miracle cost resolves.


Standard | [Bone Dragon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bone+Dragon) returning from the graveyard will now find at most one lonely bat in a [Desecrated Tomb](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Desecrated+Tomb).
