The *Ravnica Allegiance* Prerelease is just around the corner, and we are very excited to offer a code in every Prerelease pack redeemable for one Traditional Draft entry in *Magic: The Gathering Arena*!


When you play in a Prerelease at a Wizards Play Network member store, you will receive a code in your Prerelease pack for a Traditional Draft in *MTG Arena*. Codes can be redeemed as early as January 17, and the *Ravnica Allegiance* Traditional Draft will kick off in *MTG Arena* on January 18.


Prereleases and other in-store events are a great opportunity for us to support your *Magic* journey at home with *MTG Arena*. With these Prerelease codes, we're trying some different game content to help us determine which you like best. We'll be gathering feedback, watching play, and tinkering with what *MTG Arena* codes from in-store events redeem for in the future. So check out a Prerelease at your local WPN member store, fire up a draft in *MTG Arena*, and then sound off in the forums!


Additionally, the *Ravnica Allegiance* Dovin Baan and Domri Rade Planeswalker Decks will contain a code that redeems for that Planeswalker Deck in *MTG Arena.* And to celebrate the launch of *Ravnica Allegiance,* we're offering a (non-unique) code to everyone that redeems for three in-game *Ravnica Allegiance* packs. Enter "PlayAllegiance" in the code-redemption field located in the *MTG Arena* store to get yours!


For more information on how to redeem your code, [click here](https://forums.mtgarena.com/forums/threads/44789)!


\*Codes are limited to one redemption per account. A Wizards Account is required to play. *MTG Arena* (and its game codes) is not available in all regions and languages. For more info on *MTG Arena* codes and promotions, click [here](https://magic.wizards.com/en/promotions).
