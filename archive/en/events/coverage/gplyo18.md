Day 2 Coverage



A whopping 2,058 players had been in the running initially, a testament to the unwavering popularity of the Modern format. After the first day's eight rounds, this number was down to 387, and seven rounds later, eight gathered for the playoffs. At the end of it all, of course, there could be only one to hoist the trophy and claim the title.


While the field at large was as varied as always, the big story of the Top 8 was four Mono-Green Urzatron decks making the cut. However, worries about Tron dominance may have been premature, as the next 24 in the ranking only added two more Tron lists to the total. The Tron decks also didn't do particularly well in the Top 8, and the final was a battle between 2016 Worlds finalist (20) Márcio Carvalho playing Abzan and 2017 WMC finalist Grzegorz Kowalski and his Red-Green Eldrazi.


While Kowalski was adamant that his lucky Forked Bolt had been the most important element to his success, he had to admit that he boarded it out for the finals. Rather, a series of Reality Smashers turned out to be the most important element to his success then, giving Kowalski his first trophy in his fifth Grand Prix Top 8!

Day 1 Coverage



In the morning, a whopping 2,058 players shuffled up their cards, full of hopes for fame and fortune and a spot in the second day of Grand Prix Lyon 2018. But after eight rounds of Modern, only 387 of them had earned the requisite record of 6-2 or better.


Leading the charge into Day 2 were thirteen players at 8-0: Arthur Brocsko, Matic Penko, (20) Márcio Carvalho, Malte Smits, Kim Ströh, Florian Koch, Davide Cappiello, and Mehdi Chelil (pictured above, left to right) as well as Leonardo Dalmasso, Julien Henry, Vjeran Horvat, Raul Vallejo, and Ricardo Sanchez (not pictured). The archetypes they piloted included two copies each of Burn, Urzatron, Lantern Control, and Mardu Pyromancer, but Modern showed no signs of settling down. Wackier strategies like Mill or Jeskai Ascendancy finished the day at 7-1 and the combination of Soulflayer and Zetalpa, Primal Dawn went 6-2 too …


Tune back in tomorrow to see all of that and more, as well as the epic conclusion of Grand Prix Lyon 2018!
