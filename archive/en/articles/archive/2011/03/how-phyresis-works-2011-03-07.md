Consider, if you will, Phyresis. The *Mirrodin Besieged* Style Guide has this to say:



> 
> **Phyresis**, the transformation of a living thing into a Phyrexian creature, can follow a variety of routes.
> 
>

> 
> In some cases it seems to start from the inside working its way out ([Fig. A](javascript:void(0);)), or it may start from the outside and work its way in ([Fig. C](javascript:void(0);)).
> 
> 
> It may even start somewhere in between ([Fig. B](javascript:void(0);)).
> 
> 
> The process usually focuses on a single limb or appendage and slowly spreads and corrupts the entire creature ([Fig. D](javascript:void(0);) & [Fig. E](javascript:void(0);)).
