***Tempest Remastered* Event Schedule**


*Tempest*, *Stronghold*, and *Exodus* were some of the first sets designed with Limited play in mind. It's been nearly two decades since *Tempest* block's release, and R&D has leveraged their accumulated experience to refine and balance those Limited forebears to play as well as a modern-day set. Now that *Tempest Remastered*'s release day is almost here, what's the best way to celebrate these three weeks in which the set is first available on *Magic Online*? With a smorgasbord of Limited Events, of course!


Check out the [article](http://magic.wizards.com/en/MTGO/articles/archive/magic-online/tempest-remastered-event-schedule-2015-04-27) for the full details, including information on how players can win *Tempest Remastered* booster packs in Vintage and Legacy 2-Player Queues and Dailies.

**Stop By Tomorrow for Two Special Articles**


Tomorrow, two special articles will be posted to [MTGO.com](http://magic.wizards.com/en/game-info/products/magic-online) and [Daily MTG](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles) by two great authors, Marshall Sutcliffe from [Limited Resources](http://lrcast.com/), and Randy Buehler, host of the upcoming [Standard Super League](http://standardsuperleague.com/)!


Randy Buehler has taken a retrospective look at Vintage Super League's second season and written a wrap-up article where he reviews some of the great moments and matches of the season. Whether you missed a few episodes along the way, or just can't get enough Vintage, this article will be a great place to catch up.


Limited specialist, Marshall Sutcliffe recently joined us at Wizards HQ to participate in an early *Tempest Remastered* Draft. In his Wednesday article, Marshall talks about his experience and walks players through some of his thoughts on the upcoming *Magic Online*-only set, *Tempest Remastered*!

**Known Issue Around Trading *Tempest Remastered* Cards**


We added a new known issue in last week's Bug Blog involving trading cards from *Tempest Remastered*.


The *Tempest Remastered* set is hidden if unowned. This means that if a player owns no *Tempest Remastered* cards, the *Tempest Remastered* filter cannot be selected as a possible format, even if the player has the quantity filter set to 0. Because of this issue, a player who doesn't own any *Tempest Remastered* cards cannot place any of those cards in their wishlist. This bug is scheduled to be fixed during the Wednesday, May 27 deployment. In the meantime, players can find a breakdown of how we expect this to affect trading *Tempest Remastered*. Thank you for your patience while we work on this!


**Trading *Tempest Remastered* without using wishlists:**


If a player who does not own any *Tempest Remastered* cards begins a trade with another player who has *Tempest Remastered* cards, then *Tempest Remastered* cards will be visible in the trade for both players.



* The player who did not own any *Tempest Remastered* cards is able to trade with that other player to get *Tempest Remastered* cards without issue.
* Once the trade is complete, the player who did not have any *Tempest Remastered* cards will now find that the *Tempest Remastered* filter in their collection is functional.
* Once the filter is functional, the player will only be able to see cards that they own.


**Trading *Tempest Remastered* using a wishlist:**


If a user owns no *Tempest Remastered*, the *Tempest Remastered* filter cannot be selected as a possible format, even if the player has the quantity filter set to 0. Because of this, a player who doesn't own any *Tempest Remastered* cards cannot place any of those cards in their wishlist. The only cards that can be added to the wishlist, are ones that a player already owns.
