### Game 1


After both players had wished each other good luck they started the game. Antoine Ruel was undefeated and Konstanczer had a record of 10-1, only having lost to Antoine.


After a mulligan, the German played the first creature that was cleaned by Scorching Lava from the Frenchman's side. André cast Bog Down, fishing out a Singe and a Mountain out of Antoine's hand. André then cast a Cavern Harpy and enchanted it later with Sinister Strength. Both players traded damage, but Antoine won an edge with Magma Burst with kicker having André's only creatures as targets, thereby making room for his creatures to give the German lethal damage.


### Game 2


Antoine had a more aggressive start then André, who didn't seem to find the right mana to cast his spells. Again, André's creatures were no match for the Frenchman's removal spells. Not only did he have good removal spells but also a Halam Djinn that would later be enchanted by a Sinister Strength. André had no possible chance against Antoine, who expressed that he would like to play André in the top 8 and that he would surely enjoy winning against him again.
