The **Magic** meeting happens once per week. All the designers and developers that work on **Magic** are invited. Randy Buehler, the director of **Magic** R&D, runs the meeting.

Randy starts out the meeting by talking about recent events. He talks about the attendance numbers for the last prerelease. He mentions that a product has been added to next year’s schedule. He talks about a discussion he had with the **Magic** brand team.

Then he gets to the fun part: the list of discussion topics. Randy looks at his watch as says, “We have an hour and ten minutes left, that should be enough for this first topic.”

Usually the topics at these meetings are things that Randy knows need discussion. Most often that means that R&D is split on the issue.
