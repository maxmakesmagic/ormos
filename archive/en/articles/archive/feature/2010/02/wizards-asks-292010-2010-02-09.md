*Suppose you were setting out on a week-long **Magic** cruise, as dozens of players did last weekend. What decks, packs, and cards would you bring, and why?*

![Kelly Digges](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/mtgcom/authorpics/authorpic_kellydigges.jpg)**Kelly Digges:** The first thing in my suitcase would be lots and lots of booster packs for drafting. If possible, I'd try to bring something on the order of two full boxes of *Zendikar* and a box of *Worldwake*, plus maybe some packs for one of my favorite two-player Winston draft formats, the bizarre *Shadowmoor* / *Alara Reborn*. 

I'd also make sure to bring enough basic land to comfortably outfit an eight-player draft. There are few things worse than losing an entire draft to mana-screw, and while I'm sure there would be lands available on the boat, wouldn't I feel dumb if there weren't?

After that would be the decks—specifically, my box of 100-card EDH decks. My heavily Goblin-themed [Wort, Boggart Auntie](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wort%2C+Boggart+Auntie) deck is fun times, as is my mono-green [Multani, Maro-Sorcerer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Multani%2C+Maro-Sorcerer) concoction (which mostly makes everyone draw cards). Rounding out the roster would be [Sharuum the Hegemon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sharuum+the+Hegemon) (probably the most powerful), the stealy-riffic [Nicol Bolas](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nicol+Bolas), and glass cannon [Uril, the Miststalker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Uril%2C+the+Miststalker)—enough decks to outfit a full five-player table without taking up too much room.

The only other absolute must-bring would be the *Planechase* planes and dice. There is just no better way to Timmy up a game of **Magic** than to start rolling that planar die.

Beyond that would be all the usual dice, beads, and tokens—and I might even remember to pack clothes.
