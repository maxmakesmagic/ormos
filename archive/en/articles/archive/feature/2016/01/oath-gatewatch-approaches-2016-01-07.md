*Oath of the Gatewatch* is just around the corner, and there are so many different ways you can experience the brand new set that we had to write an article about it! Kozilek has arrived, and our Planeswalker heroes are assembling to battle *two* Eldrazi titans. Are you ready for the exciting conclusion to the *Zendikar* block?

===============================

EVENTS
======


Mark your calendars! The [*Oath of the Gatewatch* Prerelease](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/event-types/prerelease) is January 16–17. *Oath of the Gatewatch* is designed with Two-Headed Giant play in mind, so check whether your local game store is offering Two-Headed Giant Prereleases! This is the perfect opportunity to bring a friend and battle with the latest cards.


*Oath of the Gatewatch* will be hitting shelves January 22, which also means that January 22–24 is Launch Weekend.


Just two short weeks after that, [Pro Tour *Oath of the Gatewatch*](http://magic.wizards.com/en/protour/ogw) will descend on Atlanta, Georgia, featuring the Modern format. Make sure to subscribe to our [Twitch](http://www.twitch.tv/magic) channel—you won't want to miss the coverage of this awesome tournament.

*MAGIC DUELS*
=============


Today we'd like to announce important information regarding the future of *Magic Duels*.


The recent release of the *Battle for Zendikar* update marked the first step in the restatement of our commitment to making *Magic Duels* the great experience that you deserve.


In order to continue improving *Magic Duels*, we have made the decision to revise our content release plan for 2016. This means that instead of the *Oath of the Gatewatch* update being available in January, players can expect it to be released to *Magic Duels* in April, alongside content from the next *Magic* set, *Shadows over Innistrad*. With the *Shadows over Innistrad* update, we will be back on track to delivering regular content updates aligned with *Magic*'s paper set releases.


We'll share more information about the release of the combined *Oath of the Gatewatch* and *Shadows over Innistrad* update in the spring.


Thanks for your continued passion and support.


*MAGIC ONLINE*
==============


*Oath of the Gatewatch* will be hitting *Magic Online* on January 29. Also on that day will be a streamer showdown of the Prerelease! (Check the [MTGO.com](http://mtgo.com/) Weekly Announcements next week for more information on where and when to tune in.) Watch some sweet games go down, then jump in on the action yourself—play in Prerelease events January 29 through February 1, then enjoy Release events February 1–17.
