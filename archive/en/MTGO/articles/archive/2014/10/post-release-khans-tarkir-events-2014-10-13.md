*Khans of Tarkir* [Release events](http://magic.wizards.com/en/MTGO/articles/archive/khans-tarkir-prerelease-and-release-events-2014-09-15#release) are coming to a close on Wednesday, October 22. Halloween is around the corner too, and maybe it's the time of year, but I can't help but see the similarities between the two. Did you go Trick-or-Treating on Halloween as a kid? Let's look at the parallels.


Choose your costume; choose your clan. Go door-to-door, gathering candy; go from event to event, raking in prizes. A great time is had by all! Unfortunately, all good things must come to an end—the festivities are winding down.


But wait! Have we lost track of the whole point of Halloween/the Prerelease and Release period? Perhaps we have. The fun isn't over when Halloween/the Prerelease and Release period comes to an end—it's just beginning. With renewed vigor, run home to search for a clearing big enough to dump your loot. Dive for the site of your future treasure trove, turn your pillow case or plastic pumpkin upside-down, spill its contents all over the floor, and begin to messily devour your hard-won *Magic* cards!


Wait a minute.


The point is that Release Events might be almost over, but there's plenty more *Khans of Tarkir* to come! Now that we're done getting acquainted with the new set, it's time to add more events into the mix that let *Magic Online* users play *Khans of Tarkir*. When Release events come to a close on October 22, you can look forward to many more *Khans of Tarkir* events rotating in on the below schedule. As always, keep your eye on the [Event Schedule](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/events-schedule-2014-08-27) for full event details once we're closer to Wednesday, October 22.
