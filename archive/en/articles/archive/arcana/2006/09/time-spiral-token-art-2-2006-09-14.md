On [Monday](/en/articles/archive/time-spiral-token-art-1-2006-09-11) we looked at the art commissioned for a few *Time Spiral* tokens for ***Magic** Online*. Today we dig a bit deeper into that token art. We should let you know that we’re still just scratching the surface of the amount of new art commissioned for tokens.

Today’s tokens represent a slightly odder group of creature types from last time. As you’ll see at the [prerelease](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/events/prereleases), *Time Spiral* is bursting at the seams with its menagerie of creatures.

We begin with a reference to a recent card preview.

*Thrull token art by Mark Tedin*
Check out the art of [Endrek Sahr, Master Breeder](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=magic/images/mtgcom/fcpics/features/360_ohakg8d0rgqpfdfl.jpg) in Jeff Till’s [preview puzzle solution](/en/articles/archive/magic-puzzling-time-spiral-sneaky-preview-solutions-2006-09-13). Endrek Sahr, courtesy of Dominaria’s thrashing temporal rifts, is back to his fleshcrafting ways once again. Mark Tedin painted the legend and the token he generates. Note the throwback look—these are not your [*Ravnica* thrulls](/en/articles/archive/return-thrulls-2006-02-09). (By the way, Endrek Sahr isn’t the only card in *Time Spiral* that creates thrull tokens.) 


How about another creature of the night?

*Bat token art by Mark Poole*

There’s more to this bat than meets the eye. It may have something to do with somebody shown on one of the [*Time Spiral* booster packaging designs](/en/node/703466).

*Citizen token art by Michael Phillippi*

This poor soul has been displaced in time from his native Icatia, and he’s not happy to see the state of his surroundings. What has happened to his home? What has happened to the *plane*? Why was he summoned here? We can tell you that this fellow is depicted in the background of the *Time Spiral* card that does the summoning. Maybe you’ll open it up for use in your sealed deck at the [prerelease](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/events/prereleases)!
