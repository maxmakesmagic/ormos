Asbach has the Tezzeret's Touch!
================================




John Asbach won Grand Prix San Jose without dropping a game in the Top 8—defeating Ari Hausman-Cohen in the Finals.

TOP 8 COVERAGE



The Top 8 was a field of mostly newcomers for the first North American outing of *Aether Revolt* Limited. Other than Grand Prix Phoenix champ Roberto Berni, few had made it this far in a Grand Prix. Even the one Pro Tour champion, Jiachen Tao, had only one Grand Prix Top 8 to his name—and anyway, he was out in the quarterfinals!


After the dust settled, it was the military man, John Asbach, armed with two Tezzeret's Touches and a couple big vehicles who ran through the competition without dropping so much as game in the elimination rounds—taking out Ari Hausman-Cohen's aggressive Red-White deck in the Finals to take home the trophy,


The weekend was quite the auspicious one. *Aether Revolt*has throughly changed both Sealed and Draft, which will surely be explored to its fullest at Pro Tour *Aether Revolt*next weekend in Ireland. It will be a fun challenge to see just how few land people try to get away with over in Europe. Roberto Berni said both times he played fifteen lands, he probably should have played fourteen. A Limited revolution is happening on Kaladesh for certain.


The revolt has just begun, and will only gather steam at the Pro Tour next week!


From everyone in San Jose, have a great night! And one more congratulations to your Grand Prix San Jose champion, Josh Asbach!

Day 2 Coverage



The number remaining in San Jose is 529. That’s 529 out of near-2000 who were asked to return, getting their hands on *Aether Revolt* in a Grand Prix for the first time. The revolt brought along swift changes to the Sealed format on Kaladesh—the same will surely happen to Draft. But after such a tough first day, will these players have the energy?


Leading the charge are Roberto Berni, Avanesh Pernankil, Adam Ragsdale, Basil Nabi, and Anand Khare. These five combatants braved the elements to be Sealed virtuosos yesterday. But the trouble with having a perfect record is maintaining that record. Past performance isn’t always an indicator of future success. As surely these players know all too well.


Hot on their heels are those looking to overthrow the conclave at the top. Massdrop East’s JC Tao, CFB Fire’s Paul Cheon, Jake Mondello, Ben Seck, Matt Sperling, Dave Williams, Vidianto Wijiaya, and many others only have one loss to their names. With a few turns, the revolution could be steered their way.


They’ll be plenty of action all day as we explore the depths of the *Aether Revolt* along with Grand Prix Prague happening over in Europe.


We still have 529 now, but later that will be winnowed to 8, and then just 1—the *de facto* chairperson of the *Aether Revolt*!

 
  
  



Day 1 Coverage



The first day of*Aether Revolt*'sinaugural outingin North America is in the books. Five players took down the Sealed format with aplomb and left the building with the perfect 9-0. Roberto Berni, Avanesh Pernankil, Adam Ragsdale, Basil Nabi, and Anand Khare got there by hook or by crook.


Some, like Nabi, had tons of great vehicles and just jammed enough creatures to crew them. Some, like Khare, had a deck for the ages. There were rumors flying around the top tables about his deck; its myth was quite powerful. And others just had some eminently fair play. But the link among them was land cheating. Everyone was seeing how few lands they could play, quite a rarity for Sealed. And a standout feature of the format so far.


Land-easiness was the story of the day. Pro after pro just talked about how to make the most of the lands in your deck without drawing the seventh, eighth, and ninth. With all these racing vehicles, you just want more gas! Everything you know about Sealed is wrong; more two drops, less land. It's a revolt!


And speaking of racing, Drafting starts tomorrow. *Aether Revolt*'s first lap around the track. Will it be just as destructive to the Limited paradigms?


They'll be plenty more action tomorrow, and we'll see you then!
