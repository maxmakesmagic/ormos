In this weekend’s Modern-flavored variation on Quick Questions, we ask [Fact or Fiction](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fact+or+Fiction) about a few of Modern’s popular points of debate.


### Brian Braun-Duin

**Fact or Fiction: Modern should be a turn four format.**


Fact. I think that there’s not really that much interaction in Modern in terms of combo decks - there’s no [Force of Will](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Force+of+Will) or [Daze](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Daze) - there’s less ways to protect yourself from combo decks. So I think that having Modern be a turn four format gives players more time to play a game before they get killed and maybe find something that can actually interact with a combo. A lot of the answers costs three mana, and if players have decks that are killing on turn two or turn three there’s just not enough time to deal with it.


**Fact or Fiction: WotC should print new Modern-legal cards in non-Standard sets (such as Modern Masters).**


Fact. I think that it would be awesome to throw some new cards in there or even cards that are maybe Legacy-legal but aren’t in Modern they could print in a Modern Masters and put it into the format. It doesn’t necessarily have to be a new card. I think that that would really do some cool things for Modern, depending on what it is. Nothing too broken or powerful, but something that maybe fills a hole that Modern has or something fun that allows for new archetypes.


**Fact or Fiction: Modern would be a better format without fetch lands.**


Fact. I wrote an article, probably over a year ago, talking about getting rid of fetch lands in Modern. I think that it would really go a long way towards helping the format. For one, it allows you to play a lot more diverse mana bases. Some of the land cycles that don’t really see play in Modern would be a lot better when you don’t have to play shock lands and fetch lands in every single deck. Also a lot of the cards that are banned are banned specifically because of fetch lands - things like [Deathrite Shaman](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deathrite+Shaman) or [Treasure Cruise](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treasure+Cruise) or [Dig Through Time](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dig+Through+Time) - cards like that would be fine and perfectly fine to be legal cards if there weren’t fetch lands.

### Adrian Sullivan

**Modern should be a turn four format.**


Fiction. I don’t mind if it is a turn three format or a turn seven format so long as the games are awesome. You can have a really crappy format that’s a turn four format, you can have a really crappy format that’s a turn twelve format, or a really crappy format that’s a turn two format, and what I want is fun, period.


**WotC should print new Modern-legal cards in non-Standard sets (such as Modern Masters).**


Not at all. Fiction. Modern should be very easily understood as to what the cards are from. It shouldn’t be a detective novel to figure out what you can play.


**Modern would be a better format without fetch lands.**


Fact. Anything that searches the library slows down the game immensely and makes the game ultimately physically less fun. It slows it down to a point where way less Magic can even be played. So absolutely, I would love it if we had [Shadow of Doubt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shadow+of+Doubt) all the time in all Modern games.

### Cedric Phillips

**Modern should be a turn four format.**


Fiction. I think that Modern *can* be a turn four format, but I don’t think that it *should* be a turn four format. I think of Modern having diversity as being both fast and slow. [Ancestral Vision](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ancestral+Vision)s is a slower card, there are faster cards obviously, and faster decks like Infect. I’m fine with it being in-between. Some games will be fast, some games will be slow, I’m happy with either outcome.


**WotC should print new Modern-legal cards in non-Standard sets (such as Modern Masters).**


Fiction-ish. I just don’t think that’s that good of an idea. It just has a weird warping effect. Like [Scavenging Ooze](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scavenging+Ooze) in a Commander product before they put it in the core set - I think it’s better if they don’t do stuff like that.


**Modern would be a better format without fetch lands.**


Fiction. I understand that people don’t like shuffling, but besides that one of the appeals to Modern is that you can play any color or any colors, and I actually think that’s a good thing. Fetch lands are mostly bad for on-camera matches, but besides that the ability to open up what people can play and how many colors they can play I think is a net positive.

### Matt Costa

**Modern should be a turn four format.**


Fiction. I think that there’s always going to be some sort of imbalance in a format like Modern, when there’s this many different and powerful cards. That’s kind of an arbitrary restriction that I think ends up doing more harm than good a lot of the time.


**WotC should print new Modern-legal cards in non-Standard sets (such as Modern Masters).**


Fact. That sounds great to me. And I’d like if they did it in a way where you could play Limited with them, because that’s the best way to open cards and for most people to get their hands on cards.


**Modern would be a better format without fetch lands.**


Fact. I don’t know that it would be a better format, but it would be a more enjoyable format. The shuffling is just so miserable. And at this point people know how to build decks with fetch lands, they understand how to build the mana bases, so there’s not even that much creativity anymore in building a fetch land and Ravnica shock land mana base. So yeah, it would be better. I’m in.

### Mike Sigrist

**Modern should be a turn four format.**


Fiction. I think that Modern should be a place where everyone can play. Let the combo players play. I do agree that the decks shouldn’t be degenerate like Amulet Bloom, but [Splinter Twin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Splinter+Twin) is fine.


**WotC should print new Modern-legal cards in non-Standard sets (such as Modern Masters).**


Fact. I would love that. I would love to have new cards in Modern to make it more interesting and not have it affect Standard.


**Modern would be a better format without fetch lands.**


Fiction. It’s an eternal format, let people have good mana. I don’t care about the shuffling. Fiction.
