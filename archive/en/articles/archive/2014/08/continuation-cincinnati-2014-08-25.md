================================

 The Standard season is in full swing and we've had some time to digest what *Born of the Gods* has had to offer. With Grand Prix Cincinnati just concluded, let us take a quick peek at the state of the metagame and how we expect the Chinese to adapt accordingly. For starts, it was pretty much a great week for [Thoughtseize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtseize), as represented by 23 (out of a possible 32) copies in the Top 8.

 Putting three Esper Control decks in the Top 8 (and several more in the Top 16), we can safely conclude that this three-color control deck will continue to be one of the top contenders this week in Beijing. The weekend in Cincinnati culminated in an all-Esper finals between former Player of the Year Brad Nelson and eventual Champion Kyle Boggemes. [Nightveil Specter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nightveil+Specter) proved to be an major game-changer for the mirror, and it was exactly what Boggemes used to sweep the Top 8 to clinch his first Grand Prix title. We expect Chinese players to jump on the bandwagon, or at least be prepared to beat this monster control deck.

 One of the trumps is possibly Jacob Maynard's Naya Hexproof deck. Laden with downright-unfriendly and untargetable creatures like [Gladecover Scout](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gladecover+Scout), [Voice of Resurgence](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Voice+of+Resurgence) and [Witchstalker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Witchstalker), it even has [Boros Charm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Boros+Charm) and [Mending Touch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mending+Touch) to protect against the omnipresent [Supreme Verdict](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Supreme+Verdict). [Unflinching Courage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Unflinching+Courage) is traditionally good against aggressive strategies and [Madcap Skills](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Madcap+Skills) provides a light touch of "evasion" as well as an alarmingly fast clock in combination with [Ethereal Armor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ethereal+Armor).

![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Blood Baron of Vizkopa)






 Perhaps the only deck capable of handling a colossal hexproof, first-striking and lifelinking monster would be the black-based control decks packing [Devour Flesh](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Devour+Flesh). With [Thoughtseize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtseize) championed as one of the best cards in the format, black mages only need to make a choice of whether to end games with [Pack Rat](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pack+Rat), [Desecration Demon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Desecration+Demon) or [Blood Baron of Vizkopa](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Baron+of+Vizkopa). Orzhov Control propelled Jared Boettcher and Auston Tramper into the Top 8, so we expect Swamps and Plains (and [Temple of Silence](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Temple+of+Silence)) to remain popular in Beijing.

![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Herald of Torment)






 Speaking of ending games quickly with black creatures, Clyde Martin opted to pack a quicker punch with unassuming dudes like [Tormented Hero](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tormented+Hero), [Rakdos Cackler](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rakdos+Cackler) and [Pain Seer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pain+Seer). Packing a similar removal and hand disruption package as Boettcher and Tramper, Martin however opted to close games quickly with [Herald of Torment](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Herald+of+Torment) and [Mogis's Marauder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mogis%27s+Marauder). Bamf!

![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Ephara, God of the Polis)






 Lastly, the demise of Blue Devotion is mostly an urban legend, seeing how Jeffrey Pyka managed to bring [Thassa, God of the Sea](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thassa%2C+God+of+the+Sea) and [Ephara, God of the Polis](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ephara%2C+God+of+the+Polis) into the Top 8. Admittedly a little weak against Esper, we expect this archetype to be less popular this weekend, but never underestimate the power of [Master of Waves](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Master+of+Waves) and [Bident of Thassa](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bident+of+Thassa).



With over a thousand players in the tournament hall today, it marks the largest tournament in China to date! Stay tuned as we bring you the latest updates and may the odds be ever in your favor!
