**Tips on Using the Sealed Deck Builder** 


When you start the application, you'll see all your cards in a Card Pool tray. If you can't see all the cards in your pool, you can expand the size of your tray by dragging black tool bar upward.


Drag cards from this tray to the field of columns at the top to build your deck. You can hold Shift to move a stack of cards at once, or use Control (Command on Mac) to select and move specific cards together.


When you’re done choosing cards for your deck, add some basic lands with the "Add Land" tray.


When you've completed your deck, click "Share" (in the top right corner) to post your deck build on our forums and compare strategies!


By using a combination of the Sort and Hide options, you can quickly get an idea of what your build will be like. Want to see the distribution of creature costs? Sort by Cost, and hide all non-creature cards. Want to easily hide non-red cards? Hold Control and click the red hide button (it will auto-hide all other colors.) Hold Shift while clicking any hide option, and it will unhide all cards.


For more tips and specific explanations while using the application, click "Help" in the bottom right corner. This will turn on a tip roll-over function to guide you through your fist build.


For the best performance, use Firefox or Chrome. Currently, the Sealed Deck Builder is not compatible with any mobile browsers.
