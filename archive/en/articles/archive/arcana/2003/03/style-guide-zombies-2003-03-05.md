As the Mirari exerts its powerful influence over the races of Otaria, they all begin to mutate in strange ways.


The Zombies begin growing additional deformed appendages (and in some cases, extra heads). Here is the Style Guide sketch of a pit-fighting Zombie, shown complete with extra arms.


This sketch was used as a reference point for artists working on cards for the *Onslaught* block. *Legions* cards showing such mutated Zombies include [Noxious Ghoul](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Noxious+Ghoul), [Zombie Brute](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Zombie+Brute), and [Gempalm Polluter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gempalm+Polluter).
