Remember magazines? They were sort of like websites, except they only updated once a month. And they had much bigger ads in them. In fact, they used to be the standard way to advertise new products. Here, for example, are an assortment of full-page ads that were used to promote upcoming **Magic** sets from years gone by!

### *Ice Age*

### *Mirage*
