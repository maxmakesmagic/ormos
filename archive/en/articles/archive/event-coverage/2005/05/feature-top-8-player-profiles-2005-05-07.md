**Ryan Cimera**


**Age:** 16


**Hometown:** Colorado Springs


**Occupation:** Student


**Number of times playing on the Pro Tour:** This is my first.


**How did you qualify for Pro Tour-Philadelphia?** GP Seattle Top 8


**Number of GP/PT Top 8s:** 2


**Other Previous Magic accomplishments:** Friday Night Magic Champion


**What was your record on:**  
**Day 1:** 6-0  
**Day 2:** 4-2


**What deck are you playing and why? How long did it take you to decide what deck to play?** I am playing my sealed deck from last week with 20 extra cards and a sideboard. I had some trouble early on with a black-green list so I asked for a decklist.


**Please describe your testing process for your deck. Who built it?** Nicotine Jones on MTGO made the early builds. I picked it up and played it in some 8-man tournaments.


**What was the most surprising thing you saw during the first 12 rounds?** Kai Budde getting mana screwed.


**What do you think of your chances in the Top 8?** I have beaten that Gifts deck every time this weekend. This one has less removal and Heartbeat/Myojins, so I like my chances.


**What do you think of the Pro Tour Players Club? What Level are you?** It is pretty cool now that I get something from it.


**What is your favorite movie?** The one with action in it.

**Day 1:** 5-1  
**Day 2:** 4-2


**What deck are you playing and why? How long did it take you to decide what deck to play?** BGWU Splice. I think it's the best deck. I've been set on playing a Splice deck since I started testing, but I got my list on Thursday night.


**Please describe your testing process for your deck. Who built it?** Rogier Maaten and Gabe Walls built and tuned the deck, but it was my influence that made them play [Final *Judgment*](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Final+Judgment).

**What do you think of your chances in the Top 8?** Pretty good. I really like my deck.


**What do you think of the Pro Tour Players Club? What Level are you?** It's cool, but they should serve lunch like in Atlanta and there should be more pop. I'm Level 3 unless I win it all, then I'm Level 4.

**Hometown:** Essen, Germany


**Occupation:** College Student

PT New Orleans - 20th


**What was your record on:**  
**Day 1:** 6-0  
**Day 2:** 3-3


**What deck are you playing and why? How long did it take you to decide what deck to play?** I played Four-color Control. I picked it up Thursday night when I lost to it all the time with the deck I was originally going to play. It was a last-minute switch.


**Please describe your testing process for your deck. Who built it?** Harald Stein built it for a Premier Event on Magic Online. Before the Pro Tour I didn't play the deck at all. My only experience with it was the twelve matches I played in this event.


**What was the most surprising thing you saw during the first 12 rounds?** Against one of the Japanese players I lost Game 1 when he drew 12 off a [Myojin of Seeing Winds](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Myojin+of+Seeing+Winds). In the second game I Extracted for them, and missed! He had sided them out along with his Heartbeats of Spring for a bunch of cheaper Legends!


**What do you think of your chances in the Top 8?** I should have a small edge in the quarters. The semis look favorable for me no matter who advances. After that, we shall see.


**What do you think of the Pro Tour Players Club? What Level are you?** I'm Level 3 right now, unless I win the Pro Tour, in which case I'll level up. The additional bonuses are great for players like me, but the very best would rather have their end-of-year payout.


**What is your favorite movie?** Memento
