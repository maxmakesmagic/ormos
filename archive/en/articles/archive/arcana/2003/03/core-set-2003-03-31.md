The next "base set" of **Magic** will be *Eighth Edition*, releasing this summer. Unlike previous base sets—like *Sixth Edition* and *Seventh Edition*—*Eighth* will not refer to itself primarily as *"Eighth Edition,"* but rather as the "Core Set."



There were concerns that older base sets confused newer players—their primary audience—by making them feel like they "missed out" on five or six previous editions and were hopelessly behind.


Of course, the set logo will still be an "8" and it will be referred to by the experienced players (including us) as *Eighth Edition*.


In addition, the two-player Starter game will be referred to as the "Core Game."
