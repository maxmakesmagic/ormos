*Double Masters* Events Start This Week!
----------------------------------------


[As announced last week](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/magic-online/double-masters-magic-online-edition-and-gen-con-online-2020-07-23), we've moved the release of *Double Masters* events up to Friday, July 31! Leagues will start at 10 a.m. PT with Sealed Deck, Draft, and Phantom Draft available. In addition, we're kicking off the *Double Masters* season with a bang and have a Super Qualifier on Sunday, August 2! If you haven't checked out the updated *Magic* Premier Play schedule yet and what Super Qualifiers qualify you for, go [read that announcement](https://magic.gg/news/announcing-the-2020-2021-magic-esports-season).

*Magic Online* Meets Gen Con Online!
------------------------------------


We are happy to announce that *Magic Online* is joining forces with Gen Con and Pastimes this year to provide some unique *Magic* experiences, though, due to the pandemic, we're bringing the fun to our house! The *Magic* at Gen Con Online events start on July 30 and run through August 2. We'll be hosting the events, but Pastimes will be taking care of the entry and the prizes for these special events.


The event formats include Vintage, Legacy, *Double Masters*, and a special Gen Con Cube. In addition, we're testing a new feature with Gen Con Online that will let players build decks for the Vintage and Legacy events without having the cards in their collection! Check out [the article from last week](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/magic-online/double-masters-magic-online-edition-and-gen-con-online-2020-07-23) to see all the details, or head over to [Gen Con's website](https://www.gencon.com/event_finder?search=Magic+Online) to sign up.

Build Notes
-----------


* [Casualties of War](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Casualties+of+War) and [Planewide Celebration](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Planewide+Celebration) no longer cause game slowdown.
* [Everflowing Chalice](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Everflowing+Chalice)'s normal "Cast" action has been removed. It can still be cast with zero counters, but that zero option now needs to be chosen via the multikicker prompt.
* The appearance of card text in context menus has been updated.
* The contents of Treasure Chests have been updated. Please visit our [treasure chest page](https://magic.wizards.com/en/MTGO/articles/archive/magic-online/treasure-chest-card-list-info) for current contents and note that treasure chests always use the current collation, regardless of when they were acquired.
* The Draft Scene has been restyled to match the new MTGO style, though functionality has not changed (it may have moved, however). Please [click here](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/magic-online/double-masters-magic-online-edition-and-gen-con-online-2020-07-23#draftscene) for more information.
