Data from the last week of *Magic Online* Pioneer league play and this past weekend's tournaments don't indicate a conclusive need for changes at this time. While it's likely that future changes will be necessary as the environment develops, we prefer to let the metagame evolve more before evaluating the correct next steps.


Due to next week's [*Magic Online* Pioneer Week and the series of several scheduled PTQs](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/magic-online/magic-online-announcements-november-12-2019#Pioneer%20Week), we don't anticipate making changes to the Pioneer banned list on Monday, November 25. However, we will still post an update announcement that day and do reserve the option to make changes if needed.
