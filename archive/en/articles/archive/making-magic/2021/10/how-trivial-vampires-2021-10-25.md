======================

 Working in R&D since '95, Mark became Magic head designer in '03. His hobbies: spending time with family, writing about Magic in all mediums, and creating short bios. 






Today's article is another trivia column. In honor of *Innistrad: Crimson Vow* previews starting later this week, I'm focusing my questions on the Vampires of *Magic*. There are 30 questions total. Record your answers as you take the quiz and check below to see how you did.


If you enjoy this column, here are the three trivia columns I've done previously:


"[How Trivial](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/making-magic/how-trivial-2018-10-22)" – Trivia from 25 years of *Magic*.


"[A Trivial Pursuit](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/making-magic/trivial-pursuit-2020-03-23)" – Trivia about sets I've led or co-led.


"[How Trivial – Legendary Creatures](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/making-magic/how-trivial-legendary-creatures-2020-11-23)" – Trivia about legendary creatures.


Two caveats before I begin. One, all of today's questions are accurate as of the release of *Innsitrad: Midnight Hunt*. Two, none of the questions refer to any creature with changeling or one with all creature types. When I talk about Vampires, I mean they have the creature type Vampire in their Oracle wording.

**Answer to Question #1 – d. *Odyssey* (2001)**


[![](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&multiverseid=83)](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=83)[![](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&multiverseid=2465)](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=2465)
[![](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Ravenous+Vampire)](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ravenous+Vampire)[![](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&multiverseid=4686)](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=4686)
The first card printed with Vampire on its type line was [Sengir Vampire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sengir+Vampire) in *Limited Edition Alpha* in 1993. The second was [Krovikan Vampire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Krovikan+Vampire) in *Ice Age* two years later. [Ravenous Vampire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ravenous+Vampire) was then printed in 1996 in *Mirage*. A year later in *Tempest*, [Skyshroud Vampire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skyshroud+Vampire) was the fourth one printed. It wasn't until 2001, eight years into the game, that the fifth (and sixth and seventh) card with Vampire was printed in *Odyssey*. Those cards were [Repentant Vampire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Repentant+Vampire), [Stalking Bloodsucker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stalking+Bloodsucker), and [Vampiric Dragon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vampiric+Dragon). Years later, we did do a creature type update that added Vampire to several early cards that had a vampire flavor.


**Answer to Question #2 – c. [Crovax the Cursed](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crovax+the+Cursed) (*Stronghold*)**


[![](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&multiverseid=5106)](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=5106)
At the time Crovax was printed, Legendary was a creature type, Legend, and creatures, with rare exceptions, only had one creature type. To make Crovax a Vampire, it had to have the text "[Crovax the Cursed](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crovax+the+Cursed) counts as a Vampire" in its rules text.


**Answer to Question #3 – a. [Repentant Vampire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Repentant+Vampire) (*Odyssey*)**


[![](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Repentant+Vampire)](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Repentant+Vampire)[![](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&multiverseid=28755)](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=28755)
[Repentant Vampire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Repentant+Vampire) and [Gallantry](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gallantry) were both part of a larger piece of art drawn by artist Mark Tedin.


**Answer to Question #4 – c. Dragon**


[![](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&multiverseid=29969)](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=29969)
The first Vampire to have a second printed creature type was [Vampiric Dragon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vampiric+Dragon) from *Odyssey*. There has not yet been a Vampire Bat printed, although [Screeching Bat](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Screeching+Bat) // [Stalking Vampire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stalking+Vampire) from *Innsitrad* is a Bat on one side and a Vampire on the other. [Vampire Hounds](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vampire+Hounds) was in *Exodus* but was printed as a Hound. During the Grand Creature Type Update, it gained the Vampire creature type (and later became a Dog). The first Vampire Skeleton was [Skeletal Vampire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skeletal+Vampire) in *Guildpact*.


**Answer to Question #5 – b. Seven**

[Carrier Thrall](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Carrier+Thrall) (*Battle for Zendikar*) creates Eldrazi Scion. [Slaughter Specialist](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Slaughter+Specialist) (*Innistrad: Midnight Hunt*) creates Humans. [Felisa, Fang of Silverquill](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Felisa%2C+Fang+of+Silverquill) (*Commander 2021*) creates Inklings. There are no Vampires that create Servos.

[Vampire Champion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vampire+Champion) (*Rivals of Ixalan*) only has deathtouch.

There are five creatures that permanently grant +1/+1 to all Vampires, other than themselves.

**Answer to Question #13 – a. Carnival of Blood**


![Innistrad Intro Packs](https://media.magic.wizards.com/images/featured/EN_ISDIntroPacks_Product.png)


In original *Innistrad*, the Vampire deck was the red-black Intro Pack called Carnival of Blood.


**Answer to Question #14 – b. *Dark Ascension***


![Dark Ascension Booster Box](https://media.magic.wizards.com/images/featured/EN_DKABooster_Product.png)


The figure on the booster box of *Dark Ascension* was Sorin, a vampire. Liliana was on the booster box of both *Innistrad* and *Eldritch Moon*. Jace was on the booster box of *Shadows over Innistrad*.


**Answer to Question #15 – b. Count Dracula**


In top-down sets, we will often name playtest cards after the trope we're trying to capture so that everyone knows what top-down thing we're working with. The Creative team will then give it their own take and create a *Magic* version of the trope. Olivia, at the time named Count Dracula, won the internal rare poll for *Innistrad*. (The internal rare poll is a poll we let any Wizards employee take to help us gauge what players will especially like of the rares and mythic rares.)


**Answer to Question #16 – c. White-black-red**


White-black-red would allow you to have 271 different Vampires to choose from. Blue-black-red would allow you to have 244 Vampires to choose from. Black-red-green would give you 234 Vampires to choose from. White-blue-black would give you 227 Vampires to choose from.


**Answer to Question #17 – c. Grandson**


Sorin is [Edgar Markov](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Edgar+Markov)'s grandson.

[Elusive Tormentor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elusive+Tormentor) (*Shadows over Innistrad*) becomes [Insidious Mist](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Insidious+Mist), a blue card. [Valentin, Dean of the Vein](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Valentin%2C+Dean+of+the+Vein) (*Strixhaven: School of Mages*) can also be cast as [Lisette, Dean of the Root](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lisette%2C+Dean+of+the+Root), a green card. [Voldaren Pariah](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Voldaren+Pariah) (*Eldritch Moon*) becomes [Abolisher of Bloodlines](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Abolisher+of+Bloodlines), a colorless card. There aren't any mono-black double-faced Vampires with a red card on the back.

[Mirri the Cursed](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mirri+the+Cursed) (*Planar Chaos*) is a Vampire Cat. [Throatseeker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Throatseeker) (*Modern Horizons*) is a Vampire Ninja. [Nirkana Revenant](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nirkana+Revenant) (*Rise of the Eldrazi*) is a Vampire Shade. We have yet to print a Vampire Elf. Though, I hope we do someday.


**Answer to Question #21 – a. White-blue-black**


There are two blue-black-red Vampire commanders—[Garza Zol, Plague Queen](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Garza+Zol%2C+Plague+Queen) (*Coldsnap*) and [Jeleva, Nephalia's Scourge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jeleva%2C+Nephalia%27s+Scourge) (*Commander (2013 Edition)*). There are three white-black-red Vampire commanders—[Edgar Markov](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Edgar+Markov) (*Commander (2017 Edition)*); [Licia, Sanguine Tribune](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Licia%2C+Sanguine+Tribune) (*Commander (2017 Edition)*); and [Mathas, Fiend Seeker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mathas%2C+Fiend+Seeker) (*Commander (2017 Edition)*).

There are currently zero white-blue-black Vampire commanders.


**Answer to Question #22 – a. Falkenrath**


There are twelve cards with Falkenrath in their name ([Anje Falkenrath](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Anje+Falkenrath), [Falkenrath Aristocrat](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Falkenrath+Aristocrat), [Falkenrath Exterminator](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Falkenrath+Exterminator), [Falkenrath Gorger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Falkenrath+Gorger), [Falkenrath Marauders](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Falkenrath+Marauders), [Falkenrath Noble](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Falkenrath+Noble), [Falkenrath Perforator](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Falkenrath+Perforator), [Falkenrath Pit Fighter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Falkenrath+Pit+Fighter), [Falkenrath Reaver](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Falkenrath+Reaver), [Falkenrath Torturer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Falkenrath+Torturer), [Heir of Falkenrath](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Heir+of+Falkenrath), and [Talons of Falkenrath](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Talons+of+Falkenrath)). There are eight cards with Markov in their name ([Chosen of Markov](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chosen+of+Markov), [Edgar Markov](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Edgar+Markov), [Markov Blademaster](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Markov+Blademaster), [Markov Crusader](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Markov+Crusader), [Markov Dreadknight](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Markov+Dreadknight), [Markov Patrician](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Markov+Patrician), [Markov Warlord](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Markov+Warlord), and [Sorin Markov](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sorin+Markov)).

**Answer to Question #23 – c. Six**


[![](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Rayami%2C+First+of+the+Fallen)](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rayami%2C+First+of+the+Fallen)[![](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Vito%2C+Thorn+of+the+Dusk+Rose)](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vito%2C+Thorn+of+the+Dusk+Rose)
There are many Vampires with four words in their name. There is one with five—[Rayami, First of the Fallen](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rayami%2C+First+of+the+Fallen) (*Commander (2019 Edition)*). But the most is six—[Vito, Thorn of the Dusk Rose](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vito%2C+Thorn+of+the+Dusk+Rose) (*Core Set 2021*).


**Answer to Question #24 – d. Sengir**


[![](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&multiverseid=83)](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=83)[![](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&multiverseid=489281)](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=489281)
The original text of [Sengir Vampire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sengir+Vampire) in *Limited Edition Alpha* refers to both "counter" and "turn," and surprisingly "dies" long before it became a keyword action. The card simply calls itself Vampire, never using the word "Sengir."


**Answer to Question #25 – d. *Zendikar***


Interestingly, the decision to make Vampires into a characteristic creature type that shows up in low rarities was made during the development of original *Zendikar*. The design file didn't have any Vampires at common or uncommon. For more on this story, read my column "[Care for a Bite?](https://hasbroinc.sharepoint.com/sites/wizards/communications/Shared%20Documents/DailyMTG%20Docs/2021/MM/ADD%20LINK%20-%20https:/magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/making-magic/care-bite-2009-10-19)" from Vampire Week back in 2009.

[![](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Dusk+Feaster)](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dusk+Feaster)[![](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Felisa%2C+Fang+of+Silverquill)](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Felisa%2C+Fang+of+Silverquill)[![](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&multiverseid=43615)](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=43615)
[Dusk Feaster](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dusk+Feaster) (*Eldritch Moon*) has delirium. [Felisa, Fang of Silverquill](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Felisa%2C+Fang+of+Silverquill) (*Commander (2021 Edition)*) has mentor. [Soul Collector](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soul+Collector) (*Scourge*) has morph. There are no Vampires with devour yet, sadly.


**Answer to Question #27 – a. *Fifth Dawn***


[![](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Mephidross+Vampire)](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mephidross+Vampire)
[Mephidross Vampire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mephidross+Vampire) from *Fifth Dawn* has this rules text.


**Answer to Question #28 – c. [Rakish Heir](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rakish+Heir)**


[![](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&multiverseid=234441)](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=234441)
The flavor text comes from [Rakish Heir](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rakish+Heir). [Bloodcrazed Neonate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodcrazed+Neonate)'s flavor text: "*While elder vampires select their meals with care, the newly sired frenzy at the first whiff.*"


[Falkenrath Marauders](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Falkenrath+Marauders)'s flavor text: "*No slinking in the dark for them, no luring whispers. They claim their prey in the speed and glory of the hunt.*"


[Stromkirk Noble](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stromkirk+Noble)'s flavor text: "*A responsible king walks among his subjects.*"


**Answer to Question #29 – d. Ravnica**


Dominaria, Innistrad, and Ixalan have all been home to Vampire Knights, while Ravnica has not.
