With shadows looming over Innistrad and the release of *Shadows over Innistrad* already looming on the horizon, the new set was naturally a big topic of conversation this weekend. We wanted to hear from several pro players which of the cards previewed so far they liked the best.

**Gold-level pro Christian Calcano:** I thought Jace, Unraveler of Secrets was sweet. The +1 is a control player's dream! I can already see it now: a Bant planeswalker deck with [Oath of Nissa](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oath+of+Nissa), [Oath of Gideon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oath+of+Gideon), [Nissa, Voice of Zendikar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nissa%2C+Voice+of+Zendikar), [Narset Transcendent](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Narset+Transcendent) (which is underrated, by the way), and Jace, Unraveler of Secrets. Seems great!

**Two-time Pro Tour semifinalist Patrick Dickmann:** Both from a flavor as well as a gameplay perspective I like Arlinn Kord. Awesome design. I especially like transform cards where you have more control over the transformation than with your standard Werewolf cards.

**No. 16 Joel Larsson:** Arlinn Kord, the red-green planeswalker. It is comparable to [Elspeth, Knight-Errant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elspeth%2C+Knight-Errant), which is not a low remark. Besides the two-color restriction, the card actually seems more powerful than Elspeth to me. And you don't have to build around Arlinn Kord at all; just like [Huntmaster of the Fells](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Huntmaster+of+the+Fells), you can play it in any deck and be happy with it. I also think Anguished Unmaking can be really good, but three life is a cost. Hopefully there will be aggro decks that can punish the life loss so that it would make for an interesting choice of how many copies to play. Finally, Thing in the Ice is super powerful but needs the right shell. There are like infinite crazy cards in this set!

***Magic Online* Champion Magnus Lantto:**  I really like Sorin, Grim Nemesis. I'm not sure why I'm so drawn to the card as I'm usually not a control player, but he seems powerful and I'm looking forward to building decks with Sorin. In general, all planeswalkers look good.

**Hall of Famer Ben Stark:** Sorin, Grim Nemesis seems incredibly powerful. To have effectively a six-mana [Fireball](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fireball)/[Corrupt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Corrupt) mix to deal with opposing threats is pretty good for a control deck. With this ability, Sorin can help you come back from behind. And if it's not going to die, then it's a planeswalker that can do other things for you.

**No. 10 Fabrizio Anteri:** Deathcap Cultivator. I like these colors. Since [Elves of Deep Shadow](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elves+of+Deep+Shadow), I don't think we've had a green creature that could tap for black mana.

**Hall of Famer Gabriel Nassif:** Jace, Unraveler of Secrets looks great, especially when compared to the old five-mana [Jace, Memory Adept](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace%2C+Memory+Adept).

**Gold-level pro Oliver Polak-Rottmann:** To the Slaughter is a beautiful design, especially with all of these great new planeswalkers.

**No. 18 Martin Dang:** Arlinn Kord, Thing in the Ice, and also all the cards with delirium. They're so hard to exploit but at the same time have a great potential to affect the format a lot if you find the right deck.
