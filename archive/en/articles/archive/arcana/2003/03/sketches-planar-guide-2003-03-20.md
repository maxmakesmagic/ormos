This week's "Sketches" looks at Eric Peterson's [Planar Guide](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Planar+Guide) from *Legions*. 


### 1. Art Description


These are the instructions given to the artist:


"Color: White  
 Location: Daru Plains  
 Action: Show a refugee cleric standing in the Daru Plains as others around him in the background appear to be transparent."


[Planar Guide](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Planar+Guide) was called "Daru Flickerer" in playtest, due to its ability's family resemblance with the *Urza's Destiny* card [Flicker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flicker).


### 2. Sketches


Here are two preliminary sketches of "Daru Flickerer" submitted by Eric Peterson. 


The art team liked the dramatic sun rays of the top sketch, but they wanted Eric to follow the *Legions* style guide for refugee clerics. According to the style guide, the robes and armor of white-aligned refugee creatures are [fashioned from the reeds of the Daru Plains](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/askwizards/0103#1-24-2003). Also, the art team requested that the Flickerer's eyes be whited out for a less friendly, more serious effect.


### 3. Final Art


Here is a large version of the final piece. The end result is one tough cleric.


### 4. Card


Finally, here is the card as you'll see it in booster packs.
