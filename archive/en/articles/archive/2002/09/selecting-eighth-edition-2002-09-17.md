Selecting *Eighth Edition*
==========================



 Posted in **Feature**
 on September 17, 2002

Go to the "Selecting *Eighth Edition*" promo page [here](http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=mtgcom/vote8e/home).


[Rabid Wombat](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rabid+Wombat) is one of those cards that is a little sillier than we normally like to print, but we understand that people have an attachment to it, and we're perfectly willing to put it into *Eighth Edition*. Similarly, [Crusade](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crusade) was rotated out of the base set, partially due to power level concerns, but with white needing a kick-start, we could see it coming back.


The dust has settled, and it seems you all have other ideas. Nostalgia, please have a seat.


[Yavimaya Enchantress](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Yavimaya+Enchantress) and [Glorious Anthem](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glorious+Anthem) beat out their older siblings, and neither contest was particularly close. I'll leave the "whys" and "hows" to other speculative writers around the 'Net; I'm just here with the facts. (And the fact is, an 0/1 for ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161225105850im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless2.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20220123123600im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/green.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20220123123600im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/green.gif) *is* pretty awful when you think about it.)


Nostalgia saved face by winning both art votes, with *Tempest* versions of [Trained Armodon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Trained+Armodon) and [Boil](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Boil) getting the nod.
