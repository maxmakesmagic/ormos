Although Avacyn is missing from Innistrad, her symbol is everywhere. We originally covered this in [September](/en/articles/archive/symbol-avacyn-2011-09-29) by looking at several pieces of art from *Innistrad* that showed the symbol. Since then, *Dark Ascension* has come out, and that means it's time to take another look. Hooray!

The most prominent place to see the symbol of Avacyn is in the iconography of her church. For example, there's this collar:

You'd think those collars would be unique to the priesthood, but they've also collared their griffins:

Even Clerics who aren't working inside the church wield Avacyn's symbol. [Thraben Doomsayer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thraben+Doomsayer) has a staff that should look very familiar at this point.

The obvious symbol on [Executioner's Hood](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Executioner%27s+Hood) is on the wall in the background. But a closer inspection of the hood itself reveals that the symbol has been stiched onto the face!

The symbol of Avacyn is so widespread, it's even in common use as a gravestone, as seen in [Grafdigger's Cage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grafdigger%27s+Cage)

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/arcana/919_grafdiggerscage.jpg)[Grafdigger's Cage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grafdigger%27s+Cage) | Art by [Daniel Ljunggren](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&artist=%5B%22Daniel+Ljunggren%22%5D)

In fact, we've already shown you gravestones in that shape. Scroll back up to that [Silverclaw Griffin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Silverclaw+Griffin) and check out the graveyard. There are a couple of broken stones that clearly used to be in the shape of the symbol of Avacyn.
