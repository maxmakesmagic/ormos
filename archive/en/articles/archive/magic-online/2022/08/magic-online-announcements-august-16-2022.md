Limited Showcase Opens This Weekend
-----------------------------------


The penultimate events of each season, Showcase Opens allow anyone to try their hand at earning an invitation to the Showcase. Players don't need to earn points or another qualification to enter, and because these events are Sealed, players don't even need a deck. The winner of each Open will get invitations to both the Season 2 Showcase in October and Pro Tour Charlotte in 2023.


These events are also the last chance to earn enough [Leaderboard](https://magic.wizards.com/en/mtgo/leaderboard) points to grab one of two At-Large invites to the *Magic Online* Champions Showcase.


Showcase Opens are scheduled as follows:





| ***DATE*** | ***TIME*** | ***UTC*** | ***FORMAT*** | ***INVITATION*** |
| Saturday, August 20, 2022 | 7:00 a.m. | 14:00 | 2X2 Sealed | 2022 Season 2 Champions Showcase (MTGO)
 Pro Tour Charlotte (Tabletop) |
| Sunday, August 21, 2022 | 7:00 a.m. | 14:00 | 2X2 Sealed | 2022 Season 2 Champions Showcase (MTGO)
 Pro Tour Charlotte (Tabletop) |


**IMPORTANT**: Because *Double Masters 2022* is being used to Opens this round, each Open's entry options are 50 Event Tickets or 500 Play Points. Set prizes for the Top 8 will be *Double Masters 2022*.

Update: Season 2 QP Expiration & Limited Preliminary Prizes
-----------------------------------------------------------


The extension of validity for Season 2 Qualifier Points ends tomorrow. Your last chance to enter Limited Preliminaries using QPs is today.  
  

QP prizes in these preliminaries are now Season 3, usable only for other event types as normal.


Because of this, the prize payout for Limited Preliminaries is currently:


* 4 Wins – 750 Play Points and 40 Season 3 QP
* 3 Wins – 450 Play Points and 20 Season 3 QP
* 2 Wins – 150 Play Points and 10 Season 3 QP

This prize schedule remains in effect until *Double Masters 2022* Limited Preliminaries conclude in two weeks.

August Special Events: *Double Masters 2022* Duels
--------------------------------------------------


We have heard plenty of feedback from players regarding adding Limited to the menu of weekly Format Challenge choices.


As an experiment, we are trying out a new event type on weekends this month that has a set number of rounds (like Preliminaries) but has greater prizes (like Challenges). For now, we are working these in around the existing schedule.


***Double Masters 2022*** **Duels**


**Time**: Through August 28, Saturdays and Sundays at 1 a.m. PT (8:00 UTC) and noon PT (19:00 UTC)


* Replaces Limited Prelims in the following time slots: 1 a.m. PT Saturday, noon PT Saturday, and noon PT Sunday
* New slot at 1 a.m. PT Sunday
	+ Reminder – this weekend at 1 a.m. there are no Duels—just a normal Prelim on Saturday.

**Entry**: 45 Event Tickets or 450 Play Points  
**Format**: *Double Masters 2022* Sealed Deck  
**Min-Max Players**: 65–256  
**Rounds**: 7 (no Playoff)  
**Prizes**:





| Wins | Prizes |
| --- | --- |
| 7 | 900 Play Points, 50 Treasure Chests, 1 *Double Masters 2022* regular set, and 40 Season 3 QPs |
| 6 | 600 Play Points, 25 Treasure Chests, and 30 Season 3 QPs |
| 5 | 450 Play Points, 10 Treasure Chests, and 20 Season 3 QPs |
