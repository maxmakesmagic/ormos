Black is my favorite color in **Magic**, and although I'm not a big fan of Zombies, I do like the Returned of *Theros*. Those gold masks look really cool, and the Returned have a sort of melancholy about them that Kelly Digges explored in his story, "[Asphodel](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/uncharted-realms/asphodel-2013-12-10)." Trick has looked at the Returned a couple times (in "[Intrusion](https://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/arcana/1358)" and "[The Returned](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/daily-deck/returned-2013-12-04)") so let's do it again, this time with one from *Theros* and one from *Born of the Gods*!


Gray Merchant of Asphodel
=========================


"Gary" (as it's affectionately known) is popular in both Limited and Standard, so it seemed like a good place to start. It's a little hard to see at card size, but there is a trail of gold coins dropping out of the gray merchant's bag, as instructed in the art direction:


Maybe a sack has fallen off his back and split open, and coins spill out onto the ground. A trail of lost coins, which has fallen out of one of his sacks, can be seen on the road behind him.


Take a look:

Forlorn Pseudamma
=================


Moving on to *Born of the Gods*, let's start with the art description:


Action: Deep within a cavern lit from some unknown source show a female Returned. She is a "pseudamma"—a Returned who steals the children of the living, eventually turning them into Returned as well.  

She is with two children, one holding each hand. They are roughly 4 to 6 years of age. The pseudamma has a signature golden mask of the Returned, but the two children forms don't have a golden mask yet—they are still living, but faceless.


She should feel disconnected from the children and they from her, they simply blindly shamble where she leads.


Creepy.

And, yes, there's a story that talks a bit about the pseudamma as well: Jennifer Clarke Wilkes's "[Dance of the Flitterstep](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/dance-flitterstep-2014-02-19)." Enjoy!
