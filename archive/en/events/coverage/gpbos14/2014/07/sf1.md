After earning a Top 8 at Grand Prix Prague and getting second at Grand Prix Vienna, Robin Dolar is hungry for a Grand Prix victory. Dolar brought his W/B/G Rock deck--the White/Black/Green midrange deck that put two players into the top eight. His opponent, Phillip Napoli, was the fan favorite. The New York City player was playing Blue/Green Infect. While Napoli openly admitted that this was not his best match-up, anything can happen in a match of *Magic*.


**The Games**


![](https://media.wizards.com/2014/events/gpbos14/Napoli-Dolar.jpg)*Robin Dolar and Phillip Napoli*




A [Thoughtseize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtseize) from Dolar was the first play of the game. It revealed Napoli's hand: two [Mutagenic Growth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mutagenic+Growth)s, [Distortion Strike](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Distortion+Strike), [Groundswell](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Groundswell), [Verdant Catacombs](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Verdant+Catacombs), [Inkmoth Nexus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inkmoth+Nexus), and a [Misty Rainforest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Misty+Rainforest). Dolar opted to take [Distortion Strike](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Distortion+Strike) and Napoli simply played an [Inkmoth Nexus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inkmoth+Nexus) on his turn.



Dolar cast a [Tarmogoyf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf) on his second turn while Napoli simply attacked for a single poison damage with his [Inkmoth Nexus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inkmoth+Nexus). Dolar cast a [Lingering Souls](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lingering+Souls) on his third turn, stifling Napoli's hope of getting through with his Nexus on the following turn.


Dolar attacked with his team and Napoli took the opportunity to block Dolar's [Tarmogoyf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf) with his Nexus and use his pair of [Mutagenic Growth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mutagenic+Growth)s to take out the [Lhurgoyf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lhurgoyf). Napoli fell to 8 after the attack. Post-combat, Dolar played Liliana and used her -2 ability to force Napoli to sacrifice his [Inkmoth Nexus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inkmoth+Nexus).


Without another infector from Napoli, he was left with attempting to win via normal damage--Napoli fetched up a [Dryad Arbor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dryad+Arbor) and played a [Noble Hierarch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Noble+Hierarch). His first attack was thwarted by a Spirit token, his second by a [Scavenging Ooze](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scavenging+Ooze). Facing down lethal damage, Napoli scooped up his cards.

*Robin Dolar*

Napoli started the second game by using [Gitaxian Probe](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gitaxian+Probe) to get a look at Dolar's hand. He saw a pair of [Inquisition of Kozilek](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inquisition+of+Kozilek)s and a [Dark Confidant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dark+Confidant) among some lands.



Unsurprisingly, Dolar cast Inquisition on turn one, getting a peek at Napoli's hand of [Inkmoth Nexus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inkmoth+Nexus), Apostle's [Blessing](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blessing), [Verdant Catacombs](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Verdant+Catacombs) and a pair of [Dispel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dispel)s. Dolar took the Apostle's [Blessing](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blessing).


Dolar opted to play [Dark Confidant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dark+Confidant) over a second [Inquisition of Kozilek](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inquisition+of+Kozilek)--knowing that at best it could only get a [Dispel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dispel). Napoli had the opportunity to attack with his [Inkmoth Nexus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inkmoth+Nexus) for two Poison, while Dolar played a [Tarmogoyf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf) and [Stirring Wildwood](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stirring+Wildwood).


Napoli drew a [Blighted Agent](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blighted+Agent) on his turn, cast it, and attacked for another two poison with his [Inkmoth Nexus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inkmoth+Nexus). Dolar had an opening to [Abrupt Decay](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Abrupt+Decay) Napoli's [Blighted Agent](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blighted+Agent) and drop him to 7 with an attack.

*Phillip Napoli*

Napoli looked to his draw step for a pump spell that could give his Nexus +4/+4. When he missed, he wasn't completely out of the woods, putting Dolar at 7 poison and having a pair of blockers behind.



Dolar had exactly what he needed--his one-of [Engineered Explosives](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Engineered+Explosives). He used it to wipe away Napoli's blockers clear his way to the finals
