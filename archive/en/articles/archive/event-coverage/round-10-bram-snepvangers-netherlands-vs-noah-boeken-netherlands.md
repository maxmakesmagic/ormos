Snepvangers and Boeken are both Dutch players, and often practice-draft together in Amsterdam. Even so, they are much more competitors than friends, and this certainly can be considered a grudge match. Snepvangers, who has been around the Pro Tour for a long time and has achieved a number of top 32 finishes along with top 8 GP finishes, did not recognize the potential in the young player when Boeken first became competitive. Having proven himself later on, Boeken, who is the defending European Champion, convinced many of Snepvangers playtest partners to work with him instead. The relationship between these two top Dutch players has since thawed a bit, but there is still a layer of tension that can be sensed in their otherwise friendly match.


### Game 1


Both players were off to a slow start - but Snepvangers' was slightly faster. He summoned Disciple of Kangee and an Alpha Kavu, with no interruptions from Boeken, whose first creature was a Coastal Drake, enchanted with Sisay's Ingenuity.


Noah thought to have stopped Snepvangers's attack when he summoned an Emblazoned Golem with kicker: 3 (a 4/5 creature), but Snepvangers attacked with all of his creatures and used Gaea's Might to destroy the powerful artifact. Boeken's position was quickly becoming desperate - down to ten life points, his lonely Coastal Drake facing four creatures on the other side of the table. He traded the Drake in combat for Aurora Griffin and used an Exclude to counter a Kavu Climber, then tapped out to summon Razorfin Hunter and Sparring Golem, and cast Scorching Lava on the Disciple, suddenly in control of the table.


Snepvangers was waiting for just that - with Boeken having used his Exclude and tapped out, he was able to summon Sabertooth Nishoba - a creature Boeken's deck would have a very hard time dealing with. Boeken enchanted his Sparring Golem with Sleeper's Robe, but the card he drew didn't help against Nishoba. He summoned Tahngarth - an amazing card, that still wasn't much help. At eight life points, Boeken had only one more turn to find an answer to Snepvangers's monster. To add even more pressure, Boeken put a pair of Kavu - Ancient and Alpha - into play. Boeken's next two draws - his draw step and the card provided by Sleeper's Robe - did not offer a solution, and he packed away his cards.


### Game 2


Snepvangers was not going to win this game.


He started off by taking a triple mulligan. In competitive Magic, taking a double mulligan is usually a death sentence - a situation where you will rarely win a game. Of course it is possible - Patrick Mello actually pulled it off in last round's feature match - but not likely. As to winning off a four card opening hand - such cases are extraordinarily rare.


Snepvangers was doing all right for such a bad start. He drew enough lands, and an Urborg Elf. Boeken generated further card economy by using his Razorfin Hunter to kill an Elf, and Excluding one of Snepvangers' creatures. Snepvangers summoned a Jungle Barrier, but Boeken pressed on, destroying it with Stormscape Battlemage. Mourning Zombie and the Battlemage tag-teamed Snepvangers, who was out of cards he could cast on a pair of Plains and a Forest. Down to six life, he cast Harrow, finally gaining access to the other mana colors.



> "I drew a lot of lands again," commented Boeken.  
> 
> "Are you complaining?" I asked, eliciting a chuckle from manahosed Snepvangers.  
> 
> "Yeah, a little bit." Boeken attacked with his creatures, ending the very one-sided game.


### Game 3


"His deck is way better than mine," Boeken told teammate Ryan Fuller while shuffling. It would be an uphill battle for him in the final game. Believing he will win if his draw is decent, Snepvangers chose to let Boeken play first. This paid off big time - Boeken drew a one-land hand and had to mulligan. His new hand was excellent though, while Snepvangers' would be good as long as he drew several more lands - he started with two in his opening hand.


Boeken went on the offensive with Sparring Golem and Blind Seer. Normally an excellent early blocker, Snepvangers' Pincer Spider could not do much about those two creatures. Down to thirteen, Snepvangers finally stopped the beat-down by casting a Jungle Barrier. A second Barrier made it into play to Noah's dismay, followed by an Urborg Elf. Realizing that he will not get through for any more damage in a conventional way, Boeken chose to enchant his own Blind Seer with Cursed Flesh, in order to be able to attack for two damage every turn.


Snepvangers attacked back, trading his Disciple in combat for Sparring Golem, then summoned Benalish Lancer with kicker. Boeken, who was still stuck at four mana, attacked and summoned a Volcanic Imp in a desperate attempt to outrace Snepvangers. Bram would have none of it - he enchanted the Spider with Squee's Embrace, attacked bringing Boeken down to eight life points, and summoned another large monster - a Kavu Chameleon. Boeken was able to chump-block his opponent's larger creatures for a turn, but ultimately he had no way to survive the onslaught.


**Final Result:** Snepvangers 2 - Boeken 1
