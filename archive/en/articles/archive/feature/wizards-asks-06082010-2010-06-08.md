*What's the funniest creature type in **Magic**?*

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/mtgcom/authorpics/authorpic_markrosewater.jpg)**Mark Rosewater: Magic** has numerous humorous creature types. Among my short list are:

Squirrels  
 Beebles  
 Atogs  
 Goblins  
 Chicken  
 Clamfolk

The one that most tickles my funny bone are chickens. Chickens have long been a comedy staple (see rubber chicken) and I was very happy to use them in *Unglued*. If we eliminate the *Un*-sub types (the ones that only exist in silver-bordered landâ€”Chickens would just be Birds in black-bordered land), I would have to go with Squirrels. If Goblins are red's attempt at humor, to me Squirrels are green's. Green loves the idea that things that seem innocent and silly can, in fact, kick your butt. And Squirrels just make me chuckle whenever I see them.
