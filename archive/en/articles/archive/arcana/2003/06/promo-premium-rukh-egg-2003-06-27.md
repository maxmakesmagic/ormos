To the right is a scan of the promotional premium [Rukh Egg](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rukh+Egg) that will be given away to players at the upcoming Global Celebration tournaments (which are akin to "prereleases" for *Eighth Edition*), while supplies last.

This black-bordered card features a silver leaf "10" logo in the lower left corner of the art box and a **Magic** 10th Anniversary logo behind the card text. It also showcases the new look of premium cards in the updated card frame. It is a real beauty!

Global Celebration tournaments will be held at the GenCon game convention in Indianapolis and at stores all over the world on the weekend of July 26th and 27th. Locations will be available on this site in the next couple days, so stay tuned!
