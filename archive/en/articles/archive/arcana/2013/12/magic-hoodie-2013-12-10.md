 Mike first played with Ice Age and became the copy editor for DailyMTG.com in December 2011. Before DailyMTG, he was an editor on D&D's Dragon magazine for four years. 






In [today's Serious Fun article](/en/articles/archive/serious-fun/tis-season-2013-12-10), Bruce Richard provides a buyer's guide for the **Magic** player on your list (or for you, if you hand the article to your loved ones!). One of the gift ideas he mentions are [mana hoodies](http://www.mtgmerch.com/catalogsearch/result/?q=hoodie) from [MTGMerch.com](http://www.mtgmerch.com).

 We wanted to bring these up because once they sell out they are gone for good. Also because they are quite awesome. Don't take my word for it, though; check it out:

 Something else we wanted to mention: if you order $50 or more on [MTGMerch.com](http://www.mtgmerch.com) before December 15, you will get free shipping!
