| Find a Game Day Near You! |

Game Days are the first opportunity for you to play Standard on a global scale with the newest cards.

Where Can I Play?
**Local Stores** - Game Day events are happening worldwide on March 1-2, 2014! Check out our [tournament locator](http://ww2.wizards.com/StoreAndEventLocator/) to find an event near you. Contact the organizer of the event for details on event start times and entry fees. 

What Happens There?
Game Day events are Standard format tournaments. Contact the organizer of the event for tournament details.

**What Does a "Standard Deck" Mean?**
The Standard format uses only the newest sets the game has to offer. The current block, the block that was released the previous year, and the most recent core set are all legal to play in a Standard deck. 

 For more information on Standard, [click here.](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/tcg/resources.aspx?x=judge/resources/sfrstandard)

 The following sets are Standard legal: *Return to Ravnica*™, *Gatecrash*™, *Dragon's Maze*™, *Magic 2014*™ Core Set, *Theros*, and *Born of the Gods*. 

**What Do I Get?**
 All participants receive an exclusive  full-art promo card (while supplies last). The Top 8 players each receive an exclusive  full-art foil promo card. The cards are awarded to the Top 8 players even if the tournament cuts only to the Top 4. 

 In addition, the 1st-place winner of *Theros* Game Day will receive an exclusive Playmat. 

**Battle the Horde**
 Bring the Hero Cards you've earned at *Born of the Gods* Prerelease and Launch Weekend to help you defeat the Battle the Horde Challenge Deck at *Born of the Gods* Game Day. This special deck is a special activity that you can challenge beginning with Game Day, between rounds or at your convenience. It's not a part of the tournament, but you'll want to defeat the Horde to earn the sixth Hero Card on the Hero's Path. 

 You can use up to three Hero Cards to help you against the Battle the Horde Challenge Deck. To learn more about the Hero's Path, visit [MTGHerosPath.com](http://archive.wizards.com/Promo/HerosPath/Default.aspx). 

**Have Questions?**
 Players and tournament organizers who have general questions about Game Day or any other Wizards of the Coast offerings should contact Customer Service or the WPN Support Team at  [Wizards.com/CustomerService](http://wizards.custhelp.com/), or call 800-324-6496 in North America, or check the global contact list for their local Customer Service office at [Wizards.com/GlobalCS.](http://company.wizards.com/contactus)
