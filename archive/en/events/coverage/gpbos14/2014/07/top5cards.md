 5. [Birthing Pod](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Birthing+Pod)



 Thirty-two players used [Birthing Pod](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Birthing+Pod) based decks to get themselves to day two of Grand Prix Boston-Worcester--more than any other deck. When [Birthing Pod](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Birthing+Pod) gets online it acts as a one-card combo deck and a control deck that plays the perfect card every turn. When it isn't, the deck regularly gets the highest-value creatures--like [Ranger of Eos](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ranger+of+Eos), [Reveillark](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reveillark), and voice of resurgence--into play anyway. Pro Tour *Born of the Gods* finalist Jacob Wilson decided to stick to his guns and pilot Melira Pod again this weekend. Narrowly missing top eight, he defeated players round after round using [Birthing Pod](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Birthing+Pod) both to combo his opponents out and to create an army of unbeatable rares.
