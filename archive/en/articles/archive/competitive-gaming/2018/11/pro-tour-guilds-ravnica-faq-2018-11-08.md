PRO TOUR *GUILDS OF RAVNICA* BASICS
===================================


Here are all the key details that you need to know about Pro Tour *Guilds of Ravnica*:


* The Pro Tour is a three-day invitation-only event featuring some of greatest *Magic* pros as well as top-finishing Grand Prix competitors, Hall of Famers, and players who found success in Regional Pro Tour Qualifiers that took place a few weeks ago. Those players will be competing for a share of the $250,000 prize pool, with $50,000 going to the winner.
* Pro Tour *Guilds of Ravnica* is the first Pro Tour of the 2018–19 season, and the kickoff event for the Pro Tour Team Series this season. [The full teams were announced a few weeks ago on DailyMTG](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/competitive-gaming/2018-19-pro-tour-team-series-rosters-2018-10-25), and you can find out more about the Team Series on the [Pro Tour Team Series page](https://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/ptgrn).
* The formats for Friday and Saturday are three rounds of Booster Draft—using three *Guilds of Ravnica* boosters—and five rounds of Standard Constructed. All matches on Friday and Saturday are best-two-out-of-three games.
* In Standard Constructed, the following sets can be used to assemble a 60-card deck and a sideboard of up to 15 cards: *Ixalan*, *Rivals of Ixalan*, *Dominaria*, *Core Set 2019*, and *Guilds of Ravnica*. This includes Buy-a-Box promos and Planeswalker Deck exclusives tied to the card sets listed here.
* All players with 12 or more match points (a 4-4 record or better) at the end of the first day will advance to Day Two of the competition.
* The Top 8 players at the end of Day Two will advance to Sunday's playoff, featuring a traditional single-elimination bracket.
* All matches played on Sunday are best-three-out-of-five Standard Constructed, with the first two games featuring pre-sideboard action.
* The winner gets $50,000 and Platinum status in the Pro Tour Players Club for the next four cycles.
* The $250,000 prize pool pays down to 64th place, awarding a minimum of $1,000. In addition, all players with 33 or more match points at the end of the Pro Tour's Swiss rounds will receive an invitation to compete in the next Pro Tour.

Pro Tour *Guilds of Ravnica* is one heck of a way to kick off a new Standard Constructed format and new Team Series, and as always, [Rich Hagon took a deeper dive into what to look forward to](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/competitive-gaming/pro-tour-guilds-ravnica-preview-2018-11-06) than I'll ever be able to do.


WHEN DOES COVERAGE START?
=========================


Tune in to Pro Tour *Guilds of Ravnica* on twitch.tv/magic starting *Thursday*, November 8 (hey, that's today!), at 12 p.m. PT for the 2018–19 Player of the Year Playoff and a Pro Tour preview from the coverage team.


Pro Tour action takes place Friday, Saturday, and Sunday, and it gets going at 9 a.m. local time each day. Since we're in Atlanta, Georgia, local time is Eastern Time, so that's 6 a.m. PT for West Coast viewers and 2 p.m. UTC (note that as of last week, U.S. time zones fell one hour back compared to UTC due to daylight savings).


If you can't watch the broadcast live, don't worry! We'll be replaying the broadcast once each day concludes, so just in case you can't watch it all in your time zone, you can watch at your own leisure.


In addition to that, VODs (videos on demand) of each round and segment will be available on our Twitch page. They get archived on our coverage page too, so you can go through all the rounds at your own pace after they conclude.
