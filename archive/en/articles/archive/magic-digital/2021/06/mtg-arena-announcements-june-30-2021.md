Mirror, Mirror Rewrites Historic July 3–6
=========================================


July 3–6, step through the looking glass into an alternate realitywhere Oko, Thief of Crowns is just another great Historic card or Teferi, Time Raveler is more of a friend than foe to the format . . .


Given that *MTG Arena* is a digital expression of *Magic*, we want to experiment with some of the advantages only digital *Magic* can offer. Mirror, Mirror opens a portal to a Historic event in which twelve banned cards have been rebalanced, allowing you to play with those versions instead.


This event is All Access, meaning all cards are available for you to build your deck—even if they're not in your collection!


The rebalanced cards will have the *MTG Arena* "A" logo before their names. Note that this logo is the mythic-rare-colored version on all these cards and is independent of the card's actual rarity.


In exported decklists, these cards will appear with "A-" at the beginning of the card name. If you want to import a deck that uses these rebalanced cards, be sure to include the "A-" before the card name as well.


You can find these cards by using the advanced search command "set:ANC" in the deckbuilder.


Rebalanced cards cannot be crafted or otherwise added to your collection.
