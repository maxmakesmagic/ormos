This city is proud to host the third **Magic**: The Gathering Grand Prix ever held in our country. 


This Standard constructed event is the perfect occasion to have a blast and show the world how serious is your game; both competitive and casual players are welcome to bring their best decks and strategies to the largest magic event of 2013.

* Deck lists are required.
* Players must use the same deck on Day 2 that they used on Day 1.


**Tournament Structure** 


* Modified Swiss-style (50-minute rounds).
* If 799 or fewer players register for the event, all players with an X-2-0 or better record OR the top 64 players—whichever number is greater—will advance to the second day of the event.
* If 800 or more players register for the event, all players with an X-2-0 or better record OR the top 128 players—whichever number is greater—will advance to the second day of the event.
* The Top 8 players after the final Swiss round on Day 2 will advance to the Top 8 single-elimination finals.
* Top 8 playoff matches will be best 2 of 3, and have no time limit. (Players are still expected to play at a normal pace and complete playoff matches in a reasonable amount of time.)
* Where necessary, the standings after the Swiss rounds will still be used to determine final order in the standings.
* For the first game of each match in the Top 8, the player that finished higher in the Swiss rounds chooses either to play first or to play second. For subsequent games in each Top 8 match, the usual Play/Draw rule applies (loser of the previous game decides whether to play first in the next game).

Our convenient Jalisco hotel location is just 20 minutes away from the airport, 15 minutes away from the financial and business zone and 15 minutes away from the most important industrial zones in Guadalajara.


The easiest way to get there from the airport and bus station is on taxi. You can get information about the public transport system here: <http://www.rutasjalisco.gob.mx/>


Traveling by bus is really easy in México, Guadalajara is only 6 hours away from Mexico city, if you have time and you're travelling from outside of México you may consider getting a flight to Mexico City and taking a bus or a low cost plane from there.
