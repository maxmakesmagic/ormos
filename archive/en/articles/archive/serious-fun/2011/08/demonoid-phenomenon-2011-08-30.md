Welcome to *Innistrad*. Today's weather is cloudy, with a chance of death. I mean, have you *seen* some of the locals?

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/sf/trwerdtfghjoiuse765t56sy7uhj.jpg)  
Yeah. *That* guy there is who we're meeting today. As Doug Beyer explained in [last week's Savor the Flavor](http://www.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/stf/157), the archangel Avacyn seems to be MIA, leaving Demons (and other agents of darkness) to step up into the spotlight. And this guy isn't going to be subtle about asking you to change allegiance.

He's big. He's bold. He's got a morbid fascination with mortality. Are you ready to taste the abyss?

Demons cut creatures wide open, and this not-to-subtle throwback to [The Abyss](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=The+Abyss) does a very good job at just that. So what does he do, exactly?

*Morbid* is an ability word that gives a name to a common event: a creature has died. It's not a trigger *when* the creature dies, it just lets you know that this is an ability that cares that a creature died already sometime during the turn. In this case, it cares enough to give us an "at the beginning of the end step" trigger: something *else* gets to die.

Demons love death, no bones about that.

### A Cautionary Tale of Demons

Demons are almost always a double-edged sword. Many require sacrificing creatures, paying life every upkeep, and generally taking everything they can take from you. When faced with a Demon like this, just remember the three D's:


> 
> * Dead (As in that's what creatures will end up if you mess with Demons.)
> * Dying (As in that's what even critters you care about will be if you don't bring out Demons.)
> * Don't (let Demons freaking touch you!)
> 

The keys to maximizing our demonic indulgence are right there. Look a little closer at this conditional trigger:

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/sf/uytsretyfghjkdfgffdfdfdf.jpg)  

> 
> * It triggers at the beginning of every end step, working somewhat like an end-of-turn reverse Verdant Force.
> * It triggers if any creature died (the whole 'morbid' shtick), not just yours or your opponent's.
> * It requires a target, and can only target something that isn't a Demon.
> 

Making creatures die is a pretty straightforward affair. There are many things that get the job done.

Having one of our own creatures die anytime is pretty easy too.

And since handling Demons is dangerous for our own non-Demon creatures, we could use some that can withstand the pressure.

So what do we get when we put it all together? I think it would look something like this.

This is what horror awaits those who tread with the Demons of *Innistrad*. It's actually a not a horror for you, though. As part of this contracted "Deal of Devotion" (see the similarly contractual "[COVENANT](http://www.wizards.com/magic/magazine/article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/stf/97)"), our Reaper from the Abyss really doesn't hurt us.

| Volrath's Stronghold | Reassembling Skeleton |

[Volrath's Stronghold](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Volrath%27s+Stronghold), [Reassembling Skeleton](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reassembling+Skeleton), [Bloodghast](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodghast), and [Nether Traitor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nether+Traitor) all offer ways around the situation where something non-Demon has to die but your opponent has no creatures. They also fuel our outlets for sacrificing creatures, like [Phyrexian Altar](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phyrexian+Altar), [Kjeldoran Dead](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kjeldoran+Dead), and [Viscera Seer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Viscera+Seer). [Attrition](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Attrition) and [Grave Pact](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grave+Pact) are particularly rough for an opponent to keep creatures through, and adding Reaper from the Abyss to that duo is a brutal three-creature loss each time.

[Nim Deathmantle](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nim+Deathmantle) and [Lashwrithe](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lashwrithe) provide some power boosts to our smaller fries, with the Deathmantle letting us buy back a creature on its way out and [Lashwrithe](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lashwrithe) giving us a sacrificial lamb through living weapon. [Diabolic Intent](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Diabolic+Intent) is a tutor with a steep cost, but it fits our theme and function better than its [Demonic Tutor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Demonic+Tutor) cousin. A handful of fellow Demons ([Woebringer Demon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Woebringer+Demon), [Grinning Demon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grinning+Demon), and [Ob Nixilis, the Fallen](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ob+Nixilis%2C+the+Fallen)) round out the [Swamp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swamp) side of the deck.

Splashing blue here helps us cover our shortage of cards with "draw a card" on them. [Neurok Commando](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Neurok+Commando) dodges any errant triggers from our Reaper thanks to shroud while making the most of an empty board to attack into. [Vivisection](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vivisection) lets us cash one creature in for three cards, a pretty good deal with it was a [Bloodghast](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodghast) or [Nether Traitor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nether+Traitor) that we sent packing.

And in case we had forgotten, Reaper from the Abyss is a 6/6 with flying, too. So far, this whole dealing with Demons deal is pretty swank. What collusion and soul-selling do you have planned for Reaper from the Abyss? I, for one, look forward to getting my hands on this YAACTICWTCIC (Yet Another Awesome Card That I Can't Wait To Cast In Commander)!

### Demons Are in the Details

Last week I ran down [some of the most fun cards in **Magic**](/en/articles/archive/serious-fun/great-eight-2011-08-23). While the math that makes millions of Golems appear through [Precursor Golem](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Precursor+Golem) and a kicked [Rite of Replication](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rite+of+Replication) caused some of our heads to melt, I wanted to answer the other questions I had posed around [Doubling Season](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Doubling+Season)—each one assuming you had that enchantment parked in play.

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/sf/sf158_season.jpg)  
*How can you spend three mana to get a 10/10 that eventually results in 10* more *total power and toughness?*

The answer is [Vigean Hydropon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vigean+Hydropon). It normally comes into play with five +1/+1 counters on it. With [Doubling Season](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Doubling+Season) in play, Hydropon comes into play with ten counters – a three mana 10/10. Thanks to graft, whenever we bring another creature into play we can move one of these counters off of the Hydropon, getting *two* counters on the recipient creature. After ten creatures, we end up with a total of twenty +1/+1 counters spread around!

*If you cast [Cenn's Enlistment](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cenn%27s+Enlistment), then double your tokens through [Rhys the Redeemed](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rhys+the+Redeemed), how many tokens will you have after drawing land for five turns straight?*

![Cenn's Enlistment](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Cenn%27s+Enlistment)  
The answer to this can be solved via a cleverly created equation. Since not everyone is familiar with the math I'd need to describe it, I'll instead walk us through a "brute force" calculation, turn by turn.



|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Turn** | **Cast [Cenn's Enlistment](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cenn%27s+Enlistment)** | **Double with [Rhys the Redeemed](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rhys+the+Redeemed)** |
| 1 | 4 (2 tokens, doubled) | 12 (add 4 tokens, doubled) |
| 2 | 16 | 48  |
| 3 | 52 | 156  |
| 4 | 160 | 480  |
| 5 | 484 | 1,452 |

  
That's part of why I took [Doubling Season](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Doubling+Season) out of my [Rhys the Redeemed](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rhys+the+Redeemed) Commander deck – I just didn't need to make that many tokens that fast! If I need to speed the process up, [Rings of Brighthearth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rings+of+Brighthearth) works fairly well too!

*What's the minimum value X to push through a [Primordial Hydra](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Primordial+Hydra) to have a 10/10 on your next turn?*

![Primordial Hydra](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Primordial+Hydra)  
I meant to use "at least" instead of "a" before the 10/10, but you all understood what I was asking anyway. (Nice job!)

The minimum X value is 2; you need to pay ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161225105850im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless2.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20220123123600im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/green.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20220123123600im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/green.gif) for [Primordial Hydra](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Primordial+Hydra). Doing so will net you a Hydra with four +1/+1 counters (two counters, doubled through [Doubling Season](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Doubling+Season)), which will then result in eight more +1/+1 counters being added on your next upkeep (four counters, doubled). Four mana to get a 12/12 with trample you can attack with on your next turn is very saucy!

*You have a [Mirror-Sigil Sergeant](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mirror-Sigil+Sergeant) and you enchant it with [Followed Footsteps](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Followed+Footsteps). How many tokens will you have three turns later?*

![Mirror-Sigil Sergeant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Mirror-Sigil+Sergeant)  
Similar to the [Cenn's Enlistment](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cenn%27s+Enlistment) question above, you can solve this through mathematical judo. We'll just brute-force it again for simplicity's sake.



|  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Turn** | **Sergeant Adds** | **Footsteps Adds** | **Total Tokens** | **Total Sergeants** |
| 1 | 2 | 2 | 4 | 5  |
| 2 | 10 | 2 | 16 | 17  |
| 3 | 34 | 2 | 52 | 53 |

  
The answer is fifty-two token copies of [Mirror-Sigil Sergeant](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mirror-Sigil+Sergeant). I can think of a few things to do with fifty-two copies of a creature!

I received many great stories around using [Doubling Season](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Doubling+Season) for even more mind-bending puzzle-like interactions. [Opalescence](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Opalescence) then [Followed Footsteps](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Followed+Footsteps) on [Doubling Season](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Doubling+Season) was a popular one, and there were several variations on that too: [Opalescence](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Opalescence) and [Doubling Season](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Doubling+Season), followed by [Clone](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Clone)-type creatures and a [Venser, the Sojourner](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Venser%2C+the+Sojourner), or a [Clone](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Clone)-type creature in a [Mimic Vat](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mimic+Vat), or [Spitting Image](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spitting+Image) and [Life from the Loam](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Life+from+the+Loam).

It's stories like those that make me smile, and not just because of the numbers game involved in figuring out what's going on. Thanks for the tales and trials; I look forward to more!

With all the hubbub about *Innistrad* in full swing, I'll let our weekly poll be a fun one.

  
Thanks to the awesome events at PAX this past weekend there is a treasure trove of *Innistrad* cards now parked in the [Card Image Gallery](http://www.wizards.com/magic/tcg/article.aspx?x=mtg/tcg/innistrad/cig). If you missed the excitement while it happened, check out the gallery now to catch up on the juicy new details!

And don't forget: there is the rest of this week as well as two more full weeks of *Innistrad* goodies to look forward to! We'll see you then!
