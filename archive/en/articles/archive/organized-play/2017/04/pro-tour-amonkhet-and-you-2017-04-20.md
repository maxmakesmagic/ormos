With *Amonkhet* Prereleases coming up in in just a few days, players worldwide will get their first opportunity to play with *Magic*'s newest set. That also includes the many players who will be traveling to a Grand Prix and the Pro Tour in the coming weeks, and with preview season now behind us, I'm back to take a look at the three exciting weeks of fresh premier play coming at you soon.


May's Big Events
================


The month of May will be the time for *Amonkhet* to shine at the top level as players travel to Grand Prix and the Pro Tour to put their best to the test.


**Limited Grand Prix Triple-Header**


Things kick off the first week of May with a triple Grand Prix weekend featuring the brand new *Amonkhet* Sealed Deck and Booster Draft formats!

**Live Video from**: Grand Prix Richmond ([twitch.tv/magic](http://twitch.tv/magic))

The triple Grand Prix weekend will be our first look at what strategies players muster to topple *Amonkhet* Sealed Deck and Booster Draft.

Pro Tour *Amonkhet* Merch
=========================


Pro Tours typically are also the place where attendees can pick up event-exclusive playmats from the merch booth as well as some awesome stuff that is often made available at the Pro Tour first.


Pro Tour *Amonkhet* is no exception, and anyone who is at the Pro Tour in Nashville will have the chance to purchase an event-exclusive playmat meshing the Nashville skyline with the artwork from [Hazoret the Fervent](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hazoret+the+Fervent).


![](https://media.wizards.com/2017/images/daily/UIKhE0mPKx.png)


This playmat is always a fast seller at our flagship tournaments, oftentimes selling out early in the weekend, so players and visitors should pick this item up as soon as possible if they're interested in one.


In addition to that, a couple of new items will be available for sale starting at Pro Tour *Amonkhet*, such as a brand-new T-shirt featuring Gideon, and new V-neck T-shirts, and a messenger bag featuring some familiar horns . . .


![](https://media.wizards.com/2017/images/daily/xa5Et8EZq3.png)


The merch booth will also be adding some sweet hoodies to its catalog for those who identify with red-white and black-red color combinations.


![](https://media.wizards.com/2017/images/daily/hWh9cw3j6q.png)


While the playmat is an event exclusive, the new T-shirts, messenger bag, and hoodies will also be available at the Legion Supplies web portal, [mtgproshop.com](https://mtgproshop.com/), starting on Friday, May 12, once the Pro Tour is underway. So if you want any of those for yourself, order from them starting that day to pick yours up as soon as it goes on sale!


It's going to be an exciting few weeks of coverage. All the best to those competing, and we look forward to seeing you tune in soon!
