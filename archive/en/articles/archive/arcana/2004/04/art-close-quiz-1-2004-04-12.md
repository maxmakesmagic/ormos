How well do you know your *Mirrodin* block art?

For example, did you know that this little myr hangs out on the art of [Ogre Leadfoot](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ogre+Leadfoot)?

Here's a little quiz. Each of the three images below is a small section of the art of a *Mirrodin* or *Darksteel* card, magnified greatly; can you identify the card to which each belongs? *Hint:* They are all *Mirrodin* block commons.

Discuss your answers on the [Arcana thread](http://boards1.wizards.com/forumdisplay.php?s=&forumid=481) on the message boards, and tune in tomorrow for the answers! (If these prove to be too easy, the next ones will be harder.)
