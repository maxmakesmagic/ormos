*We're taking a two-week holiday break and will be back with new stuff on Monday, January 3, 2011. Until then, please enjoy our favorite Arcanas of 2010. This article originally ran May 18, 2010.*

Let's consider [Hand of Emrakul](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hand+of+Emrakul).

![Hand of Emrakul](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Hand+of+Emrakul)As you can see, this monstrosity is digging into the side of a mountain. It's flinging huge chunks of rock out of its way. But there's something you don't know, because it's behind the name of the card. Let's blow this up!

Oh no! It looks like some poor mountaineer has gotten in the way! According to the art description, it's probably a goblin. So now you know!
