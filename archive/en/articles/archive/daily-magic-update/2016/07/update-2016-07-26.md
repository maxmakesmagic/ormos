The Daily *Magic* Update is a roundup of everything *Magic* you should know on July 26, 2016. Today's Update is brought to you by *Conspiracy: Take the Crown*.


Hear Ye, *Conspiracy* Fans, Hear Ye
===================================


1. King Brago is no more, and the Black Rose has taken the crown of Paliano. But for how long?

This summer we're releasing *Conspiracy: Take the Crown*, a multiplayer Draft set filled with political intrigue and treacherous alliances. To celebrate, we're holding a special event in seven stores around the world on August 20, where fans will get the chance to draft with the new set before anyone else—including a first look at preview cards exclusive to each store! Players will be able to follow along all weekend with live social media coverage on Twitter and Facebook, so be sure to follow us for all the newest previews and plays.


The event will be held in the following stores:


* [Academia de Jogos (Sao Paulo, Brazil)](https://www.academiadejogos.com.br/)
* [Dark Tower Games (Bellingham, Wash.)](http://www.darktowerlgs.com/)
* [Games Laboratory (Melbourne, Australia)](http://gameslaboratory.com.au/)
* [Jonny no Omise (Hiroshima, Japan)](http://www.johnnymagic.jp/)
* [Kirwan's Game Store (Catskill, NY)](http://www.kirwansgamestore.com/)
* [Warez Gaming (Bournemouth, UK)](http://www.retrowarez.co.uk/)
* Shanghai M3 Magic Card Store (Shanghai, China)

We'll have more information about the event as we get closer to the release of the set, so certainly stay tuned.


Today's Must
============


1. [Boat Brews](http://magic.tcgplayer.com/db/article.asp?ID=13415&writer=Ali+Aintrazi&articledate=7-26-2016) | TCGPlayer | Ali Aintrazi

Check out the multiple flavors of blue-green decks Ali Aintrazi brewed on his way to finding the Sultai Control deck that took him all the way to second place at last weekend's SCG Open.


After Those, Read, Watch, or Listen to These
============================================


1. [*Magic: The Gathering* Zombifies Planeswalkers for Comic-Con](http://www.forbes.com/sites/laurenorsini/2016/07/25/magic-the-gathering-zombifies-planeswalkers-for-comic-con/) | Forbes | Lauren Orsini

If you're wondering "What's the point of a review of a product I can't get anymore, since I didn't make Comic-Con?" fret not, Orsini's review will not be in vain. At some point (exact date TBD) the exclusive will be available on the [Hasbro Toy Shop](http://www.hasbrotoyshop.com/).


1. [*Eldritch Moon* EDH/Commander Deck Tech Spotlight for *Magic: The Gathering*!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHcCrqP4z1g&feature=youtu.be&a) | The Mana Source | Wedge

Wedge tackles the legends of *Eldritch Moon* that might make an impact on Commander, which, as it turns out, is pretty much all of them.

1. [Taking Tamiyo to Legacy](http://www.hipstersofthecoast.com/2016/07/legacy-bant-control-ft-tamiyo-field-researcher/) | Hipsters of the Coast | Aaron Gazzaniga

Gazzaniga (try typing that four times fast—or once) thinks Tamiyo might be able to do some field research in Legacy in a shell reminiscent of Miracles.


One note on [Doubling Season](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Doubling+Season)—planeswalkers do enter the battlefield with twice as many loyalty counters on them, but activating their abilities is a cost, not an effect, so using them will not put twice as many counters on them.


[The more you know.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GD6qtc2_AQA)


1. [Charting Drake's Course](http://www.gatheringmagic.com/alexullman-07262016-charting-drakes-course/) | Gathering Magic | Alex Ullman

Should [Peregrine Drake](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Peregrine+Drake) be banned from Pauper? Alex Ullman thinks so, and he has charts to prove it.


What to Watch Tonight
=====================


1. [Vintage Super League](https://vintagesuperleague.com/)

It's the last week ov Vintage Super League before a short break for the Pro Tour. VSL is off next week, so if you want your fill of Vintage action, tune in tonight at 5 p.m. PT/8 p.m. ET on [twitch.tv/magic](https://www.twitch.tv/magic).


What People Are Talking About
=============================


1. > 
> 1996 World Championship painting from Chris Rush? Yeah it's being sold. 11x13". [#mtgart](https://twitter.com/hashtag/mtgart?src=hash)<https://t.co/orbVgMbR14> [pic.twitter.com/obDLWDFsmj](https://t.co/obDLWDFsmj)

>  — Mike Linnemann (@VorthosMike) [July 25, 2016](https://twitter.com/VorthosMike/status/757672586473906177)

Among *Magic* art and history aficionados, this was possibly the biggest news to drop since—well, honestly, I can't think of what would have topped this in recent memory. The 1996 World Championship card was a unique card of which only one was ever given out—to the 1996 World Champion. This was only done this one year, making it unique in the game's history (so there is no 1997 World Championo card, even.) The original art, meanwhile, has never been sold. But it is now. It will be interesting to see where this find a home.


1. [From The Vault: Lure Full Spoiler!](https://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/4um687/from_the_vault_lure_full_spoiler/)

Do you enjoy fish puns? Because this thread is full of them. If you're looking for a fish pun here, there isn't one. But keep looking.


Also, just so we're all clear, this thread is a joke. And a funny one, at that.


Decks of the Day
================


1. [Red-Green Goggles](http://sales.starcitygames.com/deckdatabase/displaydeck.php?DeckID=105594)

Another non-Bant deck to make the Top 8 of the StarCityGames.com Open last weekend, Matthew Voltz showed that Red-Green Goggles might still have what it takes.


The deck was virtually identical to Brad Nelson's list from [Pro Tour *Shadows over Innistrad*](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/ptsoi) and used zero *Eldritch Moon* cards, as it turns out that casting [World Breaker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=World+Breaker) and [Dragonlord Atarka](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragonlord+Atarka) are still game-winning plays.


Now, given that this was the first weekend of the format and many players didn't have access to new cards, it's possible Voltz just wasn't able to add anything. Or maybe the deck is perfect just the way it is. Either way, one of the advantages of this deck is that it dodges [Spell Queller](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spell+Queller) and [Reflector Mage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reflector+Mage) pretty well. Is it time for a Goggles comeback?
