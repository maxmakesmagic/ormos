Following the success of other gaming conventions we’ve visited recently, *Magic* is heading to [Gamescom](http://www.gamescom-cologne.com/en/gamescom/home/index.php). There’ll be plenty to see and do, so join us in Cologne, Germany, next week, August 13-17, 2014.


Whether you’re on-site and enjoying the festivities, or following the action from home, don’t forget to use the hashtag: [#mtgGC](http://twitter.com/search?f=realtime&q=%23mtgGC&src=typd)









The Booth


Come and find us in booth B-053, in hall 10, where each day there will be a range of activities on offer, including:


* *Magic 2015—Duels of the Planeswalkers* demos.
* Take your photo with a Planeswalker using our three magic mirrors.
* Meet Garruk - the Apex Predator will be wandering the convention halls, and paying regular visits to the booth.
* Take a break and recharge your phone in our dedicated charging area.








Giveaways


You like free stuff. You love *Magic*. We're combining the two!


Come to our booth for a *Magic 2015—Duels of the Planeswalkers* demo, and we'll give you one of these inflatable versions of Garruk's axe:
