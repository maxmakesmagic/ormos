[Sudden Impact](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sudden+Impact), finding its way back inside black borders in *Tenth Edition* [this weekend](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/events/07gameday&dcmp=ILC-MTGARCANA) for the first time since *Tempest*, has had a lot of different illustrations through the years.


It gets yet another facelift for *Tenth Edition*, this time under the hand of master artist Wayne Reynolds. The concept for the card has been brought more in line with the savagery and impulse of the color red. Check out the art description provided to Wayne Reynolds for the project:



> *Color: Red Spell*  
> *Location: Not important*  
> *Action: We see the head and shoulders of a blue-aligned mage reeling forward, as if struck in the back of the head by an invisible baseball bat. His expression is that of sudden, horrible agony, and his face is cracked like crumbling brickwork, smoke from the mind-blast seeps from between the cracks.*  
> *Focus: The stricken mage*  
> *Mood: Magical blunt-force trauma*


Alrighty then! Let's see the sketch-to-final process. Click the links below the image to see the piece move from sketch stage to its final art.
