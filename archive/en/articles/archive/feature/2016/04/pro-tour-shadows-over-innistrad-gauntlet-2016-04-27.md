Hello friends! Welcome back to another installment of the Pro Tour Gauntlet, this time for [Pro Tour *Shadows over Innistrad*](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/ptsoi/). For those of you who might have missed the first installment of the Pro Tour Gauntlet, you can check that out [here](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/magic-digital/running-pro-tour-gauntlet-2016-02-10). As a brief recap, the Gauntlet lets you use some of the best decks to come out of the Pro Tour and pit them against other decks that did well.


If you were able to watch the story unfold from Pro Tour *Shadows over Innistrad*, there were a plethora of new and interesting decks that made waves. Fortunately for us, there wasn't a single repeat deck in the Top 8 of the Pro Tour! Let's jump to our first deck, Steve Rubin's Green-White Tokens. In this video, I also give a further introduction to this awesome experience you can play on *Magic Online*.

Next up, Jon Finkel's [Seasons Past](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seasons+Past) deck!

How about Luis Scott-Vargas's Black-Green Aristocrats?

A little Bant Company never hurt anyone (okay, maybe it has).

And finally, Brad Nelson's awesome ramp deck.

What decks will you play if you try the Pro Tour Gauntlet? Who knows! While you should definitely [read the accompanying article](http://magic.wizards.com/en/MTGO/articles/archive/magic-online/pro-tour-gauntlet-shadows-over-innistrad-2016-04-26) that details everything else about it, you could also just randomly join and see what it's like to pilot some of the top decks, blindly.


Let me summarize my experience so far with this version of the Pro Tour Gauntlet: I played five of the Standard Constructed lists that made up the Top 8 of Pro Tour *Shadows over Innistrad*. After beginning with Steve Rubin's Green-White Tokens list, I moved to a much more control-oriented deck, trying out Jon Finkel's Black-Green [Seasons Past](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seasons+Past) list. From there we tried an aggressive deck of the same colors, Luis Scott-Vargas's Aristocrats. Changing things up, we moved to Andrea Mengucci's Bant Company, and finally capped things off with Brad Nelson's Red-Green Goggles Ramp deck. Overall it was an amazing experience—and given the feedback from the previous Pro Tour Gauntlet, I am certain that if you try this one out you'll love it too.


Not often do you get to play with some of the most dominant strategies in a format, all against other decks that did well at the most recent Pro Tour. The best part? I didn't need to be on the same skill level as Jon Finkel or Luis Scott-Vargas to play. Sure, they would have certainly piloted the decks better than I ever could, but to taste the same thrilling experience was a reward on its own. My hope is that you're able to find the same fulfillment and satisfaction that I had while playing these decks. The Pro Tour Gauntlet is an amazing way to experience the wonders of *Magic Online*, and I hope you at least give it a run while it's available. If not, there's always the next Pro Tour, and with it another Gauntlet.


Until next time, this is your friend NumotTheNummy wishing you the best—and telling you to go try the Pro Tour Gauntlet!
