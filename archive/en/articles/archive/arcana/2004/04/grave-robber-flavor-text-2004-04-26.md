Because of the "graveyard matters" themes of the *Odyssey* block -- including flashback, threshold, and Incarnations among others -- you would think that being a Cabal grave robber would be a good gig. But it turns out that, according to three pieces of humorous flavor text from those sets, that they had a hard time of it. 

First, on *Odyssey's* 
**[Decompose](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Decompose)**:

The sentiment continues on *Torment's* 
**[Carrion Rats](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Carrion+Rats)**:

 And the poor grave robber finally has had enough on *Judgment's* 
**[Rats' Feast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rats%27+Feast)**:
