Today is *Fate Reforged* release day, which means the Standard format will be going through some shifts in the next couple of weeks. Last weekend featured a break in Premier Play action to give everyone a chance to participate in a Prerelease, but we'll be moving back into the swing of things leading up to the Pro Tour very quickly.



In the meantime, let's take a look at Standard as we currently know it. What's big? Where has the metagame moved to adjust to the current juggernaut decks? This will be a starting point as players adjust to the new Standard and the new set.



Pro Tour Qualifiers will also be starting back up next weekend, and will be featuring the new Standard. This season is currently awarding invitations to [Pro Tour *Dragons of Tarkir*](http://magic.wizards.com/en/content/qualifiers-pro-tour-dragons-of-tarkir), so be sure to [find a PTQ near you](http://magic.wizards.com/en/protour/qualifierlist), and perhaps we will see you in Brussels, Belgium April 10â€“12!
