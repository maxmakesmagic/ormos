This week's "Sketches" takes an *interactive* look at Luca Zontini's [Noxious Ghoul](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Noxious+Ghoul) from *Legions*. 

### 1. Art Description

These are the instructions given to the artist:

"Color: Black  
 Location: Swamp  
 Action: Show a refugee zombie moving towards the viewer surrounded by insects or flies that spread disease. Several of these can be closer to the viewer so we can tell what they are. Make sure, however, that the focus is on the zombie."

The card was called "Swarm Zombie" in playtest.

### 2. Sketches

Here is one of three preliminary sketches of "Swarm Zombie" submitted by Luca Zontini. The art team had a lot to say about this card, so there were several changes. Click the three buttons below to see the progression of "Swarm Zombie" over time! *(Depending on your connection speed, it might take a few seconds for the image to change.)*

Note how the zombie gets beefier and more mutated over time. Six-pack abs here! Extra arms (and creepy fingerlike appendages) there! It's like a Mirari mutation flip-book!

### 3. Final Art

Here is a large version of the final piece. The end result is a hulking, mutated Noxious Ghoul fit for any zombie deck.

### 4. Card

Finally, here is the card as you'll see it in booster packs.
