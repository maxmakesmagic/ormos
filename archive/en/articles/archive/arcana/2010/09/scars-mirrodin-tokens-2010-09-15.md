They say that you can get a pretty good feel for a **Magic** set by looking at its tokens. Well, nobody says that right now, but there's a chance they might start. After all, when you see a pair of tokens like this...

...doesn't it make you picture a card like this?

Okay, that was kind of a gimme. But let's look at the other tokens of *Scars of Mirrodin* and see what they tell us about the set.

Myr tokens? That brings to mind the Myr Battlesphere!

Ah! That looks like a golem that gets created by the Precursor Golem, which just appeared on the [Visual Spoiler](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/tcg/article.aspx?x=mtg/tcg/scarsofmirrodin/spoiler) yesterday!

This wolf, of course, is the product of the Sword of Body and Mind.

A 1/1 Insect with infect? Hey, that rhymes! And it suggests that maybe someone's been using a Trigon of Infestation around here.

Where did this Goblin come from? Well, that will have to remain a mystery for now.

A 1/1 Soldier? Well, that one's easy: Elspeth Tirel!

And our last creature token is a mighty Cat, spawned, presumably, by Kemba, Kha Regent.

There's one more interesting one, but it's not a token card. And no, it's not an emblem either. It's a *counter* card.
