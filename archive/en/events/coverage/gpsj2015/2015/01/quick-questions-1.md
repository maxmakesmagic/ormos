Teams manifest in many ways.  Sometimes it’s a majestic coming together that just works; sometimes it’s longtime friends bonding over a mutual love of *Magic*; sometimes it’s just because someone missed a plane.  How did the make-up of this event happen for some players?

Nass: We’ve been friends for a long time. We all used to live in this area.


Pardee: And then Jacob was a traitor.


Nass: Well, you were a traitor for a while too.


Pardee: Oh yeah, that’s true . . .


[The team then explained some of the substitutions they’d had to make at various events]


Pardee: I missed Grand Prix Nashville because of my grandfather’s 85th birthday.


Me: But now you’re back and all’s right in the world?


Nass: Well, if all were right in the world, we’d be 5-0 right now.

Williams:  Well, we won the last time, so we figured we’d do it again.  We’ve won all the Grand Prix we’ve played in San Jose. [Williams smiles]

Brown: Back when we really sucked at *Magic*, we bought plane tickets to Grand Prix Providence together for some reason.


Hwang: It made sense at the time, and plus Andrew flies for free.


[Brown smiles]


Hwang: We went 10-0, and then on the second day—


Brown: On the second day we built character.


[Sad note: They lost three straight win-and-ins to not make the elimination bracket. Sad face emoticon]

Alex: I got a Facebook message from Tom asking if I was interested.  I was.


Me: That’s it?


Alex: Yeah, that’s it.


Me: No, like, grand beginning of forging in a lava pit or something?


Alex: Nope.
