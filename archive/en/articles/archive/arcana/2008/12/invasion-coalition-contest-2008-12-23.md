What do you say to a complete change of pace?

Many years ago, *Invasion* came out, and it was good. And it had a neat [minisite](http://www.wizards.com/magic/expert/invasion/magicinvasion/welcome.asp) with information and background for the set.

Arguably the coolest part was the Invasion Coalition Contest, in which people had to match parts of the Coalition symbol to the right parts of Dominaria. The contest part ended years ago, but it's still a lot of fun.
