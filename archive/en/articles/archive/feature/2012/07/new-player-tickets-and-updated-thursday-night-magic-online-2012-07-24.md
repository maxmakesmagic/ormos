We are always looking at ways to improve the **Magic Online** experience for our players, especially when they are just starting out. Each year, when the Core Set launches, we update the **Magic Online** New Account Starter kit as part of this process. This ensures that new players get the latest Core Set booster, the newest cards, and the most recent Planeswalker Deck Pack. In addition, this year we are adding something completely new: New Player Tickets!

With the release of ***Magic** 2013*, we wanted to give new players a better way to get comfortable with **Magic Online** and the game's controls, especially when entering Limited tournaments, namely Booster Drafts and Sealed Deck events. To this end, we have created the New Player Ticket. Starting with the downtime on July 25, every new **Magic Online** New Account Starter Kit will include 4 New Player Tickets (including any previously purchased, unopened Starter Kits). These special, untradeable tickets will let new players enter the two new tournament queues listed below that are designed to let them become familiar with how **Magic Online** works in a low-pressure environment.

Each New Player tournament is a 4-player Phantom queue. This means each event will launch as soon as four players join and each player will play two matches, win or lose, but the cards played with will not be added to players' collections. 

**New Player Phantom Sealed Deck Queue**  
*START TIME:*  On demand.   
*LOCATION:* Limited Queues room.   
*ENTRY OPTION(S):* 1 New Player Ticket.  
*PRODUCT:* 
**Magic Online** will provide 6 Phantom ***Magic** 2013* booster packs.   
*SIZE:* 4 players.   
*DURATION:* Deck building time plus two rounds, Swiss pairings.   
*PRIZES:* Prizes are based on total match points at the end of the tournament. Each match win awards 3 points and each match loss awards 0 points. Players who earn 6 match points will earn 1 copy of the current Thursday Night **Magic Online** promo card. 

**New Player Phantom Draft Queue**  
*START TIME:* On demand.   
*LOCATION:* Limited Queues room.   
*ENTRY OPTION(S):* 1 New Player Ticket.  
*PRODUCT:* 
**Magic Online** will provide 3 Phantom ***Magic** 2013* booster packs.   
*SIZE:* 4 players.   
*DURATION:* Drafting and deck building time plus two rounds, Swiss pairings.   
*PRIZES:* Prizes are based on total match points at the end of the tournament. Each match win awards 3 points and each match loss awards 0 points. Players who earn 6 match points will earn 1 copy of the current Thursday Night **Magic Online** promo card. 

Speaking of Thursday Night **Magic Online**, we are making some changes to this program as well. Starting August 2, 2012, Thursday Night **Magic Online** (TNMO) tournaments will all require 5 Event Tickets to enter, regardless of format, and will all have the same basic prize structure (see below for full event details). This means that each and every Thursday you can hop into a Booster Draft, Sealed Deck or Constructed tournament for only 5 Event Tickets.

To accommodate this change, TNMO Booster Draft and Sealed Deck events will use Phantom booster packs. Again, this means that the product players play with in these tournaments will not be added to their collections when the event is over. 

**Thursday Night Magic Online**  
*START TIMES:* Every Thursday at 4:00 AM PDT (11:00 UTC), 9:00 AM PDT (16:00 UTC), 3:00 PM PDT (22:00 UTC), and 7:00 PM PDT (Friday, 02:00 UTC).  
*LOCATION:* Scheduled Events room.   
*ENTRY OPTION(S):* 5 Event Tickets.   
*PRODUCT:* Players must provide a Constructed deck that is legal in the Thursday Night **Magic Online** format for that week or **Magic Online** will provide 3 Phantom booster packs or 6 Phantom booster packs (depending on whether the event is a draft or a 6-booster Sealed event) of the appropriate set(s).   
*SIZE:* 16 players minimum, 512 players maximum.   
*DURATION:* Drafting time (when necessary) and Deck building time (when necessary) plus three rounds, Swiss pairings.  
*PRIZES:* Prizes are based on total match points at the end of the tournament. Each match win awards 3 points and each match loss awards 0 points. See prize schedule below.

| **Match Points** | **Prizes** |
| 9 | 3 booster packs |
| 6 | 2 booster packs |

  
*ADDITIONAL PRIZES:* Each player who participates in a Thursday Night **Magic Online** event will receive the current month's promo card. Each player with 9 points will also receive a premium foil version of that card. Please check the [**Magic Online** Group](/en/articles/archive/event-coverage/pro-tour-gatecrash-qualifier-season-top-8-standard-decklists-2015-50) page for the current month's promo card.

The addition of the New Player Queues are a great way for players to get their feet wet and check out how Booster Draft or Sealed Deck events work in **Magic Online**. After players are more comfortable, Thursday Night **Magic Online** events are a great next step for players who are looking to start playing **Magic** more competitively but may not be ready to jump into a normal queue or premier event. With these updates, we hope that players who are just starting out but aspire to play **Magic Online** competitively have a clearer path towards that goal.
