In Standard, it's generally acceptable to be doing some reasonably powerful things. Game-ending six-drops or "X" spells are not unheard of. If you go any larger than that, chances are you get run over before you can set up, or your big spell gets [Thoughtseized just before you were going to break the game wide open.](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtseized+just+before+you+were+going+to+break+the+game+wide+open.)



![Plasm Capture](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Plasm%20Capture&options=)If you've been missing the "go bigger" option, you've either been emulating Ali Aintrazi or you've been waiting for the decklist below, featuring the incredibly powerful, but seldom used, [Plasm Capture. In fact, now might be the perfect time to be using Plasm Capture, as it's a card people don't typically play around. Sure, they might not want their spells to get Dissolved, but generally it's better to start running bigger stuff into counterspells. You probably don't have many and you might not have one in your hand at all!](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plasm+Capture.+In+fact%2C+now+might+be+the+perfect+time+to+be+using+Plasm+Capture%2C+as+it%27s+a+card+people+don%27t+typically+play+around.+Sure%2C+they+might+not+want+their+spells+to+get+Dissolved%2C+but+generally+it%27s+better+to+start+running+bigger+stuff+into+counterspells.+You+probably+don%27t+have+many+and+you+might+not+have+one+in+your+hand+at+all%21)

If you catch someone with a surprise [Plasm Capture, you might be able to play Supreme Verdict and a Planeswalker; an Elspeth, Sun's Champion; or even a giant Sphinx's Revelation. From there, it should be pretty easy to win. The trick is getting to that point in the first place! But like I said earlier, with Plasm Capture being mostly forgotten about, it might not be so tricky after all.](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plasm+Capture%2C+you+might+be+able+to+play+Supreme+Verdict+and+a+Planeswalker%3B+an+Elspeth%2C+Sun%27s+Champion%3B+or+even+a+giant+Sphinx%27s+Revelation.+From+there%2C+it+should+be+pretty+easy+to+win.+The+trick+is+getting+to+that+point+in+the+first+place%21+But+like+I+said+earlier%2C+with+Plasm+Capture+being+mostly+forgotten+about%2C+it+might+not+be+so+tricky+after+all.)
