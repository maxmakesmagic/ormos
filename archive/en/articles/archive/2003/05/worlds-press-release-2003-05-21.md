**WORLD'S TOP TRADING CARD GAME PLAYERS HEAD TO BERLIN THIS SUMMER FOR 2003 *MAGIC: THE GATHERING* WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP AND INTERNATIONAL CELEBRATION OF GAME'S 10TH ANNIVERSARY**



***Germany hosts prestigious trading card championship for first time; reigning national team winners get to defend title on home turf***


**May 20, 2003** (**Renton, Wash.)**– In a testament to the global popularity of the *Magic: The Gathering* trading card game, published by Wizards of the Coast, Inc., a division of Hasbro, Inc. (NYSE: HAS), players from more than 50 countries will participate in the *2003 Magic: The Gathering* World Championship. For the first time in the event's 10-year history, the *Magic: The Gathering* World Championship will be held in Germany, at Berlin's Estrel Convention Center, August 6-10. This year's World Championship also coincides with the 10th anniversary of the *Magic*game.


More than 300 qualified players – winners of national tournaments held in their countries prior to the World Championship – will compete for individual and team titles and an aggregate prize purse of $400,000\* (USD). In addition, an estimated 1,000+ fans of the *Magic* game are expected to turn out for an array of public events happening concurrently with the World Championship. Among the side events open to the public will be tournaments for product prizes as well as informal tournaments, card trading and artist card-signings.


The *Magic: The Gathering* game celebrates its 10th anniversary this year. Widely recognized as the premier trading card game, the *Magic* game is played by an estimated six million players in 52 countries, with more than 100,000 official tournaments sanctioned each year by the DCI players' organization.


“The *Magic: The Gathering* game created a whole new genre of games when it debuted a decade ago,” commented Wizards of the Coast Chief Executive Officer Chuck Huebner. “The *Magic* game continues to set the standard for trading card games, with the best game play and the most vigorous schedule of events for players to participate in, including the prestigious *Magic* Pro Tour and World Championship. The 10th anniversary makes this year's World Championship an especially exciting one.”


The World Championship is the culmination of the *2002-2003 Magic: The Gathering* Pro Tourseason. The *Magic: The Gathering* Pro Tour is the most established competition in the trading card game world. Players who have qualified for the World Championship will be competing for an individual first-place prize of $35,000 (USD) and a team first-place prize of $30,000 (USD), with each player on the three-person team taking home $10,000 (USD).


Reigning World Champion Carlos Romao, a Brazil native and the first Latin American player to capture the World Championship title, is expected to compete in this year's event, as is top-ranked Kai Budde, a computer science student at the University of Hamburg, who is sure to be the local favorite in Berlin. Budde and German national teammates Mark Ziegner and Felix Schneiders prevailed at the 2002 World Championship, which was held in Sydney, Australia. But it's been four years since Budde won the individual event. No doubt the field will be packed with the crème de la crème of *Magic* players, hailing from every corner of the world.
