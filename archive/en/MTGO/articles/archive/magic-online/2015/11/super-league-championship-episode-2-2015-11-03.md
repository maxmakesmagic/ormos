Super League is a weekly stream on Twitch that shows *Magic* celebrities playing on *Magic Online*. Ever since July, we’ve been building up to the Super League Championship, which features the top finishers from Vintage Super League, Standard Super League, Modern Super League, and last week’s Last Chance Qualifier.


Last week was the first week of the Group Stage and you can catch up on all the action [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_oCCTW8iQM&list=PL3rP64NRtmbhN7kiM4jScs_tKR60-mQo_&index=8). You can also check out the nice variety of decklists that folks brought to the table [here](http://magic.wizards.com/en/MTGO/articles/archive/magic-online/super-league-championship-decklists-2015-10-27).


Gaby Spartz seems to have made a particularly good metagame call, and her Eldrazi Ramp deck has already crushed Modern Super League champion Shaun McLaren (plus the only true aggro deck is in a different group from her). Here is tonight’s schedule:

Tonight is the second week of the round robin Group Stage. After week 3 each player will have played each other player in their group once, and the top two will advance to the playoffs. It’s actually possible, depending on the results, for some players to clinch advancement to the playoffs tonight. However everyone wants the byes that are given to the top two group winners so there is guaranteed to be a lot on the line in next week’s Group Stage finale.
