Blake is the content manager for DailyMTG.com, making him the one you should email if you have thoughts on the website, good or less good (or not good). He's a longtime coverage reporter and hasn't turned down a game of Magic in any format ever. 






The month is nearly over, so once again it's time to take a trip in our Friday Night *Magic* time machine and see what promos we have in store (and in stores!) for the coming months.


**November**


Is it a coincidence that our hottest promos come during some of the coldest months in North America? Stay warm with this Zoltan Boros take on [Roast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Roast).

**December**


For many, December is a highly anticipated month full of holidays, presents, the end of one year, and the start of a brand-new one. To celebrate, we're giving you a new tool to see what's ahead with an updated version of [Anticipate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Anticipate) from Volkan Baga. What? You didn't see that coming?

**January**


It's a new year, which means it's time for a journey to find yourself...and maybe a few Forests. Nissa's certainly on just such an introspective journey, and you can join her with your copy of [Nissa's Pilgrimage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nissa%27s+Pilgrimage) featuring art by Christine Choi.
