*"[Quarantine Field](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Quarantine+Field). Being able to exile threats is very powerful against Jeskai, shutting down their recursion from Commands. It's not bad even as an expensive [Oblivion Ring](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oblivion+Ring), and the ability to scale up is huge." – Two-Time Grand Prix Champion Brian Braun-Duin*

*"[Dragonlord Silumgar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragonlord+Silumgar). Very powerful against Gideon and all the green decks. Any deck capable of casting it should have it in the sideboard." – Household Name Reid Duke*
