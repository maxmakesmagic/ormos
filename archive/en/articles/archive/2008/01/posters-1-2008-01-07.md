Morningtide, as you may have heard, is a class-based set. We don't mean that in the sense of "snooty, monocle-wearing creatures", but in the sense of "everyone's got a job".


Three of those jobs are Rogue, Shaman, and Warrior. Rogues look like this:


![Rogue](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/mtgcom/arcana1000/1498_MORPoster_Rogue.jpg)*[Rogue Poster in PDF (1.7MB)](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=magic/images/mtgcom/arcana1000/1498_MORPoster_Rogue.pdf)*
Sneaky, aren't they? Shamans look like this:
