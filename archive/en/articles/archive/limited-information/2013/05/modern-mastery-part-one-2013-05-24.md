*Modern Masters* is a real Draft format. I don't feel the need to build any more excitement for this release than there already is. With a full slate of exciting and sought-after reprints, some sick new artwork, and a premium foil card in every pack, *Modern Masters* has done plenty to garner attention for itself.

That said, it is a real Draft format, and that's what we will be taking an initial look at over the next few columns.

That, and a bunch of sweet preview cards from the set.

For Drafters, By Drafters
 Take a look at the design and development team for *Modern Masters*: 

* [Max McCall](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Archive.aspx?author=Max%20McCall)
* [Erik Lauer](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Archive.aspx?author=Erik%20Lauer)
* [Ryan Spain](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Archive.aspx?author=Ryan%20Spain)
* [Shawn Main](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Archive.aspx?author=Shawn%20Main)
* [Aaron Forsythe](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Archive.aspx?author=Aaron%20 Forsythe)

 That is a list of Spikey draft junkies right there. Having had personal experience with each of these people, I had a good idea what to expect from *Modern Masters* draft. 

 I expected complexity, depth, and nearly endless interaction. Core sets—and even expansion-level releases—have to carry a level of accessibility to newer players. They must be complex enough to satisfy the people who draft them 50–100 times (like me), but straightforward enough that if you only draft the set four or five times, you aren't feeling totally lost ([like Fblthp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=like+Fblthp)). 

*Modern Masters* takes the gloves off. If you love complex, interesting, deep Draft formats, this is for you. And why not? There are plenty of great products aimed at the broader audience: *Planechase*, Commander decks, Intro Packs, *Duels of the Planeswalkers*, the From the Vaults series, and so on. 

 But what about the hardcore enfranchised players? While often the most vocal group, and the one who makes up a big percent of the active **Magic** community, enfranchised players are demographically much smaller than the hoards of "casual" players who play **Magic**. (I used quotes around "casual" because I don't think it's the correct word, but it's the one that is used the most often). *Modern Masters* Draft is like a big "Thank you!" to the enfranchised players. It's varied, complex, and filled with fan favorites from years past. 

The Buddy System
This draft format is like many others in that it's been designed with color pairs in mind. There is overlap, but each of the ten two-color combinations has its own base archetype. I'll be walking you through a few color pairs over the next three columns, using preview cards to spotlight some of the archetypes. I'm not going to go too deep into each one, and I won't cover them all. But I think you will get the idea of where development was going after seeing some of the cards.
