### 5. [Fated Retribution](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fated+Retribution)


It's been a while since an instant speed "[Wrath of God](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wrath+of+God)" effect has been printed and control players are happy to supplement their removal suite with a board wiper that did not require them to tap out. Planeswalkers have always been the bane of control decks and [Fated Retribution](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fated+Retribution) conveniently removes them while keeping friendly [Detention Sphere](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Detention+Sphere)s safe from harm. Wei Yifan went to the extent of playing two copies in the maindeck, a testament of how good the card is in the Esper control archetype.

### 4. [Xenagos, God of Revels](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Xenagos%2C+God+of+Revels) & [Xenagos, the Reveler](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Xenagos%2C+the+Reveler)


The combination of both his incarnations is more than sufficient for Red Green based decks to make a resurgence, providing resilience against control decks by being so difficult to remove. Red Green decks will continue to be a menace in the metagame, especially while partner-in-crime [Domri Rade](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Domri+Rade) is in the mix.

### 3. [Courser of Kruphix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Courser+of+Kruphix)


One of the best cards introduced in Born of the Gods, this nifty Centaur is tough enough to deter incoming attackers and conveniently gains the owner some life while generating card advantage. The "Jack of all Trades" found homes in Ash Webster's Jund deck, as well as Huang Hao-Shan's Red Green Monsters archetype and some Simic brews utilizing [Kiora, the Crashing Wave](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kiora%2C+the+Crashing+Wave).

### 2. [Sphinx's Revelation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sphinx%27s+Revelation)


If there was any doubt as to whether or not [Keepsake Gorgon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Keepsake+Gorgon) is the best uncommon in *Theros* Limited, there is no question about it now. The five-mana monstrosity creature has proven itself to be the best uncommon in this set's Sealed and Booster Draft formats.


Old habits die hard. Players love to draw cards and its difficult to kick the habit. Nowadays, either you go really fast and kill the control player before this card gets out of hand, or you simply get buried by the insane card advantage. Good enough to send Patty Robertson to the finals and two other players into the Top 8, [Sphinx's Revelation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sphinx%27s+Revelation) will continue to be force to be reckoned with, until the next Standard rotation. [Temple of Enlightenment](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Temple+of+Enlightenment) deserves an honorable mention too!

### 1. [Pack Rat](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pack+Rat)


Nope, we're not quite done yet. Ever since its dominance in the world *Return to Ravnica* Limited, these pesky rodents continue to dominate in Standard. Exponential growth is often unfair, and when paired with [Thoughtseize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtseize), it can mean a swift death for the unprepared. Champion Nam Sung-Wook was always first to finish his Top 8 matches, thanks to the raw brutality of [Pack Rat](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pack+Rat).
