Mark Rosewater wasn’t the only person to run a trivia game show at Worlds this year. Koichiro Maki’s ran on Thursday, and it followed a more tradition game show format, with the questions rising in difficulty and prizes going from one rare (after answering the fifth question correctly) to a thousand (after question fifteen).


The **Magic** Game Show had lifelines: a 50/50 option (two wrong answers got eliminated, leaving one right and one wrong answer), “Ask the audience,” and “phone a friend,” although the friend had to be in the audience. (And there wasn’t a phone.)


Before the first game, Maki played Jan-Ken-Po (Rock-Paper-Scissors) against the entire crowd. Everyone who tied or lost had to sit down. Then he played again against the people who had beaten him. He repeated this until there were only two people remaining. Then they played each other for the right to play for ... a THOUSAND RARES!


This happened twice, so we have two sets of fifteen questions created by Rich Hagon. Enjoy! And remember, they get harder as you go along.
