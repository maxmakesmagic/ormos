**Core Set Survivor!**There are exactly sixteen cards that have been in every core set from *Alpha* to *Tenth Edition*. When ***Magic** 2010* comes out, that number will be eight. Over the next three weeks, we'll be counting them down in this special Arcana sub-feature, giving you an "IN" or "OUT" on one card a day. Step forward, [Fear](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fear).
