Blake is the content manager for DailyMTG.com, making him the one you should email if you have thoughts on the website, good or less good (or not good). He's a longtime coverage reporter and hasn't turned down a game of Magic in any format ever. 






This week, before things get too conspiratorial, we've got [*Eldritch Moon* Game Day](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/event-types/gameday) happening at your [local game stores](http://locator.wizards.com/). Go and prove your dominance over your friends—you're going to need that advantage for what comes next.


Because next is *Conspiracy: Take the Crown*, and your friends will become enemies just like that as you strive to grab a throne that's there for the taking.


We'll be starting previews next week, but to give you a taste of what's to come, we've got the packaging from the set ready for your viewing pleasure—starting with Marchesa's visage watching over us all on the box.

You'll also find her watching you on booster packs as well. She's everywhere. As is her right as the current monarch.

Two others adorn the boosters as well. Who could these individuals possibly be?

But that's not all! As we announced with the set, you can also purchase blister packs with three packs of *Conspiracy: Take the Crown*—exactly enough to jump in a draft with some friends. And on the cover image of that pack is—Marchesa. It really is good to be queen.
