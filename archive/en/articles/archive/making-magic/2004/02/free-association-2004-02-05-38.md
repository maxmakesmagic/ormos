When I first started playing **Magic** (you know, back when I was playing my [Craw Wurm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Craw+Wurm), broken [Stasis](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stasis), green/blue/red deck) I made a great number of friends. To differentiate them from my older group of friends, I dubbed them my “**Magic** friends”. I've noticed a number of other people using this term. And to make matters worse, I just used it in [this column](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/daily/mr110-this). 

Why can't we all just use the term “friends”? Why the need to segregate?
