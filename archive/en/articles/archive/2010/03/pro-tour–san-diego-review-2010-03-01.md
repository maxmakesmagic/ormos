The 2010 **Magic** Pro Tour season kicked off in [San Diego](/en/events/coverage/g%C3%B6rtzen-goes-all-way-san-diego), and now it's time to see how the dust has settled.

Paul Jordan crunched the numbers for all the major deck archetypes. If you're looking for the hard numbers on what beat what, you won't want to miss it.
