What if there was a way to see cool *Return to Ravnica* art and get exclusive wallpapers? And what if you got to earn points for your guild and eventually reveal a preview card? 


 And what if it was Art Fight: Ravnica on Facebook?

The main element of Art Fight: Ravnica is this:

 Each day, you'll be shown two pieces of art and have to decide between them based on important criteria like "Which spell is most useful for doing chores?" In this case, I chose the piece on the right on the grounds that fire is a great for replacement for sweeping the floor. And anyway, the one on the left looks like it's just creating *more* chores. 


Then you have to predict whether the community agrees with your choice. If you're right, you'll earn points for your guild and unlock a wallpaper in your Guild Hall. And as guilds earn more points, they'll get closer to seeing a preview card that's exclusive to Art Fight: Ravnica!


 Art Fight: Ravnica is going on right now! Join in!
