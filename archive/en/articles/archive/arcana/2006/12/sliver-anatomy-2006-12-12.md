A sliver’s anatomy often reflects the adaptation that it transfers to the other members of its species.

Check out the brainy lobes on [Telekinetic Sliver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Telekinetic+Sliver) for example:

To reflect its added wiliness in battle, [Watcher Sliver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Watcher+Sliver) has evolved rows of eyes along its head, where most slivers have none:

It’s subtle, but [Bonesplitter Sliver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bonesplitter+Sliver)’s adaptation is shown right in the art. It doesn’t carry around Bonesplitters; it has a special adaptation to its blood. Its blood rages with *bioluminescent blood*. You can see it flowing through its veins right through the skin:

[Spinneret Sliver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spinneret+Sliver) sports organs referred to in its name—organs that let it spin webs like a spider. Imagine the arachnid-like clicking sound this guy would make:
