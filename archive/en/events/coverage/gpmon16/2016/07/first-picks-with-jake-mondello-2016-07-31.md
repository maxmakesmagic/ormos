Few things in *Magic* are more fun that cracking open a booster pack. And when it comes to drafting, players have perfected the art of the “crack-a-pack,” or opening a booster to debate what the best card to take with your first pick of the draft is. And with the release of *Eldritch Moon* and its premier play debut at Grand Prix Montreal, there was no better time to play everyone's favorite pack-opening exercise.


For some expert advice we turned to Jake Mondello, a two-time Grand Prix Top 8 competitor who has plenty of experience with breaking down new Limited formats.

| Pack 1 |  |  |  |  |
| [Midnight Scavengers](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Midnight+Scavengers) | [Take Inventory](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Take+Inventory) | [Tattered Haunter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tattered+Haunter) | [Borrowed Grace](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Borrowed+Grace) | [Wolfkin Bond](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wolfkin+Bond) |
| [Succumb to Temptation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Succumb+to+Temptation) | [Field Creeper](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Field+Creeper) | [Spectral Reserves](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spectral+Reserves) | [Laboratory Brute](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Laboratory+Brute) | [Prophetic Ravings](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Prophetic+Ravings) |
| [Shreds of Sanity](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shreds+of+Sanity) | [Vexing Scuttler](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vexing+Scuttler) | [Clear Shot](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Clear+Shot) | [Bedlam Reveler](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bedlam+Reveler) |  |

 


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Bedlam+Reveler)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=BEDLAM+REVELER)
**Mondello:** “Clear Shot is a really good card, but the ceiling is higher on [Bedlam Reveler](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bedlam+Reveler), which is something you want to look for early in a draft. In this case, red is the best color in *Eldritch Moon* by far, so I'd want to take the [Bedlam Reveler](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bedlam+Reveler) here.”




| Pack 2 |  |  |  |  |
| [Wretched Gryff](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wretched+Gryff) | [Galvanic Bombardment](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Galvanic+Bombardment) | [Grapple with the Past](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grapple+with+the+Past) | [Steadfast Cathar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Steadfast+Cathar) | [Strange Augmentation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Strange+Augmentation) |
| [Crossroads Consecrator](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crossroads+Consecrator) | [Thraben Foulbloods](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thraben+Foulbloods) | [Convolute](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Convolute) | [Make Mischief](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Make+Mischief) | [Tangleclaw Werewolf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tangleclaw+Werewolf) |
| [Long Road Home](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Long+Road+Home) | [Ruthless Disposal](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ruthless+Disposal) | [Deranged Whelp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deranged+Whelp) | [Stromkirk Occultist](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stromkirk+Occultist) |  |

[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Stromkirk+Occultist)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stromkirk+Occultist)


**Mondello:** “I think you have to take the rare because the upside on [Stromkirk Occultist](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stromkirk+Occultist) is higher, but [Galvanic Bombardment](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Galvanic+Bombardment) is really good. It's the best common in the best color, and I would take it over most things. After that the next best card is [Ruthless Disposal](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ruthless+Disposal). It's harder to evaluate but I've been happy with it so far. The final card to consider is [Wretched Gryff](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wretched+Gryff), but it's not on the same level. In this case I'm not worried about taking a red card and passing another really good one, because it's going to your left and you can just take the good cards away.”




| Pack 3 |  |  |  |  |
| [Otherworldly Outburst](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Otherworldly+Outburst) | [Woodcutter's Grit](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Woodcutter%27s+Grit) | [Repel the Abominable](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Repel+the+Abominable) | [Prophetic Ravings](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Prophetic+Ravings) | [Cathar's Shield](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cathar%27s+Shield) |
| [Thraben Standard Bearer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thraben+Standard+Bearer) | [Borrowed Malevolence](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Borrowed+Malevolence) | [Borrowed Hostility](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Borrowed+Hostility) | [Scour the Laboratory](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scour+the+Laboratory) | [Exultant Cultist](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Exultant+Cultist) |
| [Foul Emissary](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Foul+Emissary) | [Vildin-Pack Outcast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vildin-Pack+Outcast) | [Prey Upon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Prey+Upon) | [Selfless Spirit](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Selfless+Spirit) |  |

[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Selfless+Spirit)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=SELFLESS+SPIRIT)
**Mondello:** “This one is hard because there's a lot of good cards. [Selfless Spirit](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Selfless+Spirit) is definitely the hardest to play against, which makes me want to take it because it's always at the worst a 2/1 flyer for two. [Foul Emissary](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Foul+Emissary) is also really good, though it needs to be something like a black-green deck rather than red-green. In the end I would take the [Selfless Spirit](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Selfless+Spirit) because it has the highest ceiling, but it's very close with [Prey Upon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Prey+Upon).”
