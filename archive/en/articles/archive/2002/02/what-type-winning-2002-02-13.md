"You Make The Card" in which our readers get to vote on all the aspects of a card that will appear in a real expansion set in 2002, is in full swing.


The color has been determined (green), and voting for the card's type has been going on for a week. As of Tuesday afternoon, "creature" had a wide lead over the field. The totals (in order):




|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Creature | 949 |
| Enchantment | 469 |
| Instant | 330 |
| Sorcery | 111 |
| Total | 1856 |

Voting will run through midnight Sunday night. If you haven't voted yet, do so by clicking the You Make The Card icon at the top of our [front page](http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=mtgcom/welcome). Tell your friends to vote as well! Or, [discuss it on our boards](http://boards.wizards.com/tcg-bin/ultimatebb.cgi?ubb=get_topic&f=28&t=007843)! Will creature win? Or will one of the other three types make a late run? Find out next Wednesday right here on MagicTheGathering.com!
