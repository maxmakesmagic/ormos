It's that time of the year again! For those in the Northern Hemisphere, the leaves are turning colors and falling, the temperatures are growing cooler, and of course *Shards of Alara* is finally here! Er...I guess that's true for everyone in *every* hemisphere. How about some decks?

This week we've got everything that has to do with Premier Events on **Magic Online** and of course the very first trickle from the Pro Tour Qualifier—Kyoto season. Columbus, Ohio checked in early with an October 4 event, and we've got the entire Top 8 for your perusal. Find out what the players in Ohio managed to come up with in triple *Shards* draft, and stay tuned each week for all the latest in PTQ technology!
