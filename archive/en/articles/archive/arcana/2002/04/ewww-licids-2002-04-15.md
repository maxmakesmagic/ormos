Licids were one of the more interesting twists on creature enchantments. There were twelve licids in all -- five each in *Tempest* and *Stronghold*, and two more in *Exodus*. Below is their (small) entry in the *Tempest* Block Style Guide.

In the card art, licids were always show attached to a "host." At least one non-licid card contains a licid: [Mage il-Vec](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mage+il-Vec) from *Exodus*. The John Matson illustration on this card was originally commissioned for a licid. (It's attached to the back of the mage's head.) The *Tempest* team joked that perhaps it was fashionable to wear licids in Rath.
