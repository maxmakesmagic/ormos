### Between your two decks, which card has been the best for you this weekend?

**Paulo Vitor Damo da Rosa/Willy Edel/Allison Abe**



**da Rosa:** [Arbor Colossus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arbor+Colossus). It was in my deck yesterday, and I didn't have many ways to deal with fliers. Plus it's just an incredibly powerful card in its own right.


**Edel:** Mountain? I did play red in both decks... I'd probably say [Xenagos, the Reveler](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Xenagos%2C+the+Reveler). He let me simply steal some games against opponents yesterday.


**Abe:** [Prognostic Sphinx](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Prognostic+Sphinx). It's so hard to deal with.

**Armando Bulnes/Stephen Berrios/Ian Farnung**



**Bulnes:** [Revel of the Fallen God](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Revel+of+the+Fallen+God). My deck yesterday was an 18-land, 22 mana source, ramp into double Revel special. I think the over/under of the number of Satyrs I've made this weekend is 42.5. In this deck, it's probably [Keranos, God of Storms](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Keranos%2C+God+of+Storms). Though if someone had their way, it would have been in my sideboard...


**Berrios:** Yeah, yeah...I was wrong about that. My best card has easily been [Servant of Tymaret](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Servant+of+Tymaret). I did 20 to people multiple times this weekend with just [Servant of Tymaret](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Servant+of+Tymaret) triggers.


**Farnung:** [Observant Alseid](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Observant+Alseid). The card's just really powerful in a focused heroic deck. All of the *Theros* bestow creatures are.

**Lucas Esper Berthoud/Paulo Ricardo Cortez/Walter Perez**



**Berthoud:** This is going to sound really stupid, but it's probably [Cyclops of One-Eyed Pass](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cyclops+of+One-Eyed+Pass). My deck yesterday had so much removal that people couldn't keep creatures in play against me. I just needed a creature that could kill them quickly, and the Cyclops filled that role perfectly.


**Cortez:** [Gods Willing](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gods+Willing). I have played red/white heroic twice now, and [Gods Willing](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gods+Willing) just did so much for me. It saved my creatures, triggered heroic, and won me many games.


**Perez:** Any of the two-casting cost mana creatures: [Golden Hind](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Golden+Hind), [Kiora's Follower](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kiora%27s+Follower), [Voyaging Satyr](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Voyaging+Satyr), and even [Font of Fertility](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Font+of+Fertility). I have had a bunch of them between my two decks, and they have been the key. It's very important to ramp up to the four-drop slot in this format.
