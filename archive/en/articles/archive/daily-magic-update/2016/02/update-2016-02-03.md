The February 3, 2016 Update

The Daily *Magic* Update is a roundup of everything *Magic* you should know on February 3, 2016. Today's Update is brought to you by the [Top 25](#top25), [Pro Tour Gauntlet](#gauntlet), and a certain crown that a certain someone should totally be wearing.


Today's Must
============


1. [Preparing for Pro Tour: *Oath of the Gatewatch*](http://magic.tcgplayer.com/db/article.asp?ID=13103&writer=Seth+Manfield&articledate=2-3-2016)  | TCGPlayer | Seth Manfield

[Reigning World Champion](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/2015wc) Seth Manfield—who, in my opinion should be contractually obligated to wear a crown at all times—has been busy preparing for Pro Tour *Oath of the Gatewatch*, and he's more than happy to share some of his results with you. Because Seth Manfield is unscoutable. And basically unbeatable. Or, at least that's the impression you'd get if he wore a crown.


After That, Read, Watch, or Listen to These
===========================================


1. [The Groundhog Day Brew Review](http://www.starcitygames.com/article/32325_The-Groundhog-Day-Brew-Review.html) | StarCityGames.com | Matt Higgs

This one was up yesterday, but StarCityGame.com's site was down for a good part of the morning, so it didn't make the Update. But it was enjoyable enough that I included today!


Groundhog Day is, in fact, a weird holiday. And [a great movie](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0107048/). And, as it turns out, a great opening to an article by Matt Higgs. This funny, insightful article takes a simple, oft-repeated article concept—brewing new decks—and makes it entertaining, interesting, and fun. And that's not just because I'm a sucker for Groundhog Day references. Though I am. But if you're looking for something to spice up your Standard FNM, this is a fantastic place to start.


1. [Channel CalebD—*Oath of the Gatewatch* Draft](http://www.channelfireball.com/videos/channel-calebd-oath-of-the-gatewatch-draft/)  | ChannelFireball | Caleb Durward

Lost in the excitement of a wild, changed Modern format is the fact that we'll be drafting *Oath of the Gatewatch* for six of the sixteen rounds, and those rounds can make or break someone's tournament! Caleb Durward is hardly the only one with an *Oath* draft ready for your viewing, his is just one of the most recent. ChannelFireball has a few others for your entertainment and education, including videos from [Luis Scott-Vargas](http://www.channelfireball.com/videos/channel-lsv-oath-of-the-gatewatch-draft/) and [Marshall Sutcliffe](http://www.channelfireball.com/videos/channel-marshall-oath-of-the-gatewatch-draft/).


1. [Pet Cards](http://www.rocketjump.com/listen/pet-cards-95) | The Command Zone | Jimmy Wong and Josh Lee Kwai

Jimmy and Josh are joined by Craig Blanchette to talk pet Commander cards. There's a [Helm of Possession](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Helm+of+Possession) in there, so they have my attention.


It definitely gets you thinking about your own preferences. My pet cards? [Mulldrifter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mulldrifter). [Gifts Ungiven](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gifts+Ungiven). [Cryptic Command](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cryptic+Command). All of the Jaces. [All of them](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?action=advanced&output=spoiler&method=visual&name=+%5bJace%5d&type=+%5b%22Planeswalker%22%5d). And probably [Narset Transcendent](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Narset+Transcendent). Oh, and Island.

1. [Pro Tour *Oath of the Gatewatch* Preview with Shaun Penrod](http://www.rocketjump.com/listen/10949)  | The Masters of Modern | Alex Kessler and Ben Bateman

Podcasters unite! Shaun Penrod, the host of the [MTG Pro Tutor podcast](http://www.mtgprotutor.com/), joins the Masters of Modern to break down what to expect at Pro Tour *Oath of the Gatewatch*, which, as you might have heard, starts this Friday!

 This morning we announced Pro Tour Gauntlet, and it's already got people [talking around the interwebz](https://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/440c2s/new_kind_of_mtgo_event_pro_tour_gauntlet_looks/). [Head to the article](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/magic-digital/pro-tour-gauntlet-comes-magic-online-2016-02-03) if you're interested, but the gist of it is we let you play some of the top decks from the Pro Tour on *Magic Online* in a Phantom Constructed event. Not sure what that means? Read the article!




 Oh, and this also seemed like a good pace to point out that the tweeter above is [Quinn Murphy](https://twitter.com/qh_murphy), one of the new writers coming to DailyMTG. He's making his debut later this month!

Do you follow [Magic: The Traveling](https://twitter.com/mgcthetraveling)? If not, your only real excuse is travel envy, because this Twitter account goes pretty much everywhere. And when he gets there, he plays *Magic*. Surfing in the ocean? He's played *Magic* there. Fenway Park? He's played *Magic* there. Grand Prix? He's, uh, played *Magic* there too. He also scheduled events at [Grand Prix Oakland](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/gpoak16). There could be more in the future. Follow to find out! And to get jealous almost daily.


Top 25
======



1. Anteri moves on up

Winning a Grand Prix does wonders for your ranking, don't you think? Sitting at a "mere" 17th on the Top 25 Pro Rankings list last week, Fabrizio Anteri leaps into the Top 10 in 9th after winning [Grand Prix Mexico City](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/gpmex16). It was easily the biggest jump on the week, but it wasn't the only one.


* Kazuyuki Takimura is the second big gainer, up five spots to No. 19.
* Eric Froehlich and Paulo Vitor Damo Da Rosa were the highest-ranked players to change positions, this time mostly on the strength of Froehlich's near-miss in [Vancouver](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/gpvan16), where he lost playing for a potential Top 8 berth in the last round. Still, his 21st-place finish was good enough to nab some points.

Martin Dang rejoins the rankings after falling off a little bit ago. His Top 8 appearance in Mexico City was cut short by Anteri, but it was good enough to kick him up to No. 24.

Deck of the Day

1. [Storm is dead. Long live Storm.](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/mtgo-standings/modern-constructed-league-2016-02-02)

It's been a while, old friend. Storm has been quiet in Modern for some time after standing out as one of the boogeymen of the format. But with many players utilizing their [Steam Vents](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Steam+Vents) for casting [Pestermite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pestermite)s and [Splinter Twin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Splinter+Twin)s, Storm took a back seat to infinity Faeries. Now that all of the [Scalding Tarn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scalding+Tarn)s have been freed up? Maybe it's Storm's time to shine.


With both [Pyromancer Ascension](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyromancer+Ascension) and [Past in Flames](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Past+in+Flames), the deck is capable of chaining all of its cantrips and ritual effects one after the other, followed by a lethal [Grapeshot](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grapeshot) or [Empty the Warrens](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Empty+the+Warrens). This particular version touches on another "kill" spell—[Blood Moon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Moon). With Urza lands and [Eldrazi Temple](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eldrazi+Temple)s running rampant right now, that seems like a pretty solid way to shut down an opponent's game plan, leaving Storm to do its own thing.


Which, let's be honest, is all Storm players want to do anyway.
