4-way Solomon Draft
===================

 Brian David-Marshall is a New York–based game designer who has been involved with Magic since 1994, when he started organizing tournaments and ran a Manhattan game store. Since then, he has been a judge, a player, and one of the longest-tenured columnists on DailyMTG.com, as he enters his second decade writing for the site. He is also the Pro Tour Historian and one of the commentators for the Pro Tour. 






Neil reeves sat down for the Solomon action along with film student Jeff Taylor, Donald “The Governor” Paul, and Top 32 competitor at PT Venice, Michael Musser. As the players pored over the 200 card pool and tried to develop and anticipate strategies they bantered with each other and set the tone for this immensely fun event.

Don Paul: “These cards are not good, I won’t lie to you…”  
 Neil Reeves: “I’m from Arkansas, originally and you all know who my Governor was. He may have ‘lied’ form time to time…”  
 Don Paul: “Depends on your definition of lie…”

While the political discussion was taking place, Jeff Taylor was sorting all of the cards by color to make it easier for the other players in the pod to take in the cards. With a sly grin as the cards are passed to him, Neil Reeves is reshuffling the piles. He is concerned that the cards will clump into colors when they are dealt out into 25-card piles, “Way to color sort, gomer!”

Michael Musser was randomly selected to make the first piles and he was clearly flummoxed by the process and decided to spread each color out over all four piles and let someone else make the tough decisions. Neil was choosing first—Musser last—and would be making the next set of piles.

**Neil Reeves**

Neil separated the next pile of 25 and was faced with a difficult decision and made a small pile with Blinding Angel and Hermetic Study—has he left the Study in another pile he thinks he might have gotten it to come around. Interestingly, The Governor’s first pick was the pile that Neil thought was least impressive.

Now it was Don Paul’s chance to split with Jeff Taylor taking first. In hindsight, he could have made any pile of cards with Rofellos in it and Jeff might have taken that one, “I needed the Rofellos for a deck this weekend!” he laughed.

With his Rofellos secured for a later portion of the tournament it now turned to Jeff to make the pile. He would also make the next set of piles when the draft switched direction. The pick seemed clear for Michael Musser who somehow also picked up a Symbiotic Elf.

The next batch of cards swung the other way and Jeff could do nothing to keep Don Paul from snatching up a Pestilence while Neil scooped up a pretty spiffy set of cards himself. Somehow the powerful Midsummer Revel found its way to Jeff. Good cards for everyone!

Now it was Neil Reeves turn to split and he didn’t understand what was happening when Michael Musser took a pile with Sparkcaster and Nomadic Elf over a pile with Phantom Nishoba, “I could be wrong but I think the Nishoba is the best card there. *I could be wrong*…but I’m not!”

When all the cards were drafted no one felt especially proud of their decks. Although there were powerful cards in everyone’s piles it seemed like no one would be able to play only two colors. At the other tables there was far more excitement over decks as two pairs of players chose to use cooperative draft strategies.
