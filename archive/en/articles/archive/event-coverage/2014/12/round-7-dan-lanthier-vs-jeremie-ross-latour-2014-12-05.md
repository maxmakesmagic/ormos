It was a battle for the sole undefeated here in the last round of Day 1. Both players were going aggressive, Dan Lanthier with red-white, and Jeremie Ross-Latour with black-red.


Lanthier's opening [Elite Vanguard](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elite+Vanguard) quickly fell to [Deathmark](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deathmark) from Ross-Latour. He replaced it with [Goblin Piker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Piker), and Ross-Latour went one better with [Crimson Mage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crimson+Mage). Lanthier played a land and passed. Ross-Latour had Sorin's[Thirst](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thirst) to clear a path for his [Crimson Mage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crimson+Mage). Four mana for Lanthier, but still he had no play.


Ross-Latour decided to see what was up with [Distress](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Distress). Lanthier [Incinerate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Incinerate)d the Mage in response, and dropped a handful of lands onto the table. He drew an [Alabaster Mage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Alabaster+Mage) and put it into play. Now it was Ross-Latour's turn to pass without action. Lanthier drained him for two with his Mage.


Ross-Latour put a stop to that with [Blood Ogre](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Ogre). Lanthier drew another blank, and an [Incinerate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Incinerate) from Ross-Latour let him get in for two damage. [Goblin Chieftain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Chieftain) came off the top for Lanthier and hit. Ross-Latour [Disentomb](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Disentomb)ed [Crimson Mage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crimson+Mage) for some hasty action of his own. Now Lanthier was forced to sit back. Ross-Latour started to hit with just the [Blood Ogre](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Ogre), slowly whittling away Lanthier's life.


It brought him to 12 before Lanthier got rid of it with [Incinerate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Incinerate), but he still had nothing to contribute to the board. Ross-Latour tried to clear out the Chieftain with [Chandra's Outrage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chandra%27s+Outrage), but the results were mixed: Lanthier used [Fling](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fling) to get rid of [Crimson Mage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crimson+Mage) and save himself some damage. That meant that Ross-Latour's [Duskhunter Bat](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duskhunter+Bat) came down as a lowly 1/1.


Lanthier found Goblin[Fireslinger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fireslinger) and played it. Ross-Latour hit in the air and played a second, larger [Duskhunter Bat](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duskhunter+Bat), as well as [Bonebreaker Giant](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bonebreaker+Giant). Lanthier passed with no play. Ross-Latour rumbled in with his squad. Lanthier pushed his [Fireslinger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fireslinger) in front of the Giant and tapped three for [Slaughter Cry](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Slaughter+Cry), catching Ross-Latour off-guard.


Lanthier's second [Goblin Chieftain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Chieftain) came off the top, and he was able to swing in for four. The two traded hits. An [Incinerate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Incinerate) from Lanthier took down the bigger Bat, and though he was at four, it looked like he was pulling away. Ross-Latour brought down a [Goblin Piker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Piker), and Lanthier tried to force through more damage with [Tectonic Rift](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tectonic+Rift). Unfortunately for him Ross-Latour had been holding back [Doom Blade](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Doom+Blade), cutting down the [Goblin Chieftain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Chieftain). That tilted things back in Ross-Latour's favour, and soon the game was his.


Ross-Latour 1 - Lanthier 0


Lanthier kicked off with Goblin Fireslinger into [Goblin Piker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Piker). [Child of Night](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Child+of+Night) from Ross-Latour forced his squad to stay home. He added another [GoblinÂ Fireslinger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin%C2%A0Fireslinger) and passed. Ross-Latour decided to go on the offensive with his Child, and was promptly punished by a [Goblin Chieftain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Chieftain) from Lanthier, powering up his team for a whoppign nine damage, leaving Ross-Latour at twelve.

*Jeremie Ross-Latour* |


Ross-Latour kept his Child at home and passed. Lanthier, too, was content to bide his time. Next came a hasty [Crimson Mage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crimson+Mage) for Ross-Latour and he got in for four. Lanthier was happy with this turn of events and swung back, but Ross-Latour had [Doom Blade](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Doom+Blade) for the Chieftain. Ross-Latour returned fire.


It was a close contest, with Ross-Latour out in front. Lanthier summoned [Goblin Bangchuckers](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Bangchuckers). Ross-Latour hit with his Mage and Child. The Piker took down the Child, but the Mage got through to charge up Ross-Latour's newly-summoned [Duskhunter Bat](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duskhunter+Bat). He tapped four more for [Rusted Sentinel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rusted+Sentinel). Lanthier was in trouble.


Ross-Latour went for the kill. Lanthier put his Bangchuckers in front of [Crimson Mage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crimson+Mage) and flipped to kill the Bat, leaving [Rusted Sentinel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rusted+Sentinel) unblocked. He won the flip, clearing the first hurdle, but was still short on killing Ross-Latour, who added [Blood Ogre](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Ogre) to his squad. Luck smiled on Lanthier, however, and served up an [Incinerate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Incinerate) to go with the one he already had in hand, stealing the game.


Ross-Latour 1 - Lanthier 1


The good news for Lanthier was that he would start the deciding game with double [Fireslinger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fireslinger). The bad news was that he would only have a single mountain in play after his second turn. Ross-Latour had meantime summoned [Child of Night](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Child+of+Night) and swung in. Lanthier declined to block, and [Duskhunter Bat](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duskhunter+Bat) hit the table as a 2/2.


Lanthier drew and found Plains waiting for him, enabling [Elite Vanguard](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elite+Vanguard). He was happy to trade it for [Child of Night](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Child+of+Night) when Ross-Latour swung in. Ross-Latour replaced it with [Drifting Shade](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Drifting+Shade). Lanthier's [Fireslinger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fireslinger)s worked his life total. He untapped and thought hard before Incinerating the [Drifting Shade](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Drifting+Shade).

Ross-Latour had [Disentomb](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Disentomb) in hand and gamely replayed it. Lanthier spent a second [Incinerate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Incinerate) on it. The [Duskhunter Bat](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duskhunter+Bat) had meanwhile brought him down to just twelve, but Ross-Latour had no play on six mana. Lanthier summoned [Gideon's Lawkeeper](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gideon%27s+Lawkeeper), whose arrival could not have been more timely, for waiting in the wings was [Flameblast Dragon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flameblast+Dragon) for Ross-Latour.


The lockdown continued for two turns, the [Fireslinger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fireslinger)s working hard to bring Ross-Latour into [Lava Axe](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lava+Axe) range. It was not to be. Ross-Latour peeled removal and caught the Lawkeeper. With six land in play, the Flameblast could swing in for exactly lethal.
