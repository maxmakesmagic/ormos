It was a fitting end to the day, pairing first-time World Championship competitor Yuuki Ichikawa against one of only three players to play in all three of these events, Josh Utter-Leyton.



 On one side you have twenty-fifth-ranked Ichikawa, a popular streamer and one of the hottest players on the tour in the last year. He made his debut recently at Pro Tour Dragon's Maze, but really exploded this year with back-to-back Pro Tour Top 8s, as well as a Grand Prix Top 8. His ranking really underestimates the respect he's given on tour, where he's considered one of the absolute fastest rising players around ([see full profile](/node/314574)).




 On the other side you have the very model of consistency, twentieth-ranked Utter-Leyton. This is the third trip to this tournament for the former player of the year, and his 285 lifetime pro points (and counting) will surely put him at or near the top of Hall of Fame talk in a few years. He's always around, always putting up solid finishes, and always at the top of his game ([see full profile](/node/295836)).



So it was the new gun versus the standard bearer with both players at 4-2 and angling for a spot near the top of the standings as we round the halfway point of the World Championship.




*While Yuuki Ichikawa looks to improve upon the first day of his first World Championship, Utter-Leyton's got his sights on making sure his third consecutive World Championship showing ends with a win.*
