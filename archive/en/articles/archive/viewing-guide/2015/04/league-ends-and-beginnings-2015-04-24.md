While the Grand Prix circuit takes a one-week break in lieu of this Saturday's Regional Pro Tour Qualifiers for [Pro Tour *Magic Origins*](http://magic.wizards.com/en/protour/rptqvan15), there is plenty of non-Premier Play action to catch this weekend as well as the days following.

Let's start off today with a look at something super.

The second season of the [Vintage Super League](http://VintageSuperLeague.com/) concludes this weekend with a best-of-five-*matches* showdown between Eric Froehlich, the No. 1 ranked player in the world, and Chris Pikula, [Meddling Mage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=26591) and the first seed of the post-season matches.



The finals for the second season of the Vintage Super League takes place this Sunday at 1 p.m. PT/4 p.m. ET/8 p.m. GMT on the [*Magic* Twitch Channel](http://www.twitch.tv/magic), so don't miss it!

While the Vintage Super League is wrapping up its season, a brand new season of *Magic* matches is about to get started! The very first season of the Standard Super League kicks off on Tuesday, April 28!



The Standard Super League features eight prominent players from the *Magic* community squaring off with new Standard decks each week for eight weeks, in an eight-player single-elimination challenge. 10 points are awarded to a player for winning a match, and 5 bonus points are awarded to the player who wins the week's single-elimination challenge.



At the end of the eight weeks, the Top 3 points earners will face off in post-season play, where second place and third place must face off in a semifinal bout before moving on to play against the points leader of the season in a climactic final showdown. Commentary will be brought to you by the Hall of Famer duo of Randy Buehler and Luis Scott-Vargas, and each week is sure to show off some exciting decks, innovations, matches, and more.



Join hosts Randy Buehler and Luis Scott-Vargas for the first week of the Standard Super League this Tuesday, April 28, at 6 p.m. PT/9 p.m. ET/1 a.m. GMT on the [*Magic* Twitch Channel](http://www.twitch.tv/magic).

Standard action continues through the weeks, as the [StarCityGames.com Open Series](http://www.starcitygames.com/pages/scgop/overview) stop in Cleveland will feature two days of Standard Constructed action. Will the Standard metagame follow Grand Prix Krakow's trends, featuring prominent numbers of Esper Dragons? Or will the trend move more toward what was seen at last weekend's SCG Open in Providence, where 14-year-old Oliver Tomajko won the tournament with Abzan Whip?



Join Cedric Phillips and Patrick Sullivan for live video coverage of SCG Open Cleveland. It all starts on the [SCGLive Twitch Channel](http://www.twitch.tv/scglive) Saturday at 10:30 a.m. local time (ET)/7:30 a.m. PT/2:30 p.m. GMT. Coverage resumes Sunday at 9 a.m. local time (ET)/6 a.m. PT/1 p.m. GMT.
