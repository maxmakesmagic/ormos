To celebrate the launch of *Duels of the Planeswalkers* on Xbox LIVE Arcade, join us for the Game with Fame event on Saturday, June 20 from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. PST.


So what is Game with Fame? It's an opportunity like no other—the chance to challenge [Hall of Famers](/en/node/574031) Jon Finkel and Mike Turian, columnist Gerry Thompson, long-time pros Brian Kibler and Jamie Parke, and **Magic** creator Richard Garfield on *Duels of the Planeswalkers* via XBLA.


Defeat one of them, and you'll earn the **Spellslinger achievement**. This achievement can be obtained only by defeating someone with the Spellslinger achievement.

Who starts with the Spellslinger achievement? The Game with Famers do, as do people who were involved with the creation of *Duels*. Beat one of them, and you just might face some challengers yourself ....
