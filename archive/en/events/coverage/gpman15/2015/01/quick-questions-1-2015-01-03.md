What is your favorite Fate Reforged previewed card?
===================================================

**Christian Calcano:** Temporal Tresspass. After the results of [Treasure Cruise](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treasure+Cruise) and [Dig Through Time](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dig+Through+Time), I can't see how it's not broken.

**Lee Shi Tian:** The new [Young Pyromancer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Young+Pyromancer), Monastery Mentor, looks crazy.

**Terry Soh:** I like Crux of Fate. It gives black mass removal options.

**Martin JÅ¯za:** Soulfire Grand Master seems great, it's the 2-drop the Jeskai decks have been looking for. The ability to buyback spells seems strong.

**Nam Sung Wook:** Monastary Siege - at three mana it looks like it could be an important card in Modern, maybe in the sideboard.
