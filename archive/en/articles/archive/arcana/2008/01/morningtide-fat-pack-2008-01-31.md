As you know, [*Morningtide* Launch Parties](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/events/releases) are this weekend, starting on Friday. In some locations, they're starting midnight Thursday night. That's February 1-3. [*Morningtide* Launch Parties](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/events/releases). Hang on, I lost my place.

Sorry about that. My *point* is that the Launch Parties are your first opportunity to get a keen *Morningtide* Fat Pack, which looks like this:

![Morningtide Fat Pack](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/mtgcom/arcana1000/1516_FatPack.jpg)Ooh, doesn't it look enticing? Let's take a peek inside!

![Morningtide Fat Pack Contents](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/mtgcom/arcana1000/1516_Contents.jpg)Say! That Pack really *was* Fat! As you can see, you get:

* A player's guide with a complete visual encyclopedia of the set,
* Two card boxes with panoramic art by Steve Prescott, and six color-coded card dividers,
* Six *Morningtide* boosters,
* A pack of 40 *Lorwyn*  basic lands,
* A *Morningtide* spindown life counter (only available in this fatpack)
* The second book of the Lorwyn cycle, by Cory J. Herndon and Scott McGough (the first chapter is [here](http://ww2.wizards.com/Books/Downloads/products_magicnovel_216337400.zip) as a 129KB ZIP file), and
* One random Pro Tour Player card.

Looks good, doesn't it? And do you know how when your first opportunity to get one will be? Correct: your local [*Morningtide* Launch Party](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/events/releases). And remember, if you're in North America, select stores are having Midnight Madness events ([USA Schedule](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/events/releases-na#usa1); [Canada Schedule](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/events/releases-na#canada1)) so you can get your *Morningtide* Fat Pack as soon as possible!
