As you may already know, some double-faced cards depict the same location on each side. If you *didn't* already know that, check out [this Arcana](/en/articles/archive/two-sides-2011-09-21), which covers the topic pretty comprehensively.

So today, in honor of Transformation Week, we're going to look at a double-faced card with art that mirrors the other side thematically, rather than literally. Did you follow that? Look, just click on the image to see what's on the other side of the card. The vines turn into window frames!
