Ask Wizards is a weekly feature that allows you to ask us questions! If you'd like to submit your question please email it to [AskWizards@wizards.com](mailto:AskWizards@wizards.com).

**Q: What's the deal with the colored dots on the Pacts in *Modern Masters*? - Harry O.** 


**A: Trick Jarrett, Editor-in-Chief of DailyMTG.com**


Up until the *Innistrad* block, there were only two ways for a card to be colored. First was, of course, the mana in its casting cost. Was there white mana? Then it was a white spell. Was there blue and red mana? Then it was both a blue and a red spell.


Occasionally we did spells that broke this rule. [Summoner's Pact](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Summoner%27s+Pact) has a casting cost of ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20210707095534im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless0.gif) but is a green spell, and so when it was originally printed it included a line in the rules text that defined the spell as a green spell.

In *Innistrad* block, for the rules around double-faced cards, we needed a way to easily show the color of a spell, since the backs of the cards didn't have casting costs. So when [Gatstaf Shepherd](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gatstaf+Shepherd) transformed into [Gatstaf Howler](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gatstaf+Howler), we could easily show that even though the Howler didn't have a mana cost he still remained a green creature. To do this without using up space in the rules text, [we introduced the color indicator](http://www.wizards.com/magic/tcg/article.aspx?x=mtg/tcg/innistrad/dfcrules), which is the dot you now see in the type line when you transform the Shepherd.
