**What age must I be to participate in the new *MTG Arena* Premier Play events?**


Players must be 18 years or older.


**What is the first-place prize for the Arena Championship? What is the minimum prize for the Arena Championship?**


We will announce the prize breakdown for the first Arena Championship as we get closer to the event.


**Are Arena Championships replacing Set Championships or will both exist under the new system.**


Set Championships have been sunsetted with [the return of the Pro Tour](https://magic.gg/news/return-of-the-pro-tour-your-path-to-playing-magic-at-the-highest-level), a role they filled when our previous system was derailed by COVID. Arena Championships are a new event system.


**Will a travel stipend be included if I qualify for the Pro Tour or World Championship through the Arena Championship?**


The Arena Championship has a $200,000 prize pool for 32 players, but not a specific amount set aside for travel.


**If I am under 18, can I play for just the Pro Tour invite during Qualifier Weekends?**


Players must be 18 years or older to play in all events in the new *MTG Arena* Premier Play system.


**Will the event timing for the new Qualifier Weekend remain the same?**


They will continue to take place monthly.


**Why do I need to check in during a two-hour window to participate in the Qualifier Weekend?**


These events involve Best-of-Three matches that can take a considerable amount of time. The limited join window ensures that players who join the event have enough time to finish their matches.


**Will the Qualifier Play-In event offer re-entries?**


Yes. If you have enough Play-In Points for multiple entries, you can join with them. You can also use gold and/or gems to enter as many times as you would like.


**What will the event timing be for the Qualifier Play-In event?**


The Best-of-One event will happen on Saturday the week prior to the Qualifier Weekend, beginning at 6 a.m. PT. It will close to new entries at 6 a.m. PT on Sunday, and players already in the event will have until 8 a.m. PT on Sunday to begin matches.


The Best-of-Three event will happen on the Friday prior to the Qualifier Weekend, beginning at 6 a.m. PT. It will close to new entries at 3 a.m. PT on Saturday, and players already in the event will have until 6 a.m. PT on Saturday to begin matches..


**Are there plans to run Qualifier Play-In events or Qualifier Weekends during event windows that are friendlier to international time zones?**


Play-In events will be up for 24 hours, so there should be enough time to join regardless of your time zone.


Since Qualifier Weekends have fewer players, unfortunately they must be concentrated. We've tried to choose times that are consistent and accessible for as many players as possible.


**Do Play-In Points expire?**


There is no plan for the Play-In Points to expire. Should this event series end in the future, time will be given for players to use any remaining points, and/or they will be converted into a new replacement system.


**If I earn enough Play-In Points, can I enter the Qualifier Play-In event multiple times?**


Yes!


**Can I use multiple accounts to earn multiple qualifications for the Play-In event or Qualifier Weekend?**


No. Each person can only play in a given Qualifier Weekend once on a single account. Violations of this policy are subject to players being disqualified.


**How does eligibility work?**


All players agree to the terms and conditions when they play, and that includes all eligibility requirements, including regional requirements. Wizards will verify player eligibility prior to moving winners on to the next round.
