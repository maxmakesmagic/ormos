Family Means Business—and Festivals!
====================================


Get ready to fete the five crime families of *Streets of New Capenna*! The [Rise of the Five Families Festival](https://magic.wizards.com/mtga-snc-rise-of-the-families) explores each family's particular way of doing business and exposes how they ascended to the ritzy heights of New Capenna's upper crust.


What's in it for you? Here's the deal: you can score golden age showcase card styles that'll prove you're a big shot and not some chump with a lot of chin music.


Each event's format is Alchemy Singleton with Best-of-One matches, but with a unique emblem twist inspired by each family!


The first two events feature the Maestros and the Obscura back to back.


**Rise of the Maestros: May 12–15**


* Emblem: "Once during each of your turns, you may cast an instant or sorcery spell from your graveyard by sacrificing a creature in addition to paying its other costs. If a spell cast this way would be put into your graveyard, exile it instead."
