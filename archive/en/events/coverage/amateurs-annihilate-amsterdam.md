Amateurs Annihilate Amsterdam!
==============================











![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gpams07/fin.jpg)After an epic weekend of Two Headed Giant play at Grand Prix Amsterdam, where we celebrated the 10th anniversary of the Grand Prix circuit, just two men stand proud as the latest additions to an elite club of Grand Prix winners.


'100 Cent' - Michael Havlik and Richard Hornansky came from Eastern Europe as relative unknowns, but on their road to victory they took down some of the best in the game. Never could this be truer than the finals themselves, where they faced Gabriel Nassif and Amiel Tennenbaum, who had proven virtually unstoppable throughout the weekend - unstoppable that is until they faced the cheery pair who seemed to have every answer at just the right time.

With Pro Tour San Diego featuring the Two Headed Giant format, Amsterdam has been an exciting testing ground. Going forward, it will be great to see what happens as players become more familiar with the intricacies of 2HG draft.


For now though, congratulations to Michael Havlik and Richard Hornansky from everyone at **magicthegathering.com**
