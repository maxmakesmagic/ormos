The 2nd Annual Kentucky Open has ended! Adam Yang and Kyle Eden split the cash in the finals. One hundred and twenty four players showed up for the event this weekend. Competition from Grand Prix: Detroit and Gen Con sandwiched this event. Some players from the area were unable to attend the competition because of money issues for the events.


The seven rounds of swiss were handled well by Brennan Moody and his staff at Bluegrassmagic.com A big thank you goes out to Daryl Janisch, Mark Shafer, and Jason Dooley who all judged the main event. Kevin Gray was the side event judge.


Dealers in attendance were event sponser, Books and Music Exchange, The Lotus Guardian, and Trey Van Cleave, who sponsored an unsanctioned Type 1 tournament for a Mox. Wizards of the Coast was also generous enough to supply boxes of Scourge and Italian Legends for Prize support as well.


Another thank you goes out to the local webmasters in the Kentucky Internet community. Dave Emerson and his fine work at [www.kymagic.com](http://www.kymagic.com), Kevin Gray and his site, [www.bluegrassmagic.com/local](/en/articles/archive/event-coverage/local-talent-contention-2015-09-02) and the owners and operators of [www.thegamellc.net](http://www.thegamellc.net), and finally the official tournament website of Kentucky Magic, [www.bluegrassmagic.com](http://www.bluegrassmagic.com).


Look out for information of the 3rd annual Kentucky Open, which is to be held next year!
