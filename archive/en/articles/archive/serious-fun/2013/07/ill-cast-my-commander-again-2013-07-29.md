Bruce's games invariably involve a kitchen table, several opponents, crazy plays, and many laughs. Bruce believes that if anyone at your table isn't having fun playing Magic, then you are doing it wrong. 





San Diego Comic-Con and PAX Australia both wrapped up earlier this month. Wizards of the Coast revealed a card from the ***Magic: The Gathering** Commander 2013* edition at each location within hours of each other. The cards introduced a mechanic that is designed to take advantage of commanders being recast for ever-increasing mana costs. For those of you who missed it, here are Jeleva, Nephalia's Scourge and Prossh, Skyraider of Kher.
