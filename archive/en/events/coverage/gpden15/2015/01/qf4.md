"Have you ever Top 8ed before?"


"No. You?"



 This was how Edward Nguyen and Andrew Brown started their banter as they sat down in the quarters. In Grand Prix Denver's super-stacked Top 8, this is admittedly the most amateur match-up, but both of these combatants are seasoned *Magic*ians.



"Are you going to Omaha next weekend?"


"I am now."


They both laughed.


The matchup was going to be tough for Brown. His Blue-Black Control deck was an underdog from the get-go. Though it was well-positioned against all the midrange-y decks throughout the weekend. Aggressive strategies could kick the legs out from under it. There were a couple key cards Brown would need in his opening hand to take down the match . . . 



**The Games**




 . . . or a couple mulligans from his opponent followed by a first-turn [Thoughtseize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtseize) from Andrew Brown.




 Edward Nguyen was playing from behind the whole game. His mulliganing plus the discard spell severely hurt his ability to make proactive plays. He didn't have enough cards to overwhelm Brown's defenses. [Thoughtseize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtseize), Hero's Downfall, and [Negate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Negate) stopped any real offense from Nguyen, at all.
