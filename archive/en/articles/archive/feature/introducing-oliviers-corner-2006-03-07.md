Welcome to this new page, dedicated to you, the **Magic** community in Europe!


Why is it called Olivier’s corner? It’s probably not necessary to introduce Olivier Ruel, a well known Pro Player you might have bumped into as he seems to be everywhere **Magic** is being played.


On this page, Olivier will share with you impressions, thoughts, strategies from a variety of players – it’ll be the opportunity for you to discover the player’s community from another angle.


You’ll hear about known and also less known players – how they prepare for an event, their travel stories, their tips and much more.


As a start, we’ll guide you onto the road to Pro Tour Prague, to follow several players who will attend the event, with or without a qualification in their pocket. Look forward to similar pages for GPs (Torino as an example) or Worlds in Paris!


Interested in a certain topic? Want to read about a player? Comments, reactions or suggestions? Just send us an email at magiceurope@hasbro.be


More to come soon!


And a special thanks to Raphaël Lévy, who very unintentionally contributed to the creation of this web page (*‘à l’insu de son plein gré’*, as we say in French).
