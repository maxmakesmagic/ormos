The Daily *Magic* Update is a roundup of everything *Magic* you should know on October 18, 2017. Today's Update is brought to you by father-son bonding.


Today's Must
============


1. [My Father Interviews Me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAUH85q4Otk) | Tolarian Community College | The Professor

I have to agree with the commenter who said that basically every TCC video featuring The Professor's father is the best. This one is funny, it's entertaining, it's sweet (it gets really touching around the 21-minute mark), and it's a great way to celebrate Prof getting to 275,000 subscribers.


Congratulations, Prof!

After That, Read, Watch, or Listen to These
===========================================


1. Breaking down the final game of the World Championship | ChannelFireball

In the wake of a tense, difficult, hard-fought final game of the World Championship, there were a ton of people talking about what plays could have made the difference. Now, two pros—Luis Scott-Vargas and Ondřej Stráský—break down that final game in a pair of articles. Check out their analyses [here (Stráský](https://www.channelfireball.com/articles/worlds-finals-game-breakdown/)) and [here (LSV)](https://www.channelfireball.com/articles/luis-scott-vargas/lsvs-play-world-championship-finals/).


1. [Commander VS: Old Borders](http://www.starcitygames.com/article/36026_Commander-VS-Old-Borders.html) | StarCityGames.com | Justin Parnell and Stephen Green

Commander VS gets in its way-back machine to play *only* with cards printed prior to *Eighth Edition* (the Modern line in the sand).


1. [Finding Azcanta](https://www.channelfireball.com/articles/finding-azcanta/) | ChannelFireball | Josh Utter-Leyton

The Worlds Top 4 competitor and almost Hall of Famer gives a bulleted master class in [Vizier of Many Faces](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vizier+of+Many+Faces) plus [The Scarab God](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=The+Scarab+God). There's a whole article after that on Blue-Black Control, but be sure to stick around for the Props and Slops section at the end.


1. [Drafting *Ixalan* with Pros #2](http://www.hareruyamtg.com/article/en/category/detail/195) | Hareruya English | Jeremy Dezani

Dezani grabs four pros—Thiago Saporito, Marc Tobiasch, Grzegorz Kowalski, and Kenta Harane—and has them all chime in on some *Ixalan* picks. It's always most interesting when they disagree, naturally.


1. [How to Come Back from a Misplay (Modern Week)](http://www.constructedcriticism.com/podcasts/constructed-criticism-205-how-to-come-back-from-a-misplay-modern-week/) | Constructed Criticism | Spencer Howland and Michael Hinderaker

You screwed up. It happens. We all do it. Maybe you didn't cast that [Mulldrifter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mulldrifter) when you hit five mana—well, bad example. There's no recovering from that. Pretend you commit some lesser offense. Now what? How do you climb out of that hole? Howland and Hinderaker discuss. Though, might I suggest casting a [Mulldrifter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mulldrifter) as a way to catch back up?


What to Watch Today
===================


1. *Magic: The Gathering Arena* Community Deckbuilding Challenge | [twitch.tv/magic](https://go.twitch.tv/magic) | 1 p.m. PT/4 p.m. ET/8 p.m. UTC

The results of our community decks face off! Kenji "Numotthenummy" Egashira and Jeffrey "TrumpSC" Shih throw down in some hot, hot *MTG Arena* action while making fun of one another. Probably.


1. Magic Mics | [twitch.tv/magicmics](https://go.twitch.tv/magicmics) | Evan Erwin, Reuben Bresler, and Erin Campbell | 8 p.m. PT/11 p.m. ET/3 a.m. UTC

Get your fill of talking heads covering *Magic* news. I expect about 90 minutes on the [holiday promo](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/inkwell/gift-necromagi-2017-10-17) and 5 minutes on the [B&R non-announcement announcement](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/news/october-17-2017-banned-and-restricted-announcement-2017-10-17). Or maybe vice versa.

The *Ixalan* story concludes with "[The Race, Part 2](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/magic-story/race-part-2-2017-10-18)." We'll have some other Vorthosy goodness over the next couple weeks, but the main line of *Magic* Story itself will be on hiatus until January. We'll have a few special surprises between now and then, and we're working on some cool things for *Magic* Story as a whole, but Jace and Vraska needed a break. Though, I'm sure they'll continue to have adventures on Tumblr for quite a while.


1. [Vraska Concept Art](http://mtg-realm.tumblr.com/post/166500918506/magic-the-gathering-little-know-fact-series) | MTG Realm

Speaking of Tumblr's love of Vraska, MTG Realm showed off the Vraska concept art by Tyler Jacobson that's not terribly far off from where the final card landed.


Deck of the Day
===============


1. [Standard Red-White Approach](https://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/2017natus/us-nationals-9-16-decklists-2017-10-15)

Possibly the most interesting deck to come out of US Nationals was Red-White Approach, a redder take on the White-Blue Approach archetype that has become so popular. Adam Bialkowski just missed the Top 8 with this list, finishing 10th. The key to the deck and the main reason for red? This card:


[![](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Sunbird%27s+Invocation)](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sunbird%27s+Invocation)
This red enchantment looks a bit random and wacky, but it can be anything but. First of all, it turns nearly every one of your spells into two spells, assuming you hit. Second, it can actually be an instant-win combo with [Approach of the Second Sun](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Approach+of+the+Second+Sun).


It works like this: With [Sunbird's Invocation](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sunbird%27s+Invocation) in play, you cast [Approach of the Second Sun](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Approach+of+the+Second+Sun) and put Invocation's trigger on the stack. The key at this point is that you have not yet fulfilled the stipulation of having cast [Approach of the Second Sun](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Approach+of+the+Second+Sun) from your hand once already. Invocation resolves and, if you find another [Approach of the Second Sun](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Approach+of+the+Second+Sun) in the top seven cards, you can cast it. Since you've already cast [Approach of the Second Sun](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Approach+of+the+Second+Sun) (the one still on the stack!), you win if it resolves!


Of course, it's not always that easy, and sometimes you do need to dig for the second Approach. Without blue cards, the deck relies on [Chandra, Torch of Defiance](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chandra%2C+Torch+of+Defiance) and [Vance's Blasting Cannons](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vance%27s+Blasting+Cannons).


The [Huatli, Warrior Poet](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Huatli%2C+Warrior+Poet) looks a bit more like a "fun-of" than anything, though more planeswalkers are always welcome in a deck like this.
