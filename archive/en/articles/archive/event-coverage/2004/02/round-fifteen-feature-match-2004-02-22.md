In the true spirit of Mulligan Week, Olivier decides to mulligan his initial hand.

The first creatures came on Jose's side, a [Cathodion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cathodion) and an Arcbound Hybrid.  
 Olivier played a [Leonin Abunas](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leonin+Abunas) but Jose still sent the hybrid into it on his next turn, in order to turn the [Cathodion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cathodion) to a 5/5. A [Wand of the Elements](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wand+of+the+Elements) from Jose is removed with [Altar's Light](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Altar%27s+Light), but not before making a 2/2 flyer. [Serum Tank](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Serum+Tank) and Talisman joined the flyer's side of the table.

[Loxodon Mystic](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Loxodon+Mystic) helped the Abunas in killing the super [Cathodion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cathodion), and a [Deconstruct](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deconstruct) took care of the tank, but Jose just played a [Rust Elemental](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rust+Elemental), and a turn later [Shatter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shatter)ed a defending creature and attacked with all his team. A [Fireball](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fireball) completed the job.

Olivier Ruel 0 - Jose Barbero 1

### Game 2

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gpmad04/r15fm1_2.jpg)Once again the initial action come from Jose, in the form of Talisman, [Lumengrid Sentinel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lumengrid+Sentinel) and [Rust Elemental](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rust+Elemental). Olivier failed the fourth land drop and his first play was a [Solemn Simulacrum](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Solemn+Simulacrum) on the next turn. He then [Deconstruct](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deconstruct)ed Jose's [Whispersilk Cloak](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Whispersilk+Cloak) and used an [Altar's Light](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Altar%27s+Light) on a [Seat of the Synod](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seat+of+the+Synod), in order to keep the Elemental from attacking.

A [Wand of the Elements](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wand+of+the+Elements) created a pair of tokens before being turned to rust by the Elemental. Ruel's [Loxodon Mystic](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Loxodon+Mystic) wasn't enough to control all Jose's creatures and when the Frenchman tried a suicidal attack, a [Shatter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shatter) took care of the Simulacrum and with it the match.

Final result: Olivier Ruel 0 - Jose Barbero 2
