DAY 1 COVERAGE



Good morning, good morning from Phoenix! *Ixalan*—with all its dinosaurs, pirates, and merfolk—has invaded the convention center and we’re all set for the last Grand Prix weekend before Pro Tour *Ixalan*!


This will be the first time in quite a while that a Pro Tour is this far after a set’s release, so this pre-Tour Grand Prix will be a lot smoother sailing for many seafaring folk. Unlike the usual mad dash to learn all the cards and figure out what’s good beforehand, players here had a good while to navigate the ins and outs of the straits and narrows of *Ixalan*. Though that might sound like a good thing—as players will be more confident—the competition will be stiffer. *Every*one knows what you know.


Speaking of stiff competition, eleven of the Top 25 players in the world are here this weekend, all prepped for next week’s Pro Tour in Albuquerque. Top-ranked Paulo Vitor Damo da Rosa, and second-ranked Reid Duke are the biggest names, but there are Pro Tour winners, at least four former Players of the Year, and the current World Champion! (Although sixth-ranked William Jensen will be in the commentary booth, rather than slinging spells.)


What nuggets of wisdom will these pros bring to the weekend? Is aggro really as good as people say in Draft? Do you really have to play those splash lands if you have enough treasure in Sealed? Is Charging Monstrosaur *really* the biggest baddest beast around?


All this and more at Grand Prix Phoenix! Watch all the action at [twitch.tv/magic](https://go.twitch.tv/magic), and follow along with [#GPPHX](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23gpliverpool) on social media.
