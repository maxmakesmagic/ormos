Hey everyone! As we wind down the remaining few weekends of Grand Prix before a relatively quiet month of April, I wanted to spotlight a new feature from Twitch that you'll be seeing regularly used on [twitch.tv/magic](http://twitch.tv/magic) in short order.


Collections
===========


A few weeks ago, [Twitch rolled out their collections feature](https://blog.twitch.tv/introducing-collections-all-your-best-videos-in-one-spot-51b4e2ffdfee#.djlxatixo), allowing streamers everywhere to organize their content in a way that makes the best stuff a lot easier to find for viewers. I'm stoked for this one, as it's something that we will be making use of on twitch.tv/magic on a regular basis.


Specifically, this will allow us to organize all our Twitch content into event-specific collections. Looking to watch all matches from a Grand Prix? What about just one of them? Collections will let you find whatever you're looking for, divided by show.


For Grand Prix, we'll be creating a collection for each event to house our feature match VODs (Videos on Demand). Pro Tours will have two collections dedicated to them. One will house all our round-by-round match content. The other will contain all our between-round features, such as our Open House segments with Brian David-Marshall as well as our Deck Techs.


All collections on twitch.tv/magic can be [found here](https://www.twitch.tv/magic/collections), where you can see all of 2017's premier events that received live video coverage. This includes every Grand Prix we've streamed from; [Pro Tour *Aether Revolt*](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/ptaer); and a collection of all episodes from *Enter the Battlefield: The Series*, the ongoing *Magic* documentary from Nathan Holt and Shawn Kornhauser. Head on over and start viewing to your heart's content!


Oh, and speaking of 2017's premier events . . .


Grand Prix New Jersey
=====================


[Grand Prix Barcelona](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/gpbar17) and [New Jersey](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/gpnj17)—which took place nearly two weeks ago—marked the first of a few weekends in 2017 of live video coverage provided from two tournaments. Barcelona was shown in its entirety, and New Jersey kicked off as soon as Europe's Grand Prix finished up each day. While New Jersey was offline, their production team would record feature matches, which were then used as playback in between live feature matches, allowing the team to bring fresh content to viewers even while they were waiting for a new round to start.


The plan made a ton of sense, at least until you factored in how long Barcelona was actually running as a tournament and the loss of an hour due to North America's daylight savings condensing the time difference between the two shows by an hour. This left New Jersey with a number of rounds that went unfeatured, and Sunday in particular was particularly condensed with a short Round 15 and Top 8 matches only.


The folks at ChannelFireball—the production team that managed Grand Prix New Jersey video coverage—didn't want all that work to go to waste, and neither do we. After all, who are we to deny the world of more matches commentated by Marshall Sutcliffe and Pro Tour Hall of Famer William Jensen?


That's why we're excited to announce that more recorded matches from Grand Prix New Jersey are now available for your viewing pleasure! This includes many rounds that were recorded and commentated on by the New Jersey team, including some that never made it into the live broadcast!


And in the meantime, be sure to mark your calendars for live video coverage of [Grand Prix Orlando](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/premierplay/grandprix/fact-sheet-gporl17) on twitch.tv/magic, which starts on Saturday at 10 a.m. local time (ET). That's 7 a.m. PT, and 2 p.m. UTC!
