Play the Gladiator Format August 11–14
======================================


Gladiator is a popular, community-created format that we're excited to share in *MTG Arena* for a special Community Spotlight event August 11–14. There's no entry cost, and you can earn individual card rewards!


To help you try out the format and give you a jumping-off point for building your own Gladiator decks, we'll provide decklists created by Gladiator community members in a Community Spotlight: Gladiator deck folder you'll find at the bottom of your decks collection. From there you can:


* Submit a deck directly from this folder to the event if you have collected all the cards in the decklist.
* Copy the community deck to your collection of decks and craft the remaining cards to complete the deck.
* Copy the community deck to your collection and modify the deck as you see fit.

You can learn more in the [Community Spotlight: Gladiator event article](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/magic-digital/community-spotlight-gladiator-august-2022), and then drop in on [the Weekly MTG Twitch stream](https://www.twitch.tv/magic) on Thursday, August 11, at 2:30 p.m. PT for a discussion of the format between host Blake Rasmussen and Ben Wheeler, one of the major contributors to the Gladiator format.


Chalice of the Void Banned in Historic Brawl
============================================


In a recent game update, we added Chalice of the Void to the [Historic Brawl banned list](https://magic.wizards.com/en/banned-restricted-list#Brawl-banned).


![Chalice of the Void](https://media.wizards.com/2022/images/daily/chalice_of_the_void.png)


Like similarly banned cards, such Sorcerous Spyglass and Drannith Magistrate, Chalice of a Void can quickly lock players from casting their commander. We'll continue to monitor for similar effects and cards for Brawl in the future.


Alchemy Rebalancing for August 11
=================================


The game update for this Thursday brings adjustments to cards in Alchemy and Historic formats, plus rebalance support for *Alchemy Horizons: Baldur's Gate* Draft. You can get all the details in [the latest rebalancing article](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/magic-digital/alchemy-rebalancing-august-11-2022-08-10)!
