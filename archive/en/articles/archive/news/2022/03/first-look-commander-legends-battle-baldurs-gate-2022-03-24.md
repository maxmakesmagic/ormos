 Stybs has played Magic the world over, writing and drafting as part of the event coverage team and slinging Commander everywhere his decks will fit. 






[*Commander Legends: Battle for Baldur's Gate*](https://magic.wizards.com/en/products/commander-legends-battle-baldurs-gate) takes the flair and flavor of *Dungeons & Dragons: Adventures in the Forgotten Realms* and picks up where 2020's *Commander Legends* release left off: a fun-first set packed with legendary creatures, epic additions to your favorite Commander decks, and the return of Commander Draft to bring the battle to your own party of friends.

It matches the social gameplay fun of *Magic: The Gathering* Commander with the flavor and excitement of being a powerful, high-level character in *Dungeons & Dragons*. Whether you're a *Dungeons & Dragons* fan ready to explore a new multiplayer game or a *Magic* multiplayer master ready to draft and play with friends again, *Commander Legends: Battle for Baldur's Gate* combines these experiences into unique gameplay for every fan.
