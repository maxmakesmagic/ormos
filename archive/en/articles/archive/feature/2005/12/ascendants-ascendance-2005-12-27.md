***Magicthegathering.com** is running "best of" content during the holidays, and will return with new content January 4, 2006. This Magic Arcana originally ran June 2, 2005.*



![Kuon, Ogre Ascendant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Kuon%2C+Ogre+Ascendant)

The *Saviors of Kamigawa*  flippers, the [ascendants](http://gatherer.wizards.com/default.asp?first=1&last=100&term=ascendant&Field_Name=on&Field_Rules=on&Field_Type=on&setfilter=SaviorsofKamigawa&colorfilter=All&output=summary&sort=name&x=51&y=17), begin their lives as mortal creatures like the other Kamigawa block flippers. But these enlightened beings don't just gain in skill like some self-important [Nezumi Graverobber](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Nezumi%2BGraverobber), and they don't betray their mortal allies like some spirit-loving [Faithful Squire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Faithful%2BSquire).


These guys *ascend*. Once they flip, they aren't even creatures anymore -- they become powerful, legendary enchantments that represent the focused essence of their mortal forms, reminiscent of *Judgment's*  [incarnations](http://gatherer.wizards.com/default.asp?first=1&last=100&term=incarnation&Field_Name=on&Field_Rules=on&Field_Type=on&setfilter=Judgment&colorfilter=All&output=summary&sort=name).


The art of the *Saviors* ascendants portrays this transformation abstractly. Check out how, in each case, the artists show mystical tattoos and markings on the ascendants' mortal forms, and incorporate those same designs in their ascendant form.
