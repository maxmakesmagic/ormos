Chris had drafted a strong RW (splash B) deck that was hoping to see [Astral Slide](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Astral+Slide) or [Exalted Angel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Exalted+Angel) early and then abuse the many cycling cards that were in the deck, while Jarron had a very quick RG goblins deck using the black for removal and [Anurid Murkdiver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Anurid+Murkdiver).

### Game 1

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gpmel02/a860.jpg)Jarron won the coin toss and decided to play, while Chris took a double mulligan based on two hands of a lone [Mountain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mountain).

A quick [Spitfire Handler](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spitfire+Handler) and [Nosy Goblin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nosy+Goblin) followed by [Lay Waste](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lay+Waste) for Chris' only [Plains](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plains) were all over a lone [Thoughtbound Primoc](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtbound+Primoc). The Handler ended up trading with the Primoc and a [Gluttonous Zombie](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gluttonous+Zombie) was no match for the swamp-walking [Anurid Murkdiver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Anurid+Murkdiver). When a second swamp-walker turned up and Chris only had one [Pinpoint Avalanche](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pinpoint+Avalanche) in hand, he scooped it up.

Jarron wins game 1.

The sideboard was a story of opposites, with Chris taking out all of his non-cycling black cards ([Gluttonous Zombie](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gluttonous+Zombie), [Haunted Cadaver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Haunted+Cadaver), [Cruel Revival](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cruel+Revival) and three swamps) for two [Crown of Awe](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crown+of+Awe), [Foothill Guide](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Foothill+Guide), two [Plains](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plains) and a [Mountain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mountain). Jarron on the other hand brought in a third [Anurid Murkdiver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Anurid+Murkdiver) for [Chain of Smog](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chain+of+Smog). The chain had been useful in game 1, catching [Astral Slide](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Astral+Slide) and [Pacifism](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pacifism). He was looking to placing the Crown on the [Exalted One](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Exalted+One)'s head!

### Game 2

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gpmel02/a861.jpg)Chris chose to play and cycled [Disciple of Malice](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Disciple+of+Malice) into a [Plains](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plains) to make his hand of white cards and [Mountain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mountain)s look much safer, meanwhile Jarron made a [Sparksmith](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sparksmith). The [Plains](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plains) was good for an [Astral Slide](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Astral+Slide) and [Foothill Guide](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Foothill+Guide) before [Lay Waste](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lay+Waste) was used again to strip the white mana.

[Sparksmith](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sparksmith) fell under a [Pinpoint Avalanche](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pinpoint+Avalanche), leaving [Foothill Guide](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Foothill+Guide) to hold the fort, and he was the goods for several turns until Jarron played his [Lightning Rift](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Rift). An mind numbing play with Jarron cycling a card at the end of Chris' turn resulted in the [Foothill Guide](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Foothill+Guide) being shocked by the [Lightning Rift](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Rift) before the Slide could save it.

A top decked [Cabal Slaver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cabal+Slaver) from Jarron followed by an attack phase emptied Chris' hand of his salvation - [Exalted Angel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Exalted+Angel) - which he felt was the end, so he scooped it up.

**Final Result:** Jarron wins 2-0, but it was still good for Team Heaven, getting a player through to the Semifinals.
