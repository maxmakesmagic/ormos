Greetings, fellow Johnnies, and welcome to a results column that hopefully has been anticipated by many! I'll spare you all the folksy introductions today, and instead cut right to the juicy parts, since this article will be long enough as it is.

This is the first of two results columns for the almighty Planeswalker Contest, which I kicked off at the end of last December. I've been plugging it as much as possible since, hoping to keep you all interested while I filtered out the results, and today is finally the day we see them! (If you are new to this Contest, go ahead and click [this link](/en/articles/archive/lab/hail-and-email-2009-12-10) to read the original challenge.)

Unlike the Birthday Contest (my first contest, which was held last summer), in which I had the painful task of selecting the overall best decks out of 238 submissions, I had it far easier this time. Instead of 'grading' decks against each other, I picked the best decks for each respective planeswalker that was in existence at the time. (This restriction counted out [Jace, the Mind Sculptor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace%2C+the+Mind+Sculptor).)

If you recall, this Contest began with a super-flavorful email about [Chandra Ablaze](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chandra+Ablaze), and if you all don't mind me starting the results, I'd like to begin with another!

Josh Jelin writes, "Have you seen Chandra's hair? What is that? Is she in a band? I think this deck conclusively answers the question: yes." Here's his rocking deck list.

Josh gushes, "Chandra plays at the [Krark-Clan Ironworks](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Krark-Clan+Ironworks). She ends all of her concerts by either smashing all of her instruments ([Shrapnel Blast](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shrapnel+Blast)) and combining it with a three-part flaming guitar solo ([Lava Axe](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lava+Axe)) or turning it up to 11 for some heavy metal ([Darksteel Colossus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Darksteel+Colossus)). [Song of Blood](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Song+of+Blood) helps fill the graveyard for Chandra's encore performance. And of course, what hair metal concert would be complete without the final countdown ([Final Fortune](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Final+Fortune))?"

Obviously, the deck riffs on artifact and red instants and sorceries to create a killer set list. Use your early Myr as fodder for the [Krark-Clan Ironworks](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Krark-Clan%2BIronworks) or [Shrapnel Blast](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shrapnel+Blast), or just play defense with them and [Angelsong](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Angelsong). Either ramp into an "Iron Man" (the [Darksteel Colossus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Darksteel%2BColossus)) or unleash [Chandra Ablaze](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Chandra%2BAblaze)'s Ultimate, letting loose some [Lava Axe](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lava+Axe)s along the way.

Not all the entries were humorous in nature, though. QuickRime put a lot of time and effort into his red and black, super-flavorful [Sorin Markov](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sorin+Markov) deck, which really hit all my criteria for a Vorthos-happy planeswalker deck. In parts of an email that is, sadly, a bit too long to quote in its entirety, QuickRime analyzed the flavor texts of [Day of Judgment](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Day+of+Judgment) and [Feast of Blood](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Feast+of+Blood) to debate Sorin's exact personality. Take it away, QuickRime:

![Sorin Markov](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Sorin+Markov)
> 
> [Sorin Markov](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sorin+Markov): Let's start with the picture. [Sorin Markov](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Sorin%2BMarkov) looks down out of his portrait with distinct scorn. He radiates arrogance and cruelty, but without extravagance. There are no glowing auras, no corpses scattered at his feet, no spirits crying out in anguish. Sorin is subtler than that. Looking at his abilities, which I will refer to as [Sorin Markov](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Sorin%2BMarkov)'s First, Second, and Third, these conclusions are supported by the card's mechanics.
> 
> 
> [Sorin Markov](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Sorin%2BMarkov)'s First mimics [Vicious Hunger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vicious+Hunger). It would seem that any cards of the [Drain Life](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Drain+Life) school are in flavor. [Sorin Markov](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Sorin%2BMarkov)'s Second is much more interesting. It does not exactly halve an opponents life; instead it sets it at 10. This is not a blind attack but a calculated alteration, potentially even restoring life. Obvious cards that combine well with this ability are the *Zendikar* vampires, but I am going to stay away from those, for reasons explained below. Instead, I have chosen something far more devious: [Hidetsugu's Second Rite](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hidetsugu%27s+Second+Rite). This card's role is also explained in greater detail below. [Sorin Markov](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Sorin%2BMarkov)'s Third is, amazingly, even more interesting than his second. [Mindslaver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Mindslaver) represents the ultimate in dark control magic. This proves [Sorin Markov](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Sorin%2BMarkov)'s manipulative nature, and cards like [Blackmail](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blackmail) seem to fit in well.

![](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Crumbling+Necropolis)

















  
QuickRime also explained his all-spell deck list flavorfully:

* [Barter in Blood](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Barter+in+Blood), [Innocent Blood](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Innocent+Blood): Apart from being powerful in a no-creature deck, these cards fit in well with [Sorin Markov](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Sorin%2BMarkov)'s uncaring personality.
* [Blackmail](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blackmail), [Duress](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress): These cards represent [Sorin Markov](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Sorin%2BMarkov)'s manipulative nature, illustrated by his final ability. They also give the deck a quick and easy way to deal with difficult non-creature spells.
* [Chromatic Star](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chromatic+Star): Planeswalkers should never leave home without one.
* [Consume Spirit](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Consume+Spirit), [Vicious Hunger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vicious+Hunger), [Wretched Banquet](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wretched+Banquet): These cards all fit in with the hunger theme introduced on [Feast of Blood](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Feast+of+Blood). [Vicious Hunger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vicious+Hunger) mirrors [Sorin Markov](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Sorin%2BMarkov)'s First beautifully, while [Consume Spirit](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Consume+Spirit) for 10 works as a fine finisher with Sorin's Second. [Wretched Banquet](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wretched+Banquet) is a great [Innocent Blood](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Innocent+Blood)-like kill spell.
* [Damnation](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Damnation): Obviously a very powerful spell, this card is right down the more epic side of [Sorin Markov](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Sorin%2BMarkov)'s character street.
* [Dark Ritual](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dark+Ritual): A staple for black decks, this gets [Sorin Markov](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Sorin%2BMarkov) out early. I'm sure [Sorin Markov](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Sorin%2BMarkov) has no moral qualms about this kind of dark magic.
![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/ftl/ftl78_tutor.jpg)  
* [Demonic Tutor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Demonic+Tutor), [Diabolic Tutor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Diabolic+Tutor): It seems likely to me that [Sorin Markov](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Sorin%2BMarkov) had some kind of instruction from powerful dark entities. These cards find the necessary pieces in this pseudo-singleton deck.
* [Hidetsugu's Second Rite](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hidetsugu%27s+Second+Rite): Yes, it is red and references a setting-specific individual. However, this card combos extremely well with [Sorin Markov](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Sorin%2BMarkov)'s Second and is cruel enough to fit in such a dark deck. It is also a rather intriguing coincidence that the [Hidetsugu's Second Rite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Hidetsugu%2527s%2BSecond%2BRite) works so well with the planeswalker's second ability. Its not too farfetched to suggest that [Sorin Markov](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Sorin%2BMarkov) learned this sadistic ritual during his planar travels.
* [Infernal Contract](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Infernal+Contract), [Sign in Blood](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sign+in+Blood): Dark mages like [Sorin Markov](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Sorin%2BMarkov) are always looking for more power. These cards give us just that, fueling both the control and combo aspects of this deck. The price is immaterial.
* [Lethal Vapors](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lethal+Vapors): Another way to keep down the creatures, this is a suitably devious way to win with [Sorin Markov](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Sorin%2BMarkov)'s Third. It's simple to use; just compel your opponent to trigger the self-destruct ability a few dozen times. They pay the price for each, and the sacrificing sits on the stack. Then, take lots of turns and win through another of the combinations.
* [Null Profusion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Null+Profusion): This is a ridiculously powerful card engine in a mostly low-mana deck that also fits [Sorin Markov](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Sorin%2BMarkov)'s character well. It's all about cheating life, the universe, and everything.
![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/ftl/ftl78_painsReward.jpg)  
* [Pain's Reward](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pain%27s+Reward): On its own, this is a flavor fitting card draw spell like [Sign in Blood](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sign+in+Blood). With [Quicken](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Quicken) and [Sorin Markov](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Sorin%2BMarkov)'s Third, it becomes the most ridiculous yet clever and sadistically beautiful way of winning in the deck.
* [Planeswalker's Scorn](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Planeswalker%27s+Scorn): The name of this card alone assures its inclusion. This also offers reusable creature removal.
* [Quicken](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Quicken): See [Pain's Reward](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pain%27s+Reward). Sometimes you have to add a bit of blue to be more black. This can also be potentially useful in combination with an anti-creature or discard sorcery, or even with the Second Rite.
* [Temporal Extortion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Temporal+Extortion): This seems just like the sort of spell [Sorin Markov](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Sorin%2BMarkov) would cast. It either gives a notable advantage through an extra turn or mimics [Sorin Markov](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Sorin%2BMarkov)'s Second.
* [Crumbling Necropolis](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crumbling+Necropolis), [Sulfur Vent](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sulfur+Vent), [Vivid Marsh](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vivid+Marsh): These give you the colors you need to play Second Rite and [Quicken](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Quicken). [Sulfur Vent](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sulfur+Vent) can also help you get an early [Sorin Markov](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sorin+Markov) or [Null Profusion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Null+Profusion)."

Nice! There were a lot of attempted [Hidetsugu's Second Rite](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hidetsugu%27s+Second+Rite)s in [Sorin Markov](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Sorin%2BMarkov) decks (which were easily the most popular), but I felt QuickRime did the least stretching to include it in this contest. Great work!

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/ftl/ftl78_elspeth.jpg)  
While [Sorin Markov](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Sorin%2BMarkov) generated the most decklists, Elspeth generated the least. Of these happy few, Gabriel Gutierrez's creation was easily the best.

![Elspeth, Knight-Errant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Elspeth%2C+Knight-Errant)
>  When [Elspeth, Knight-Errant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Elspeth%252C%2BKnight-Errant) found her planeswalker spark, she left her home and never turned back. And from the moment she walked into Bant, she never wanted to leave. She just loved the [Bant Panorama](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bant+Panorama)s. She trained to become a Knight, becoming a champion of Valeron, and under her guidance and her [Master Warcraft](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Master+Warcraft), [Akrasan Squire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Akrasan+Squire)s long to become [Sigiled Paladin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sigiled+Paladin)s, respecting the rules of battle the Bant have forged. She took a [Faithful Squire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Faithful+Squire) by the name of Aran, and took him to a corrupted place, a rhox monastery turned into a [Ghostly Prison](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ghostly+Prison). There, she learned of the breach in her world, a threat that suddenly turned real. With the help of the Angels ([Archangel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Archangel), [Battlegrace Angel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Battlegrace+Angel) and [Baneslayer Angel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Baneslayer+Angel)) and her army, led by the [Knight-Captain of Eos](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Knight-Captain+of+Eos), and full of [Fresh Volunteers](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fresh+Volunteers) and [Knight of the White Orchid](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Knight%2Bof%2Bthe%2BWhite%2BOrchid), took in demons and shadows into a battle. Those foul creatures encountered Bant's army, a [Wall of Swords](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wall+of+Swords) and a [Wall of Shields](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wall+of+Shields), but nevertheless, those creatures took the upper hand in the battle. [Elspeth, Knight-Errant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Elspeth%252C%2BKnight-Errant), armed with the [Sword of the Paruns](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sword+of+the+Paruns) and the [Pariah's Shield](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pariah%27s+Shield), battled fiercely, but even with her skill she could not prevent Aran's fatal injury. The demons thought they had taken away the [Honor of the Pure](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Honor+of+the+Pure), but they did not count on [Elspeth, Knight-Errant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Elspeth%252C%2BKnight-Errant)'s planeswalker powers. She performed a [Resurrection](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Resurrection) spell on her fallen comrades, and [Exile](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Exile)d the demons away. The Bant laws forbidden her from resurrecting fallen comrades, and so she [Honor the Fallen](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Honor%2Bthe%2BFallen) in battle, and then set herself on her own [Path to Exile](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Path+to+Exile), while Bant counted the losses in [Silence](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Silence).

> The deck is very simple, it can follow a White Weenie Strategy, but can hold its own on an advanced game. [Master Warcraft](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Master+Warcraft) is the finishing spell, allowing your army to attack unblocked and finish the games. [Elspeth, Knight-Errant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Elspeth%252C%2BKnight-Errant)'s abilities help your army, and her ultimate ability makes them indestructible. I just went for a more straightforward approach in deckbuilding in order to tell [Elspeth, Knight-Errant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Elspeth%252C%2BKnight-Errant)'s story. Hope you like my creation!

**Flavorful Poetry:**

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/ftl/ftl78_poetryAjani.jpg)  
Two clever readers wrote some Vorthos-tinged poems to add to their decklist, and both were so exemplary amongst the rest of my emails that I had to include them. Here's Kelvin's poem about [Ajani Vengeant](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ajani+Vengeant):

>  Who killed my brother?
>  Grief and pain [Poison the Well](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Poison%2Bthe%2BWell) of his soul  
> [Vengeance](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vengeance), his only goal.  
>  His planeswalker spark burst into a [Pyroclasm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Pyroclasm)  
>  A [Punishing Fire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Punishing%2BFire) to burns down hovels and castles.  
>  Each step he makes sends a seismic shudder  
>  And his roar is Hell's thunder.  
>  So insidious has his fury become  
>  That he prays and prays to the demigods of revenge  
>  Longing for that [Divine Verdict](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Divine%2BVerdict), that [Day of Judgment](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Day%2Bof%2BJudgment).

> He took to forging his [Lava Axe](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Lava%2BAxe) and [Lavaball Trap](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Lavaball%2BTrap).

>  Yet despite his claws and [Double Cleave](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Double%2BCleave)  
>  He could not find reprieve.  
>  Revenge is a [Journey to Nowhere](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Journey%2Bto%2BNowhere), a lost cause  
>  Where he could never hope to [Redeem the Lost](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Redeem%2Bthe%2BLost%2B) .

Kelvin adds: "This deck is a reflection of [Ajani Vengeant](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ajani+Vengeant)'s mind: how his rage can be sweeping ([Pyroclasm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyroclasm)) or how his logic can have an element of chaos in it (imagine casting [Burning Inquiry](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Burning+Inquiry) in the hopes of casting [Runeflare Trap](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Runeflare+Trap) after, or pulling off a [Lavaball Trap](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lavaball+Trap) after casting a [Path to Exile](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Path+to+Exile) and/or having [Goblin Guide](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Guide) hit the opponent)."

Michael also mentioned that the deck's goal is to put forth an early game of recurring creatures, while eventually wreaking havoc with Nicol Bolas himself. Deliciously evil!

Two more decks and we're finished for this week. The following email was probably the best one I received for the whole contest. Mark Wischkaemper wrote me with the best father-son bonding story this side of *The Road* (er ... take that as you will). Mark and his father, both avid **Magic** players, discovered my contest and decided to challenge each other, with a unique twist: each picked the 'walker for the other. In a supreme example of family ties, they both picked [Ajani Goldmane](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ajani+Goldmane)!

Here's Mark's resulting life-gaining deck, Ajani's Pride.

As he's aged, he has created his own [Intervention Pact](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Intervention+Pact) to calm the fires in his heart. He prefers, now, the [Order of the Stars](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Order+of+the+Stars); the [Blessed Wind](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blessed+Wind) ruffling his mane or a few tender moments of [Silence](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Silence). He has built around himself walls — [Wall of Essence](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Wall%2Bof%2BEssence) and [Wall of Reverence](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Wall%2Bof%2BReverence) together. He travels lonely areas such as the [Kabira Crossroads](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kabira+Crossroads). He might enjoy a few moments with some cubs, even of races other than the Nacatl, such as the [Children of Korlis](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Children+of+Korlis).
>  When forced into battle, [Ajani Goldmane](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Ajani%2BGoldmane) would almost always prefer to convince his enemy of the values of [Pacifism](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pacifism), or attempt to turn his [Swords to Plowshares](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swords+to+Plowshares). If needed, he may summon a lowly [Goldenglow Moth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goldenglow+Moth), a noble [Knight of Meadowgrain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Knight+of+Meadowgrain), or the fearsome [Archon of Justice](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Archon+of+Justice). He may bring to his aid an [Auriok Champion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Auriok+Champion) or help usher the fate of a [Figure of Destiny](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Figure+of+Destiny). He might [Chastise](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chastise) his opponent for not following the rules of battle, or he may even call upon the [Wrath of God](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wrath+of+God) to bring about a [Day of Judgment](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Day+of+Judgment). And if it must come to a killing blow, he will bring to his side a stable of awesome avatars, including the powerful [Divinity of Pride](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Divinity+of+Pride), the unkind Merit Lage (brought up from his [Dark Depths](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dark+Depths)), or even an avatar of himself.

>  "[Ajani Goldmane](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Ajani%2BGoldmane) looked principally for creatures which could use the strength he could add to them specially, or could add strength to others as required. [Ajani Goldmane](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Ajani%2BGoldmane) recognized that his assistance alone might not be enough, but he looked for other methods of building strength to wield the swift sword of destruction."
