Jacob Van Lunen began playing Magic in 1995. He has participated in organized play at every level of competition and was a member of the winning team at Pro Tour San Diego in 2007, thanks to an innovative draft strategy.

Lucas Siow is armed with a powerful midrange strategy that features a lot of board sweepers like [Death Frenzy](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Death+Frenzy) and [Duneblast](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duneblast). His opponent, Seth Manfield, has a brutal Mardu token strategy that has the ability to win out of nowhere.

*Lucas Siow*

Both players built boards with the early turns of the game. Little trading went down and Manfield eventually combo'ed [Utter End](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Utter+End) on Siow's endstep with [Trumpet Blast](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Trumpet+Blast) on his turn for a lethal blow out of nowhere.



**Siow 0 - 1 Manfield**


Siow got off to a quick start and started trading blows with Manfield. Siow was far ahead on the board and soon had a [Woolly Loxodon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Woolly+Loxodon) headed into the red zone.

*Seth Manfield*

Seth Manfield only had a morph in play, but he won the game out of nowhere when he flipped up [Ponyback Brigade](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ponyback+Brigade) on Siow's endstep and deployed a pair of [Trumpet Blast](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Trumpet+Blast) to attack for a truly absurd amount of damage.



**Siow 0 - 2 Manfield**
