Ask Wizards is a weekly feature that allows you to ask us questions! If you'd like to submit your question please email it to [AskWizards@wizards.com](mailto:askwizards@wizards.com). We aren't able to answer every question we receive, but if your question is good, it might show up in the coming weeks!


This week, we're pulling three answers from Mark Rosewater's Tumblr: [Tales from the Pit](http://markrosewater.tumblr.com/).


**Q:** Why does Thundermaw Hellkite tap things? Wouldn't making them unable to block accomplish the same thing but in a redder way?

**A:** From **Mark Rosewater**, Head Designer for **Magic**


The card is trying to capture the flavor of thunder. Being that red could have just said "creatures can't block," I'm fine stretching a little for the flavor, as it's not fundamentally allowing red to do something it can't.

**Q:** Did you realize prior to the pencils down moment that the *Unglued* "denimwalk" ability would encourage people to take off their pants? Also, you still owe us an article on your favorite *Unhinged* jokes.

While I was head judging the *Unglued* Prerelease at Gen Con dressed as a chicken, I walked by a table and heard the following quote: "In response to your declaration of attack, I remove my pants."


I said to myself, "Oh no, what have I done?"

**Q:** Since red has a lot of "creatures without flying" hate, could it get a card reading "destroy target creature without flying?"


—zemyla


**A:** From **Mark Rosewater**, Head Designer for **Magic**


We try not to do creature destruction effects in red, instead having it do direct damage. This is one of many things we do to help separate black from red.
