![Reap and Sow](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Reap+and+Sow)MagicTheGathering.com labs continue to push the boundaries of the conventional so-called science of statistics. To this end they've bombarded the two hundred and thirty-nine decklists from this event with gamma rays and extracted whatever information they could. Below is a rough approximation of Day 1 of a Block Constructed Pro Tour, as if seen from very far away.


### Affinity - 110


Don't let this number fool you into thinking there's some consensus as to what should and shouldn't be in an Affinity deck. Once you get past the [Skullclamp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skullclamp)s, Eforcers, [Frogmite](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Frogmite)s, and all-important [Arcbound Ravager](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arcbound+Ravager)s, the decklists really start to sprawl. The greatest omission is in those decks opting out of [Disciple of the Vault](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Disciple+of+the+Vault). When combined with the Ravager you can go lethal on a moment's notice. Earlier today Eugene Harvey had his board obliterated by [Furnace Dragon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Furnace+Dragon), but because the Disciple was untouched, he won three turns later. Some decks are running a complement of burn, and the lowly [Atog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Atog)s. Some are running the full Chiss-Goria Suite. [Ornithopter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ornithopter) is getting more play than ever. Some decks touch white for the tech of Leonine Elder. There are even a handful that can go off with [Auriok Steelshaper](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Auriok+Steelshaper), [Skullclamp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skullclamp), and [Genesis Chamber](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Genesis+Chamber).


Do not underestimate the explosiveness of this deck. It can kill you with its eyes closed.


### Green-Red - 44


The so-called Anti-Affinity also has a bit of an identity crisis. These decks sweep the spectrum from control to aggro. Some are green beats that dip into red for [Fireball](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fireball), [Electrostatic Bolt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Electrostatic+Bolt) and [Shatter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shatter). Some are huge piles of hate, maxing out on [Shatter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shatter), [Detonate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Detonate), [Oxidize](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oxidize) and [Glissa Sunseeker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glissa+Sunseeker). Some are lategame control decks that bank on the power of [Molder Slug](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Molder+Slug) and Arc Slogger. All are designed to crush affinity like a bug.


### Big Red - 39


The point of division for the mono-red decks is [Furnace Dragon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Furnace+Dragon). Some run next to no artifacts (save the might Jens) to get the better of the Green-Red decks packed with hate cards, while others run artifact lands and Talismans to speed up [Furnace Dragon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Furnace+Dragon)s to put the hurt on Affinity. In between they find room for a suite of artifact destruction and burn. More than a few matches this weekend have ended with a gigantic fireball.


### Mono-Green Beats - 16


With [Oxidize](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oxidize) and [Viridian Shaman](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Viridian+Shaman), green has its share of artifact removal. Add to that efficient beaters like [Tel-Jilad Chosen](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tel-Jilad+Chosen) and [Pulse of the Tangle](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pulse+of+the+Tangle) and you've got the skeleton for a deck that owns the Red Zone. [Fangren Firstborn](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fangren+Firstborn) turned a lot of heads when he was first revealed, and it's nice that he's found a home from which to crack skulls.


[Death Cloud](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Death+Cloud) - 12


Poor [Death Cloud](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Death+Cloud). Such a big effect. So slow. Ben Stark's Affinity deck killed a [Death Cloud](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Death+Cloud) deck on turn four despite being hit by [Barter in Blood](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Barter+in+Blood). On paper the deck looks very powerful, but it just doesn't seem to have the tools to survive the mid-game. Some players have tried augmenting it with some cheap red removal, but it might not be enough.


### TwelvePost - 8


Easily the breakout deck of the tournament is this French design that exploits the presence of [Sylvan Scrying](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sylvan+Scrying) and [Reap and Sow](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reap+and+Sow) to draw [Cloudpost](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloudpost)s with regularity. What does it do with all that mana? Why, entwine [Tooth and Nail](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tooth+and+Nail), of course. [Darksteel Colossus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Darksteel+Colossus), [Platinum Angel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Platinum+Angel) and [Leonin Abunas](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leonin+Abunas) are the targets of choice.


### White-Based Control - 5


Another card that people expected big things from is Darksteel's [Pulse of the Fields](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pulse+of+the+Fields). Reusable lifegain had a lot of people musing over a snifter of brandy. Combine that with [Pristine Angel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pristine+Angel), board control like [Solar Tide](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Solar+Tide) and [Oblivion Stone](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oblivion+Stone), and [Vex](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vex) for key spells, and you've got a deck that acts a lot better than it looks.


### Other - 6


There's not much else out there. Most of the decktypes have a lot of variation within them, so the oddballs are really left out in the cold. Of course there's a white weenie deck or two, and a green control deck, but they really don't look like they've got a lot of fight.
