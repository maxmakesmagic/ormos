### Brother vs Brother: The Ruels

After sharing a dismal 2-3 opening in Block Constructed, the Brothers Ruel both needed to win out in order to make Day 2. Fate was in a cruel mood, however, and slotted them both into the same draft pod. Even in the best case, only one could advance.

Fast forward to Round 8, and both have 2-0'd their pod. Olivier put together a slick blue-red control deck, and Antoine a green-red-black aggro package. Just next door, also in an elimination match, sat Brian Kibler and Ben Rubin, shamefacedly shuffling up after going 0-2 to put themselves on the brink.

The first game was all haymakers. Antoine got an early [Lord of Shatterskull Pass](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lord+of+Shatterskull+Pass). Two turns before it would come online, Olivier traded in a board of [Emrakul's Hatcher](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Emrakul%27s+Hatcher), Spawn token, [Guard Gomazoa](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Guard+Gomazoa), and [Sea Gate Oracle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sea+Gate+Oracle)s for a [Hellion Eruption](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hellion+Eruption). Antoine dug in his heels and after the wave of 4/4's crashed against his board he was left with a very [Lord of Shatterskull Pass](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lord+of+Shatterskull+Pass). He untapped and brought him to max level, swinging in to blank Olivier's board.

But Olivier's deck decided he needed a break and fed him [Narcolepsy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Narcolepsy) off the top. The two cast and traded creatures, but Olivier again got the best of it with his OWN [Lord of Shatterskull Pass](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lord+of+Shatterskull+Pass). It quickly leveled to max and Antoine's deck refused his pleas for aid.

Olivier 1, Antoine 0

Game 2 started with mana difficulties for both brothers. Antoine had [Evolving Wilds](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Evolving+Wilds), but didn't want to waste it getting the [Forest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest) he needed for [Overgrown Battlement](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Overgrown+Battlement). He missed on his next draw step, and was forced to dig out a [Forest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest). Naturally, he drew another on the following draw step.

On the other side of the table, Olivier had a grip of Hatchers, [Traitorous Instinct](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Traitorous+Instinct), and three [Island](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island)s. He cast [Sea Gate Oracle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sea+Gate+Oracle) and greedily kept the [Hellion Eruption](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hellion+Eruption) offered him rather than a fourth [Island](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island). He showed Antoine how it was done by flipping his next card straight onto his lands: A mountain.

In the meantime, Antoine had brought back the [Lord of Shatterskull Pass](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lord+of+Shatterskull+Pass) for another round. He only had a single [Mountain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mountain), though, so leveling up was slow going. Olivier finally hit a fifth land and started playing [Emrakul's Hatcher](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Emrakul%27s+Hatcher)s. Antoine hassled him further by enchanting [Stomper Cub](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stomper+Cub) with [Boar Umbra](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Boar+Umbra), trampling past the insignificant Spawn. After playing his second Hatcher, Olivier bit the bullet and put both 3/3's in front of the Cub, stripping the Umbra. He untapped and quickly flashed the [Hellion Eruption](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hellion+Eruption), upgrading his board to six 4/4's.

Antoine swung with the Cub and took care of one of them, leveling his Lord to three and playing [Wildheart Invoker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wildheart+Invoker). Olivier held back, playing [Dreamstone Hedron](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dreamstone+Hedron) and [See Beyond](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=See+Beyond). Antoine happily [Naturalize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Naturalize)d the Hedron at end of turn, untapped, and found another [Mountain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mountain) to bring the Lord one level short of devastation.

That was just fine for Olivier, who winked as he tapped six: four for [Traitorous Instinct](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Traitorous+Instinct), and two to put the stolen Lord to max level, swinging in for a brutal kill.

Olivier Ruel commits fratricide to advance to Day 2!
