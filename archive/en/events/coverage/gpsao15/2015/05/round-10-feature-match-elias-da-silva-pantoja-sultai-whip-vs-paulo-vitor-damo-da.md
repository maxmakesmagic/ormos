 Hall of Famer Paulo Vitor Damo da Rosa is currently at an 8-1 record, armed with the very same deck that he used to secure his 16th Lifetime Grand Prix Top 8 at Grand Prix Warsaw a couple a weeks ago. Damo da Rosa is one of the most decorated players of all time (and the most esteemed in the entire tournament hall) and is hunting for his 17th Top 8 this weekend.



Damo da Rosa is paired against the "technically undefeated" Elias da Silver Pantoja. His Sultai Whip deck has a powerful late game, but sometimes takes a while to seal the deal. Despite being at the awkward score of 7-0-2, the good news is that he still has yet to drop a match!


Game One
========


Damo da Rosa allowed [Sylvan Caryatid](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sylvan+Caryatid) to enter the battlefield, but said no to [Courser of Kruphix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Courser+of+Kruphix). Sultai Whip's namesake card, Whip of Erebos, did resolve though, even though Pantoja did not have much gas in his graveyard.


The empty board gave Damo da Rosa ample time to [Anticipate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Anticipate) as well as [Dig Through Time](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dig+Through+Time), not once, not twice but thrice! The best Pantoja could do was recruit [Sylvan Wayfinder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sylvan+Wayfinder), and attack for four damage with a freshly-binned and hasty [Doomwake Giant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Doomwake+Giant).


Then, the dragons came out to play.

*Even with all the Dragons roaming Tarkir, its not very common to find three Dragonlords fighting hand in hand.*




[Dragonlord Ojutai](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragonlord+Ojutai) made its grand appearance, and it did
 get in for one hit. Pantoja tried to take it down with [Dragonlord Atarka](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragonlord+Atarka), and it saw no resistance from Damo da Rosa. That was because he had the trump of [Dragonlord Silumgar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragonlord+Silumgar) to gain control of it, creating an impressive clock that would undo all the life gain granted by [Whip of Erebos](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Whip+of+Erebos). Damo da Rosa replaced the fallen [Dragonlord Ojutai](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragonlord+Ojutai) with another, creating a rather impressive board of three Dragonlords.


That didn't last very long though. Pantoja's next move was to reanimate his own [Dragonlord Silumgar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragonlord+Silumgar) to steal the opposing copy. Thanks to the "legend rule", Pantoja was able to sacrifice Damo da Rosa's copy, regaining control of his [Dragonlord Atarka](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragonlord+Atarka).

*Elias da Silva Pantoja wins the attrition war with the help of [Whip of Erebos](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Whip+of+Erebos) and [Soul of Innistrad](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soul+of+Innistrad).*



Things went downhill from there and Damo da Rosa succumbed to power of 
[Whip of Erebos](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Whip+of+Erebos). Using it to reanimate [Soul of Innistrad](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soul+of+Innistrad), Pantoja was able to activate it's ability to pick up three creatures from his graveyard and that provided more than enough resources to overpower Damo da Rosa.



**Elias da Silva Pantoja 1 – Paulo Vitor Damo da Rosa 0**



Game Two
========


Pantoja had a pair of [Duress](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress), but Damo da Rosa was able to protect his hand using [Duress](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress) of his own and [Dissolve](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dissolve). Because of that, [Ashiok, Nightmare Weaver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ashiok%2C+Nightmare+Weaver) was able to hit play successfully. Without pressure on the board, Pantoja had to move fast or get buried by his own creatures.


Pantoja made use of the window to resolve [Whip of Erebos](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Whip+of+Erebos) and [Liliana Vess](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Liliana+Vess). Damo da Rosa turned up the heat with [Dragonlord Ojutai](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragonlord+Ojutai) and used [Dragonlord Silumgar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragonlord+Silumgar) to steal the opposing [Liliana Vess](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Liliana+Vess).

*Paulo Vitor Damo da Rosa's Dragonlords serve him well.*



In conjunction with Tasigur and the pair of Dragonlords, Damo da Rosa was able to win Game Two, forcing the draw.



**Elias da Silva Pantoja 1 – Paulo Vitor Damo da Rosa 1**




**This draw puts Paulo Vitor Damo da Rosa at 8-1-1, and Elias da Silva Pantoja at 7-0-3. Still undefeated!**
