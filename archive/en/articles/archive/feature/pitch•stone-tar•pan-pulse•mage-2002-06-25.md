**pitch•stone**

![Pitchstone Wall](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Pitchstone+Wall)  
 From Webster's 1998 Revised Unabridged Dictionary:  
 Function: noun  
 Etymology: translation of German *Pechstein*  
 : An igneous rock of semiglassy nature, having a luster like pitch.**tar•pan**

![Tarpan](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Tarpan)  
 From Dictionary.com:  
 Function: noun  
 : A wild horse found in the region of the Caspian Sea, extinct since the early 20th century. (*Equus caballus gomelini*)**Pulse•mage**

![Pulsemage Advocate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Pulsemage+Advocate)  
 From Rei Nakazawa, **Magic** creative text writer:  
 Function: noun  
 : a school of magic that specializes in resurrection spells  
 Etymology: Each Advocate has a name reflecting what it, and all creatures that carry the word in the future, generally do with its ability. So creatures with the word "Forcemage" in their names will probably belong or work in the Forcemage school of magic, and thus pump power and toughness. "Pulsemage" similarly will convey resurrection. Creative Text wanted a set of names that could carry certain types of abilities throughout different sets and different colors, and schools of magic seemed to be a good way to do it.
