If you've ever stayed up late and aimed your bleary eyeballs at several hours of animated randomness -- and our market research shows that it's a good bet that you have -- then you've probably seen Adult Swim. It's a block of late-night animation programming that takes over Cartoon Network after the kiddies have gone to bed. 


And for the next two weeks, Adult Swim is airing *Ravnica* prerelease ads.


[![Screenshot of a sample prerelease ad](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/mtgcom/arcana300/903_goldcards.jpg)](http://archive.wizards.com/playravnica/default.asp?dcmp=ILC-ASTV)


Gotta get up early? Got no TiVo or an old VCR? Got (\*gasp\*) no access to basic cable? No worries. Just head to [PlayRavnica.com](http://archive.wizards.com/playravnica/default.asp?dcmp=ILC-ASTV) to see the ads for yourself. They rotate every day.


And to make us *really* happy, just go to the dang [prerelease](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=events/magic/prereleases). And keep watching cartoons, you insomniac.
