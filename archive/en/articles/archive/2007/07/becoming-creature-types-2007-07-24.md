As you may have noticed on the *Tenth Edition* "man-lands," creature types are showing up in places where they haven't before.



![Treetop Village](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Treetop+Village)

When these lands animate, they become creatures—and creatures, the philosophy goes, should have creature types.



![Forbidding Watchtower](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Forbidding+Watchtower)

[Forbidding Watchtower](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forbidding+Watchtower), as a fortress full of soldiers, gains the creature type Soldier, and can reap benefits from [Mobilization](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mobilization) and [Field Marshal](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Field+Marshal). [Faerie Conclave](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Faerie+Conclave), logically enough, becomes a Faerie—finally a reasonable card to include in your [Faerie Noble](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Faerie+Noble) deck. [Spawning Pool](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spawning+Pool) spawns a Skeleton, which matches **Magic**'s mechanical pattern of so many 1/1 black regenerating creatures being Skeletons, and might matter if you have a [Coat of Arms](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Coat+of+Arms) in play and are building a [Drudge Spell](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Drudge+Spell) army. [Ghitu Encampment](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ghitu+Encampment), as the base camp of the rugged mountain warriors known as the Ghitu, becomes a Warrior—pumpable with [Lovisa Coldeyes](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lovisa+Coldeyes) and a reasonably powerful combo with [Sosuke, Son of Seshiro](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sosuke%2C+Son+of+Seshiro).


So, why does [Treetop Village](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treetop+Village) become an Ape? Because the card depicts Yavimaya, a forest and valley where a race of sentient apes once made their home, and because the first printing of [Treetop Village](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Treetop%2BVillage) showed these apes inhabiting the village back in *Urza's Legacy*. (See also cards like Gorilla Pack or Yavimaya Wurm for more flavor text relevant to these apes.)

There's another noncreature card in *Tenth Edition* that gains a creature type when it activates: [Chimeric Staff](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chimeric+Staff), which becomes a Construct when you pour mana into it.
