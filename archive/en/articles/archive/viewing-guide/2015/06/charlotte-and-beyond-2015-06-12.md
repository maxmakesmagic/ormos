The spotlight for this week shines on Charlotte, North Carolina, for some Modern Constructed goodness, followed by some weekday regulars!

StarCityGames.com is hosting Grand Prix Charlotte this weekend, featuring a two-day Modern main event that will showcase the Modern format at a Grand Prix for the first time since the release of *Dragons of Tarkir*. As *Magic Online* and a few other marquee events have shown, the new set has had an impact on Modern, and we'll be seeing that play out across fifteen rounds of Swiss and a Top 8 featuring North America's Modern all-stars.



Join Cedric Phillips, Patrick Sullivan, and the rest of the SCGLive crew as they bring you both days of Grand Prix Charlotte on the [SCGLive Twitch Channel](http://www.twitch.tv/scglive) starting Saturday at 6:30 a.m. PT/9:30 a.m. ET/1:30 p.m. UTC. Coverage of Day Two will begin at 6 a.m. PT/9 a.m. ET/1 p.m. UTC Sunday.

Following the Grand Prix, the Standard Super league returns on Tuesday with more Standard action, with its final week of bracket action before a cut to the Top 4. Leading the race, and a sure lock for first seed in the Top 4, is Owen Turtenwald. Following behind at a distance is a much closer race in the jockeying for second seed. Tom Ross is currently leading that charge, followed by Paul Cheon (who earned some extra points last week thanks to his guest alternate Kenji Egashira), and then Gerry Thompson.



Join hosts Randy Buehler and Luis Scott-Vargas as they bring you the final week of regular action before the cut to the Standard Super League's Top 4. It all begins on the [*Magic* Twitch Channel](http://www.twitch.tv/magic) on Tuesday at 6 p.m. PT/9 p.m. ET/1 a.m. UTC.
