PRERELEASES
-----------

Prereleases provide you with the earliest possible opportunity to play with the newest cards in Magic. Prereleases are enjoyable casual events that encourage fun over competition. You can plan to play all day in multiple events your store runs, or drop by for a single event. Be sure to check with your local store to see if you need to preregister!


Not sure where your nearest store is? Use our Store Locator tool to help you find it.

FORMATS
-------

Prereleases are Sealed Deck format events, where players are given Prerelease Packs and time to construct a 40-card minimum deck.


Prerelease Packs make deck-building more exciting with the inclusion of specialized, “seeded” booster packs and regular booster packs that let players choose a focus for their deck.


Players who are uncomfortable building a Sealed Deck may participate in Open Dueling instead of the main tournament. Open Dueling players use an Intro Pack to experience the new set a week before it hits shelves.

PRIZES
------

Players get to keep all of the cards opened in their Prerelease Pack or Intro Pack. In addition Prerelease Packs contain a premium foil Prerelease promo to keep. Players who participate in the tournament also have a chance to win additional booster packs of the newest set—an exclusive opportunity to take home even more of the latest cards before they’re available to purchase in stores! Additional prizes may be offered by local stores, so check with your organizer for additional information.



 









RULES
-----

Prerelease events focus on fun and enjoying the upcoming Magic expansion, allowing players a chance to experience the newest cards in a fun and stress-free environment. That said, as Sealed Deck tournaments, they follow certain rules for deck construction and play.


* Decks must be constructed with a minimum of 40 cards
* Decks may only be built using cards opened in the Prerelease Packs assigned at the beginning of the event, and no outside cards may be added.
