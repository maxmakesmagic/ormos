### Bernhard Wurmitzer


**Age:** 32  
**Hometown:** Villach/Graz, Austria  
**Occupation:** Actor


 

**Previous** ***Magic*** **accomplishments:**   

Won a FNM tournament.


**What deck did you play and why did you choose it?**  

Green-Red Tron because I haven't played since the last Modern Grand Prix and I liked it back then.


**What changes would you make to your deck and why would you make them?**  

Cut one [Wurmcoil Engine](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wurmcoil+Engine) from the main deck and change the [Stone Rain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stone+Rain)s in the sideboard to something different.


**What is the most important card in your deck?**  

Obviously, [Urza's Mine](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Urza%27s+Mine), [Urza's Power Plant](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Urza%27s+Power+Plant), [Urza's Tower](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Urza%27s+Tower) plus [Karn Liberated](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Karn+Liberated).

**Occupation:** Writer for MTGMadness


 

**Previous** ***Magic*** **accomplishments:**   

Three Grand Prix Top 8s, won two.


**What deck did you play and why did you choose it?**  

Jund because I think it's the best deck in the format.


**What changes would you make to your deck and why would you make them?**  

Maybe cut two [Slaughter Games](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Slaughter+Games) for [Sowing Salt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sowing+Salt).


**What is the most important card in your deck?**

### Marcel Kachapow


**Age:** 25  
**Hometown:** Düsseldorf, Germany  
**Occupation:** Economics student


 

**Previous** ***Magic*** **accomplishments:**   

—


**What deck did you play and why did you choose it?**  

Tempo [Twin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Twin) because it has quick consistent draws, enough good match-ups, and it's the only deck I could borrow/had cards for.


**What changes would you make to your deck and why would you make them?**  

The Jund match-up is very bad if the opponent is good, so maybe changing to more combo in the board or play another deck like Affinity.


**What is the most important card in your deck?**  
[Snapcaster Mage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snapcaster+Mage).

**Hometown:** Ljubljana, Slovenia  
**Occupation:** Student


 

**Previous** ***Magic*** **accomplishments:**   

Grand Prix Vienna Top 8.


**What deck did you play and why did you choose it?**  

Jund with white. It seemed like a better version of Jund.


**What changes would you make to your deck and why would you make them?**  

Minus one [Timely Reinforcements](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Timely+Reinforcements) for another [Jund Charm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jund+Charm).


**What is the most important card in your deck?**  
[Liliana of the Veil](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Liliana+of+the+Veil).

### Carlos Moral


**Age:** 26  
**Hometown:** Chiclana, Cadiz, Spain  
**Occupation:** Video game tester


 

**Previous** ***Magic*** **accomplishments:**   

Played some PTs, cashed a couple of other Grand Prix ... nothing important really.


**What deck did you play and why did you choose it?**  

Blue-Red [Delver](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Delver). I believe this is the best deck in the format.


**What changes would you make to your deck and why would you make them?**  

I would probably play less [Vendilion Clique](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vendilion+Clique)s, but that is such a great card that it's rather difficult to take out.


**What is the most important card in your deck?**  
[Gitaxian Probe](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gitaxian+Probe) and [Young Pyromancer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Young+Pyromancer).

### Andrej Rutar


**Age:** 34  
**Hometown:** Ljubljana, Slovenia  
**Occupation:** Manager


 

**Previous** ***Magic*** **accomplishments:**   

Two 9th places at Grand Prix. 9th wherever possible.


**What deck did you play and why did you choose it?**  

Ajundi. Dolar suggested we should play it and I have a foil Liliana.


**What changes would you make to your deck and why would you make them?**  

No changes to the main deck. Maybe cutting [Timely Reinforcements](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Timely+Reinforcements).


**What is the most important card in your deck?**  
[Deathrite Shaman](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deathrite+Shaman) and [Liliana of the Veil](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Liliana+of+the+Veil).

### Jérémy Dezani


**Age:** 23  
**Hometown:** Paris/Orléans, France  
**Occupation:****Magic**/tennis/biology


 

**Previous** ***Magic*** **accomplishments:**   

Pro Tour *Theros* champion, five GP Top 8s (Vienna, Warsaw, Paris, Verona, and 1st in Lyon).


**What deck did you play and why did you choose it?**  

Junk. White's better than red I think. I only miss [Lightning Bolt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt). White sideboard cards are pretty good.


**What changes would you make to your deck and why would you make them?**  

Maybe one less [Spellskite](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spellskite).


**What is the most important card in your deck?**  
[Lingering Souls](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lingering+Souls).

Nothing.


**What deck did you play and why did you choose it?**  

Blue-White-Red Geist. I played it for a long time.


**What changes would you make to your deck and why would you make them?**  

No changes, although [Aven Mindcensor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aven+Mindcensor)s didn't do much.


**What is the most important card in your deck?**  
[Geist of Saint Traft](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Geist+of+Saint+Traft).
