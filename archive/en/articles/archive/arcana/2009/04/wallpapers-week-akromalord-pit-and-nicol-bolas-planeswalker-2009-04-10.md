We've got two wallpapers this week, and one of them has two things on it. That's like *three* wallpapers!

First up, to remind you that *Duel Decks: Divine vs. Demonic* hits stores today, we've got a wallpaper that combines Chippy's new [Akroma, Angel of Wrath](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Akroma%2C+Angel+of+Wrath) and [Lord of the Pit](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lord+of+the+Pit):

But that's not all! It's Nicol Bolas Week, so this should come as no real surprise: It's [Nicol Bolas, Planeswalker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nicol+Bolas%2C+Planeswalker), by D. Alexander Gregory! Enjoy.
