2017's Grand Prix schedule features:


* An increased number of events compared to last year, with 53 Grand Prix events in total
* More Limited events spread out through each season, a popular piece of feedback we received in 2016
* More team event weekends, as this was also something the community has been asking for that we wanted to assure was part of the schedule

The spread of events by format is as follows:


* 19 Standard events
* 15 Limited events
* 9 Modern events
* 6 Team Limited events
* 2 Team Unified Modern events
* 2 Legacy events

You also may have noticed a couple of interesting weekends in that schedule. Here's a quick overview.


**San Antonio and Madrid**


Grand Prix in San Antonio, Texas, and Madrid, Spain, will feature a fresh addition to the Grand Prix schedule: Team Unified Modern. The feedback we have received is a general love for team events, and there was a strong interest in bringing Team Constructed Grand Prix to the public. Team Unified Modern is the format we're using to explore the possibility of more team events in the future, as it is the format for the World *Magic* Cup and we expect there to be interest in exploring the same format that tournament's competitors play.


North America's Team Constructed Grand Prix will take place earlier in 2017, while Europe's Team Constructed Grand Prix is situated one week after the 2017 World *Magic* Cup. Madrid's event combines with the Team Limited Grand Prix in Lyon, France, the weekend before the World *Magic* Cup for competing teams that want to make the most of their trip to Nice, France, for the big event next year.


**Asia’s TBD Grand Prix**


These is one event in Asia that is awaiting confirmation. We will update when and where this event will take place as soon as we can.


**Las Vegas**


The other major outlier in the schedule is Las Vegas, which features three Grand Prix all taking place in the same span of time at the same location.


Grand Prix Las Vegas in 2017 will comprise *three* Grand Prix main events featuring Legacy, Modern, and Standard on June 15–18, 2017. The main events start on Thursday and carry through the entire weekend as follows:


* The Legacy main event takes place June 15–16
* The Standard main event takes place June 16–17
* The Modern main event takes place June 17–18

With three main events in a single four-day span, and a Super Sunday Series Sealed event on Sunday, players who travel to Grand Prix Las Vegas will have the opportunity to play in multiple large-scale events in a single trip, making this one unforgettable *Magic* Grand Prix experience.
