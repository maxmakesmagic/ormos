Lyon in France. Porto Alegre in Brazil. Indianapolis in the United States. These were the three battlegrounds for the latest skirmishes in the *Magic* Top 25 Pro Rankings, so let's see what the new standings look like. We begin with news that once again there's a new World No. 1—it's Seth Manfield, reigning World Champion, who takes over from the man he beat in the Worlds final, Owen Turtenwald. There's less than a single point separating these two, so look for much back and forth as we continue our Grand Prix journeys around the world.


Manfield was one of four players in the Top 25 who earned a single point in Indianapolis. Like him, Shahar Shenhar, Paul Rietzl, and Jacob Wilson will all be hoping that these points won't be part of their GP portfolio come the end of the season (as only the five best results for each player count toward the final tally). The best of the Top 25 in Indy was Brad Nelson. It was Standard, and Brad's outstanding at Standard. He finished in the Top 16, which was enough for 3 Pro Points and enough to make him this week's biggest climber, up four to No. 11.


Playing on home soil, Thiago Saporito took advantage of the opportunity, finishing fifth at Grand Prix Porto Alegre, which takes him up three to No. 16. Paulo Vitor Damo da Rosa was the other "local" pro, but he couldn't get past Day One in Modern.


That leaves Lyon in France, where Pro Tour *Magic* *Origins* Champion Joel Larsson was the best placed of our ranked players, coming in seventeenth, worth 3 Pro Points. He's up three spots to No. 20 as a result. Fabrizio Anteri is also up three, thanks to his 11-4 finish in Lyon. He's the new No. 21. Martin Müller of Denmark and Spain's Antonio Del Moral León each picked up a point, keeping Del Moral León in the Top 10 and moving Müller up one to No. 21, tied with Anteri.


Up next, a busy month of GP action gets underway with Legacy in Seattle-Tacoma, right on the doorstep of Wizards of the Coast. Can Turtenwald take back the No. 1 spot? Tune in to coverage all weekend long, and we'll be back with all the latest news next week right here, at the home of the *Magic* Top 25 Pro Rankings.
