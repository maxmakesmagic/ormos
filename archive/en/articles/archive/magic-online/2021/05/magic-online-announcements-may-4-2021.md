*Proliferate Cube* Returns May 5–12
-----------------------------------


Emma Handy's *Proliferate Cube* returns May 5–12! One of the most popular spotlight cubes from 2020 is back with an update. You can *counter* on having a good time and read all about this latest iteration, including a full card list, in [Emma's article here](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/magic-online/spotlight-cube-series-proliferate-cube-returns-2021-05-04).

*Pioneer Cube* Ends Tomorrow
----------------------------


Created by veteran *Magic* and *Magic Online* designer Tom LaPille, *Pioneer Cube* takes the popular Constructed format and distills it into an incredible Cube experience. Read all about it [here](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/magic-online/spotlight-cube-series-pioneer-cube-2021-04-28) and get a game in before it ends tomorrow, May 5!

*Strixhaven* Season Alternative Play Calendar
---------------------------------------------


Classes are now in session, with guest-lecture alternative play events available weekly. Each of these events begins on Wednesday at 10 a.m. Pacific time and continues for one week unless otherwise specified. *Strixhaven* season ends with the MTGO launch of *Modern Horizons 2* in early June.


* May 12: *Legacy Cube* returns – For two weeks, we're reviving a cube that's been dormant for almost a full year. For those of us who love the power level of *Vintage Cube* without the huge spikes that come with actual power, this is the cube to watch for.
* May 26: New to the Spotlight Cube Series – As usual for new spotlight cubes, we'll have more information as we get closer.

Showcase Opens May 8–9
----------------------


The penultimate events of each season, Showcase Opens allow anyone to try their hand at earning an invitation to the Showcase. Players don't need to earn points or another qualification to enter, and because these events are Sealed, players don't even need a deck. The winner of each Open will get an invitation to the Showcase, and both the winner and runner-up earn invitations to the *Strixhaven: School of Mages* Championship on *MTG Arena*. Entry options include 40 Event Tickets or 400 Play Points, and events consist of Swiss pairings followed by a single-elimination Top 8 draft.


Showcase Opens are scheduled as follows:





| DATE | TIME | FORMAT | INVITATION |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Saturday, May 8, 2021 | 7:00 a.m. | STX Sealed | Season 1 Showcase & STX Championship |
| Sunday, May 9, 2021 | 7:00 a.m. | STX Sealed | Season 1 Showcase & STX Championship |
