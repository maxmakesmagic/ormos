Brisbane in summer is not to be missed, and what better reason to visit tropical Queensland than a weekend of **Magic**? 

Earlier in 2013, Grand Prix Sydney set the record for the biggest Australian event, so Brisbane has a lot to live up to! This year's Brisbane event features the popular Modern format, so browse through your collection and brew up a powerful list: with a US$30,000 purse and Pro Tour invites up for grabs, you can be sure that competition will be fierce! 

 With an exciting format, tons of room for innovation and deckbuilding, and the best judges on staff keeping it fair, it's going to be a great weekend for playing **Magic**. Running right alongside the Grand Prix is a huge side events schedule—there's something for everyone at Grand Prix Brisbane! Stay up to date by following [Top Deck Events on Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/TopDeckEvents). 

  

 *The **Magic: The Gathering**  Grand Prix tournament series is a great reason to get out into the **Magic** tournament community, catch up with old friends, meet some new ones, and play some great **Magic**. Grand Prix tournaments are world-wide open events that allow all **Magic**  players to participate and experience the thrill of a large-scale competition. In addition to cash prizes, a high Planeswalker Points multiplier, and exclusive foil promo cards for participants, Grand Prix feature a host of other activities, including side events and artist signings (prizes subject to change). Find out more about the Grand Prix [tournament schedule here](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/TCG/Events.aspx?x=grandprix/welcome#2013).*

**Tournament Format**
  


* [Modern](http://www.wizards.com/Magic/TCG/Resources.aspx?x=judge/resources/sfrmodern)
* Visit [this page](http://www.wizards.com/Magic/TCG/Resources.aspx?x=judge/resources/sfrmodern#banned) to see a list of cards banned in Modern tournaments.
* Deck lists are required.
* Players must use the same deck on Day 2 that they used on Day 1.


**Tournament Structure** 


* Modified Swiss-style (50-minute rounds).
* If 799 or less players register for the event, all players with an X-2-0 record (or better) or the top 64 players – whichever is greater – advance to the second day of competition for prizes and invitations.
* If 800 or more players register for the event, all players with an X-2-0 record (or better) or the top 128 players – whichever is greater – advance to the second day of competition for prizes and invitations.
* The Top 8 players after the final Swiss round on Day 2 will advance to the Top 8 single-elimination finals.
* Top 8 playoff matches will be best 2 of 3, and have no time limit. (Players are still expected to play at a normal pace and complete playoff matches in a reasonable amount of time.)
* Where necessary, the standings after the Swiss rounds will still be used to determine final order in the standings.
* For the first game of each match in the Top 8, the player that finished higher in the Swiss rounds chooses either to play first or to play second. For subsequent games in each Top 8 match, the usual Play/Draw rule applies (loser of the previous game decides whether to play first in the next game).


**Judges**
  
 The Head Judge for Grand Prix Brisbane is James Mackay.
