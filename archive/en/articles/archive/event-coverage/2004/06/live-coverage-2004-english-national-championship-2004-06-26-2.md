Tom Harle's draft


Pack one *Mirrodin*


Tom's first pick was between Electrostatic Static Bolt. [Platinum Angel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Platinum+Angel) and [Viridian Shaman](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Viridian+Shaman). Tom picked the green card indicating a desire to draft green cards, a colour that many avoid. He was passed [Looming Hoverguard](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Looming+Hoverguard) and [Fangren Hunter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fangren+Hunter) and stuck to his first pick and took the [Fangren Hunter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fangren+Hunter). He looked to branch off with his third pick of [Skyhunter Cub](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skyhunter+Cub) looking towards g/w. Green continued to flow with 4th and 5th [Deconstruct](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deconstruct)s and late a [Predator's Strike](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Predator%27s+Strike). This pack was round out my two very late myrs for him. A few red cards rounded out this pack, Krark Clan Grunt and [Hematite Golem](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hematite+Golem).


Pack two *Darksteel*


First pick Tom was left with little to pick from other than [Savage Beating](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Savage+Beating), so he was pushed more into red. The next pack Tom was forced to pick his colours as he was passed [Leonin Battlemage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leonin+Battlemage), [Razor Golem](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Razor+Golem) and [Vulshok Morningstar](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vulshok+Morningstar). He decided stick to g/r and picked the Morningstar. Picking where fairly slim in *Darksteel* as he picked up a [Tangle Golem](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tangle+Golem) and a [Viridian Zealot](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Viridian+Zealot). However a flow of black cards pass though him including 3 [Chittering Rats](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chittering+Rats) and 3 [Echoing Decay](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Echoing+Decay)s. He did manage another red card in [Dismantle](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dismantle) which has improved greatly with 5th Dawn


Pack three 5th Dawn


Again the pack Tom opened was fairly weak with his pick being Ouphe Vandal over [Sylvok Explorer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sylvok+Explorer). He then took an explorer over a [Rain of Rust](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rain+of+Rust), having plenty of artifact kill already. Beacon of creation was a another early pick out of a weak booster that might be pretty good as he was almost mono green at the time. 5th Dawn wasn't looking too strong for Tom but then he got two late [Vulshok Sorcerer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vulshok+Sorcerer) to rounds his deck out with some creature kill. Overall his deck was pretty powerful and during the draft a lot of very good card went round much too late, indicating inexperienced drafters


Tom should probably manage 3-0 with his very powerful deck. He has an awful lot of removal, but some of his creature are a bit weak.
