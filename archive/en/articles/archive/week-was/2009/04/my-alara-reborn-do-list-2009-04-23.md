Have you already figured out your plans for the weekend? And by "plans for the weekend" I mean, "which Prerelease you will be going to and how many events you are going to squeeze in." I am going to be in Boston as the gunslinger at Rob Dougherty's Prerelease tournament, so if you in the Boston area you should swing by and say hello. Play me with your Prerelease deck, and if you win you will get an extra pack of *Alara Reborn*. I am going to need to get a lot of matches under my belt because there are a bunch of things I want to try this weekend with the cards revealed in the *Alara Reborn*[Visual Spoiler](/magic/tcg/article.aspx?x=mtg/tcg/alarareborn/spoiler)â€”not to mention all the cards we have not gotten a look at yet.

The first thing on my list at any Prerelease is to have good mana. I am always concerned about mana-fixing when I go to a Prerelease, especially when you are talking about a third set and an unusual configuration of packs. This becomes even more of a priority when the new set features nothing but gold cards. There is no *Conflux* in the Sealed deck events, with three packs each of *Shards of Alara* and *Alara Reborn*. Without the basic landcycling of *Conflux* you will need to pay extra attention to Igneous Pouncer and his ilk, as well as the Borderpost cycle. Between those cards, tri-lands, Obelisks, and Panoramas players should have no trouble making sure they can cast all the golden goodness in the new set.
