"I redeemed myself."


For fifth-ranked Reid Duke, Platinum player, Pro Tour Top 8 contender, Grand Prix champion, and three-peat World Championship competitor, the pun 'Reidemption' had been used to great effect in the past. What makes it compelling isn't the story about Reid Duke the underdog, which hasn't been true for a couple years now, but how he carries himself as the constant challenger.


Without fail, Duke is looking forward and battling. At the World Championship, Duke started Day 2 with a disappointing series of losses. By the end, he flagged me down to tell me precisely what he fought hard to do. "I redeemed myself. I won five in a row."


The grin Duke wore was half the tale. "I felt good at the end of the tournament," he said. "Naturally, 7-7 is not what I was hoping for going in. It's amazing how the same record can feel so different whenever you have a weak start and a strong finish or a strong start and a weak finish. My performance at Worlds wouldn't have changed my drive for the rest of the year: Unless I had gotten first, my thought was to get right back to Worlds again. A Top 8 here would be the first step on my chance for qualifying again."





*Fifth-ranked Reid Duke had a lot on his mind rallying to regain his position from entering the day undefeated.*
