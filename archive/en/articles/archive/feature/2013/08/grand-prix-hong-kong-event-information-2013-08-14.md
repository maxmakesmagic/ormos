Situated on the southeast coast of China, Hong Kong's strategic location on the Pearl River Delta and South China Sea has made it one of the world's most thriving and cosmopolitan cities. The former British colony is a major tourism destination and an important hub in East Asia with global connections to many of the world's cities. It is a unique destination that has absorbed people and cultural influences from diverse places and proudly proclaims itself to be Asia's World City. **Magic: The Gathering** finally returns to Hong Kong with a Grand Prix after a nine-year hiatus. 

 Grand Prix Hong Kong is open to the public and all players are invited to participate. With *Theros* less than a month old, rise to battle with *Theros* Sealed Deck and make Grand Prix Hong Kong part of your heroic journey into the realms of mythology! In addition, the side event schedule will be filled with exhilarating events with multiple formats. With Planeswalker Points multipliers of 8x for the main event and 3x for all side events, there is no better way to chalk up those Planeswalker Points! A Sleep-In Special will be available (for a fee) allowing players with byes to have more snooze time on Saturday. Local and international dealers will be on hand to help with all your card-acquisition needs. 

Register for the main event and receive a Grand Prix Hong Kong exclusive playmat with art by Jung Park (while supplies last). What's more, Jung Park will be in attendance as the guest artist for signatures and sketches on cards, prints, proofs, and even the exclusive playmat!

 Come on down to Grand Prix Hong Kong for an amazing and unforgettable weekend of **Magic**! 

  

 *The **Magic: The Gathering** Grand Prix tournament series is a great reason to get out into the **Magic** tournament community, catch up with old friends, meet some new ones, and play some great **Magic**. Grand Prix tournaments are world-wide open events that allow all **Magic**  players to participate and experience the thrill of a large-scale competition. In addition to cash prizes, a high Planeswalker Points multiplier, and exclusive foil promo cards for participants, Grand Prix feature a host of other activities, including side events and artist signings (prizes subject to change).

* If 799 or less players register for the event, all players with an X-2-0 record (or better) or the top 64 players – whichever is greater – advance to the second day of competition for prizes and invitations.
* If 800 or more players register for the event, all players with an X-2-0 record (or better) or the top 128 players – whichever is greater – advance to the second day of competition for prizes and invitations.

* Top 8 matches will have no time limit.
* The Top 8 players will be seated randomly at the draft table immediately prior to drafting. The Top 8 bracket will be determined using this random seating.
* Where necessary, the standings after the Swiss rounds will still be used to determine final order in the standings.
* For the first game of each match in the Top 8, the player that finished higher in the Swiss rounds chooses either to play first or to play second. For subsequent games in each Top 8 match, the usual Play/Draw rule applies (loser of the previous game decides whether to play first in the next game).
