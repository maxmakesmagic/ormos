Tsuyoshi Fujita can't escape the Feature Match area this weekend. Not only is he a big wheel around these parts, but he's been facing some pretty high-profile competition. This round is no exception, as he squares off against the rebounding Katsuhiro Mori, in yet another red-white mirror.

### Game 1

![Astral Slide](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Astral+Slide)The first game was a mirror in every sense of the work. Both players matched turn three morphs, then unmorphed them and swung in. Then they both played [Astral Slide](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Astral+Slide)s. Then they both failed to do much of anything, other than cycling away cards. Eventually, Fujita added a [Lightning Rift](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Rift) to his side of the board, and then an [Eternal Dragon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eternal+Dragon). Mori cycled a [Starstorm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Starstorm) at end of turn, putting both the [Dragon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragon) and Angel in limbo, and then cleared the board with [Akroma's Vengeance](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Akroma%27s+Vengeance).Of course, Fujita was still in a favorable position. It got better with another [Astral Slide](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Astral+Slide). Another Vengeance got rid of them, but by now Fujita had enough mana to bring back his [Dragon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragon) and play it in the same turn. Mori stalled as best he could, playing out Rift and [Astral Slide](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Astral+Slide), and as soon as he hit ten mana he dropped the [Decree of Annihilation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Decree+of+Annihilation).

Both players pulled lands off the top for two turns. Mori's third draw was a [Chartooth Cougar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chartooth+Cougar), and when he cycled it he found he had no mountains left in his deck. Fujita hit four land in a row and then [Eternal Dragon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eternal+Dragon), and soon played [Akroma's Vengeance](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Akroma%27s+Vengeance) to put himself even more ahead. A Rift and [Silver Knight](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Silver+Knight) followed, and then he cemented victory with a cycled [Decree of Annihilation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Decree+of+Annihilation).

Fujita 1 â€“ Mori 0 

### Game 2

Mori was already mentally chalking up the win when Fujita had to go down to five cards. He played an angel face down, and waited on unmorphing it to add a [Silver Knight](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Silver+Knight) and [Lightning Rift](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Rift) to his board. Fujita played his fourth land and accepted six more to the face. Then he played [Temple of the False God](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Temple+of+the+False+God) and Vengeanced away the board.

No matter, Mori had a second Angel waiting. It wasn't good enough, as Fujita had a second Temple, letting him cast [Akroma, Angel of Wrath](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Akroma%2C+Angel+of+Wrath). Mori looked at his hand of two Akroma's and an [Astral Slide](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Astral+Slide) and hoped for the best. His next two draw steps were also [Astral Slide](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Astral+Slide)s, and then a [Decree of Annihilation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Decree+of+Annihilation). Bewildered, he started to fill out the match slip.

**Final Result:** Tsuyoshi Fujita defeats Katsuhiro Mori 2-0
