Once in a while, an alternate version of a card will be printed as part of a promotional giveaway.


This alternate art version of the *Urza's Destiny* common [Scent of Cinder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scent+of+Cinder), illustrated by Carl Critchlow, was created to be a giveaway in the now-defunct *Duelist* magazine. The card was included in every issue of Duelist #39, which was released in July 1999.


This alternate version was given a collector number of "96a/143."
