![Orb of Insight](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/features/2_orb.jpg)You peered into its depths prior to the release of *Eventide*, and now the Orb of Insight has returned for *Shards of Alara*! If you've never utilized the Orb before, you needn't fear, as it's relatively simple to use. Simply type in a word (or number) and the Orb will tell you how many times it appears on *Shards of Alara* cards. Flavor text isn't counted, and you *can* enter any type of mana costs and activation costs. For example, to search for ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227125855im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/white.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227125855im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/white.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161115194122im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/blue.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161115194122im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/blue.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161115194122im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/blue.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227195556im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/black.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227195556im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/black.gif), you’d type “WWUUUBB” in the Orb.

If you've got sufficient time on your hands and managed to enter every single word in the English language, *plus* all the words and mana costs in **Magic**, you could put together every single word in the set! Of course, there are probably going to be some *Shards of Alara*-specific words making their debut into the **Magic** lexicon this time around, so you'll need to enter every possible string of letters too (just to be safe...). At that point, it's just a simple matter of re-arranging all that data into the exact card text of all the cards in the set. If you hurry, you should be able to finish before the [Prerelease Events](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/events/prereleases)!

What *Shards of Alara* secrets will you be able to unveil? Only the Orb knows, so get to work! And of course, we'll see you back here on Wednesday, September 3 when the *Shards of Alara* Minisite debuts, followed by the official kickoff of *Shards of Alara* previews on Monday, September 8.
