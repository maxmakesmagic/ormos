25 years after the birth of *Magic*. The first team Pro Tour since 2006. The first time Legacy has even been a feature format at the Pro Tour. More than 400 players are here to compete for their slice of the million dollars being awarded over the course of the weekend.


Welcome to Pro Tour 25th Anniversary.


As you can imagine, players were more than a little excited to get to break out their [Underground Sea](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Underground+Sea)s, [Force of Will](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Force+of+Will)s, and [Wasteland](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wasteland)s, and in a wide-open metagame after [Deathrite Shaman](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deathrite+Shaman) and [Gitaxian Probe](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gitaxian+Probe) left the format no less.


What did players choose to bring to the most important Legacy tournament of their lives to date? Here's how the metagame broke down among the 165 players battling Legacy this weekend.




|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Archetype | Copies | Percentage of Field |
| Grixis Control | 20 | 12.12% |
| Sneak and Show | 16 | 9.70% |
| Eldrazi Stompy | 14 | 8.48% |
| Death and Taxes | 12 | 7.27% |
| Temur Delver | 11 | 6.67% |
| BR Reanimator | 9 | 5.45% |
| Miracles | 9 | 5.45% |
| UB Shadow | 9 | 5.45% |
| WU Stoneblade | 8 | 4.85% |
| Eldrazi Post | 7 | 4.24% |
| Mono-Red Prison | 7 | 4.24% |
| Grixis Delver | 6 | 3.64% |
| 4c Loam | 4 | 2.42% |
| Affinity | 4 | 2.42% |
| Infect | 4 | 2.42% |
| Grixis Shadow | 3 | 1.82% |
| Storm | 3 | 1.82% |
| Elves | 2 | 1.21% |
| Omni-Show | 2 | 1.21% |
| Sultai Midrange | 2 | 1.21% |
| UR Delver | 2 | 1.21% |
| WU Control | 2 | 1.21% |
| Aluren | 1 | 0.61% |
| Esper Control | 1 | 0.61% |
| Esper Stoneblade | 1 | 0.61% |
| Jeskai Control | 1 | 0.61% |
| Lands | 1 | 0.61% |
| Maverick | 1 | 0.61% |
| Merfolk | 1 | 0.61% |
| Turbo Depths | 1 | 0.61% |
| UB Reanimator | 1 | 0.61% |

As you can see from the full list, there's a lot of options available to players in Legacy, and no deck comprises more than 12% of the metagame. The top decks run the gamut from control to combo to aggro to tempo to ramp, a clear indication of why Legacy is such a beloved format among players. It's truly anything goes, and that's especially true at this event.


Of the decks listed, some have significant overlap. For instance, the Blue-Black Death's Shadow build that nine players sleeved up—and yes, this is Legacy and not Modern—also plays [Delver of Secrets](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Delver+of+Secrets), though it looks markedly different from Grixis Delver or Temur Delver, as players built their deck in a way to take advantage of [Death's Shadow](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Death%27s+Shadow)'s "drawback." Similarly, there are a few variants of Reanimator strategies.


With that in mind, let's see what the top of the metagame looks like with a bit more curation.




|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Archetype | Copies |
| Delver Decks | 28 |
| Grixis Control | 20 |
| Show and Tell Decks | 18 |
| Eldrazi Stompy | 14 |
| Death's Shadow Decks | 12 |
| Death and Taxes | 12 |
| Reanimator Decks | 10 |

We can also peel back to the highest level, with a few notes on methodology.


* Mono-Red Prison is listed with control decks.
* Eldrazi Post is listed with combo—it is aiming to ramp to [Ulamog, the Ceaseless Hunger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ulamog%2C+the+Ceaseless+Hunger), after all—even though it also plays a number of smaller creatures on the way up the chain.



|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Archetype | Copies | Percentage of Field |
| Aggro | 63 | 38.18% |
| Control | 56 | 33.94% |
| Combo Decks | 46 | 27.88% |

That's about as much balance—at least at the highest levels of classification—that players could hope for. And with so many decks able to adapt different roles depending on the matchup, it's clear the Legacy metagame is wide open despite weeks of the best players in the world testing the format for this tournament.


Some other takeaways from the data:


* Four-Color Control based around [Leovold, Emissary of Trest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leovold%2C+Emissary+of+Trest) has fallen largely out of favor. Realistically, these decks looked much like the Grixis Control decks in this tournament but splashed green for [Deathrite Shaman](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deathrite+Shaman) and Leovold. With [Deathrite Shaman](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deathrite+Shaman) no longer available to hold together the deck's fragile mana base, players have cut the green entirely and moved away from Leovold as a result.
* Sneak and Show is the most popular combo deck. With the metagame opening up, the consistent blue-red combo deck can deploy [Show and Tell](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Show+and+Tell) or [Sneak Attack](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sneak+Attack) into [Emrakul, the Aeons Torn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Emrakul%2C+the+Aeons+Torn) or [Griselbrand](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Griselbrand) extremely early, often backed up by countermagic. Access to [Force of Will](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Force+of+Will), [Flusterstorm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flusterstorm), and [Spell Pierce](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spell+Pierce) also means the deck has game against the rest of the combo decks, including Black-Red Reanimator.

* Speaking of Reanimator, the explosive black-red version is the most popular version, and the second most popular combo deck. With cards like [Unmask](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Unmask) to protect its own combo, the deck can reanimate a large creature—typically [Griselbrand](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Griselbrand)—as early as the first turn.
* Delver decks rule the roost, though there is plenty of disagreement over the best version of the deck. Most popular has been the return of "Canadian Threshold," a Temur-flavored Delver deck that uses cards like [Wasteland](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wasteland) and [Stifle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stifle) to keep opponents off mana while attacking with [Delver of Secrets](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Delver+of+Secrets) or [Nimble Mongoose](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nimble+Mongoose). Other players chose to use the traditional Grixis version of the deck, while some have a much more aggressive version using [Price of Progress](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Price+of+Progress) and other burn spells to back up the bug.
* "Fair" strategies are well-represented. Eldrazi Aggro and Death and Taxes were the third and fourth most popular choices, respectively. Both use a suite of disruptive spells—[Chalice of the Void](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chalice+of+the+Void) or [Thalia, Guardian of Thraben](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thalia%2C+Guardian+of+Thraben) are the signature cards—to keep opponents from executing their game plan while presenting a clock to end the game.
* [Brightling](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brightling) has been a standout in Death and Taxes. The *Battlebond* addition gives the deck another versatile threat that play very well with [Æther Vial](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=%C3%86ther+Vial). But it's the not the only *Battlebond* card finding a home, as [Arcane Artisan](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arcane+Artisan) has given Sneak and Show decks a sideboard option that beats most of the popular hate cards typically sideboarded in against it, including [Containment Priest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Containment+Priest).

[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Brightling)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brightling)
* The most surprising deck of the weekend takes a page from Modern—Death's Shadow. A dozen players are playing the format's largest one mana threat, and the innovative blue-black shell surrounding it includes some unexpected ways to reduce their life total, the most striking being more [Watery Grave](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Watery+Grave)s than [Underground Sea](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Underground+Sea)s.
* There are plenty of other strategies represented. Miracles is the second most popular control deck, even long after losing the former lynchpin of the deck in [Sensei's Divining Top](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sensei%27s+Divining+Top). Further down the list, players showed up with a host of decks, including Mon-Red Prison, Infect, Aluren combo, Merfolk, and even Maverick. While some noise will be created due to the team nature of this event, the Legacy metagame is as diverse as it's ever been.
