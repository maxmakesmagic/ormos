B*etrayers of Kamigawa's* 
**[That Which Was Taken](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=That+Which+Was+Taken)** represents the kami child of [O-Kagachi](/en/articles/archive/stentorian-roar-2005-02-08), the theft of which began the mortals' war with the kami. The wording you see on the card -- and even wording you *don't* see -- was chosen very carefully. 

![That Which Was Taken](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=That+Which+Was+Taken) It was brought up during development that [That Which Was Taken](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=That+Which+Was+Taken) can leave stranded divinity counters on permanents. You could play its ability to add a counter to your [Lantern Kami](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lantern+Kami), for example, and then your opponent might [Naturalize](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Naturalize)[That Which Was Taken](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=That+Which+Was+Taken). The [Lantern Kami](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lantern+Kami) would still have a divinity counter on it, but without [That Which Was Taken](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=That+Which+Was+Taken) around to provide the *significance* of divinity counters, the Kami would not be indestructible anymore. And who wants the board cluttered up with meaningless divinity counters? Why should that counter even stick around? 

A few counter-granting cards, such as [Mine Layer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mine+Layer) and [Aurification](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aurification), actually remove their counters when they leave play, to solve this problem.

However, the *Betrayers* development team did not want to include a similar clause on [That Which Was Taken](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=That+Which+Was+Taken). Why? So that the card wouldn't have a bizarre, unflavorful interaction with the [Myojin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/default.asp?first=1&last=100&term=myojin&Field_Name=on&Field_Rules=on&Field_Type=on&setfilter=ChampionsofKamigawa&colorfilter=All&output=summary&sort=name&x=36&y=26)! It wouldn't make much sense that destroying or bouncing [That Which Was Taken](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=That+Which+Was+Taken) would suddenly, unintentionally steal away the divinity counters of godlike kami.
