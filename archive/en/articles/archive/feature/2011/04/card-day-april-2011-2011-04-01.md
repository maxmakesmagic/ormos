Card of the Day - April, 2011
=============================



 Posted in **Feature**
 on April 1, 2011

By Wizards of the Coast











![Phyrexia's Core](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Phyrexia%27s+Core)**[Phyrexia's Core](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phyrexia%27s+Core)** – *New Phyrexia* uncommon. [Phyrexia's Core](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phyrexia%27s+Core) shows how deeply the Phyrexians have spread: even [Mirrodin's Core](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mirrodin%27s+Core) (from *Darksteel*) has been converted.
 ![243460](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&multiverseid=243460)**[Forest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=243460)** – *Duel Decks: Knights vs. Dragons* basic land. The Forests in Duel Decks products have all been seen before. But in *Duel Decks: Knights vs. Dragons*, the art by [Scott Bailey](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=243460) and [Mike Ploog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=243461) isn't from an expansion. Instead, they're the "European Lands" from back in 2000. They got a second run in [in 2008](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/TCG/events.aspx?x=events/fnm/euroland08).
 ![4622](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&multiverseid=4622)**[Phyrexian Hulk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=4622)** – *Tempest* uncommon. Phyrexians seem prone to creating 5/4 vanilla artifact creatures. The standard [Phyrexian Hulk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phyrexian+Hulk) originally appeared in *Tempest* and it returns in *New Phyrexia*.
 ![201816](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&multiverseid=201816)**[Enslave](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=201816)** – *Planar Chaos* uncommon. The *Planar Chaos* art for [Enslave](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Enslave) shows a black-aligned wizard taking control of a red-aligned dragon. And if you look at [the wallpaper-sized art](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/magazine/article.aspx?x=mtgcom/arcana/1247), you can see some fascinating black slime oozing from the dragon's eyes. Weird!
 ![63](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&multiverseid=63)**[Evil Presence](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=63)** – *Limited Edition Alpha* uncommon. [Evil Presence](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Evil+Presence) was a part of **Magic** from its very first core set, and it stuck around through *Fifth Edition*. And except for a brief cameo in *Masters Edition III*, it hasn't been seen since then. Until *New Phyrexia*, which brings it back! Note that this should not be confused with the [2008 holiday promo card](/en/articles/archive/evil-presents-2009-01-06).
 ![983](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&multiverseid=983)**[Mountain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=983)** – *Arabian Nights* basic land. To fill out the sheet, [Mountain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=983) was added to *Arabian Nights*. Consequently, "Mountain" is the most common basic land, but "*Arabian Nights* Mountain" is the *least* common. Unless you want to figure out what various Theme Decks, Intro Packs, Event Decks, and Duel Decks have done to the overall basic land count.
 ![Shared Triumph](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Shared+Triumph)**[Shared Triumph](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shared+Triumph)** – *Onslaught* rare. [Shared Triumph](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shared+Triumph) could have been in *Ninth Edition*, but it was up against [Glorious Anthem](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glorious+Anthem) in the [player vote](/en/articles/archive/selecting-ninth-edition-week-14-2004-09-13). And now nobody even remembers that [Shared Triumph](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shared+Triumph) exists. Such are the vagaries of fate.
 ![Ruham Djinn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Ruham+Djinn)**[Ruham Djinn](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ruham+Djinn)** – *Invasion* uncommon. Not counting [changelings](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?text=+%5Bchangeling%5D), [Ruham Djinn](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ruham+Djinn) is the only white Djinn in **Magic**. That makes it the only Djinn that would normally cohabitate with known Djinn-hater [King Suleiman](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=King+Suleiman).
 ![Common Cause](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Common+Cause)**[Common Cause](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Common+Cause)** – *Mercadian Masques* rare. There are two cards with the word "common" in their names: [Common Cause](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Common+Cause) and [Common Courtesy](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Common+Courtesy). One is rare and one is uncommon. That seems weird.
 ![Rare-B-Gone](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Rare-B-Gone)**[Rare-B-Gone](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rare-B-Gone)** – *Unhinged* rare. [Rare-B-Gone](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rare-B-Gone) was printed before mythic rares existed, but *Un*-Rules Manager Mark Rosewater has ruled that it affects them just like it does regular rares.
 ![97045](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&multiverseid=97045)**[Giant Badger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=97045)** – HarperPrism Book Insert. [Giant Badger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=97045) was one of five cards available by mailing in a coupon found in the back of a **Magic** novel. [Giant Badger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=45425) got reprinted in *Eighth Edition*, which finally relieved the massive Badger-related demand.
 ![11](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&multiverseid=11)**[Cyclopean Tomb](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=11)** – *Limited Edition Alpha* rare. One of the more confusing cards in *Alpha* was [Cyclopean Tomb](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=11), which was printed without a mana cost. In its [*Beta* printing](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=306), it got its proper cost of ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20160830042801im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless4.gif).
 ![200694](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&multiverseid=200694)**[Familiar chacal](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=200694)** – ***Magic** 2010* common. The Spanish printing of [Jackal Familiar](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jackal+Familiar) has a translation mistake on it. It says, "El Familiar chacal no puede atacar ni bloquear," which translates as, "Jackal Familiar can't attack or block." It should say that [Jackal Familiar](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jackal+Familiar) can't attack or block *alone*.
 ![2133](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&multiverseid=2133)**[Unholy Strength](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=2133)** – *Fourth Edition* common. The background of the *Fourth Edition* printing of [Unholy Strength](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=2133) is strangely empty. This is because they took out the pentagram that was visible in the [Revised (*Third Edition*) printing](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=1183).
 ![3783](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&multiverseid=3783)**[Flying Carpet](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=3783)** – *Fifth Edition* rare. The final sentence of [Flying Carpet](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flying+Carpet), from *Arabian Nights* through *Fifth Edition*, destroyed it if its target went to the graveyard. For the [*Sixth Edition* printing](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=14776), that mysteriously vanished.
 ![Phyrexian Juggernaut](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Phyrexian+Juggernaut)**[Phyrexian Juggernaut](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phyrexian+Juggernaut)** – *Mirrodin Besieged* uncommon. It seems like every culture creates its own Juggernaut. There's the original [Juggernaut](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Juggernaut), which is probably Dominarian. There's [Otarian Juggernaut](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Otarian+Juggernaut). Even the Mirrans had their own [Darksteel Juggernaut](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Darksteel+Juggernaut). When the Phyrexians mounted their invasion of Mirrodin, they soon corrupted the idea to come up with [Phyrexian Juggernaut](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phyrexian+Juggernaut).
 ![Phyrexian Grimoire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Phyrexian+Grimoire)**[Phyrexian Grimoire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phyrexian+Grimoire)** – *Tempest* rare. Although most tournament formats allow you to rearrange your graveyard as much as you like, Eternal formats like Vintage and Legacy still require you to keep the cards where they were originally placed. Why? Cards like [Nether Shadow](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nether+Shadow) and [Phyrexian Grimoire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phyrexian+Grimoire), that's why. Well, mostly the Shadow.
 ![Phyrexian Walker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Phyrexian+Walker)**[Phyrexian Walker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phyrexian+Walker)** – *Visions* common. [Phyrexian Walker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phyrexian+Walker) was the sixth creature in **Magic** history to cost zero mana, after [Ornithopter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ornithopter), [Crimson Kobolds](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crimson+Kobolds), [Crookshank Kobolds](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crookshank+Kobolds), [Kobolds of Kher Keep](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kobolds+of+Kher+Keep), and [Shield Sphere](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shield+Sphere). Since then, [Dryad Arbor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dryad+Arbor) and [Memnite](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Memnite) have joined the list.
 ![Phyrexian Dreadnought](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Phyrexian+Dreadnought)**[Phyrexian Dreadnought](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phyrexian+Dreadnought)** – *Mirage* rare. If you squint, you can see a little, tiny human wizard in the lower right corner of the art for [Phyrexian Dreadnought](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phyrexian+Dreadnought). But why squint? Just check out [this Arcana from 2003](/en/articles/archive/art-close-phyrexian-dreadnought-2003-04-14)!
 ![Gate to Phyrexia](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Gate+to+Phyrexia)**[Gate to Phyrexia](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gate+to+Phyrexia)** – *Antiquities* uncommon. When Phyrexia was first introduced in *Antiquities*, it was in the form of two cards: [Gate to Phyrexia](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gate+to+Phyrexia) and [Phyrexian Gremlins](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phyrexian+Gremlins). Even back in 1994, the Phyrexians were working against artifacts!
 ![Card of the Day](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/arcana/0401cardoftheday.jpg)  
**April 1, 2011** – *Gregorian Calendar* day. This day marked the 91st anniversary of the birth of Toshirō Mifune. April 1 is normally the 91st day of the year, although leap years push it to 92nd. In 2011, it appeared on a Friday, which is one of the seven possibilities. In some parts of the world, the weather was very pleasant, although it was less so elsewhere.
