There are several changes to cards occurring with the release of *Streets of New Capenna*. You can find the official text of any card on [Gatherer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/).


Hideaway
--------


The rules for hideaway have changed with the release of this set, and six older cards with the hideaway ability have changed to preserve their original functionality. Specifically, older cards which had the hideaway ability with no numeral after the word have received errata to have "Hideaway 4" and the additional ability "[This permanent] enters the battlefield tapped." This change affects six cards.


"If that spell would be put into a graveyard"
---------------------------------------------


Some cards allow a player to cast an instant or sorcery spell and have the instruction "if that spell would be put into a graveyard this turn, exile it instead." Since it isn't possible for a spell cast this way to go to a graveyard on a future turn, the words "this turn" are extraneous, and have been dropped. These cards now say, "if that spell would be put into a graveyard, exile it instead." This nonfunctional change affects fifteen cards.


Denry Klin, Editor in Chief
---------------------------

This card was printed with a nonstandard template that referred to when a "creature you control enters the battlefield" and was slightly ambiguous about the counters it was referring to. It has received a nonfunctional update to be clearer on both of these points. This is not a functional change.


**Denry Kiln, Editor in Chief's old text**:  

Denry Klin, Editor in Chief enters the battlefield with your choice of a +1/+1, first strike, or vigilance counter on it.


Whenever a nontoken creature you control enters the battlefield, if Denry has counters on it, put the same number and kind of counters on that creature.


**Denry Klin, Editor in Chief's new text**:  

Denry Klin, Editor in Chief enters the battlefield with your choice of a +1/+1, first strike, or vigilance counter on it.


Whenever a nontoken creature enters the battlefield under your control, if Denry has counters on it, put the same number of each kind of counter on that creature.


Flames of the Blood Hand
------------------------

Some time ago, a rule was removed from the game that allowed players to "redirect" damage to planeswalkers, and instead spells that deal damage may directly target planeswalkers. Many cards received an update to account for this rules change. [Flames of the Blood Hand](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flames+of+the+Blood+Hand) was part of this update, but its new words referred to "that player" in a way that was ambiguous if it was cast targeting a planeswalker. It has received an additional nonfunctional update to be clearer.


**Flames of the Blood Hand's old text:**  

Flames of the Blood Hand deals 4 damage to target player or planeswalker. The damage can't be prevented. If that player would gain life this turn, that player gains no life instead.


**Flames of the Blood Hand's new text:**  

Flames of the Blood Hand deals 4 damage to target player or planeswalker. The damage can't be prevented. If that player or that planeswalker's controller would gain life this turn, that player gains no life instead.


Palliation Accord
-----------------


[![](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Palliation+Accord)](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Palliation+Accord)
With the release of *Streets of New Capenna*, shield counters have been added to the game and rules have defined what a shield counter means. One older card, [Palliation Accord](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Palliation+Accord), put shield counters on itself. In order to avoid introducing unintended functionality to this older card, it has received errata to use "palliation counters" instead.


**Palliation Accord's old text:**  

Whenever a creature an opponent controls becomes tapped, put a shield counter on Palliation Accord.


Remove a shield counter from Palliation Accord: Prevent the next 1 damage that would be dealt to you this turn.


**Palliation Accord's new text:**  

Whenever a creature an opponent controls becomes tapped, put a palliation counter on Palliation Accord.


Remove a palliation counter from Palliation Accord: Prevent the next 1 damage that would be dealt to you this turn.
