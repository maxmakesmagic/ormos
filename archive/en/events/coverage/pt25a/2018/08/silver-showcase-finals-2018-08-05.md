Both Stanislav Cifka and Jason "Amaz" Chan have had to topple some of *Magic*'s brightest names to ever grace the Pro Tour Hall of Fame to make it to the Silver Showcase finals this morning, with Amaz besting one of the all-time greatest players, Paulo Vitor Damo da Rosa without the help of his trusty [Shivan Dragon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shivan+Dragon), and Cifka defeating *the* best player of all time, Jon Finkel, with a huge [Mind Twist](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mind+Twist) wiping out Finkel's hand.


Game 1 of the Finals started relatively slowly, with Amaz going large on the ground with an [Unholy Strength](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Unholy+Strength) on his [Ironroot Treefolk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ironroot+Treefolk), but he had to run it into back to back [Rukh Egg](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rukh+Egg)s from Cifka. Amaz found a [Lure](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lure) to allow him to force through some damage, but with Cifka's Eggs already broken, and a [Pestilence](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pestilence) upon the board, Amaz was losing the race to the Bird tokens. Cifka expertly dealt out the last few doses of [Pestilence](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pestilence) to end the game with himself at 1 life, and Amaz at 0.

Cifka got off to a blistering start in Game 2, deploying several creatures before Amaz could summon his first, a [Moss Monster](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Moss+Monster). Cifka continued pushing his creatures at Amaz, and the [Moss Monster](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Moss+Monster) could only eat one of them at a time, with the rest of them chipping Amaz's life total lower and lower. Amaz continued to play creatures, and again found his [Lure](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lure) and an [Unholy Strength](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Unholy+Strength), which suddenly allowed him to flip the damage race on its head, and surprising Cifka with a [Howl from Beyond](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Howl+from+Beyond) to steal victory from the beaks of defeat.

Cifka got some early damage in with [Hasran Ogress](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hasran+Ogress) in Game 3 while Amaz summoned a [Cuombajj Witches](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cuombajj+Witches) and a [Pestilence](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pestilence) to fend off the Ogress. Cifka laid a [Rukh Egg](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rukh+Egg), and then another, and looking to capitalize on the early damage from his Ogress, cracked open one of his Eggs with a [Terror](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Terror). An [Ashnod's Altar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ashnod%27s+Altar) allowed him to open the second, and Amaz had nowhere he could hide from the 4/4 tokens.

Amaz sideboarded out his black cards in Game 4 to make room for [Karma](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Karma), hoping to attack Cifka on an axis he wouldn't be able to contend with. Cifka struggled to make his early land drops, and Amaz exacerbated the issue with an [Ice Storm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ice+Storm), giving him the room to gain value from [Jayemdae Tome](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jayemdae+Tome) before landing his star player: [Shivan Dragon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shivan+Dragon).


Stranded with only Swamps, Cifka was at least holding a [Terror](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Terror) for the Dragon, and had managed to play [Pestilence](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pestilence) alongside a [Walking Dead](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Walking+Dead). The [Walking Dead](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Walking+Dead)'s regeneration meant the [Pestilence](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pestilence) was persisting, allowing Cifka to mop up anything Amaz could dig up with his Tome, and give him time to find a Mountain so he could summon one of his trusty [Rukh Egg](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rukh+Egg)s. Amaz frantically flicked through his Tome for an answer, but he couldn't deal with both Cifka's [Pestilence](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pestilence) and Bird Token and soon found himself extending his hand to congratulate Stanislav Cifka, the winner of the *Magic: The Gathering* 25th Anniversary Silver Showcase!
