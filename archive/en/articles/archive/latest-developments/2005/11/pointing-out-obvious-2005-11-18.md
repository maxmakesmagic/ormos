I've been having a good time with *Magic* lately. You might think that because working on *Magic* is my job that I always have a good time with it. But that's not entirely true—anything has its ups and downs, and sometimes being too close to the game drives me away for a time. But not lately.



![](https://media.wizards.com/legacy/global/images/mtgcom_daily_af93_picmain_en.jpg)
Last weekend I played in a “draft marathon” at a local card shop, in which I drafted the full *Invasion* block, the full *Odyssey* block, the full *Mirrodin* block, and then *Ravnica*. Although I didn't do well enough to make the top 8 (I'm gradually losing my competitive focus), I still had a ball. At work, on top of developing the upcoming “Snap” set and starting up design for the block after *that*, I've been working on the theme decks for the upcoming *Coldsnap* expansion, which are quite a trip down memory lane. The [first-ever Legacy Grand Prix](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Events.aspx?x=mtgevent/gpphi05/welcome)—something I've been pushing for personally for a long time—was a fantastic event. I'm making arrangements to attend Worlds in Japan in a couple weeks. And my old pal John Rizzo has resurfaced over at StarCityGames.



Fun times indeed. A perfect time, then, to have my readers do something fun as well.


At the draft marathon, several of the players were telling me that they enjoyed *Ravnica* Limited so much because so many of the cards were hard to evaluate correctly in Limited. That got me thinking. Then I read that Scott Wills was leaving this site, so I started perusing his archive. And that also got me thinking. Then I had to turn in my Limited pointing results for Snap to Matt Place, and that *really* got me thinking. Why not do another Limited pointing article?


What is Limited pointing? It's a way for *Magic* developers to gauge the power level of individual colors for both sealed deck and draft. Each developer assigns a number to each card based on how powerful he perceives it to be, then those numbers are averaged and analyzed in an attempt to balance things out. Here's a snippet from the relevant section of our Developer's Handbook explaining the scale we use:



> 
> *…[H]ere is the fundamental definition of our rating: Given that this is the first card you see (of your 75-card sealed deck or first pack, first pick in draft), how happy are you – on a scale of 0.0 - 5.0 – to see it? Furthermore, your ratings should be linear (that is, you'd be just as happy with a 3.5 and a 2.5 or with two 3.0's). Also, to be technically correct, this all assumes that your goal is to win – winning makes you “happy.”*
> 
> 
> *The following elaborations of this scale are merely guidelines, designed to clarify the scale defined above:*
> 
> 
> 
> ![](https://media.wizards.com/legacy/global/images/mtgcom_daily_af93_pic1_en.jpg)
> ***5.0**: I will always play this card. Period.*
> 
> ***4.5**: I will almost always play this card, regardless of what else I get.*
> 
> 
> ***4.0**: I will strongly consider playing this as the only card of its color.*
> 
> 
> ***3.5**: I feel a strong pull into this card's color.*
> 
> 
> ***3.0**: This card makes me want to play this color. (Given that I'm playing that color, I will play this card 100% of the time.)*
> 
> 
> ***2.5**: Several cards of this power level start to pull me into this color. If playing that color, I essentially always play these. (Given that I'm playing that color, I will play this card 90% of the time.)*
> 
> 
> ***2.0**: If I'm playing this color, I usually play these. (70%)*
> 
> 
> ***1.5**: This card will make the cut into the main deck about half the times I play this color. (50%)*
> 
> 
> ***1.0**: I feel bad when this card is in my main deck. (30%)*
> 
> 
> ***0.5**: There are situations where I might sideboard this into my deck, but I'll never start it. (10%)*
> 
> 
> ***0.0**: I will never put this card into my deck (main deck or after sideboarding). (0%)*
> 
> 
> 


Here are some examples from the recent *Kamigawa* block to help you understand the scale.


* [Umezawa's Jitte](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Umezawa%27s+Jitte) – 5.0. Always played, always first picked, always ridiculous.
* [Meloku the Clouded Mirror](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Meloku+the+Clouded+Mirror) – 4.0. You can easily imagine playing Meloku as your only blue card in a sealed deck, and being very happy doing so.
* [Kokusho, the Evening Star](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kokusho%2C+the+Evening+Star) – 3.5. He makes you want to play black, and you'll always run him if you are black.
* [Glacial Ray](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glacial+Ray) – 2.75. Some people may point it even higher than this.
* [Mothrider Samurai](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mothrider+Samurai) – 1.75. There are times when you'd play white and not run this guy, but they're rare.
* [Sakura-Tribe Scout](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sakura-Tribe+Scout) – 0.75. You don't want to play this guy, but it happens.
* [One with Nothing](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=One+with+Nothing) – 0.0. ‘Nuff said.


Got it? Now it's your turn. Take a look at the cards below, then enter your results into the Limited Pointing Survey.



We'll start off with a chunk of blue commons. Take a look at this list and come up with a rating for each one:


* [Stasis Cell](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stasis+Cell)
* [Surveilling Sprite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Surveilling+Sprite)
* [Tattered Drake](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tattered+Drake)
* [Terraformer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Terraformer)
* [Tidewater Minion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tidewater+Minion)
* [Vedalken Dismisser](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vedalken+Dismisser)


Next up are gold uncommons, which, as a whole, may be the most powerful group of Limited cards in the set. Where do these rate?



* [Lightning Helix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Helix)
* [Moroii](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Moroii)
* [Pollenbright Wings](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pollenbright+Wings)
* [Psychic Drain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psychic+Drain)
* [Putrefy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Putrefy)
* [Selesnya Sagittars](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Selesnya+Sagittars)


Finally, here are some black rares. Rares are interesting, as they are often hit-or-miss in Limited. Just how good are these six?



* [Blood Funnel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Funnel)
* [Dark Confidant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dark+Confidant)
* [Empty the Catacombs](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Empty+the+Catacombs)
* [Helldozer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Helldozer)
* [Hex](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hex)
* [Hunted Horror](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hunted+Horror)


You can click [here](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/daily/af93#poll) to enter your results in the Limited Pointing Survey. I'll compile the results, then compare the readers vs. R&D in a future article. Have fun!



### Last Week's Poll





|  |
| --- |
| **Which is the better draft format in general?**  |
| Big set / small set 1 / small set 2 | 3520 | 42.1% |
| Big set / big set / big set | 2998 | 35.9% |
| I don't draft | 1511 | 18.1% |
| Neither | 331 | 4.0% |
| **Total** | **8360** | **100.0%** |


That's my pick as well. This has been an ongoing argument here in R&D as we talk with Organized Play about scheduling future events.
