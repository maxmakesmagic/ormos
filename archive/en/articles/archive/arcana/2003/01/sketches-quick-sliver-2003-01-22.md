This week's "Sketches" looks at one of the new Slivers that you may run into at this weekend's prerelease, [Quick Sliver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Quick+Sliver) by John Avon. John, as you may know, usually illustrates land cards; let's see how his style translates to a creature.

### 1. Art Description

These are the instructions given to the artist:

"Color: Green  
 Location: green forest setting  
 Action: Show a Sliver that appears to be materializing, half visible, half transparent, in a green forest setting."

### 2. Sketch

This is the preliminary sketch submitted by John.

There were a couple of small problems. One, Slivers only have one "arm," and John drew two. Two, the other creatures in the background made the Sliver look too large by comparison; it is, after all, only a 1/1.

### 3. Final Art

Here is a large version of the final piece. The number of "arms" is correct, and the creatures in the background have been removed.

### 4. Card

Finally, here is the card as you'll see it at the prerelease.
