As we return to the metallic plane of Mirrodin, it comes as no surprise that we see some old friends. And it also comes as no surprise that those old friends look a little different. There are other things that *do* come as surprises, but they're not what we're talking about today. Today, we're talking about the Mana Myr from *Mirrodin*, and specifically what they look like now.

For each of the Myr, we'll show what they looked like back in *Mirrodin*, then we'll look at what they look like now. They've all changed while we were away, although some have changed more than others.
