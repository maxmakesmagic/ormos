**Pot o' Gold Events**


The Pot o' Gold Saint Patrick's Day Event answers the age old question of what's at the end of the rainbow once and for all. Turns out, it's three Phantom *Alara Reborn* booster packs and all of the fixin's for a Draft. Weird, huh?


Stop by *Magic Online* from Friday, March 13, through the Wednesday, March 18, downtime to participate in the Pot o' Gold Event. Don't worry about wearing green either; thanks to the magic of the internet, no one will be able to pinch you for wearing other colors.

Behold, the list of competitors!
