### Game 1


Farid starts off with a mulligan but still manages turn 2 and 3 [Silver Knight](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Silver+Knight)s. Olivier has a morph on his second turn thanks to [Birds of Paradise](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Birds+of+Paradise). When Farid declares attackers Olivier tries to convince Farid that his morph is a Zombie Cuthroat. Farid doesn't buy it though and still attacks.


Things start to look bad for Farid as he stalls on 3 lands while Olivier develops his mana with 2 [Solemn Simulacrum](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Solemn+Simulacrum)s and unmorphs a [Bane of the Living](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bane+of+the+Living) (x=0) end of turn. Some turns later Farid still hasn't drawn his 4th land for the [Wrath of God](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wrath+of+God) he's holding so on to game 2.


1-0 Olivier


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gpbru04/fm6_2.jpg)Game 2 Farid started with a turn 2 Talisman although he's holding a pair of [Silver Knight](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Silver+Knight)s as well. His plan is to first play a [Wrath of God](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wrath+of+God) to clear Olivier's board and then play the Knights. He gets punished for that as Olivier plays a turn 3 [Persecute](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Persecute) naming white. This removes Farid's entire hand except for an [Island](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island). As if this wasn't enough Olivier drew 5 cards 2 turns later with double Skullclamp and a [Solemn Simulacrum](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Solemn+Simulacrum). Down in lands, creatures and with no cards in hand Farid is forced to concede to his fellow countryman and friend.


Olivier Ruel beats Farid Merahgni 2-0
