*Theros*  Event Dates  
(all times are Pacific Time)
* **Digital Release:** October 7, 2013
* **Release Events End:** October 23, 2013
* **Constructed Qualifiers:** January 8, 2014, @12 AM

Now that *Theros*  has officially launched on **Magic Online**, we're very excited to tell you about the two new *Theros*  Championship events. We want to really make this a big deal--it is a championship, after all! We are introducing both a *Theros*  Limited Championship and a *Theros*  Standard Constructed Championship, happening in the weeks before *Born of the Gods*  is released. Both of these championships will have dedicated qualifier events during the week leading up to them. We'll also be awarding more prizes to the top finishers and to more players overall. After the events conclude, we'll then celebrate top finishers and their decklists on a *Theros*  Championship web page!

What's New for Championships
----------------------------


As we mentioned in the [*Theros*  Prerelease and Release Events article](/en/articles/archive/magic-online-theros-prerelease-and-release-events-2013-09-16-0), we're scheduling championships at the end of new card-set cycles. Now, players will have time to learn the new cards, try out synergies, and refine their favorite strategies throughout the cycle, and then put all of that knowledge to the test during the championship events!


Prize awards have expanded so more players can win booster packs. We've pushed the threshold for those who win packs from 64th place all the way down to 128th place, awarding a total of 1,000 booster packs in each championship event. Top 8 finishers will receive booster packs in addition to complete set prizes! Plus, Top 8 finishers in the championship events will now receive enough Qualifier Points to qualify for **Magic Online**  Championship Series preliminary events.


After the *Theros*  Championship concludes, we will feature the winners and their decks on a dedicated web page on MTGOnline.com.


So start honing your *Theros*  **Magic**  acumen, because the *Theros*  Championship will be here before you know it!
