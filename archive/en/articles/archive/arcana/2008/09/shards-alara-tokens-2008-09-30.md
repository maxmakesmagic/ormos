If you open a *Shards of Alara* pack, you might see a token card in there. And perhaps you would like to know now what kind of token you might see, if you were to be so lucky. If so, then you are indeed fortunate, for today is the day that we show them to you. Well, five of them. We're saving the other five for tomorrow. And there will be a special bonus tomorrow too.


Okay, hit it!

First up, we have a noble 1/1 Soldier token, waiting to be called into action by [Elspeth, Knight-Errant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elspeth%2C+Knight-Errant) or [Knight-Captain of Eos](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Knight-Captain+of+Eos).

Our second contestant is a creation of Esper's [Puppet Conjurer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Puppet+Conjurer). Say hello to a 0/1 blue artifact creature named "Homunculus". He enjoys volleyball and Jazzercise.

Yikes! A skeleton, and it regenerates! This will come in handy the next time you [Skeletonize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skeletonize) something.

Welcome to Jund! This Dragon token indicates that either [Broodmate Dragon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Broodmate+Dragon) or [Sarkhan Vol](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sarkhan+Vol) is around here somewhere.

Ah! A multicolored 8/8 Beast. This is clearly the spawn of [Godsire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Godsire), which makes it... something you don't want to mess with, probably.


Come back tomorrow for the other five, plus a special bonus!
