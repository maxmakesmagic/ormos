Build Notes
-----------


* [Bolas's Citadel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bolas%27s+Citadel), [As Foretold](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=As+Foretold), and other cards that allow casting spells without paying their mana cost can once again allow players to cast X spells. (Please note that per rule 107.3b in the Comprehensive Rules that in these circumstances X must be 0.)
* [Containment Priest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Containment+Priest)'s ability now correctly only applies to creatures entering the battlefield without being cast if [Containment Priest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Containment+Priest) is already on the battlefield. Notably, casting [Exhume](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Exhume) and returning a [Containment Priest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Containment+Priest) will no longer exile the other creature returned.
* [Conclave Mentor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Conclave+Mentor)'s replacement effect will no longer apply to itself and give itself an extra counter if an effect would cause it to enter with one (e.g. [Renata, Called to the Hunt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Renata%2C+Called+to+the+Hunt)).
