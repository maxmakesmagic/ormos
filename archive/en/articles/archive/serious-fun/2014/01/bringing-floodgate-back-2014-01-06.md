 Bruce's games invariably involve several friends, crazy plays, and many laughs. Bruce believes that if anyone at your table isn't having fun, then you are doing it wrong. 





Several weeks ago, two readers requested an article about underplayed or forgotten cards. I love writing these types of articles, since I usually go through my collection to find good cards that I haven't seen in a deck in a while. It inspires me to put together some new decks or reminds me of old decks that would really benefit from some new cards. 

 This time was different. I put out the request on Twitter to hear your nominations for underplayed cards, with a focus on cards that are a little older. The response was great! Brandon Isleib, a friend and [writer at GatheringMagic.com](http://www.gatheringmagic.com/author/brandonisleib/), emailed an entire list of cards. These are cards that some of my newer readers will be seeing for the first time, and will hopefully bring a smile to the veterans who remember these cards from a while ago.
