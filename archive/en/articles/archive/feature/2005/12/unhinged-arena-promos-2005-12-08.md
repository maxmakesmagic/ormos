 As we've seen in [past](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/arcana/688)  [Arcanas](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/arcana/879), the *Unhinged* set resurrected some of the ideas of the never-released set *Unglued 2*, but a lot of art was still commissioned for *Unglued 2* and never used.


The [Arena League](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=arena) found a handy use for some of that art -- a set of *Unhinged* promotional cards featuring the original *Unglued 2* art. These cards were in the *Unglued 2* design file and made it to print in *Unhinged*. There's even alternate flavor text on four of them. Check it out.
