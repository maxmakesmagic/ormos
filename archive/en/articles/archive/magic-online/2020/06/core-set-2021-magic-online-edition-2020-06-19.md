Core Set 2021: Magic Online Edition

The world is in rough shape right now. Between the pandemic and the global protests for justice, it's a hard time for a lot of folks. So, if you could use some escapism, and a fun new thing to take your mind off of, well . . . \*gestures at the world\* . . . you're in luck. It's time for another new set on *Magic Online*, and *Core Set 2021* promises to be an exciting one.


Events start a few days later, but we're going into downtime on Tuesday, June 23 to push the new build live. Yes, you read that right: this time we've got a Tuesday downtime instead of Wednesday. As usual, we're planning to start around 9 a.m. Pacific time (UTC-7) and come back up by noon. When we come back up, a few things will be different:


* Everything in M21 will have its legality updated. This is true for every set, but it's worth calling out here because not every set has [Solemn Simulacrum](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Solemn+Simulacrum), [Containment Priest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Containment+Priest), and other high-power reprints sure to affect Standard, Pioneer, and Modern.
* The Treasure Chests will be updated. You can see the new Treasure Chest contents [here](https://magic.wizards.com/en/MTGO/articles/archive/magic-online/treasure-chest-card-list-info) on Monday, June 22. All Treasure Chests will open based on the new collation once we're up from downtime, no matter when they were earned.
* In the previously announced alternative play schedule from the *Ikoria*: *Lair of Behemoths* article, *Legacy Cube* was slated to end with the launch of M21. However, as you'll see, *Legacy Cube* will still be around. The simple reason is that, well, it worked pretty well last time. We kept the then-current cube up through *Ikoria* launch weekend, and that went well. So, we're going to do that again and keep *Legacy Cube* up through July 1. Cube fans may rejoice.

*Core Set 2021* Redemption Schedule
-----------------------------------


* *Core Set 2021* will be available for redemption beginning July 22.
* The *Core Set 2021* redemption guarantee ends October 7.
* *Core Set 2021* redemption will end on November 11.

*Core Set 2021* Avatars
=======================


Unlike last season, in which *Ikoria* demanded a record number of avatars, there are only five avatars to collect in M21 season.


Three Prestige Avatars will be granted at the end of the season based on the number of trophies won in leagues. Players get five points for every Competitive trophy and one point for every Friendly trophy. Then, all players with five or more points gets the uncommon silver-border Basri Ket avatar. Everyone with 20 or more points gets the rare gold-border Liliana, Waker of the Dead avatar. And if you get 40 or more points, you earn the mythic rare Teferi, Jamuraan Hero avatar!


![Basri, Liliana, and Teferi avatars](https://media.wizards.com/2020/images/daily/Core-Avatars-2021_1.png)


Treasure Chests will have only one unique Avatar here: the Rin and Seri Inseparable avatar. For those of us who don't want to have to pick between Dogs and Cats, we can rep both with this adorable avatar.

And if you're just making a fresh account, or you pick up a *Deck Builder's Essentials* for the set, you'll get this unique Teferi avatar.

Alternative Play Calendar
=========================


The release of *Double Masters* makes this too short a season to see a lot of wacky events. But we've still got a calendar that I *think* you're going to like. And when *Double Masters* comes out, we'll have plenty of new events to announce.


* ***Legacy Cube* (Continues** **until July 1)** – This began last season and is continuing without changes.
* ***Vintage Cube* (July 1** – **July 29)** – *Vintage Cube* is always our most popular cube, without fail. Newly updated through *Core Set 2021*, of course, by our partners in R&D. Any day you can land-Lotus-Mox into Elder Gargaroth I'd say is a good day. (Spoiler alert: Elder Gargaroth is in the cube.)

And that takes us through to the release of *Double Masters*!
