![Feature Match: Thoren vs. Cunningham](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/ptno03/874.jpg)The mood was rather subdued as the players sat down to shuffle up for this match. Jens Thoren, otherwise known as the [Silent Assassin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Silent+Assassin), was quiet as usual, in addition to looking a little peaked. He claimed it wasn't from a night out on the town, but given that last night was Halloween and we're in New Orleans, who really knows. He brought Team Punisher's build of Blue/Red [Tinker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tinker) Stax to the table. Jeff Cunningham, on the other hand, was playing [Psychatog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psychatog) with a splash of Red.

### Game 1

![JC is 40% style, 60% substance](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/ptno03/871.jpg)Jeff won the right to go first when Jens selected the hand that wasn't holding the glass bead. He led off with [Island](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island) and passed the turn. Jens had [City of Brass](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=City+of+Brass) and a [Goblin Welder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Welder), which was fine with Jeff as he played [Engineered Plague](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Engineered+Plague) on turn two off of a [Psychatog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psychatog)-imprinted [Chrome Mox](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chrome+Mox). Jens came back with [Ancient Tomb](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ancient+Tomb) into Monolith, which fueled his [Thirst for Knowledge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thirst+for+Knowledge) plus [Voltaic Key](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Voltaic+Key).

Jeff's third turn was just [Bloodstained Mire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodstained+Mire), but after Jens passed the turn back he [Brainstorm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brainstorm)ed, then shuffled the chaff away by searching for a [Mountain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mountain), and finally [Vampiric Tutor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vampiric+Tutor)ed. He untapped and put down an [Isochron Scepter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Isochron+Scepter) that was imprinted with [Counterspell](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterspell) after Jens resolved a [Thirst for Knowledge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thirst+for+Knowledge) in response. Jeff finished his turn with two mana up and one card in hand.

Jens placed [Masticore](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Masticore) on the stack and Jeff chose not to counter, perhaps fearing something worse. [Lightning Greaves](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Greaves) was next, and that also resolved. [Masticore](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Masticore) got his groove on with the Greaves and attacked for four, then Jens put down a [City of Traitors](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=City+of+Traitors) and nudged the turn.

Cunningham could find nothing worthwhile for his fifth turn, so he just sent it back. Jens paid the [Masticore](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Masticore)'s upkeep with [Ancient Tomb](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ancient+Tomb) and then cast [Mindslaver](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mindslaver), which Jeff considered worthy of using the Scepter on, tapping an [Island](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island) and a [Mountain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mountain) and leaving an [Island](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island) and a [Swamp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swamp) up. No longer fearing [Counterspell](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterspell), Jens went for the [Tinker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tinker), sacrificing his key. Jeff [Brainstorm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brainstorm)ed in response but had to let it resolve, so Jens retrieved [Pentavus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pentavus), equipped it with the Greaves, and sent it into the Red Zone next to the [Masticore](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Masticore), taking Jeff to a scant four life.

Jeff, again, had little action, and was forced to just tap three of his four lands and cast [Psychatog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psychatog). Jens simply untapped, didn't forget the [Masticore](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Masticore) upkeep, and attacked with both creatures to take the first game.

In preparation for game two, Jeff sided in [Boomerang](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Boomerang), [Vampiric Tutor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vampiric+Tutor), two [Energy Flux](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Energy+Flux)es, and [Diabolic Edict](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Diabolic+Edict), while taking out [Upheaval](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Upheaval), [Engineered Plague](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Engineered+Plague), [Fact or Fiction](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fact+or+Fiction), and two [Isochron Scepter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Isochron+Scepter)s.

### Game 2

![Jens Thoren, immobile.](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/ptno03/872.jpg)The next game began with a "Good luck" from Jens and a "Thanks" from Jeff, who then led with an [Island](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island). Thoren had [Ancient Tomb](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ancient+Tomb) followed by Greaves on his first turn, and Cunningham [Brainstorm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brainstorm)ed on end step. This was followed by [Bloodstained Mire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodstained+Mire), which fetched a mountain that was used to pay for an [Ice](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ice) on Thoren's land during upkeep. Another uneventful turn passed for Jeff, though on Thoren's turn he killed a [Metalworker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Metalworker), this time with the red half of [Fire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fire)/[Ice](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ice). He then played his fourth land and cast [Fact or Fiction](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fact+or+Fiction) in response to Jens's turn four [Metalworker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Metalworker).

The choices were a lone [Vampiric Tutor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vampiric+Tutor) against [Polluted Delta](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Polluted+Delta), [Bloodstained Mire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodstained+Mire), [Swamp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swamp) and [Island](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island), and Jeff chose to take the spell. [Metalworker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Metalworker) was equipped with the Greaves and immediately tapped to make four mana, some of which paid for a [Thirst for Knowledge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thirst+for+Knowledge) pitching [Seat of the Synod](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seat+of+the+Synod). Another Seat entered play and was immediately [Tinker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tinker)ed away. Jeff picked up an island for [Daze](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Daze) and the spell was countered.

Cunningham untapped, [Vampiric Tutor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vampiric+Tutor)ed on upkeep, replayed his [Island](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island) and said go. The [Metalworker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Metalworker) was used to cast a [Defense Grid](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Defense+Grid), which Jeff responded to by casting [Cunning Wish](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cunning+Wish) for [Shattering Pulse](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shattering+Pulse). Jens then played out a [Great Furnace](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Great+Furnace) and [Tinker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tinker)ed that away for [Bosh, Iron Golem](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bosh%2C+Iron+Golem). [Lightning Greaves](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Greaves) was equipped and Bosh attacked for six. Jens cast [Thirst for Knowledge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thirst+for+Knowledge) and then finally passed the turn.

Options were quickly becoming limited for Jeff, who apparently had almost nothing left as he tapped out for a main phase [Fact or Fiction](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fact+or+Fiction) while staring at lethal damage (from an attack plus Bosh's ability). The split was: [Chrome Mox](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chrome+Mox), [Fire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fire)/[Ice](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ice) and [Counterspell](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterspell) or [Energy Flux](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Energy+Flux) and [Diabolic Edict](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Diabolic+Edict). Jeff thought for a minute, took the second pile, and then a few seconds later shrugged and scooped up his cards. Game and match to the [Silent Assassin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Silent+Assassin).
