Grand Prix Vancouver 2016
=========================




Jon Stern, Chris Hewitt, Nick Slind, Han Li, Allen Sun, Ben Weitz, and Martin Goldman-Kirst are at the top!
















Grand Prix Vancouver 2016

* [Day 1 Coverage](#tabs-0)


Day 1 Coverage



It was a big first day here in Vancouver. On this triple-Grand Prix weekend (with Grand Prix events in Nagoya and Mexico City as well), players are clamoring to make their mark in the new *Oath of the Gatewatch* Limited format before the Pro Tour next week in Atlanta.


Here in Vancouver, veteran Canadian Jon Stern is the biggest name among the 9-0s, but Chris Hewitt, Nick Slind, Allen Sun, and Han Li are pretty pumped about an X-0 finish and are ready to translate into a Top 8 tomorrow. 2014-2015 Rookie of the Year runner-up Ben Weitz and Martin Goldman-Kirst sit just below them at 8-0-1. But there chances of conversion are still much better than 99% of the field for tomorrow.


The colorless mana changes and the Wastes have been distorting *Magic*reality, but players with 6-3 records or better have proven themselves worthy. They will return tomorrow to draft!


Catch all the coverage tomorrow at [twitch.tv/magic](http://twitch.tv/magic). See you then!
