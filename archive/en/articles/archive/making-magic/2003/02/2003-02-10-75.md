*You don’t tug on Superman’s cape.  
 You don’t spit into the wind.  
 You don’t pull the mask off that old Lone Ranger…*


And you don’t turn Richard Garfield away when he approaches with a **Magic** idea.


First, his ideas are almost always good.


And second, your dream job exists because of him. Show some respect.


### YOU LOSE!
