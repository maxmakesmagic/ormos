Welcome back to You Make the Card, the series where YOU, the readers of DailyMTG.com, work together to create an actual **Magic** card, to appear in a future **Magic** set. Last week, we voted on the Top 8 rules text submissions. We'll get to the results shortly.

The good news is, we've heard your feedback and are making a change. A lot of you wrote to us asking why people outside of the United States and Canada couldn't submit rules mechanics. So we went to work to change the terms for future calls for submissions. The next time we have a call for submissions, which should be for the final card name, it will be open to adults of all the nations of the world. Even astronauts on the International Space Station are welcome to participate.


The bad news is, the creator of one of the Top 8 rules text submissions violated the terms of the process and the submission had to be disqualified. "Eldritch Rites" has been disqualified and "Demonic Bargain" will advance to the next round.


So now we have our Top 4 designs! This round works the same as the last one, so vote for your favorite in each pair of cards. We should have the final vote THIS WEEK, on Wednesday, May 22. Don't wait until Monday to vote in the finals, because it will be TOO LATE by then!

*\*This ability originally read "Cast a spell without paying its mana cost." That was judged to be too powerful compared to the others. If this design wins, we'll have a further vote to decide what ability will go in this blank space.*
