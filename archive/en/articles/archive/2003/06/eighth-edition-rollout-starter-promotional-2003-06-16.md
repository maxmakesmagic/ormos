*A 1/1 flyer with no other abilities? Perfect for the introductory boxed set – now known as the Core Game.*


### *[Starter](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=magic/starter/starter/welcomeold2.asp)* Information:


*Starter* was created to help segue new players into the game. Unlike *Portal*, *Starter* used "real" **Magic** card types and terminology, but it still contained some cards that were not tournament legal, a sticking point with players that moved on to play in events. The *Starter* idea lasted two years, and has since been replaced by the "Core Game" – a two-player learning tool that contains only the simplest Core Set cards.


### Promotional Card Information:


Wizards of the Coast has released several promotional cards, but the most well-known group are those given away to players that redeemed coupons clipped from a series of **Magic** novels printed in 1994 and 1995. Although these cards were never part of any official expansion sets, they are all legal in Type 1 tournaments (and all but [Mana Crypt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Crypt) are legal in Type 1.5). The best place to see these cards is on "Flaminio's **Magic** Rarities" page **[here](http://www.flaminio.com/magic/rarities-harper-us.html)**.


### Cards in *Eighth Edition* that originated in *Starter* or as promotional cards:
