Banned & Restricted List Update Window
--------------------------------------


Next Monday, October 7, R&D will make an announcement regarding the banned and restricted lists for each format. If there is a change to any format, *Magic Online* will implement that change at 12 p.m. PT on the same day as the announcement.


If a card is banned or restricted, players using the newly banned card in a league can finish their league courses in the intervening four hours. At noon, however, any remaining players with newly illegal decks will be removed from the league with their entry option returned to their collection. If a card is unbanned or unrestricted, players can join existing leagues with decks containing those cards after the update.

Bonus Format Playoffs Reminder
------------------------------


For those of you who missed the previous format playoffs, we're holding bonus playoffs this month! To join, accrue 35 Format Points in Challenges and Leagues within a single format by its Playoff date—Modern on Saturday, October 12, and Legacy on Sunday, October 13, both at 8 a.m., then Vintage on Saturday, October 19, and Pauper on Sunday, October 20, both at 10 a.m.


The *Magic Online* Format Challenges continue every weekend for Modern, Vintage, Legacy, and Pauper formats except when replaced by Format Playoffs during scheduled Format Playoff dates.


Format Playoff events qualify you for the Format Championship in January that sends the top player to the *Magic Online* Championships and the tabletop Players Tour.

GRN | [Vraska, Golgari Queen](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vraska%2C+Golgari+Queen)'s first loyalty ability works correctly now.


ELD | Rather than only showing legal selection options until a choice is made, [Specter's Shriek](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Specter%27s+Shriek) now correctly reveals the entire hand of target opponent.


ELD | The abilities of [Thief of Sanity](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thief+of+Sanity) and [Spell Queller](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spell+Queller) now function correctly with adventure cards.
