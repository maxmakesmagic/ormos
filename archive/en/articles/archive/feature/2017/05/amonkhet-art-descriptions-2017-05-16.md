*Amonkhet*, despite being under the thumb of Nicol Bolas (or, hey, maybe because of it!), is a gorgeous plane, and it has the amazing art to match.


So let's take a look at some of that art blown up beyond card size and the art descriptions that led to their creation.


**Insult // Injury**

![Insult // Injury](https://media.wizards.com/2017/images/daily/FEAT20170516_Injury_Lucas_Graciano.jpg)[Insult // Injury](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Insult+%2F%2F+Injury) | Art by [Lucas Graciano](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&artist=%5b%22Lucas+Graciano%22%5d)
Aftermath Frame: First Half (Wide Aspect)


Setting: Amonkhet


Color: Red spell


Location: Not important


Action: We'd like this piece, together with "Injury," to form a single piece of art broken across two moments. This part, "Insult," shows a minotaur warrior bellowing. His roar emanates out as glowing hieroglyphics (see reference packet), and the hieroglyph runes continue into "Injury."


Focus: The minotaur and his roared hieroglyphics


Mood: A war bellow that can inflict real damage.


Aftermath Frame: Second Half


Setting: Amonkhet


Color: Red spell


Location: Not important


Action: This piece, together with "Insult," form a single piece of art broken across two moments. This part, "Injury," is when the magical hieroglyphics from "Insult" crash into another warrior, perhaps a Naga. The Naga puts up his arms to try to shield himself from the mystical attack.


Focus: The hieroglyphics striking their target.


Mood: These words have the power to harm.


**Protection of the Hekma**

Setting: Amonkhet


Color: White spell


Location: Just inside the Hekma, the forcefield barrier that encloses the entire city-state


Action: Show a scene that illustrates what it's like to be just inside the Hekma forcefield. The forcefield shimmers with magic, but the barrier itself is otherwise invisible. Sand dunes from the desert wastes beyond are piled up against the barrier, and a horde of desiccated mummies bump against it, mindlessly drawn by hunger. On *this* side of the barrier, the city-state is lush and calm.


Focus: The shimmering Hekma barrier is the most important element here.


Mood: Contrast of danger outside and safety inside.


**Lay Claim**

Setting: Amonkhet


Color: Blue spell


Location: Any place in the city-state with monuments in the background


Action: This spell represents the blue god Kefnet demonstrating his divine power by reaching down and grabbing a fearsome creature. Show a dragon that is being snatched up by the back of its neck, as if it were a puppy being grabbed by its scruff. Kefnet's hand looks huge, perfect, softly glowing in its divinity.


Focus: The action of grabbing is the main focus hereâ€”the contact point between Kefnet's hand and the dragon he's laying claim to.


Mood: What mortals think is huge is mere child's play to a god.


Special Masterpiece Section
===========================


**Divert**

Setting: Amonkhet


Color: Blue spell


Location: Exterior city-state shot with waterfalls


Action: In this shot, an ibis-headed vizier uses his magical power to divert the water of a waterfall. He hovers in the air where the water should be cascading down upon him, but instead the water continues onward in defiance of gravity. The vizier has his hands raised, and wisps of blue energy rise from his fingers to carry the water forward.


Focus: The gravity-defying water.


Mood: Awesome power that defies nature.


**Mind Twist**

Setting: Amonkhet


Color: Black spell


Location: An expanse of dunes in the desert


Action: The intent of this piece is to display a person's sanity shattering from wandering in the desert. To accomplish this, show a human male at the foot of a steep dune. He is small in the frame and his shadow stretches up the side of the dune. Halfway up, the shadow peels off the dune to become corporeal. It has the appearance of the monster on p. 128A. With one of its spindly arms, it reaches toward the human to poke him in the forehead. The human grabs his head in agony.


Focus: The shadow lifting off the of surface of the dune.


Mood: Surreal and disturbing.
