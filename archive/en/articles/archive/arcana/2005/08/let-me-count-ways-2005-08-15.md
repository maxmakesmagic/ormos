H**ow many legal ways are there to win or lose a game of Magic, as of right now?**




*(Thanks to Devin Low for today's Arcana, and to Steve from Chicago for the question that inspired it.)*


![Battle of Wits](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Battle+of+Wits)What's your guess?
 .  
.  
.


The answer is 28.


.  
.  
.


Oh, you actually wanted to know what they were? Well just remember it the way **Magic** R&D's Devin Low does, with this... er, *simple* mnemonic poem he devised:



> *5 Tormented *Odysseys*,  
>  5 Paths to Lose by Rules,   
>  7 Scattered Crazy Wins,  
>  3 Fortunes' Final Fools,  
>  3 Liches to Live in Death,   
>  5 Risks for Those Who Find Them,  
>  One Comp Rules to Rule them All, and in the Darkness Bind Them.*

5+5+3+7+3+3+5 = 28. Simple. If you didn't catch them all from the poem, just sound it out.


.  
.  
.


More detail?? Really. Okay. So the comprehensive rules say you win when your opponents all lose, or when a card effect says you win.


### "5 Tormented *Odysseys*"


*Odyssey* Block has a cycle of 5 alternate win conditions:


1. [Battle of Wits](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Battle+of+Wits)
2. [Chance Encounter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chance+Encounter)
3. [Epic Struggle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Epic+Struggle)
4. [Mortal Combat](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mortal+Combat)
5. [Test of Endurance](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Test+of+Endurance)

### "5 Paths to Lose by Rules"


There are 5 ways your opponent can lose according to the [comprehensive rules](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=magic/comprules):


1. He or she has zero life.
2. He or she tries to draw a card with no cards left in his or her library.
3. He or she has ten poison counters.
4. He or she loses and wins at the same time. (HINT: You lose.)
5. He or she concedes.

### "7 Scattered Crazy Wins"


There are 7 other alternate win conditions across various sets:


1. [The Cheese Stands Alone](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=The+Cheese+Stands+Alone)
2. [Now I Know My ABC's](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Now+I+Know+My+ABC%27s)

7. [Phage the Untouchable](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phage+the+Untouchable)

(These last two are wins disguised as losses.)

1. [Lich](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lich)
2. [Lich's Tomb](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lich%27s+Tomb)
3. [Nefarious Lich](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nefarious+Lich)

### "5 Risks for Those Who Find Them"


And there are 5 other risky cards your opponent might use that can make him or her lose the game:


1. [Amulet of Quoz](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Amulet+of+Quoz)
2. [Forbidden Crypt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forbidden+Crypt)

5. [Transcendence](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Transcendence)

Yup, 28.
