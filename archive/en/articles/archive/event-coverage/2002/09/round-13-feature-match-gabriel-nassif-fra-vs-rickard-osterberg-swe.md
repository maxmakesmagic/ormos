![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gplon02/908.jpg)Both of these players are near the top of the standings, and a win would put them in a great position to make the top eight. Gabriel, who is playing Blue-Black [Upheaval](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Upheaval) has had a breakout year on the PT, finishing the season with more than 40 pro points. Rickard is running black control, and his best results include a win at GP Warsaw last year.

Game One

Gabriel had to take two mulligans at the start of this game. “That evens the game out”, said Rickard, as the match-up was heavily in favor of Gabriel’s [Upheaval](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Upheaval) deck. Nassif was still fine, even with a five card hand, since he went first and dropped a second turn [Standstill](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Standstill). Rickard was going to be forced to break it at some point, so he dropped a Fiend, taking [Innocent Blood](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Innocent+Blood), which also showed that Nassif had a second [Standstill](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Standstill).

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gplon02/909.jpg)Gabriel played [Chainer's Edict](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chainer%27s+Edict) on the Fiend and said go. After Rickard played a Shade on his next turn, Gabriel used the [Innocent Blood](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Innocent+Blood) and dropped [Standstill](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Standstill) number two. Once again it was broken by a Fiend. When this ran into yet another [Innocent Blood](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Innocent+Blood) it looked like Gabriel was in a very comfortable position, as he was able to drop [Standstill](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Standstill) and Infestation. This [Standstill](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Standstill) was broken by a [Faceless Butcher](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Faceless+Butcher), but Gabriel was easily able to deal with it with [Chainer's Edict](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chainer%27s+Edict). The Frenchman had drawn nine extra cards from [Standstill](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Standstill) at that point. With a handful of useless cards, Rickard conceded to save time rather than wait for the Zombies to kill him.

Game Two

This time it was Rickard who had to mulligan twice, but unfortunately for him, he isn’t running [Standstill](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Standstill)s to get his cards back. He played [Cabal Therapy](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cabal+Therapy) on his first turn, and hit a [Standstill](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Standstill). The Swede played [Braids, Cabal Minion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Braids%2C+Cabal+Minion) which was [Innocent Blood](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Innocent+Blood)ed. Gabriel played a [Zombie Infestation](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Zombie+Infestation), and once again looked to be in control.

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gplon02/910.jpg)Rickard played a second [Braids](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Braids), but it didn’t last long since Gabriel had a second Blood, and then played [Standstill](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Standstill). Osterberg would have broken the [Standstill](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Standstill) if he had anything worth playing, but instead he just kept passing the turn while Nassif looked for a seventh land needed to cast [Upheaval](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Upheaval) and Infestation in the same turn.

Finally Osterberg drew a [Rancid Earth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rancid+Earth) and used that to break the [Standstill](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Standstill), then dropped [Braids](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Braids). Gabriel tapped out to Blood and [Deep Analysis](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deep+Analysis), so the Swede took the opportunity to drop a [Screams of the Damned](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Screams+of+the+Damned). Rickard used [Cabal Therapy](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cabal+Therapy) to see that Gabriel had [Upheaval](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Upheaval) (which he probably should have named over [Circular Logic](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Circular+Logic)) and was about to combo on the next turn. Nassif also had a [Skeletal Scrying](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skeletal+Scrying) which he used in response to [Mind Sludge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mind+Sludge). This gave him enough cards so that the Frenchman was able to [Upheaval](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Upheaval) and drop Infestation next turn, and Rickard scooped in response.
