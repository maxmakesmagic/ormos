How do you introduce arguably the biggest faceoff in the Top 8 of Grand Prix Baltimore?


On one side sat twentieth-ranked Josh Utter-Leyton, former Player of the Year, multiple Pro Tour Top 8 competitor, World Championship competitor and all-around nice guy. With years of experience and an excellent run through the Draft rounds leading up to the Top 8, Utter-Leyton had only one phrase for what he planned: "I've got this."


On the other side sat twenty-second-ranked Ben Stark, Pro Tour Hall of Fame member, Pro Tour winner, Grand Prix champion, and renown Limited specialist. His knowledge was oft-referred to among players, and his skill kept him among the elite class of Platinum players.


The winner of this match would be taking home more than a shot at the trophy: between teammates and friends it was a story they'd remember: For Stark, Utter-Leyton was the first opponent he would play a second time in a Grand Prix Top 8. That time, Stark got the better of the two.


Could Utter-Leyton even the score here, or would the Limited master march onward again?



**The Games**




[Ainok Bond-Kin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ainok+Bond-Kin) and [Jeskai Student](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jeskai+Student) led the way for Stark, though Utter-Leyton's Tuskgaurd Captain was a promising start to defend. With four mana Stark revealed one of his trumps: [High Sentinels of Arashin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=High+Sentinels+of+Arashin). Undaunted, Utter-Leyton struck back with [Mardu Warshrieker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mardu+Warshrieker) into [Bloodfire Expert](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodfire+Expert), promising a powerful counterattack, at least until Stark's [Debilitating Injury](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Debilitating+Injury) took the latter out.
