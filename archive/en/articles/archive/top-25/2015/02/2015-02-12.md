It was a Pro Tour weekend here at the home of the *Magic* Top 25 Pro Rankings, and that means everything changed. Well...almost everything. Despite ten players climbing the rankings, twelve falling, and two new entries, we begin our roundup with the one person who went precisely nowhere as a result of the festivities at [Pro Tour *Fate Reforged*](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/ptfrf)*—*Owen Turtenwald remains in the top spot at No. 1, after a solid 10–6 finish brought him 75th place and 6 pro points. Behind him, three of the biggest upward movers all made the Top 8. Eric Froehlich climbs a huge eight places from No. 11 to No. 3, and Jacob Wilson celebrates a second consecutive Modern Pro Tour Top 8 with a jump up six to No. 9. Lee Shi Tian of Hong Kong, like Wilson and Froehlich, lost his quarterfinal, but it's Lee who now stands as the closest challenger to Turtenwald at No. 2. In addition, he now leads the Player of the Year race by the smallest of margins, setting up a fantastic second half to the season.



Slightly further down the Top 25, Martin Juza, who only returned to the rankings last week, took the opportunity to cement his place, up six to No. 19. There were strong showings from Willy Edel of Brazil (up five at No. 16) and Yuuki Ichikawa of Japan (up three at No. 15) as well as more modest gains for No. 7 William Jensen, No. 8 Ari Lax, No. 10 Sam Black, and No. 13 Paul Rietzl. As for the two new entries, Seth Manfield joins at No. 18, a reward for his pacesetting efforts at the Pro Tour (he reached the lofty heights of 12–0 before his first loss), while longtime Necropolis fan Andrew Cuneo went 11–5 in Washington, propelling him to No. 20.



Of course, ups are mirrored by downs. The bottom five in the table (Kentaro Yamamoto, Patrick Chapin, Ben Stark, Craig Wescoe, and Josh Utter-Leyton) all fell sharply, and there were also significant falls for Reid Duke (down six, and now outside the top ten at No. 11) and Yuuya Watanabe (down five at No. 12). Josh Utter-Leyton now sits over the fabled trap door, and that's important, as he is one of a very few to have been in the Top 25 since its inception. Can a new entry force his or her way into the Top 25 at Grand Prix Seville this weekend? You'll get all the answers right here next week, at the home of the *Magic* Top 25 Pro Rankings.
