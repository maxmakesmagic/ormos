### Tournament Location

Palazzo dell'Ex Casino di Venezia  
 Lungomare Marconi 4  
 30126 - Venezia Lido (VE)

### Hotel Information

There is no dedicated player hotel. For detailed locations of the recommended hotels please refer to the map. All the hotels are at the Lido.

Generally all the hotels are in between the Vaporetto boat stop and the ex-casino palace: only the hotels marked with "not far" are a little bit out of the direct way. 

Distance "Not too far": between 15 and 10 min by walk  
 Distance "OK": between 10 and 5 min by walk  
 Distance "perfect": next to the ex-casino less than 5 min by walk

**NOTE:**  
 For images and more information please refer to the direct web site of the hotels


**Transportation from the Airport to the Hotel:**


The Alilaguna airport boat offers frequent, inexpensive service from Venice’s Marco Polo Airport to the Lido.


Take the Alilaguna water launch from the airport to the Lido vaporetto stop. The water launch leaves the airport at hourly and 2-hourly intervals depending on the time of day. You can check for specific timetables at ([www.alilaguna.it](http://www.alilaguna.it)). Tickets are available from the office close to the exit of the Arrivals hall. One-way single person fare is approximately 10 Euros. The journey from the airport to the Lido will take approximately 40 minutes.


Once you arrive on the Lido, you can take a taxi or the bus to the hotel.

|  **Randy Gallegos**
Randy was born on Halloween, 1974. His earliest memory was of seeing Star Wars at the theater at the age of three, so in a way he was programmed early for imaginative art. He's been a steady name in the field since he began illustrating professionally nearly ten years ago. His work first began appearing on various collectible card games, including Magic: The Gathering and others, and he quickly found himself among an immensely talented group of artists. Randy's art has since graced many other Wizards' games, and he's lent his talents to role-playing games, video games, children's books, and running websites while playing with his rock band, Plumage.
He was born and still lives in San Jose, CA with his wife and long-time sweetheart Monica and a rabid dog reincarnated as a cat named Kirby.

 |  |  **Greg Staples**
Born in 1970 and raised in the north of England, Greg knew from a very early age that he wanted to be an artist. After completing his school degrees he left to train in architecture, feeling he wouldn't be able to make a living as a full time artist. However, three years later, redundancy forced him to build a portfolio and give it a go.
In 1990, Simon Bisley saw some of his work at a comic convention and introduced Greg to the editor of the British comic 2000AD where he was given his first professional job, right there on the spot.
Greg drew *Judge Dredd* as his first strip and continues to do that to this day. Other credits include a collective book of his best work, a *Slaine the Barbarian* graphic novel,a new collection of Judge Dredd stories called *Innocents Abroad*, written by Garth 'Preacher' Ennis and too many covers for various magazines to mention. Film production work and computer game design have also featured heavily in his career such as the game *Loaded* for the playstation which he also produced.
His current work includes a series of illustrations for Salomon Snowboards, book covers, as well as illustrations for **Magic: the Gathering**.
He is currently living in Sheffield, England.
