 Despite a Grand Prix taking place in Kobe, hardcore globetrotter Tomoharu Saito has elected to take the ten-hour flight to Sydney. He is in search of some Pro Points to kickstart the new season and preferred to do it far away from the intense brawl in Japan. Clearly very dedicated to the game, Saito's gambit has paid off and he found himself in the twentieth Grand Prix Top 8 and is now hunting for his sixth Grand Prix win. Saito has put together a Blue/Red concoction, hoping to close the game fast with pairs of [Welkin Tern](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Welkin+Tern), [Aeronaut Tinkerer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aeronaut+Tinkerer) and [Inferno Fist](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inferno+Fist). If that plan doesn't work out, perhaps he can rely on [Siege Dragon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Siege+Dragon) to clinch the match.



Saito's already qualified for Pro Tour Khans of Tarkir, set to take place in the island paradise of Honolulu in a couple of month's time. He narrowly missed the Top 8 at grand Prix Chicago, costing him complimentary return airfare to Honolulu, but that little problem took care of itself today. The new and improved Organized Play policy now grants all Grand Prix Top 8 competitors airfare to the affiliated Pro Tour. 





*Tomoharu Saito in his 20th Grand Prix Top 8.* 

  

 His opponent Maitland Cameron from Tasmania was a proud member of the Australian National team back in 2011 and will also be equally pleased to be back on the Pro Tour, but was perhaps less pleased that he had to go up against the strongest player in the Top 8 today. His aggressive MONO White deck is a rare masterpiece, featuring triple [Raise the Alarm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Raise+the+Alarm) to complement [Triplicate Spirits](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Triplicate+Spirits) and a pair of [Will-Forged Golem](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Will-Forged+Golem). Should Saito manage to gum up the board, he has a pair of each [Selfless Cathar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Selfless+Cathar), [Marked by Honor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Marked+by+Honor) and [Razorfoot Griffin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Razorfoot+Griffin) to hopefully break the stalemate and deal the final blows.



"Did your draft go well?" Cameron inquired.


"It was okay,' Saito modestly replied.


"Haha, congratulations on making the Top 8 anyway, how much did your flight cost?"


"Around twelve hundred bucks, but it was worth it."


With that, they began shuffling up and soon began their match.



**Game One**




 Saito's superior Swiss standing allowed him to play first and he quickly opened with [Welkin Tern](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Welkin+Tern) and [Bronze Sable](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bronze+Sable). Cameron managed [Selfless Cathar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Selfless+Cathar) and a pair of [Raise the Alarm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Raise+the+Alarm) tokens.




 Saito made use of his fourth turn to cast and equip [Rogue's Gloves](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rogue%27s+Gloves), netting him a card. [Razorfoot Griffin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Razorfoot+Griffin) was Cameron's rebuttal, putting a stop to further card drawing shenanigans.




 Saito turned up the heat with a pair of [Thundering Giant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thundering+Giant)s, only to have it kept at bay by [Razorfoot Griffin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Razorfoot+Griffin), now enchanted with [Marked by Honor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Marked+by+Honor). Unable to wait any longer, Saito swung with his entire team. Not wanting to grant his opponent the additional card Cameron wisely chose to block the [Welkin Tern](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Welkin+Tern) and chump one of the two Giants.

 This attack took him down to 8, but Cameron was able to shorten his three turn clock into two, thanks to [Sacred Armory](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sacred+Armory). With Saito down to just 5 life, he was forced to chump with [Siege Dragon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Siege+Dragon) and [Welkin Tern](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Welkin+Tern), eventually succumbing to the 4/4 "Firebreathing" Griffin.




**Cameron 1 â€“ Saito 0**




[Selfless Cathar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Selfless+Cathar) and two [Raise the Alarm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Raise+the+Alarm) tokens were the first creatures to hit the board again, but the horde was temporarily stymied by [Coral Barrier](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Coral+Barrier). Cameron was unfazed and added [Will-Forged Golem](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Will-Forged+Golem) to the board on Turn 3, the fastest possible turn for it to hit play in the world of *Magic 2015* limited.






*Maitland Cameron might not have Soul (of *Theros*), but he had Soldiers.Comment Goes Here!*

  

 Saito dug for options with [Divination](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Divination), finding [Thundering Giant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thundering+Giant) to halt the attacks. Unfortunately, that was only a temporary roadblock. Cameron flooded the board with yet a second pair of soldier tokens and [Kinsbaile Skirmisher](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kinsbaile+Skirmisher). Laying his fifth land, Cameron attached with his entire team.




 "Oh dear, GG" murmured Saito. Clearly, he was worried about [Sanctified Charge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sanctified+Charge). However, a little bird told me it was not in Cameron's deck.




 Nonetheless, Saito made the appropriate blocks, forcing Cameron to sacrifice [Selfless Cathar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Selfless+Cathar). This all-out attack knocked Saito down to 6 life. When the bloodbath ended, Saito was left with a single [Coral Barrier](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Coral+Barrier) to fend off Cameron's [Oreskos Swiftclaw](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oreskos+Swiftclaw), [Kinsbaile Skirmisher](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kinsbaile+Skirmisher) and two remaining soldier tokens.




[Into the Void](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Into+the+Void) bought him some time but [Triplicate Spirits](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Triplicate+Spirits) reared their three ugly heads. Saito was tapped out the turn before and had missed the window to counter the crucial spell with [Negate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Negate). Seeing no other way out, Saito could only graciously extend his hand, wishing Cameron good luck in the semifinals.




**Maitland Cameron defeats Tomoharu Saito 2-0**
