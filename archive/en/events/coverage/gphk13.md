Shuhei Nakamura is your Grand Prix: Hong Kong champion! Tied a win each against Martin Juza, the deciding game involved a 7/6 [Agent of Horizons](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Agent+of+Horizons) providing the finishing touches to an otherwise stalled board. This victory marks his 6th Grand Prix title, which means he is now tied for second (with Yuuya Watanbe).


Rounding out the top 8 were Martin Juza (now on his 18th Top 8), Ken Yukuhiro, Yuuta Takahashi, Ng Soon Lye, Denny Dunsford, Lu Xiaoshi and Lei Yu Sheng.


Congratulations to Shuhei Nakamura, Champion of Grand Prix Hong Kong!
