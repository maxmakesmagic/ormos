### SERIOUS FUN


My Butcher's Favorite Cuts

Welcome to Mardu Week! Of the wedges, Mardu is definitely my favorite. I was lucky enough to pick it in my playgroup's *Khans of Tarkir* mini-Prerelease (I'll have to share that with you in a future article). I was blessed with a great set of cards for the Prerelease, led by [Butcher of the Horde](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Butcher+of+the+Horde), supported by [Ponyback Brigade](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ponyback+Brigade)s and [Hordeling Outburst](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hordeling+Outburst)s.

[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Ponyback Brigade)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ponyback Brigade)


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Hordeling Outburst)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hordeling Outburst)



The deck really showed off the power of [Butcher of the Horde](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Butcher+of+the+Horde) for me. When I opened my prize packs, I was lucky enough to get another Butcher! When I pulled a third one from some extra packs I happened to have, it seemed like a sign that I should not ignore! I needed to build a Mardu deck featuring the Butcher.


And really, it was about time that I built a new deck. When you play often with a regular group, your opponents get to know your decks. Whether it is the deck with the distinctive *Magic*-backed sleeves, the deck that uses every full-art [Zendikar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Zendikar) land you own, or the deck that uses every [Mother of Runes](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mother+of+Runes) that you own, keeping the same decks, over time, makes your game predictable. If you're even a little bit interested in winning your games, doesn't it make sense to change up your list of decks? When you're showing up with a new deck every week, you get the advantage of your opponents never really knowing what you're doing. I advocate new decks and constantly changing your regular decks. Not only do you keep the element of surprise, but you get to try something new and exciting every time you play!


This new Mardu deck started out much the same way many of my decks begin: I have a card and I really want to use it!


**3 Butcher of the Horde**


With [Butcher of the Horde](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Butcher+of+the+Horde) as the first cards in the deck, I know that I'll be including at least red, black, and white in the deck. I prefer to limit the colors in my deck to two, so going up to three is already stretching my comfort zone, but it shouldn't be too bad. Since I know the colors of the deck, I do a quick search through my cards for other cards in those colors that I really want to play. I know this is not the best way to build a deck loaded with synergy, but it is the best way to build a deck with cards I'm wanting to play, so this is usually my second step. This rarely takes too long. I keep my cards in a library card catalog. When I have a card I'm particularly interested in seeing in a deck, I stand it up in the drawer while all the other cards are lying down. It makes it pretty obvious which cards I'm dying to get into decks.


![](https://media.wizards.com/2014/images/daily/demigod.jpg)
The [Demigod of Revenge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Demigod+of+Revenge) just seems like an interesting option for a deck with [Butcher of the Horde](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Butcher+of+the+Horde). The Demigod offers another big creature that needs to be dealt with, and it can be sacrificed to the Butcher in a pinch. It does come back fairly easily, since I'll regularly draw multiple copies. I'm reluctant to suggest it is a good card to sacrifice to Butcher since it costs more than the Butcher, but it is certainly an option and that is enough "synergy" for me to include it.


**4 Demigod of Revenge**


Another card I spotted in my drawer?


![](https://media.wizards.com/2014/images/daily/sorin.jpg)
I had recently picked up a couple more copies of [Sorin, Lord of Innistrad](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sorin%2C+Lord+of+Innistrad), and this seemed like the right deck to run them. The Vampires Sorin creates can certainly be sacrificed to the Butcher. Since it seemed likely at this point that the deck would likely have several creatures in it, being able to get a few copies of his emblem in play also seemed like a good plan.


**3 Sorin, Lord of Innistrad**


So if the deck is going to revolve around [Butcher of the Horde](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Butcher+of+the+Horde), while working with [Demigod of Revenge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Demigod+of+Revenge) and Sorin, what can be done to maximize it? At this point, I tend to look at the card to come up with ideas and review the limitations. Just some quick brainstorming to see the obvious and possibly a little deeper.



* Mana base that can handle Mardu colors
* Protect the Butcher
* Creatures that I'm okay with sacrificing
* Creatures that can be recycled through the graveyard
* Creatures that can get cards from the graveyard

I don't really need, or want, to go any farther than that at this point. All I'm doing here is limiting the cards I'll be looking at, and I don't want to get the blinders on too tightly. Some of the limitations are fairly straightforward. The mana base needs to produce all three colors of mana fairly early and be able to get [Butcher of the Horde](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Butcher+of+the+Horde) into play quickly. However, we'll get to the mana base shortly.


While I like the idea of sacrificing the [Demigod of Revenge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Demigod+of+Revenge) to the [Butcher of the Horde](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Butcher+of+the+Horde), then using a new [Demigod of Revenge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Demigod+of+Revenge) to bring the sacrificed one back, I expect that I won't have another Demigod in hand as often as I might want. Sacrificing a 5/4 flier to get haste, vigilance, or lifelink just seems like a bad plan, so I'll want other creatures to sacrifice. Sorin makes 1/1 black Vampires, but when I was looking for other ways to make cheap creatures, there was another card staring at me.


![](https://media.wizards.com/2014/images/daily/luminarch.jpg)
I'm a little hesitant to run the [Luminarch Ascension](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Luminarch+Ascension) here. Nothing encourages people to attack you like a card that tells everyone to attack you or they'll have to deal with 4/4 Angels for two mana. However, it's another card I wanted to try out. And hey, 4/4 Angels for two mana!


**2 Luminarch Ascension**


Some other interesting creature producers I found in my collection:


**2 Twilight Drover**  



The [Drover](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Twilight+Drover) is a token-making machine and the [Doomsayer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thraben+Doomsayer) gets it started, all while costing almost nothing once it is on the battlefield. The [Satchel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Druidic+Satchel) not only makes creatures, it also gets lands into play and gives me a little life. I do love multipurpose cards!


Between my creatures getting sacrificed and just outright dying, I'm going to need ways to get them out of the graveyard and back in my hand. I went digging through my collection and found these goodies:


**1 Grim Harvest**  



The first three are fairly straightforward in that they get creatures out of my graveyard and into my hand. The [Treasury Thrull](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treasury+Thrull) costs a bit much, but it can get the Satchel and [Luminarch Ascension](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Luminarch+Ascension) back as well as creatures, so I thought I'd try it out. The Angels are a little more questionable. I picked them since I could see plenty of situations where I overextended and wanted a [Demigod of Revenge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Demigod+of+Revenge) back. This is the selection I suspect will be the first to be replaced, or perhaps I'll form more of the deck around it to make it work just a little better. The Demigod and [Twilight Drover](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Twilight+Drover) are the only spirits in the deck...for now.


The remaining spells in the deck are there to find lands, destroy permanents, and exile libraries. The Demigods really push the mana base, while most of the smaller cards in the deck are white, so tutoring for land is important. I like my decks to have some way to deal with permanents on the battlefield, beyond trying to kill them during the combat step. Finally, my group is seeing more and more decks that abuse their graveyards. The ability to shut down a graveyard is getting more and more important in our games, so I included a couple of cards to help with that.

This is not the most potent version of this deck. I'm confident that every reader out there can think of at least one card that would be better in place of another card that is currently in the deck. The joy of this deck is that I used only what I had available. I didn't need to trade for a single card in the deck!


I had the chance to take it out for a quick spin last week. We ran a six-player Star game. In this format, your opponents are the players at the table not sitting on either side of you. The first person to kill all of their opponents wins the game. We find these games tend to move a little faster than having to kill every other player, so when our group gets a little bigger, we often try alternatives that look like they could result in shorter games.


The deck played out pretty well. An early [Luminarch Ascension](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Luminarch+Ascension) got one quest counter on it, and cost me three life before it was destroyed. A [Twilight Drover](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Twilight+Drover) and [Thraben Doomsayer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thraben+Doomsayer) were the next ones out. Human tokens and spirit tokens were around, but a [Pernicious Deed](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pernicious+Deed) put an end to that. [Butcher of the Horde](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Butcher+of+the+Horde) came out soon after, eating Humans and later Vampire tokens, while ramping up my life total.

At this point, we had already lost two players in the game and it was getting closer to the end. I had two Demigods in my hand, but I was unable to cast them since the eight mana I had on the board could not produce five black and/or red mana between them. A [Wheel of Fortune](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wheel+of+Fortune) left both of them in my graveyard, with another showing up in my new hand of cards. After several more turns, I finally found the last mana I needed and cast the [Demigod of Revenge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Demigod+of+Revenge), bringing Demigod's twin siblings out of the graveyard and onto the battlefield. I took out Jesse with exactly the eighteen damage I needed (I had a Sorin emblem from earlier still around), leaving me with only one opponent. Harry and I each needed to take out Josh for a shared victory, and things wrapped up quickly after that.


One game doesn't teach much about a deck, but I did learn a few lessons:



* The mana base needs to be changed, or the cards in the deck need an overhaul. To run so many cheaper white cards, then need so much black mana later is asking more than this mana base can provide. Either more lands that can tap for more types of land, or cards like [Chromatic Lantern](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chromatic+Lantern) will likely be in order.
* [Luminarch Ascension](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Luminarch+Ascension) will likely need to come out and be replaced with something else, but for now it stays—4/4 Angels are too good to give up on that quickly!
* Hitting with multiple Demigods is just awesome! They come out of nowhere and can alpha at one person or send a wave of hysteria over multiple opponents!

The most important lesson I learned from this game? Keep tokens handy! The deck makes Angels, Vampires, Spirits, Humans, and Saprolings! This deck is a blast!
