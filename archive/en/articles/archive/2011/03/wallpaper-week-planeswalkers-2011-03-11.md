Before we get to today's wallpaper, how about a quick announcement? Yes!


### Duels of the Planeswalkers 2012 at PAX East


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/arcana/665_d12logo.jpg)In Summer of 2011, Wizards of the Coast is releasing an all-new version of **Duels of the Planeswalkers**, and if you want to be among the first to play it, all you have to do is stop by our booth at PAX East.


**Duels of the Planeswalkers** 2012 will have a lot of new features, but here's the one we're most excited about: *Archenemy*! Yes, *Archenemy*! We'd show you screenshots of what that looks like in **Duels of the Planeswalkers** 2012, but what fun would that be? Go to PAX East and see it for yourself!


**DUELS OF THE PLANESWALKERS 2012  

COMING THIS SUMMER**


Okay, now that that's out of the way, how about a wallpaper? And to tie it all together, how about a wallpaper for **Magic: The Gathering** 2012? That means it applies to both **Duels of the Planeswalkers** 2012 and the ***Magic** 2012* core set! Enjoy.
