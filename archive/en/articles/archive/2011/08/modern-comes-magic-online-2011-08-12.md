As mentioned by [Tom LaPille in Latest Developments](/en/articles/archive/latest-developments/welcome-modern-world-2011-08-12), we are happy to announce that the Modern format is coming to **Magic Online** after the downtime on August 24. Originally introduced as one of the formats for the 2011 Community Cup, Modern will now receive an in-game format filter and will be added to our rotation of Core formats events. Prizes for Modern tournaments will match the prizes awarded for Standard and Extended tournaments.


After the August 24 downtime, the following event types will be available for Modern:


* 2-Player Queues
* 8-Player Queues
* 4-Round Daily Events
* Premier Events

To celebrate the release of this nonrotating format, **Magic Online** will host a Modern Release Celebration from August 24 until September 7. During this time, all players who play in a Modern 8-player queue, 4-round Daily Event, or Premier Event will receive a textless Lightning Bolt promo card automatically delivered to their MTGO account at the end of that event. In addition, all players who earn 12 match points in a Daily Event or reach the Top 8 of a Premier Event will be invited to participate in the Modern Release Championship on September 11\*.
