 **Q: Regarding "Walking the Planes: Grinders," I absolutely loved that guitar piece in the middle of the video. What was it and who did it? â€”Travis F.**  


**A: Nathan Holt, Walking the Planes co-creator:**


I'm also in love with that track, Travis. Had it stuck in my head throughout the post-production process. It was done by Matt Gibson of The Extraordinaires. The demo was called "Roger's Dishes" and he gave us the final track as "Magic Dishes" in honor of the web series it was created for. I wouldn't be surprised if the band adds lyrics and fleshes out the track for their upcoming album. That's what happened with Matt's track "Staring at the Sun," aka "the whistle track" from episodes #7 and #15.
