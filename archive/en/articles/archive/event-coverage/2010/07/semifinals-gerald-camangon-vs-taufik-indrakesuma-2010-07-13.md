Taufik Indrakesuma and his [Polymorph](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Polymorph) deck triumphed over Yuuta Takahashi's Jund deck in almost record time in the quarterfinals, while Gerald Camangon's Mythic Conscription deck took slightly longer to finish off Adrian Marasigan's [Vengevine](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vengevine) Naya. As the players perused each other's decklists, Indrakesuma let out a long "ooooh no," spying at matchup he wasn't looking forward to.


Indrakesuma accelerated out a turn three [Jace, the Mind Sculptor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace%2C+the+Mind+Sculptor) with the help of an [Everflowing Chalice](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Everflowing+Chalice), and used it to bounce Camangon's turn two [Knight of the Reliquary](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Knight+of+the+Reliquary). When Camangon replayed his Knight, Indrakesuma simply played a [Khalni Garden](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Khalni+Garden), and turned the plant into an [Emrakul, the Aeons Torn](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Emrakul%2C+the+Aeons+Torn). He then took a look at the top of Camangon's deck with Jace, and passed the turn back. Camangon went through all of his options, and decided his only out was winning games two and three.

Indrakesuma 1 – Camangon 0


Indrakesuma mulliganed in game two, while Camangon lead with a pair of fetch lands, and a [Sejiri Steppe](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sejiri+Steppe), passing his first three turns without play. Indrakesuma had a first turn [Khalni Garden](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Khalni+Garden), and an [Everflowing Chalice](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Everflowing+Chalice) for one on turn two. While Camangon may have been wary of Indrakesuma's third turn, all it yielded was a second [Khalni Garden](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Khalni+Garden). The players continued to play draw-go. Something not unheard of for Indrakesuma's deck. But a little out of the ordinary for Camangon's. Indrakesuma summoned Jace to his side, and together they [Brainstorm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brainstorm)ed up a plan. Camangon finally summoned a [Lotus Cobra](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lotus+Cobra), and with the help of a [Misty Rainforest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Misty+Rainforest), it generated enough mana to cast an [Oblivion Ring](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oblivion+Ring) with three more mana open. Indrakesuma answered with a [Negate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Negate), and Camangon wasn't tempted into tapping out, allowing the Jace/Indrakesuma brain trust to continue the brewing. Indrakesuma drew more cards, and passed it back with all of his mana available.

*Indrakesuma's checkin' out the goods.* |


Camangon went for it, summoning a [Sovereigns of Lost Alara](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sovereigns+of+Lost+Alara) and attacking with the Cobra, but Indrakesuma had an [Unsummon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Unsummon). On Indrakesuma's turn, he aimed a [Polymorph](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Polymorph) at one of his plants. With his one remaining white mana, Camangon tried to [Path to Exile](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Path+to+Exile) the plant, but Indrakesuma had the [Deprive](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deprive). Emrakul wasted no time entering play from the top of the deck, and Jace rounded out the turn by bouncing the Sovereigns. Camangon cast a Jace of his own to see if he could tempt Indrakesuma to tapping his last two [Island](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island)s, but with Emrakul already in play, he was happy to let them cancel each other out. Camangon summoned a [Lotus Cobra](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lotus+Cobra), and passed the turn back. Emrakul rumbled in and annihilated all but two lands and three of Camangon's life points. He untapped, found nothing, and offered the handshake.


Taufik Indrakesuma defeats Gerald Camangon to advance to the finals.
