Hi everyone,


I’m pleased to say that since my last update in March, we’ve made great progress towards restoring paper-linked premier play to **Magic Online**.


We have scheduled several zero-ticket entry “test” events early in the month of May. We are inviting the **Magic Online**  community to help us test some of the new tools and processes we have put in place for PTQ and MOCS events to improve player experience in case of an unplanned outage, or other emergency. These test events will be first come-first serve, and all of the details for those events can be [found here](http://community.wizards.com/content/blog/4080821).



In addition to giving promo cards to all who participate, these events will have prizes awarded to the players who do well in them.

In addition to giving promo cards to all who participate, these events will have prizes awarded to the players who do well in them, as normal. Note that these will be true tests and therefore this will result in some people (purposefully) getting removed from the events, clock timers being manipulated for some/all players, and other things like that, and players affected in this way will not be compensated further beyond their participation prizes. As I said, these test events are designed to stress some of the many changes we’ve made to the system and to our staffing to make your experiences more reliable.


Before the end of May, we will complete our analysis on the tests and post another update on our progress. As we said last month, returning these events to you all as soon as possible is one of our top priorities.


I want to thank the **Magic Online**  community in advance for helping us test out these new systems, and we greatly appreciate your continued patience as we work to improve our products and processes to deliver you the best **Magic**  experiences we can.


Also a reminder that there is a dedicated email inbox for players to send their feedback on this or any issue—[magiconlinefeedback@wizards.com](mailto:magiconlinefeedback@wizards.com). Rest assured, all communications are reviewed by the MTGO business team, though we cannot respond to all questions personally. Additionally, we have created a thread to [discuss this specific issue](http://community.wizards.com/forum/magic-online-general/threads/4080836). As always, specific questions about your **Magic Online**  account should be sent to our [Game Support team](http://wizards.custhelp.com/app/answers/list).
