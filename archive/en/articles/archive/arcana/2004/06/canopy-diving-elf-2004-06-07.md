How does a lowly elf take down a flying creature? With a bit of preparedness -- and a lot of determination.

The *Fifth Dawn* creature **[Viridian Scout](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Viridian+Scout)** is a non-flying elf that can be sacrificed to deal 2 damage to a flying creature. The art and flavor text reveal how, in flavor terms, this ability is accomplished.

The Scout drops out of the canopy of the Tangle forest onto its foe. When the trees of one's home forest grow higher than flyers fly, even elves can have the higher ground advantage!
