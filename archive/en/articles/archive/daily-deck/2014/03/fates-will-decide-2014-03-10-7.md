 Bruce's games invariably involve several friends, crazy plays, and many laughs. Bruce believes that if anyone at your table isn't having fun, then you are doing it wrong. 






The game had been going steadily downhill for you right from the start. You couldn't seem to keep anything on the board for any length of time, and your life total had been dwindling. Amy seemed to have most of the board locked down with several permanents that continued to bounce everything back to players' hands.

 You managed to draw a [Frost Titan](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Frost+Titan) and were starting to make some inroads, as Amy really didn't want to bounce the [Frost Titan](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Frost+Titan). Josh played out a [Diluvian Primordial](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Diluvian+Primordial) and also started to break the lock. Tyler looked frustrated, but was stocking his hand with cards that would undoubtedly start hitting the table as soon as he thought he could keep them there. 

 At that point, you draw [Phyrexian Metamorph](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phyrexian+Metamorph) and thank the Fates! [Phyrexian Metamorph](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phyrexian+Metamorph) could give you a copy of [Frost Titan](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Frost+Titan), or [Diluvian Primordial](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Diluvian+Primordial), or any of the creatures Amy was using to bounce other permanents. 

Since it is a creature, if Amy chooses to bounce it back to your hand, or simply remove it and return it to play, it will just come right back. With all the "enter the battlefield" options available, this seems like a serious mistake. The Fates rejoice with you in making a game-breaking play.
