The December 13, 2016 Update

Blake is the content manager for DailyMTG.com, making him the one you should email if you have thoughts on the website, good or less good (or not good). He's a longtime coverage reporter and hasn't turned down a game of Magic in any format ever. 






The Daily *Magic* Update is a roundup of everything *Magic* you should know on December 13, 2016. Today's Update is brought to you by podcasts, long and short.


Today's Must
============


1. [Six Winners and Losers from Standard GP Weekend](http://www.channelfireball.com/articles/6-winners-and-losers-from-standard-gp-weekend/) | ChannelFireball | Paulo Vitor Damo da Rosa

Right, right, I got a callout, but I also just love these "winners and losers" articles, because they're succinct ways to look at the story of a weekend and see what improved and what got worse over the course of a tournament. Plus, it feeds that primal need to be all judgy about cards and decks.


After That, Read, Watch, or Listen to These
===========================================


1. [Failure Is Necessary](http://www.channelfireball.com/articles/failure-is-necessary/) | ChannelFireball | Will Jonathan

It's not uncommon for players to lose their first umpteen games of *Magic* while learning. Heck, it's not uncommon for even the most seasoned pros to go on losing streaks. It's also not uncommon for that to be a frustrating experience. But Jonathan has a new spin on losing, one that leads to that other thing—winning.


1. [First Strike #4—From Pro Tour Teams to *Magic Online* Draft Leagues](http://manadeprived.com/first-strike-4-pro-tour-teams-magic-online-draft-leagues/) | Mana Deprived | Kar Yung Tom, Doug Potter, and Bryan Gottlieb

The Team Series, Heart of Kiran, concessions, Draft Leagues, and more are on the docket for the fourth episode of this talking-heads style podcast. Clocking in at a touch over an hour, it's not a bad way to spend a workout, Draft League, or whatever it is you do with 1 hour and 9 minutes. I don't know your life...


1. [The Short Episode](http://mtgcast.com/mtgcast-podcast-shows/active-podcast-shows/monday-night-magic/monday-night-magic-541-the-short-episode) | Monday Night Magic | Chewie Slate, Bill Bloodworth, and Aaron Lacluyze

...In fact, maybe you're more of a jogger, or you've only got time for one game in a Draft League, or you just want to kill some time while your significant other watches yet another episode of *Gilmore Girls*. In that case, maybe I can interest you in a 39-minute podcast instead? Limited Grand Prix, the Vintage Cube, and a *Magic* player's continued roll are all on the list for this, well, short episode.


1. [*Magic* Story: Can It Be Better?](http://magic.tcgplayer.com/db/article.asp?ID=13678&writer=Denis+Stranjak&articledate=12-13-2016) | TCGPlayer | Denis Stranjak

Denis Stranjak, of Windmill Slam, joins TCGPlayer to offer some thoughts on *Magic* Story and how he believes it could be improved.


1. [Mana Echoes: Let's Talk About Frontier and the Community's Reaction to It!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQVpgbls0Ig) | YouTube | Wedge

This video isn't so much about Frontier (a fan-made format), but about the recently raised level of discourse on the format—and it's that discourse that Wedge is actually discussing. The main point of the video is to be nice, inclusive, and let people play how they want to play. And those seem like pretty good things.

Community Spotlight
===================


1. [Planeswalker Showdown—*Magic: The Gathering* (Games Night XL)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoiGJujcFBc) | YOGSCAST Lewis & Simon

This is from a few days ago, but it's a touch outside our normal realm, so it's unlikely many of you have stumbled upon this charmingly funny video from a pair of British YouTubers who usually focus on other games. Here they battle, with British accents and all, with the Planeswalker Decks from *Kaladesh*, and they do so delightfully.

Tim Aten, a former *Magic* pro and Wizards employee, just keeps on winning at *Jeopardy!*. But don't worry, that's just how he looks when he's starting to feel comfortable somewhere.

We released the next set of [FNM Promos](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/feature/january-through-march-fnm-promo-update-2016-12-13), and people seem to be at least a little pleased this round.


Deck of the Day
===============


1. Retreat!

This is, bar none, my favorite Standard Showdown deck I've selected here for Deck of the Day. And that's saying quite a bit.


It should come as no great surprise that a Standard with a Zendikar block has a viable lands deck, and this one can do some crazy things. The main goal is to set up a [Splendid Reclamation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Splendid+Reclamation) with a few [Retreats](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?action=advanced&output=spoiler&method=visual&name=+%5b%22Retreat%20to%22%5d) in play and a bunch of lands in the graveyard. Since the whole deck is basically built to 1) Have lands in the graveyard and 2) Play Retreats, it seems reasonable that the deck can accomplish that some percentage of the time.


[Jaddi Offshoot](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jaddi+Offshoot) is fantastic here, gaining life and blocking to give you time to assemble all of the Retreats. [The Gitrog Monster](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=The+Gitrog+Monster) gives you something more to do with all of those lands, and [Painful Truths](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Painful+Truths) is still one of the best draw spells in Standard, especially when you have so many ways to gain the life back.


You could also look at [Ghirapur Orrery](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ghirapur+Orrery) to add some extra spice to the deck that plays nicely with the lands theme, possibly over [Painful Truths](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Painful+Truths).


But whatever direction you take this deck, it is primed and ready for a run at a Standard Showdown or Friday Night *Magic*. Now where did I put all of my Retreats...
