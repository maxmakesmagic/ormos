**Magic** revolves around mages. **Magic** has wizards, shamans, clerics, druids, sorcerers, spellshapers, pyromancers, necromancers, cryomancers, ovinomancers, battlemages, task mages, guildmages, augermages, seers, sages, artificers, adepts, maguses, witches, thaumaturgists, illusionists, lobotomists, elementalists, hypnotists, and straight-up mages.


The topic of what mages *look* like could span many, many articles. But suffice it to say that a wizard in **Magic** doesn't have to be a shriveled white dude with a long beard and a pointy hat. In fact, in **Magic**, those are far outnumbered by dynamic, powerful mages of all shapes and sizes.


Check out the *Tenth Edition* art for Arcane Teachings next to its *Judgment* counterpart. Not only is the old art not a great fit for a red aura of fire and strength, it also doesn't communicate this sense of mages as beings of immense power and dynamic potential. In a game about spells, mages are the ultimate badasses.

Here are some *Tenth* cards that depict spellcasters in the way that nails the look of **Magic**'s powerful, badass, active mage.
