The best defense is a good offense.



 At this point in Level One, it's time to begin putting together the fundamental concepts of *Magic* which have been covered so far and learning concrete ways to apply them. This means looking at the complete picture—not just the gameplay of *Magic*, but at deck building as well.




 Deck building is also important in *Limited* formats (like [Sealed Deck](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/lo/sealed-deck-2014-09-15)), but the greater challenges—and rewards—come from deck building in *Constructed.* In Constructed formats (the most commonly played of which is [Standard](http://magic.wizards.com/en/content/standard-formats-magic-gathering)), the possibilities are virtually endless, as you may build your deck from any cards (that are [legal in the format](http://magic.wizards.com/en/gameinfo/gameplay/formats/bannedrestricted)) that you can get your hands on. The challenge becomes to hone in on a particular strategy, and to make sure every card you choose contributes to that strategy.




 Perhaps the simplest and most common strategy is to exploit [tempo](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/tempo-2014-09-22), covered last week. By building a fast deck geared toward playing and attacking with creatures quickly, you can put your opponents on the back foot right away and win lots of games with minimal resistance. We call these *aggro* (short for aggressive) decks.



The Importance of Tempo in Aggro Decks
======================================


With an aggro deck, your goal is to get ahead early and stay ahead until you either win the game or create an advantage large enough to leverage into a win. Tempo is your most important resource and ought to overshadow other concerns. Let's put this in the perspective of some of the other concepts we've touched on in Level One up to this point.



[Card advantage](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/lo/basics-card-advantage-2014-08-25) is a bigger concern for players aiming to play a long game. With an aggro deck, you want to be able to decide the game with your opening seven cards plus your first small handful of draw steps. You wouldn't turn down drawing extra cards if you could do so for free, but you cannot afford to sacrifice tempo in order to do it.



Your mana curve should be carefully built and as low to the ground as possible. If you cannot begin putting creatures into play in the first couple turns of the game, you risk losing the window where you could have developed your biggest advantage.



 Focus on *mana efficiency.* For every job that needs to be done, choose the cheapest (in terms of mana) option available to you. Ideally, you should spend less mana to deploy threats than your opponent spends to answer them. You should spend less mana answering threats than your opponent spends to deploy them. Do not invest tempo into cards like [Sandsteppe Citadel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sandsteppe+Citadel) and [Abzan Banner](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Abzan+Banner), since (hopefully) the games won't go long enough for such cards to be worth their initial investment.
