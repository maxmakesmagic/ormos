Happy Announcement Day!


Today we'll be announcing a slate of new sets and products coming out in the next year, including the next block and a slew of awesome supplemental products and sets.


As these sets don't release until next year, expect some of the information—primarily images, logos, and the like—to be filled in in the coming months.


Now the exciting part—what's coming up between now and mid-2017! Watch the video below for more information, then click on the links further down to get all of the details.

* "Rise Among the Worthy" on the plane of [*Amonkhet*](http://magic.wizards.com/en/content/amonkhet-info). Discover a world ruled by Nicol Bolas when the first set of the *Amonkhet* block releases April 28, 2017.
* Nicol Bolas is among the most powerful beings in the Multiverse—don't face him alone! Much like the original *Archenemy* release, [*Archenemy: Nicol Bolas*](http://magic.wizards.com/en/content/archenemy-nicol-bolas-info) pits you and two friends against a single powerful foe where you must work together to survive—or fall to Nicol Bolas himself.
* The second set in the *Amonkhet* block, [*Hour of Devastation*](http://magic.wizards.com/en/content/hour-devastation-info), releases July 14, 2017.
* In the same spirit as *Duel Decks: Anthology* and *Planechase Anthology*, [*Commander Anthology*](http://magic.wizards.com/en/content/commander-anthology-info) gathers four previous *Commander* products together in one convenient package, releasing June 9, 2017.
* Draft like a master once more as we release [*Modern Masters 2017 Edition*](http://magic.wizards.com/en/content/modern-masters-2017-info) March 17, 2017—featuring cards from *Eighth Edition* through *Magic 2014*, including new trips through *Innistrad* and *Return to Ravnica*.
* Brains or brawn? Cunning or strength? Test your guile and brute force with [*Duel Decks: Mind vs. Might*](http://magic.wizards.com/en/content/duel-decks-mind-might-info), releasing in March of 2017.
* Updates to [*Magic: The Gathering*: Puzzle Quest](https://d3go.com/a-new-kaladesh-themed-pvp-event-for-magic-the-gathering-puzzle-quest) are here, with *Kaladesh* content!
