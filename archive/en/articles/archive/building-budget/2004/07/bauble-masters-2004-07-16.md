![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/global/images/magic_expansion_5dn_expansionLogo_en.jpg)*It's here!*Finally, the day I have been waiting for has arrived! Even though *Fifth Dawn* has been out for paper cards for a short while now, the online versions of the cards are only now ready for play. So for all of you paper card slingers who were wondering why no *Fifth Dawn* was being included in my decks, now you know why! This column is primarily for the ***Magic** Online* players (hence the price of the deck in tickets), even though the decks can also be made for regular play. I have a lot of cool decks in store for the next few weeks that I have been saving up for the release, so stay tuned. 

The first deck I would like to talk about makes use of one of *Fifth Dawn's* interesting themes: Baubles. Now there have already been several thematic articles about baubles (also known as “cogs” by the R&D types) and their various uses, but I wanted to make a deck that used all those cool things in-game.

Thus I set forth on my bauble quest, and came to the conclusion that Blue and White are the colors best suited for doing powerful things with puny artifacts. [Artificer's Intuition](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Artificer%27s+Intuition) and [Auriok Salvagers](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Auriok+Salvagers) are probably the best Bauble engines. With a White/Blue base, the deck almost just fell right into place, using and reusing various 1 casting cost artifacts to create good board position. The result?

![Auriok Salvagers](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Auriok+Salvagers)This deck shows off what a 1 casting cost artifact can really do. The first and most obvious thing about the deck is the cool things you can do with [Auriok Salvagers](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Auriok+Salvagers) and [Aether Spellbomb](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aether+Spellbomb). It is rather easy to do and gives you the ability to bounce any creature for 4 mana. Feel free to [Condescend](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Condescend) the creature on its way back into play. [Trinket Mage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Trinket+Mage) and [Artificer's Intuition](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Artificer%27s+Intuition) give you access to many different tricks depending on what you need. If you need life, get [Sunbeam Spellbomb](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sunbeam+Spellbomb). If you need to kill some creatures, get [Viridian Longbow](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Viridian+Longbow). If you need to stop something from hitting you or just force in an attack, get [Leonin Bola](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leonin+Bola). Need Mana? Get an Artifact land or [Wayfarer's Bauble](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wayfarer%27s+Bauble). If you are just looking to put some good spells back into your deck ([Condescend](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Condescend) is a goodie) then use [Conjurer's Bauble](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Conjurer%27s+Bauble) over and over with the Salvagers.If there is one thing this deck is good at, it is going through cards. With all the baubles, it should be easy to thin your deck enough to find the key element, whether it be the Salvagers, [Artificer's Intuition](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Artificer%27s+Intuition), or something else. One of the really cool things you can do with [Artificer's Intuition](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Artificer%27s+Intuition) is get [Myr Servitor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Myr+Servitor)s with it, then discard the Servitors to get more…simply cast the last one and watch the other three pop back into play!

The basic plan of the deck is to stabilize by playing out [Leonin Squire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leonin+Squire)s and [Auriok Salvagers](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Auriok+Salvagers) while setting up some Bauble shenanigans. [Myr Servitor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Myr+Servitor)s are a great way to stop attackers, since you can easily block with all but one and watch the rest come back. Sometimes using [Sunbeam Spellbomb](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sunbeam+Spellbomb) or [Aether Spellbomb](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aether+Spellbomb) over and over again is enough. 

### Tips on Playing the Deck

* Don't be afraid to block with a [Leonin Squire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leonin+Squire) or [Trinket Mage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Trinket+Mage), stack damage, and then [Aether Spellbomb](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aether+Spellbomb) it back to your hand. In the case of [Leonin Squire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leonin+Squire), you can always get the Spellbomb back, and with [Trinket Mage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Trinket+Mage) you can find another.
* Use [Viridian Longbow](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Viridian+Longbow) to shoot down larger creatures by passing it to another untapped creature after each shot. If you have 6 mana and three creatures available (when the bow is already equipped on one of them), you can deal 3 damage!
* Use [Artificer's Intuition](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Artificer%27s+Intuition) to thin all of the artifact lands out of your deck. This will make your usage of [Conjurer's Bauble](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Conjurer%27s+Bauble) more noticeable since you will have a better chance of drawing the card you put back in.
* Don't forget you have two [Great Furnace](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Great+Furnace)s and a [Pyrite Spellbomb](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyrite+Spellbomb) in case you need some quick burn. If you already have enough Blue and White mana, it might not be a bad idea to make it the next mana source you fetch up with [Artificer's Intuition](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Artificer%27s+Intuition) or [Trinket Mage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Trinket+Mage) just in case you need an emergency 2 damage to kill something. Reusing the [Pyrite Spellbomb](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyrite+Spellbomb) over and over again can be very effective.
* You may have to win many of your games through using [Pyrite Spellbomb](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyrite+Spellbomb) on your opponent over and over, or pinging them many times with a [Viridian Longbow](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Viridian+Longbow).

### Adding Money to the Deck

![Pristine Angel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Pristine+Angel)[Pristine Angel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pristine+Angel) would be a great add to this deck, as it would really eliminate the need to ping your opponents to death. The Angel knows how to put a good clock on. [Thirst for Knowledge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thirst+for+Knowledge) would also be a nice addition to this deck. Even though it has many ways to draw cards, it doesn't have many ways to do it as an instant, and [Thirst For Knowledge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thirst+For+Knowledge) would also help if you were already adding [Pristine Angel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pristine+Angel)s. Strangely enough I think [Beacon of Tomorrows](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Beacon+of+Tomorrows) would be a really cool card to add, since you will often be able to whittle down your deck to only one card via all the card drawing and thinning, and then you can take infinite turns. I don't know about you, but I would really enjoy infinite turns…Overall this deck is cool and effective, I recommend it!

Until next time, [Urza's Bauble](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Urza%2527s%2BBauble) and hope it isn't [Necropotence](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Necropotence).
