Let Richard Hagon be your guide through [Pro Tour–Kyoto](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/nassif-greater-power), the first Pro Tour of the 2009 season. If you're not a regular reader of event coverage, this is a great starting place to learn the top players and storylines that have shaped this season. With exclusive player interviews, analysis of deckbuilding strategies, explanations of formats and the PT season, and much more, it's a cornucopia of information. 



**PRO TOUR–KYOTO**




You can listen to each segment in the player to the right, or you can click on the link to listen to the file in your browser or right-click Save As to download to your computer. If you have iTunes installed on your computer, [click here](http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewPodcast?id=80538924) and you'll be directed to the **Magic: The Gathering** podcast in the iTunes directory.





* [**Kyoto in Review, plus Nassif Interview**](http://webcast2.wizards.com/podcasts/09kyoto/kyoto_highlights.mp3) (19.0 MB)

Want to re-live the excitement that was Pro Tour–Kyoto? From Luis Scott-Vargas's amazing start to the changing Standard metagame all the way to Gabriel Nassif's historic victory, it's all right here—including an in-depth interview with Nassif just moments after he hoisted the winner's trophy.





* [**Saturday, 7:15 p.m.: The End of the Line**](http://webcast2.wizards.com/podcasts/09kyoto/kyoto_4.mp3) (14.8 MB)

Here it is then, the pure unvarnished truth. With one round to go, all six players in the Arena knew that a win would see them come back for Super Sunday, and a loss would leave them on the sidelines. Join us then for all the action as Jan Ruess and Yann Massicard, Gabriel Nassif and Brian Kowal, and Brian Robinson and Ari Lax go head-to-head. Interviews with some very happy winners, and the Top 8 is revealed as we head for the first Top 8 of the Pro Tour season.





* [**Saturday, 4:30 p.m.: Cloudgoat Ranger and Chums (or God's Own Country gives the Colonies a Kicking)**](http://webcast2.wizards.com/podcasts/09kyoto/kyoto_fight.mp3) (1.9 MB)

As some of you may know, I'm English. Amongst assorted fringe benefits, we understand irony better than anyone on Earth. We understand that for some of you, we're an island of bowler-hat wearing, umbrella-swinging, hair-gelled upper-class toffs, with servants at our beck and call, catering to our every aristocratic whim. To be honest, that's not a stereotype most of us would recognise as the face of modern Britain. In my case, of course, it's absolutely true.


In the spirit therefore of the great British broadcasters of the past, we're delighted to offer you a window into the 1930's, as we show you what a top table match might have sounded like between the star of the show Luis Scott-Vargas and the leading British contender Matteo Orsini-Jones. 


We would like to make it clear that our collective tongue was wedged so firmly in our cheeks for the creation of this piece that actual surgical procedures were required. Thank you.





* [**Saturday, 12:59 p.m.: Once More Into the Breach**](http://webcast2.wizards.com/podcasts/09kyoto/kyoto_3.mp3) (15.3 MB)

Round Nine is upon us, and 186 players are still competing here on Day Two. In the Arena, Charles Gindy and Cedric Phillips of the United States are locked in mortal combat at 6-2. Next door Shouta Yasooka and Akimasa Yamamoto of Japan are looking to move up to 8-1. And in our third marquee matchup, American Brian Robinson will look to prevent the only undefeated player left in the building from extending that astonishing run. And who is that mighty annihilator of worlds? Luis Scott-Vargas. Three killer matchups brought to you from a ringside seat.





* [**Friday, 7:45 p.m.: Inside the Arena**](http://webcast2.wizards.com/podcasts/09kyoto/kyoto_2.mp3) (13.3 MB)

 So here it is, straight from the Arena, where two of the three undefeated players heading into Day Two would be determined. Some surprising names were showcased in this final round, but nobody could dispute their right to stand apart from their peers, having assembled the perfect first half. Now the challenge becomes the holding onto of their precious lead. We're cranking through the gears as the pace starts to quicken. All the action is just a click away.





* [**Friday, 12:03 p.m.: The Metagame Plus One**](http://webcast2.wizards.com/podcasts/09kyoto/kyoto_1.mp3) (16.9 MB)

 The first Pro Tour of the year is under way, and we talk to dozens of the big names as they prepare for four rounds of Standard to get us going with a bang. Kithkin, Red/White, Faeires, Blightning Beatdown, Five-color Control...will there be surprises? We take the measure of the early metagame, and bring you tales from the first skirmishes. One hour of **Magic**  goodness direct to you...
