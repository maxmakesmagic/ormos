R*eturn to Ravnica* block in Standard has proven a fluid and flexible set of sets. At the start of the season, RWU was all about porting miracles from *Innistrad* block and locking down the board with the tag team of [Jace, Architect of Thought](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace%2C+Architect+of+Thought) and [Tamiyo, the Moon Sage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tamiyo%2C+the+Moon+Sage)... [Pillar of Flame](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pillar+of+Flame) as a red splash was largely there as a foil to [Geralf's Messenger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Geralf%27s+Messenger) and [Gravecrawler](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gravecrawler). RWU has reinvented itself into a variety of styles... from an aggro deck with [Geist of Saint Traft](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Geist+of+Saint+Traft) and [Thundermaw Hellkite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thundermaw+Hellkite) to a flash deck based around two-drop Wizards and permission spells to a variety of [Boros Reckoner](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Boros+Reckoner) strategies (including an infinite-life combo deck). 

[Boros Reckoner](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Boros+Reckoner) itself has proven to be an amazing tool in Standard; promoting not just an infinite life sequence but the "brain you for 13" combination with [Blasphemous Act](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blasphemous+Act). In The Aristocrats, those cards linked arms to give [Tom Martell a PT victory](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/magazine/article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/eventcoverage/ptgtc13/welcome), and that WBR deck has continued to evolve via the good work of [Jake Van Lunen](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Archive.aspx?author=Jacob%20Van%20Lunen), Brad Nelson, and a host of inheritors. 

 Naya has had some of the wildest swings in the format, manifesting as Midrange, Ramp, and mono-aggro Blitz decks, all. When [Loxodon Smiter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Loxodon+Smiter) was previewed, it seemed like an aggro player's dream—a 4/4 creature for only three mana—but [Loxodon Smiter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Loxodon+Smiter) has done more good work as a blocker of beatdown creatures than an active attacker; many sorts of Naya decks remain active and successful. 

Let's look at some of these moves from the most recent Standard Open...
