When fleshing out a Dragon deck, you'll probably want some cheaper cards that aren't Dragons, but still fit the theme.


There have been four artifacts printed in **Magic** that have the word "Dragon" in their titles:

![Dragon Mask](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Dragon+Mask)



![Dragon Blood](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Dragon+Blood)

![Dragon Arch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Dragon+Arch)

*[Dragon Engine](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragon+Engine) from* Antiquities, *[Dragon Mask](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragon+Mask) from* Visions, *[Dragon Blood](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragon+Blood) from* Urza's Saga, *and [Dragon Arch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragon+Arch) from* Apocalypse.
Besides those four, the only other tournament-legal card that has the word "Dragon" in its title is *Onslaught*'s [Dragon Roost](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragon+Roost).
