Hello and welcome to the first week of ***Magic** 2011* previews! Now that the core set changes its gears every summer, we as **Magic** players get a different three-symbol code per July. For example, this one is "M11," and last year's core set was "M10." Personally, I can't wait for ***Magic** 2016*, so I can uncork my cache of James Bond jokes.

Seriously though, the core set is **Magic**'s time to shine at its most flavorful and fun, with straightforward concepts representing what magical fantasy is all about. Just check out Mark Rosewater's [preview card](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/mm/97) from Monday. A giant, feisty, and blue-defying Elemental of massive force! Or how about Hoarding Dragon, from the quickly expanding [Visual Spoiler](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/tcg/article.aspx?x=mtg/tcg/magic2011/spoiler)? This dragon hoards its treasures and defends them to the death. I can't be the only one who caught a whiff of Smaug there.
