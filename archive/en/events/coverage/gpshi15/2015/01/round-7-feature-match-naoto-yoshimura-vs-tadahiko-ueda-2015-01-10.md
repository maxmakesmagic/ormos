Naoto Yoshimura dethroned the previous King of the Hill in Round 6, and is looking to “pull a Mengucci” and ride the Royal Chair to a Top 8 berth. Standing in his way is Tadahiko Ueda, hoping to earn himself the title of Kingslayer.


The Matchup
===========


Both players have slow decks looking to grind out advantage and seize the endgame. Yoshimura’s 5-color special has to be given the edge thanks to its stable manabase and sheer number of haymakers. Ueda’s more “fair” deck will have to capitalize early.


The Games
=========


Yoshimura made his polychromatic bent known early after rolling out [Opulent Palace](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Opulent+Palace), [Rugged Highlands](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rugged+Highlands), and a basic plains. Ueda brought out an Ainok Bond-kin, then grew it to a 3/2 and played a late [Disowned Ancestor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Disowned+Ancestor). Yoshimura got out a morph and then [Sultai Soothsayer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sultai+Soothsayer) while Ueda worked to make his crew bigger.

Facing little pressure and already ahead on cards, Yoshimura went big with [Ivorytusk Fortress](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ivorytusk+Fortress). Ueda did little to hide his dismay. He still had nothing to contribute to the board. He mentally crossed his fingers that the 2/6 Ancestor would hold long enough for him to draw into action. It was all in vain, of course. Yoshimura cleared it out of the way with [Savage Punch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Savage+Punch) and swung in with his whole team, unmorphing Pinewalker with the last of his mana. Ueda drew, then revealed a hand completely choked with lands.


**Yoshimura 1 – Ueda 0**


In the second game, Udea got ahead in an early morph skirmish when [Feat of Resistance](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Feat+of+Resistance) let his mystery creature overcome what turned out to be a [Sage-Eye Harrier](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sage-Eye+Harrier). Yoshimura simply untapped and cast [Mardu Charm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mardu+Charm) to crush whatever momentary joy Ueda had. Ueda shook it off and cast Rakshasa’s Secret.

Now, I don’t know about you, but if my opponent were to discard [Debilitating Injury](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Debilitating+Injury) and [Bitter Revelation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bitter+Revelation) from a five-card hand in that spot – sitting on four lands and all five colors – I would probably get up from the table and leave the tournament immediately. There’s no way I have the mental fortitude to endure what is sure to be a beating of the highest order. Ueda is made of stronger stuff than I. He watched as Yoshimura brought out [Ivorytusk Fortress](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ivorytusk+Fortress) for an encore, this time following up with [Sultai Soothsayer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sultai+Soothsayer) and [Siege Rhino](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Siege+Rhino). [Dazzling Ramparts](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dazzling+Ramparts) bought him a little time, but again his deck failed him.


**Naoto Yoshimura defeats Tadahiko Ueda 2 – 0**


The Aftermath
=============


Yoshimura couldn’t resist turning over the cards left in his hand: [Butcher of the Horde](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Butcher+of+the+Horde) and [Sagu Mauler](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sagu+Mauler). All the colors of the beatdown rainbow.


He also showed his extensive sideboarding. He had taken out most of his deck’s early plays, and in their place added [Kill Shot](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kill+Shot), [Mardu Charm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mardu+Charm), [Bitter Revelation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bitter+Revelation) and [Flying Crane Technique](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flying+Crane+Technique), further tuning his deck towards the long game. Ueda could only shake his head at the overwhelming power in Yoshimura’s deck.
