First of all, thanks for the flood of e-mails I received wishing me congratulations on my impending daughter. She's not here yet, at least at the time of me submitting this article. Since the due date was last Thursday, though, it figures to be soon. Expect lots of sleep-deprived babbling from me in the coming months.


Now, back to the final installment of my [Blood Clock](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Clock) deck evolution. You all had a bunch of great suggestions on the Message Boards, many of which lined up exactly with my own thinking on the deck. I think some of what I do today will be a surprise, but I'm happy to see that it won't be as surprising as I had originally feared.


If you need a refresher, [go here](/en/articles/archive/building-budget/blood-clock-five-bloody-clocks-2005-08-08) and read about why I'm focusing on [Blood Clock](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Clock), then [go here](http://boards1.wizards.com/showthread.php?t=481725) to see where the deck has meandered up until today. What you'll see is that I took a Monoblack [Blood Clock](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Clock) deck focused on discard and [Thief of Hope](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thief+of+Hope) and added [Choice of Damnations](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Choice+of+Damnations) and Green for mana-acceleration, yielding this decklist: 








#### Black Clock v.2.0

Last week I played ten games with this decklist and made the following observations:


* My deck is prone to mana-flooding.
* My deck can't deal with [Kodama of the North Tree](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kodama+of+the+North+Tree).
* My deck can't deal with [Umezawa's Jitte](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Umezawa%27s+Jitte).
* My deck has a hard time with fliers.
* [Blood Clock](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Clock) and [Choice of Damnations](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Choice+of+Damnations) are real skill-testers for my opponents.
* I love the Green acceleration.
* I still love [Choice of Damnations](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Choice+of+Damnations) and [Thief of Hope](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thief+of+Hope).
* I'm a little dubious of [Wicked Akuba](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wicked+Akuba) because it seems like the one true beatdown card in the deck.
* I haven't drawn [Death of a Thousand Stings](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Death+of+a+Thousand+Stings) once since dropping to a single copy.

[Kodama of the North Tree](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kodama+of+the+North+Tree) is a problem without a lot of answers. People have suggested [Psychic Spear](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psychic+Spear), which is a good sideboard option (I get hung up on the fact that it's not arcane, sadly). For [Umezawa's Jitte](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Umezawa%27s+Jitte), suggestions have been primarily [Manriki-Gusari](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Manriki-Gusari) and [Wear Away](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wear+Away). I'm not sure my deck has enough creatures to make [Manriki-Gusari](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Manriki-Gusari) worth it, but save the [Wear Away](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wear+Away) idea for another five games or so. Right now I'm going to focus on the mana-flooding issue and my discomfort with [Wicked Akuba](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wicked+Akuba).


*OUT*: 3 [Horobi's Whisper](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Horobi%27s+Whisper)


It's arcane, which is a definite improvement over [Kiku's Shadow](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kiku%27s+Shadow). It's also an instant, which I like. However, I've noticed two things: First, my instincts that a lot of people play Black in the Casual Decks room seems valid. Black Hand decks are everywhere, as is [Kokusho, the Evening Star](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kokusho%2C+the+Evening+Star), [Nezumi Graverobber](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nezumi+Graverobber), and Oni of all shapes and sizes. As a result, it would be nice to have removal that actually, you know, removed stuff. Second, it turns out that the splice cost hurts me a lot more than I had expected. Between soulshift, [Soulless Revival](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soulless+Revival), and [Death of a Thousand Stings](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Death+of+a+Thousand+Stings) I find that picking four cards to remove from the game is sometimes hard. I would consider [Hideous Laughter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hideous+Laughter) as a replacement (and it's still in my mind as a possibility), but I think another card may fit the deck even better.


*IN*: 3 [Swallowing Plague](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swallowing+Plague)


![Swallowing Plague](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Swallowing+Plague)[Swallowing Plague](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swallowing+Plague) kills Black creatures. More importantly, [Swallowing Plague](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swallowing+Plague) is terrific in a deck that uses its own life as a resource and one that can generate a lot of mana. Those mana-flooding situations become a lot more bearable if I can gain ten life from killing a creature and thus give myself some time to draw a non-land card. [Blood Clock](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Clock) decisions become all the more easy with that ten life under my belt as well. As a minor benefit, it's also a card I could use on my own creatures in a pinch versus a deck like [Ire of Kaminari](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ire+of+Kaminari). It still won't kill [Kodama of the North Tree](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kodama+of+the+North+Tree), but the hope is that it better fits into what my deck wants to do than [Horobi's Whisper](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Horobi%27s+Whisper).
 *IN*: 3 [Hana Kami](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hana+Kami)


This should come as no surprise. Any deck with Green that uses even a few quality arcane cards has to seriously consider [Hana Kami](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hana+Kami). For my deck in particular, [Hana Kami](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hana+Kami) allows for recurring mana-acceleration ([Kodama's Reach](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kodama%27s+Reach)), discard ([Waking Nightmare](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Waking+Nightmare)), creature removal and lifegain ([Swallowing Plague](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swallowing+Plague)), and--the kicker--[Choice of Damnations](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Choice+of+Damnations). Don't forget that [Thief of Hope](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thief+of+Hope) will trigger on all of these cards, including [Hana Kami](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hana+Kami) herself. Speaking of the Thief, it and [Soulless Revival](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soulless+Revival) can both bring [Hana Kami](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hana+Kami) back from the grave to do its trickery a second time. All in all, I think [Hana Kami](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hana+Kami) is the only obvious maindeck Green card to add to my formerly-monoblack deck other than mana acceleration.


*OUT*: 2 [Wicked Akuba](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wicked+Akuba)


The thing about having four [Wicked Akuba](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wicked+Akuba) in my deck is that it randomly allowed me to play like a beatdown player. One of the express purposes of this deck was to avoid a straight beatdown deck, so this has always made me a little uncomfortable. The reason it was originally in the deck was to act as a finisher once I had lots of land on the table and my opponent had taken damage from [Blood Clock](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Clock). Having two copies neuters the beatdown capabilities while keeping the Akuba in its initial role. I'm not sure those last two copies will stick around, but for now I feel more comfortable with the deck knowing they're there.


*OUT*: 1 Swamp


When mana flooded, start lowering your mana sources and see what happens. I don't know if one land is enough to drop, but it's a start. 


I'm now here:

![](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Swamp)


















Let's see how this sucker plays...


*Game 21: Blue/Green Arcane*


![Cloudhoof Kirin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Cloudhoof+Kirin)His primary plan, it seemed, was to use [Consuming Vortex](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Consuming+Vortex), [Psychic Puppetry](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psychic+Puppetry), and [Vital Surge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vital+Surge) to keep him alive with [Dampen Thought](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dampen+Thought) and [Cloudhoof Kirin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloudhoof+Kirin) as the victory conditions. I think my first-turn [Hana Kami](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hana+Kami) scared him off of [Dampen Thought](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dampen+Thought), and he used his tapping very liberally against pretty small guys. In any case, I got a [Thief of Hope](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thief+of+Hope) and [Blood Clock](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Clock) in the first four turns, then played a second Clock and [Kodama's Reach](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kodama%27s+Reach). He paid life instead of bouncing his own land, with me having [Thief of Hope](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thief+of+Hope) on offense and a bouncing [Hana Kami](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hana+Kami) stealing more life. He eventually spliced, then cast [Wear Away](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wear+Away) to kill both of my Clocks but the damage was already done. With all of my land I put down a second Thief and used [Waking Nightmare](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Waking+Nightmare) twice to empty his hand of arcane cards. After that he could only topdeck land, and I won easily.
 *Game 22: Green/Black/Blue Control*


His deck used the same mana-acceleration engine as me, along with [Nezumi Graverobber](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nezumi+Graverobber), [Heartbeat of Spring](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Heartbeat+of+Spring), [Time Stop](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Time+Stop), [Overwhelming Intellect](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Overwhelming+Intellect), and a host of other bad-boy spells. I had another first-turn [Hana Kami](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hana+Kami) to match his [Sakura-Tribe Elder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sakura-Tribe+Elder). He then got a Graverobber while I got [Thief of Hope](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thief+of+Hope). The Graverobber flipped into Nighteyes the Desecrator after killing my [Kodama's Reach](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kodama%27s+Reach) at about the same time I played [Blood Clock](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Clock). Nighteyes hit me twice, then I tried to play [Kemuri-Onna](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kemuri-Onna) only to have it stopped by [Overwhelming Intellect](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Overwhelming+Intellect). The [Kemuri-Onna](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kemuri-Onna) joined my opponent's team and things started to look grim. The good news was that I was eating into his life via [Blood Clock](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Clock) and Thief, and then I got him to lose eight life with [Choice of Damnations](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Choice+of+Damnations). At two life my opponent decided it was best to not let me untap with my Thief and [Hana Kami](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hana+Kami), so he played [Heartbeat of Spring](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Heartbeat+of+Spring), then Sway of Stars floating four mana. We started our new game, him getting Forest and [Sakura-Tribe Elder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sakura-Tribe+Elder), then mana-burning down to five life. I had a nice hand that allowed for a third-turn [Thief of Hope](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thief+of+Hope), followed by [Blood Clock](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Clock) and [Kodama's Reach](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kodama%27s+Reach). My opponent tapped out for a 14/14 [Masumaro, First to Live](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Masumaro%2C+First+to+Live), but I untapped, played a second [Thief of Hope](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thief+of+Hope) and [Wicked Akuba](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wicked+Akuba) for the win. Neat.


*Game 23: Monoblue [Dampen Thought](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dampen+Thought) deck*


![Dampen Thought](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Dampen+Thought)This may be one of the few decks I've made where I actually enjoy playing against near-creatureless or creatureless decks. Oh sure, I drew a fairly useless [Swallowing Plague](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swallowing+Plague), but I also got a [Blood Clock](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Clock) on Turn 4 while a [Sakura-Tribe Elder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sakura-Tribe+Elder) and [Thief of Hope](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thief+of+Hope) were on the attack. When I played the Clock, my opponent had exactly three Islands on his side of the table. He took two damage from [Blood Clock](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Clock) for three turns while I attacked for three and did one or two extra with my Thief each turn. He tried [Dampen Thought](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dampen+Thought) on me a combined four times, but there was no way he was going to win that race. A [Waking Nightmare](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Waking+Nightmare) got rid of two [Cloudhoof Kirin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloudhoof+Kirin), then [Wicked Akuba](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wicked+Akuba) finished the game.
 *Game 24: Monoblack Control*


This game was so beautiful I could cry. Chris Romeo (RightField), friend and fellow budget-deck writer, showed up with a deck that had wrecked me the week before using no creatures besides [Kiku, Night's Flower](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kiku%2C+Night%27s+Flower) and [Genju of the Fens](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Genju+of+the+Fens) to go along with massive amounts of creature control and discard. His first-turn [Psychic Spear](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psychic+Spear) nabbed my [Kemuri-Onna](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kemuri-Onna), but I was able to play two [Kodama's Reach](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kodama%27s+Reach) to give me plenty of land and to put down two [Blood Clock](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Clock)s. Chris, meanwhile, had two Genju, Kiku, and a mess of Swamps. He was eating into my life when I was able to play [Swallowing Plague](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swallowing+Plague) on his Kiku to gain seven life and bring me back up to fifteen. That was just the pad I needed. 


Although he had used another [Psychic Spear](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psychic+Spear) to get [Choice of Damnations](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Choice+of+Damnations), I drew [Hana Kami](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hana+Kami) with just enough mana to get it back and play it. Chris dropped down to five permanents (from nine), keeping up a modest attack to drop me to around eight life. I drew another [Hana Kami](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hana+Kami) for the same trick, this time bringing him down to four permanents (from six). [Thief of Hope](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thief+of+Hope) came next, which blocked his Genju to bring back [Hana Kami](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hana+Kami) and do the whole thing over again. This time Chris went down to two permanents (from four) since he only had three life. Both of his Swamps popped back to hand on the next turn, and he conceded with me at a fairly comfortable seven life (yay [Swallowing Plague](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swallowing+Plague)!). It was counter-intuitive for me to keep choosing the permanent-loss over life-loss that would have brought him to one or two life, but I was sure he would kill me with his Genju if I didn't limit his resources. Two [Blood Clock](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Clock)s on the table helped this decision quite a bit, too.


*Game 25: Monored Aggro*


![Adamaro, First to Desire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Adamaro%2C+First+to+Desire)Manaflooding strikes again! I had a tremendous start with [Ghost-Lit Stalker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ghost-Lit+Stalker), [Sakura-Tribe Elder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sakura-Tribe+Elder) and a third-turn [Blood Clock](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Clock). My opponent, meanwhile, had two Mountains. He rightly elected to take damage for a while, getting [Adamaro, First to Desire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Adamaro%2C+First+to+Desire), [Hearth Kami](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hearth+Kami), and four land. I was digging through my deck like crazy, using two [Kodama's Reach](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kodama%27s+Reach)es plus a third brought back via [Hana Kami](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hana+Kami). My blockers were all burned away, including a [Kemuri-Onna](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kemuri-Onna). I was able to kill his [Hearth Kami](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hearth+Kami) with a blocker and keep Adamaro to 1/1 or 2/2 the entire game, but then [Genju of the Spires](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Genju+of+the+Spires) showed up. I kept hoping to kill Adamaro by emptying my hand, but I kept drawing land with a land in hand, making it impossible. Two hits with the Genju and a 1/1 Adamaro, coupled with a [Lava Spike](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lava+Spike) finished me off. I looked at the top four cards of my library: Three land, then [Thief of Hope](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thief+of+Hope). Yuck. 
 ### An Eerie Toolbox


4-1 is looking better; the deck is now officially competitive in most of my games. Still, it's got some holes. The mana-flooding is still an issue, but reduced from before. Remember my troubles with fliers, [Umezawa's Jitte](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Umezawa%27s+Jitte), [Kodama of the North Tree](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kodama+of+the+North+Tree), and let's throw in Hondens? I haven't addressed any of those yet. 


Here are the easy changes:


*OUT*: 2 [Wicked Akuba](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wicked+Akuba)


If you couldn't guess, the writing was on the wall for [Wicked Akuba](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wicked+Akuba) when I added green to the deck. The writing might have been on the wall when I declared I wanted to make a control deck. As much as I would like to think of him as a finisher--a role he can play rather admirably in this deck, truth be told--I know in my heart of hearts that if the deck is doing its thing with [Blood Clock](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Clock) I don't actually need a finisher beyond [Choice of Damnations](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Choice+of+Damnations). In fact, I shouldn't need the attack phase at all. Instead, my deck needs to shore up its defense and ensure that I can control the game in its latter stages.


*IN*: 1 [Hana Kami](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hana+Kami)


![Hana Kami](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Hana+Kami)I have loved [Hana Kami](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hana+Kami) every time I've drawn it. That is one spiffy flower. It's nice to have another one-mana bounce target for [Blood Clock](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Clock) (and, unlike [Ghost-Lit Stalker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ghost-Lit+Stalker), one that doesn't need to ever tap), it's nice to return all of my arcane cards, it's nice to trigger [Thief of Hope](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thief+of+Hope) as a Spirit, it's nice to pretend I have more than two copies of [Choice of Damnations](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Choice+of+Damnations)... It's just nice. 
 *IN*: 1 [Wear Away](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wear+Away)


I knew I wanted [Wear Away](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wear+Away) in my deck as an answer to [Umezawa's Jitte](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Umezawa%27s+Jitte), Hondens, [Night of Souls' Betrayal](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Night+of+Souls%27+Betrayal), and any number of other problematic cards in *Kamigawa* Block Constructed. The question for me was how many copies? Four seemed like assuredly too much, and even with three it felt like they would get stuck in hand far too often. Two copies felt about right, but in the times I needed [Wear Away](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wear+Away) I was going to need it too badly to pray for only one of two copies to appear. It was a mental puzzle, and one that stumped me for a good half day.


Then I realized that [Sakura-Tribe Elder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sakura-Tribe+Elder) and [Kodama's Reach](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kodama%27s+Reach) make splashing a third color ridiculously easy. Why not put in a tutor for [Wear Away](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wear+Away), I thought? So I added...


*IN*: 2 [Eerie Procession](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eerie+Procession)  
*IN*: 1 Island


![Eerie Procession](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Eerie+Procession)Now I have a way to find [Wear Away](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wear+Away) when I need it without flooding my hand with extra copies of [Wear Away](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wear+Away) when I don't need it. This also gives me the illusion of having four [Choice of Damnations](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Choice+of+Damnations) in my deck since when I want to start plugging away under an active [Blood Clock](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Clock) I can do so. [Eerie Procession](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eerie+Procession) is arcane itself, which triggers [Thief of Hope](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thief+of+Hope) and is a target for [Hana Kami](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hana+Kami). More important than all of these features, though, is the fact that if this works out it opens the deck up to things like [Hideous Laughter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hideous+Laughter) and other situational cards that can be huge game-swingers. My deck is very crammed for space with [Blood Clock](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Clock), [Thief of Hope](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thief+of+Hope), cheap Spirits, and arcane cards. [Eerie Procession](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eerie+Procession)--like any “toolbox” tutor approach--allows me to do more things with fewer dedicated card slots.
 *OUT*: 1 Swamp


I'm taking out a Swamp because I have never found early Forests to be a problem whereas I get stressed out if I see all Swamps early. The fourth [Hana Kami](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hana+Kami) and the loss of [Wicked Akuba](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wicked+Akuba) only solidifies that Green mana is becoming as important as Black in my deck.


*OUT*: 1 [Ghost-Lit Stalker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ghost-Lit+Stalker)


I don't like dropping to two copies of [Ghost-Lit Stalker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ghost-Lit+Stalker) because overall he's been a lot more useful than not. My reason for doing so is that [Hana Kami](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hana+Kami) is a better bounce outlet for [Blood Clock](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Clock) because it doesn't need to tap to be useful and because seven one-mana Spirits feels like a bit too much. 


*OUT*: 1 [Death of a Thousand Stings](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Death+of+a+Thousand+Stings)


It's a shame. I was really committed to keeping [Death of a Thousand Stings](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Death+of+a+Thousand+Stings) in my deck. It was a pet card, one I was always happy to draw and even happier to play. So why drop it? Mostly because I think the costs of dropping any other cards in the deck outweigh the loss of [Death of a Thousand Stings](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Death+of+a+Thousand+Stings). I could go down to two [Waking Nightmare](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Waking+Nightmare)s, or drop [Ghost-Lit Stalker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ghost-Lit+Stalker) altogether, or drop another land and hope my deck can survive on twenty-one land. None of that feels right, though. If I drop either [Waking Nightmare](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Waking+Nightmare) or my Stalkers, it will because another card is pounding on the table and demanding to be used. [Death of a Thousand Stings](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Death+of+a+Thousand+Stings) is the nice guy on the team who can't play very well. I like him, but at some point he's got to go.


My deck now looks thus:

![](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Swamp)


















Boy howdy, my decklist is looking weird! 


*Game 26: White/Red Legends*


![Day of Destiny](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Day+of+Destiny)He got out some Plains, [Kitsune Blademaster](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kitsune+Blademaster), and a [Day of Destiny](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Day+of+Destiny) which he admitted was a slow start. I took advantage of it, playing [Hana Kami](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hana+Kami), two [Kodama's Reach](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kodama%27s+Reach)es, [Blood Clock](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Clock) and [Thief of Hope](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thief+of+Hope). He kept bouncing his fourth land while I kept bouncing [Hana Kami](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hana+Kami). I tried a huge [Swallowing Plague](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swallowing+Plague) on his Blademaster but he had [Blessed Breath](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blessed+Breath). Then I played [Choice of Damnations](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Choice+of+Damnations) on him, making him lose five life. Then [Hana Kami](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hana+Kami) brought it back. When I cast Choice a second time, I spliced [Soulless Revival](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soulless+Revival) onto it to get back [Hana Kami](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hana+Kami). After that my opponent started to lose resources a lot faster than he could play them. He went down to one Plains and two Blademasters, but I had twenty-six life and could easily absorb the blows. Once he was down to three permanents, my Clock-Choice-Hana-Revival combo killed him quickly. He showed me a hand of all [Brothers Yamazaki](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brothers+Yamazaki) and expensive White legends.
 *Game 27: Monored Aggro*


I got stuck on three land for several turns without any mana-accelerators, which was a very scary place to be given that he had [Ember-Fist Zubera](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ember-Fist+Zubera), [Akki Blizzard-Herder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Akki+Blizzard-Herder), and [Hearth Kami](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hearth+Kami) on offense. He also only had two Mountains, though, which turns out to be a huge boon in my favor since he was unwilling to put his Goblin in harm's way and unable to cast [Stone Rain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stone+Rain). It also meant my [Thief of Hope](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thief+of+Hope) survived long enough to give me life via [Ghost-Lit Stalker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ghost-Lit+Stalker) and another Thief before dying. I killed the [Hearth Kami](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hearth+Kami) with a blocking Stalker. I eventually found a fourth land and used [Swallowing Plague](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swallowing+Plague) on his Zubera, then played [Blood Clock](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Clock). My Stalker bounced and came back, then I used [Eerie Procession](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eerie+Procession) (first time!) for [Kodama's Reach](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kodama%27s+Reach). My opponent had four land now after taking Clock damage but it was too late. Another Plague killed his Blizzard-Herder, and we both went down a land with [Blood Clock](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Clock) on the table. I reached five land and [Kemuri-Onna](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kemuri-Onna), then played a second Clock and my opponent conceded with one solitary Mountain on the table.


*Game 28: Green/Red Spirits*


![Kemuri-Onna](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Kemuri-Onna)This one actually wasn't much like [my Soul Train deck](/en/articles/archive/building-budget/interlude-budget-saviors-2005-08-01), since he used [Blademane Baku](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blademane+Baku), [Hanabi Blast](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hanabi+Blast), [Elder Pine of Jukai](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elder+Pine+of+Jukai), and [O-Naginata](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=O-Naginata), among other things. Anyway, he got out a Baku and I held it off with first a [Ghost-Lit Stalker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ghost-Lit+Stalker), then [Kemuri-Onna](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kemuri-Onna). I cast a [Swallowing Plague](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swallowing+Plague) for three at his [Elder Pine of Jukai](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elder+Pine+of+Jukai), then my [Kemuri-Onna](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kemuri-Onna) died to a blocking [Blademane Baku](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blademane+Baku). [Thief of Hope](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thief+of+Hope) and [Blood Clock](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Clock) followed, gaining me life via [Hana Kami](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hana+Kami). My opponent bounced his [O-Naginata](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=O-Naginata) for a few turns, then killed my Thief (returning my Stalker) and my [Hana Kami](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hana+Kami) (returning [Swallowing Plague](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swallowing+Plague)). Thanks to a [Kodama's Reach](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kodama%27s+Reach) I had mana to cast [Eerie Procession](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eerie+Procession) for [Choice of Damnations](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Choice+of+Damnations). The Choice brought him down to five life while I had two [Sakura-Tribe Elder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sakura-Tribe+Elder)s on offense. He killed both Elders with burn, but when I used [Hana Kami](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hana+Kami) to return [Choice of Damnations](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Choice+of+Damnations) my opponent conceded. 
 *Game 29: Red/Blue Aggro-Control*


His deck was cool and he was a heck of a player. When he cast a first-turn [Teardrop Kami](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Teardrop+Kami) I was intrigued. I figured it might be a Ninja deck so I blocked with my [Ghost-Lit Stalker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ghost-Lit+Stalker). Sure enough, several turns later his [Ghost-Lit Warder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ghost-Lit+Warder) became a [Ninja of the Deep Hours](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ninja+of+the+Deep+Hours). I had a pretty poor start, with two [Hana Kami](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hana+Kami) but no arcane cards to cast. Eventually I got [Thief of Hope](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thief+of+Hope), [Blood Clock](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Clock), and [Choice of Damnations](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Choice+of+Damnations), bringing him down to eight life. By that point he had a slew of land, the Ninja, [Goblin Cohort](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Cohort), and a [Frostling](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Frostling). Spliced [Glacial Ray](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glacial+Ray)s and the [Frostling](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Frostling) took out my team, and after an attack a 6/6 [Soramaro, First to Dream](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soramaro%2C+First+to+Dream) hit the table. I cast a recurred [Choice of Damnations](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Choice+of+Damnations) to bring him to four permanents, he took [Blood Clock](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Clock) damage to four life, then Soramaro became 8/8 and killed me. There was an opening there for [Swallowing Plague](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swallowing+Plague) to save me, but my lack of [Hideous Laughter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hideous+Laughter) and a tough time with fliers both came back to haunt me. Can anyone tell me why [Gale Force](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gale+Force) isn't arcane?


*Game 30: Monoblack Ogres/Demons*


It's as if [Swallowing Plague](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swallowing+Plague) was laughing at me for the second game in a row. My opponent came out fast and furious with [Bile Urchin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bile+Urchin), two [Wicked Akuba](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wicked+Akuba), [Bloodthirsty Ogre](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodthirsty+Ogre), and two [Painwracker Oni](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Painwracker+Oni)s. He was really living on the edge, because if I could have removed his Ogre he would almost assuredly die. I held on a few turns waiting for the Plague (which is an odd thought, to be sure) thanks to triple [Thief of Hope](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thief+of+Hope) and a [Blood Clock](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Clock). Three Thieves sound awesome until you realize I only had [Sakura-Tribe Elder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sakura-Tribe+Elder)s to cast and thus didn't gain much life from them. Anyway, [Bloodthirsty Ogre](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodthirsty+Ogre) killed one Thief, and the other two died blocking [Wicked Akuba](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wicked+Akuba). I had one draw for [Swallowing Plague](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swallowing+Plague). If I drew it I would kill the Ogre, both his Oni would die on upkeep, and I'm back in the game. Instead I drew a land. Hm, maybe that's not [Swallowing Plague](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swallowing+Plague) laughing. It's more hideous than that.


So...


*IN*: 1 [Hideous Laughter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hideous+Laughter)


![Hideous Laughter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Hideous+Laughter)I've been pondering it long enough; it's time to pull the trigger on [Hideous Laughter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hideous+Laughter) now that I have [Eerie Procession](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eerie+Procession) in the deck. I have run into enough situations against all five colors where a well-timed [Hideous Laughter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hideous+Laughter) would completely change the game in my favor. Look back at my last two games, for example. Yes, tutoring for it lets an opponent know I have it in hand, and yes, it kills [Thief of Hope](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thief+of+Hope). I suppose in an ideal situation I could bounce the Thief with [Blood Clock](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Clock) before casting it. In any case, this is the sort of card that toolboxes love. It will still sit uselessly in hand against the odd creatureless or fattie-toting opponent, but the benefits outweigh those rare situations. More [Hideous Laughter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hideous+Laughter)s belong in the sideboard.
 *IN*: 2 [Sensei's Divining Top](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sensei%27s+Divining+Top)


I've resisted this addition for a while, partly because--as Prunedanish said on the Boards--it makes the deck feel so ordinary. The fact is, though, that [Sensei's Divining Top](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sensei%27s+Divining+Top) is spectacular in my deck. It costs one mana, so is a viable [Blood Clock](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Clock) bounce target. More importantly, my deck now has a whopping ten cards that shuffle my library, meaning that I will frequently be looking at a new three cards from which to choose. [Sensei's Divining Top](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sensei%27s+Divining+Top)'s ubiquity in both Standard and *Kamigawa* Block Constructed is not an accident. It is an incredibly good card at finding what you need when you need it. I suppose the only question for me is whether to drop my two [Ghost-Lit Stalker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ghost-Lit+Stalker)s and add a full four Tops. Right now I'm clinging to my Stalkers.


*OUT*: 3 [Waking Nightmare](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Waking+Nightmare)


I don't like dropping [Waking Nightmare](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Waking+Nightmare) from the deck. My opponent always groans after I cast a Nightmare, even if they have seven cards in hand. The ability to recur it via [Hana Kami](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hana+Kami) makes it all the more juicy. The problem is that, as I said last week, it's the one bit of discard in the deck that is useless when my opponent is out of cards in hand. This situation has come up often enough that I have begun to question [Waking Nightmare](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Waking+Nightmare)'s usefulness. Contrast it with [Ghost-Lit Stalker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ghost-Lit+Stalker), which can hit two cards and also be used as [Blood Clock](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Clock) and [Thief of Hope](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thief+of+Hope) fodder. Since adding Green, in fact, I've found myself channeling [Ghost-Lit Stalker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ghost-Lit+Stalker) a few times to completely devastate an opponent's hand. As I said, I don't like dropping [Waking Nightmare](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Waking+Nightmare), but it's the least good card in a deck now full of good cards.


This is, for my purposes, the final decklist:

60 Cards 




![](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Swamp)


















It's ironic that a deck that started out with a lot more four-ofs turned into a deck with several one- and two-of copies. It's like I reverse-engineering a preconstructed deck! Seriously, though, single-copy cards are the hallmark of “toolbox” approaches like the one I'm using with [Eerie Procession](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eerie+Procession). Double-copy cards are the hallmark of slow decks that can expect to see a good portion of their libraries. Tight decks with almost all four copies of their cards tend to be aggressive decks. It's no wonder, then, that most of my preconstructed experiments have evolved into four-copy editions since most have become beatdown decks. This time you get a deck that expects to see a lot more of its library over the course of a game.


Now, I'm fully aware that the above deck costs a lot more to put together than most other experiments I've tried. There are six rares, for one thing, even if they are “cheap rares.” There are also a whopping twenty-one uncommons, and not just any uncommons but fairly pricey ones in [Sensei's Divining Top](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sensei%27s+Divining+Top), [Hana Kami](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hana+Kami), [Hideous Laughter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hideous+Laughter), and to a lesser extent [Thief of Hope](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thief+of+Hope) and [Swallowing Plague](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swallowing+Plague). My hope is that this is about as expensive as one of my decks will get, and also falls well into the “30 tix” limit that [Nate Heiss](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/authorarchive&author=nateheiss) used as his definition of a budget deck. 


As usual, I'm not logging my games with the final decklist. I've gone a respectable 22-9 since arriving at this version (yes, I've played a lot of games... it's a fun deck). The deck is incredibly potent against players who aren't used to making the strategic decisions [Blood Clock](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Clock) and [Choice of Damnations](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Choice+of+Damnations) require. Even against experienced opponents, though, the Clock-Choice combo can be a killer. When I lose it tends to be because of a) mana issues, and/or b) super-aggressive starts from my opponent. If I have the mana I need and can survive to the midgame, though, watch out. What I particularly appreciate about the deck is not only the complexity of it, but also its ability to win games it otherwise has no business winning. Many, many times a game has looked completely hopeless for me only to have my opponent concede twelve turns later. 


Oh, and it's now time for deck name. Post your suggestions on the Message Boards and I'll pick the one I like the most to be the deck's official name. If you suggested names last week, suggest them again because I'll only be scanning the thread from this article for ideas. Remember to be catchy and to be brief. Also remember to not send me e-mails, please... Let everyone see your creativity on the Boards.


This article is a doozy in terms of length, so I'm going to once again only briefly touch on my usual wrap-up sections. In fact, I'm going to skip the “Paths Not Taken” section since I covered so many divergent paths in the first [Blood Clock](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Clock) article. 


### Speculative Sideboard Time!


I haven't yet peeked into the Tournament Decks room to try out my deck. As a result, I have a sideboard in my head that consists of three copies of five different cards. I often do this when thinking of sideboards, trying an equal treatment across the cards and adjusting my numbers once I realize what I take out and put in for each matchup. With that rather large caveat, here is how I would approach my first-draft sideboard:


*Sideboard*: 3 [Psychic Spear](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psychic+Spear)


![Psychic Spear](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Psychic+Spear)Against other spiritcraft decks, [Blood Clock](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Clock) can actually be a boon. In those cases, I'm guessing the Spear will be key. [Psychic Spear](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psychic+Spear) also comes in to combat against [Kodama of the North Tree](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kodama+of+the+North+Tree) and against any heavy splicing deck like [Ire of Kaminari](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ire+of+Kaminari). 
 *Sideboard*: 3 [Traproot Kami](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Traproot+Kami)


When my opponents play [Traproot Kami](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Traproot+Kami), I find myself giving up on trying to deal combat damage and instead focusing on [Thief of Hope](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thief+of+Hope) and [Choice of Damnations](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Choice+of+Damnations). “If you can't beat them...” and all that. Against aggressive decks, I think this is a good complement to my deck, slowing down the game while also giving me a perfect [Blood Clock](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Clock) outlet.


*Sideboard*: 3 [Ebony Owl Netsuke](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ebony+Owl+Netsuke)


I've noticed that Monoblue and splice-focused decks often keep a seven-card hand throughout the game, even amidst my discard. [Ebony Owl Netsuke](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ebony+Owl+Netsuke) punishes these decks, makes a good [Blood Clock](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Clock) outlet, and makes the Clock and [Choice of Damnations](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Choice+of+Damnations) more potent.


*Sideboard*: 3 [Wear Away](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wear+Away)


Boo, [Umezawa's Jitte](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Umezawa%27s+Jitte)! Boo, Hondens and [Enduring Ideal](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Enduring+Ideal)! Boo, [Night of Souls' Betrayal](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Night+of+Souls%27+Betrayal)! Boo, I say, boo!


*Sideboard*: 3 [Hideous Laughter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hideous+Laughter)


Versus White Weenie, Black Hand, Monored Aggro, aggressive Spirit decks, Meloku decks, Rats, and who knows what else, [Hideous Laughter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hideous+Laughter) can be a beating. I'm guessing that [Ghost-Lit Stalker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ghost-Lit+Stalker) comes out for two of these along with, probably, one copy of [Choice of Damnations](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Choice+of+Damnations). 


Like I said, I haven't tested this sideboard, so it may be that I'm missing a key card or four. This is a starting point only. If you have other sideboard ideas, speak up on the Message Boards.


### Adding Money To The Deck


If you like the idea of a Black/Green [Blood Clock](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Clock), [Choice of Damnations](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Choice+of+Damnations) deck and aren't quite so restricted in your budget, you may want to consider some of the cards below. None are necessary, of course, but all are worth trying out if you have them:


*[Tendo Ice Bridge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tendo+Ice+Bridge)*


![Tendo Ice Bridge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Tendo+Ice+Bridge)As I said, I find that the games I lose are most often those in which the land I have on the table doesn't match the cards I have in hand, and I haven't drawn any mana-fixers like [Sakura-Tribe Elder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sakura-Tribe+Elder), [Kodama's Reach](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kodama%27s+Reach), or [Sensei's Divining Top](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sensei%27s+Divining+Top). [Tendo Ice Bridge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tendo+Ice+Bridge) would take a lot of the pressure off of my three-color manabase. Not only that, but it's a card that gets along well with [Blood Clock](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Clock) since it can be reset to have a counter whenever I need it. I'll talk more about my land in my next article, but suffice it to say this is the first card I would add if I could.
 *[Cranial Extraction](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cranial+Extraction)*


I'm not sure if this is better as a sideboard addition or a maindeck card, but it can obviously be devastating in my deck. It's arcane, so it has nice interactions with all of the cards that matter most in the deck. A word of caution, though: Start recurring [Cranial Extraction](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cranial+Extraction) with [Hana Kami](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hana+Kami) and I'm guessing you should step out of the “Casual Decks” room.


*Black Legends* 


Green has nice legendary creatures, too, but it's the Black ones I think really fit into my deck. [Kagemaro, First to Suffer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kagemaro%2C+First+to+Suffer) would be terrific with [Blood Clock](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Clock) and [Soulless Revival](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soulless+Revival). Maga, Traiter to Mortals seems almost cater-made for a [Blood Clock](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Clock) deck with lots of mana acceleration. [Kokusho, the Evening Star](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kokusho%2C+the+Evening+Star) is like a Super Fattie [Thief of Hope](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thief+of+Hope). [Infernal Kirin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Infernal+Kirin) could be another really cool spiritcraft trigger. And, although it's not a Spirit, [Nezumi Shortfang](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nezumi+Shortfang) could easily replace the [Ghost-Lit Stalker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ghost-Lit+Stalker)s to provide another way for the deck to deal lethal damage. Adding these cards make [Okina, Temple to the Grandfathers](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Okina%2C+Temple+to+the+Grandfathers), [Shizo, Death's Storehouse](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shizo%2C+Death%27s+Storehouse), and [Time of Need](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Time+of+Need) look pretty decent in the deck as well.


*[Long-Forgotten Gohei](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Long-Forgotten+Gohei)*


![Long-Forgotten Gohei](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Long-Forgotten+Gohei)All of the arcane cards in the deck have some colorless component to their cost, especially [Choice of Damnations](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Choice+of+Damnations). For the mana-saving benefits alone [Long-Forgotten Gohei](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Long-Forgotten+Gohei) would be worth a look. Even better, the Gohei makes [Thief of Hope](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thief+of+Hope) immune to [Glacial Ray](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glacial+Ray) and counteracts [Night of Souls' Betrayal](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Night+of+Souls%27+Betrayal). I have no idea what I would take out of the deck to make room for it, but if you can squeeze it in it's worth a shot.
 *[Sickening Shoal](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sickening+Shoal)*


I'm not sold on the idea that [Sickening Shoal](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sickening+Shoal) would be better than [Swallowing Plague](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swallowing+Plague) in my deck since the life pad is such a great side effect. That said, it would be worth trying out to see if instant-speed removal is something my deck could fit.


Ah, it feels good.


To be honest, I wasn't sure I would enjoy [Blood Clock](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Clock) as much as some of the other cards in my poll three weeks ago, mostly because of the lack of good comes-into-play creatures in *Kamigawa* Block. Once I embraced it, though, I've made a deck that I enjoy playing immensely. That's two experiments in a row I've been pleasantly surprised. 


I've been excited enough by next week's topic that I'm already well underway on writing it. As a result, it's looking more and more like I won't miss a week even though my attention is about to turn drastically away from **Magic** for a brief time. I hope you enjoyed today, will enjoy next week, and are geared up for another deckbuilding series after that.


Think hard and have fun,
