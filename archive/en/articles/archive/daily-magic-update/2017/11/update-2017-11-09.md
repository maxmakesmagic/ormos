The Daily *Magic* Update is a roundup of everything *Magic* you should know on November 9, 2017. Today's Update is brought to you by [new beginnings](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/news/new-dailymtg-2017-11-09).


Today's Must
============


1. [The Mysteries of *Ixalan*](http://www.mtgsalvation.com/articles/49672-the-mysteries-of-ixalan) | MTGSalvation | "Vorthos" Jay Annelli


Jay went deep, and I mean *deep*—nope, deeper than that—on the story of *Ixalan*. This piece is a rich, full look at the story and lore of *Ixalan*, and should be a treat for anyone who loves the story—or even anyone just curious about it.


Plus, there's zero speculation about Marit Lage, so we're already in a good space!


Also, Read, Watch, or Listen to These
=====================================


1. [Blue-White Gift Deck Guide](https://www.channelfireball.com/articles/blue-white-gift-deck-guide/) | ChannelFireball | Pascal Maynard

Maynard came *thiiiiis* close to winning a Pro Tour with this very deck, and now he gives you the ins and the outs of this powerful graveyard deck.


1. [*Ixalan* Art Review](http://www.gatheringmagic.com/mikelinnemann-11092017-ixalan-art-review/) | Gathering Magic | Mike Linnemann and TheMagicManSam

Art! Review! Video! TheMagicManSam!


Mike Linnemann is there too.


(Kidding, Mike. You're great.)


1. [How to Bluff (and When Not To)](http://lrcast.com/limited-resources-414-how-to-bluff-and-when-not-to/) | Limited Resources | Luis Scott-Vargas and Marshall Sutcliffe

The answer is to just never bluff and always have it. Simple.


1. [How to Play *Magic Online* (MTGO): A Guide for New *Magic: The Gathering* Players](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WiYO78ZfK5I) | Magic the Amateuring | Meghan Wolff

These new-player guides to MTGO pop up now and then, but this is certainly one of the better ones. Sit someone down who's interesting in MTGO but hasn't made the move yet, and this will give them everything they need to decide whether or not to get started.

Community Spotlight
===================


6. [Voidmage Gamer](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOlNM7gIVyg5WhonuTbF99g/featured)


Voidmage Gamer is a YouTube channel mostly dedicated to Commander that publishes frequent, quality videos. In fact, in the past week they've published seven videos, including the one shown below on the Top 10 Selesnya cards in Commander. They're fond of Top 10 lists and deck techs, so if those things tickle your fancy, check them out.


<https://www.youtube.com/embed/rmENtj8svik>


1. [Brian Weissman](https://www.youtube.com/user/bekele2617/videos)

Both a name that rings throughout *Magic* history *and* a YouTube channel by the same man. Weissman, for those who don't know, basically invented the idea of card advantage with the appropriately named "The Deck." It was the first deck to really utilize the idea that drawing more cards than the opponent would eventually lead to victory, and it was the best deck in the game for quite a bit. Now, Weissman almost exclusively plays Commander, both of the 1v1 and multiplayer variety. He does the occasional deck tech, but most of his videos are gameplay videos. As one of the game's true greats, his channel should get more attention than it does.

During yesterday's *MTG Arena* stream, these fifteen words sparked a bit of, let's call it hopeful discussion. You can check out the replay of the stream [here](https://go.twitch.tv/videos/188704385) and [here](https://go.twitch.tv/videos/188722097).


Deck of the Day
===============


1. [Standard Esper Control](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/mtgo-standings/competitive-standard-constructed-league-2017-11-08)

I've tried myself to make Esper Control work, but I kept having trouble with the mana. But MagicIsFunToDo on *Magic Online* managed to go 5-0 in a Competitive Standard League by playing all of the dual lands ever—including [Aether Hub](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aether+Hub).


The idea with Esper Control is basically that standard Blue-Black Control needs a sweeper, and [Bontu's Last Reckoning](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bontu%27s+Last+Reckoning) isn't it. [Fumigate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fumigate) and [Settle the Wreckage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Settle+the+Wreckage), meanwhile, certainly are.


I'm not a huge fan of a single [Search for Azcanta](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Search+for+Azcanta), as that card is too powerful not to play two or three, but I also understand this deck can't afford to not impact the board early in the game. [Pull from Tomorrow](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pull+from+Tomorrow) does the heavy lifting later in the game instead.


Is this the new vision for control? The mana base worries me, but I do think [Fumigate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fumigate) is The Truth in Standard right now. Control has to adapt, so maybe this is the direction it should go.
