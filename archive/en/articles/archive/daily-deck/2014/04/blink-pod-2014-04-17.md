By now, I think almost everyone is familiar with the concept of a value-based [Birthing Pod](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Birthing+Pod) deck. For those not in the know, rather than set up some two- or three-card combo that wins you the game, you can use [Birthing Pod](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Birthing+Pod) to trigger enters-the-battlefield effects to generate board and/or card advantage.



![Momentary Blink](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Momentary%20Blink&options=)I never thought we'd take it this far.

Similar to the Modern deck [I showcased earlier in the week](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/deck/1469), this deck has a mini combo with [Akroma, Angel of Fury](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Akroma%2C+Angel+of+Fury) and [Momentary Blink](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Momentary+Blink). It also plays [Sea Gate Oracle](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sea+Gate+Oracle) and [Wall of Omens](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wall+of+Omens) for added value, plus [Restoration Angel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Restoration+Angel)s to do it all over again. Any deck would be hard-pressed to keep up with that type of card advantage.


While Lurgold kept it light, the deck still has the combo portion with [Kiki-Jiki, Mirror Breaker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kiki-Jiki%2C+Mirror+Breaker) plus [Deceiver Exarch](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deceiver+Exarch) or [Restoration Angel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Restoration+Angel). It should only be used once the coast is clear or you have no other option. In the meantime, enjoy valuing out your opponents, or just cheating the unmorph cost of [Akroma, Angel of Fury](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Akroma%2C+Angel+of+Fury)!
