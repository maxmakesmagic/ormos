The original art description for **[Doubling Season](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Doubling+Season)** called for the art to depict a double batch of *viashino* instead of saprolings. The artist, Wayne Reynolds, duly created this initial sketch:

While the sketch was awesome, it was later decided that the card should depict saprolings, since it's what most of the token-generating cards in *Ravnica* produce, and would be an in-color race (viashino are traditionally red-aligned). Here's the second sketch.

This sketch led to the final art on the card.
