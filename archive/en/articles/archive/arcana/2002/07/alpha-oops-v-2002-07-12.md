These five cards help give white its identity as the color that can hole up like no other.

When Alpha hit the shelves in '93, an oversight left [Circle of Protection: Black](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Circle+of+Protection%3A+Black) off the printing sheet and out of the set. But in some strange way, it made sense to players.

"White and black are enemies," they postulated, "so it makes sense that white cannot stop black using a Circle of Protection." Ah, if only the real reason were so elegant. 

The CoP was put into the set in Beta, which then opened the Pandora's Box of problems relating to using a CoP on a [Black Knight](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Black+Knight) or other "protection from white" creatures, questions that still linger to this dayâ€¦
