------------------------------


Shuhei Rocks Japan!
===================




July 16-17, 2009

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/jpnat09/End_Nakamura.jpg)What a weekend! In a star studded Top 8, it was some of Japan’s biggest names advancing from the quarters to the semis to the finals! Naoki Sakaguchi, an unknown who came blazing out of nowhere to dominate the first two days of competition saw his streak ended by Shuhei Nakamura in the quarterfinals. Meanwhile Kenji Tsumura, resurgent after taking some time away from the game, managed to sneak through to the semis.


It was there that even Tsumura fell, to Yuuya Watanabe. The former Rookie of the Year found himself in back-to-back Nationals Top 8s and, with his semis win, joined the Nationals team for the second year in a row! But even he couldn’t overcome the reigning Player of the Year, Shuhei Nakamura. Shuhei put up a dominating performance in the Top 8, nearly sweeping to victory by going 3-1 in the finals. He will captain a powerful team featuring himself, Yuuya, Yuma Shiota in 3rd, and Kenji Tsumura as the alternate. Japan has spoken loudly, and their champion is Shuhei Nakamura!
