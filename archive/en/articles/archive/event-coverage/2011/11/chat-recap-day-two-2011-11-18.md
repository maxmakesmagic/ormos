For those of you who weren't awake or about for the Friday Limited day here at the World Championships, we were trying something a little new -- live text coverage from Tim Willoughby throughout the day. Working off live feedback from readers, his unique brand of English wit and a surprising amount of caffeine (none at all), he spent all six rounds on his feet finding out what was happening as it happened. Then Ray Walkinshaw took over for a nightcap, bringing you the **Magic Online**  Championship's draft rounds.


We'll have more live text coverage going forward, but for those of you that want to see how draft day unfolded, here is the full log of the day's chat, as it came throughout the day. This includes not one but two complete live feature matches, including Sam Black vs. Martin Juza and Conley Woods vs. Josh Utter-Leyton.
