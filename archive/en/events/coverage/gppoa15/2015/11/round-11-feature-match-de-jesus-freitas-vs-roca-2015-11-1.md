This is a matchup that hasn't been witnessed for a long time. Owing to “Blue-Red Storm”'s vulnerability to Black-Green deck, it has fallen out of disrepute in recent time. However, judging from Caua Roca's 9-1 record, his decision to surprise the field with [Goblin Electromancer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Electromancer) seems to be paying off handsomely.

Facing off against Marcos Paulo De Jesus Freitas, the only 10-0 player in the entire tournament, it would be a race of whether he could execute the combo before being trampled to death by [Wild Nacatl](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Nacatl) and its friends. Without any hand disruption, De Jesus Freitas' best bet was to burn away [Goblin Electromancer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Electromancer) on sight, and also sideboard in removal against the deck's namesake enchantment.


If De Jesus Freitas wins, he'll move on to 11-0, way ahead of the field. If Caua Roca triumphs, he'll dash his opponent's hopes of going undefeated and moving up to the same 10-1 record as him.


Game 1
======


De Jesus Freitas was forced to mulligan to five, but bounced back with [Noble Hierarch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Noble+Hierarch) to allow [Tarmogoyf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf) and [Wild Nacatl](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Nacatl) on his second turn. Drawing [Knight of the Reliquary](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Knight+of+the+Reliquary) off the top, it didn't seem like De Jesus Freitas had suffered from a mulligan at all.


Roca was quickly under immense pressure, but was able to drop [Goblin Electromancer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Electromancer) after making sure his opponent didn't have a way to kill it with [Gitaxian Probe](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gitaxian+Probe). After he untapped and paid two life to drop [Steam Vents](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Steam+Vents) untapped, he reached for his dice and began to keep track of his storm count.

*Caua Roca reaches for his dice, a bad omen for his opponent.*


Really?


With only three lands, [Goblin Electromancer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Electromancer) and no other permanents on the board, could this really be the final turn?


Roca's first mana was spent on [Thought Scour](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thought+Scour), milling [Past in Flames](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Past+in+Flames) into his yard. His second mana was spent on [Serum Visions](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Serum+Visions). His third and final mana was for [Manamorphose](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Manamorphose) (remember [Goblin Electromancer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Electromancer)'s “discount” on Instants and Sorceries?), which eventually led to a second [Manamorphose](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Manamorphose) and a flurry of [Pyretic Ritual](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyretic+Ritual)s and [Desperate Ritual](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Desperate+Ritual)s.


That got him enough mana to cast [Past in Flames](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Past+in+Flames) as well as [Pyromancer Ascension](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyromancer+Ascension), which he swiftly fulfilled with third and fourth copies of [Manamorphose](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Manamorphose). Now that all his spells were being duplicated, it was simply a matter of digging for the lethal [Grapeshot](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grapeshot).


With over 20 mana in his mana pool and the storm count at 15, Roca eventually found the [Grapeshot](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grapeshot) he required.


**Marcos Paulo De Jesus Freitas 0 - Caua Roca 1**


Game 2
======


De Jesus Freitas' deck was the epitome of fairness, which he demonstrated by leading with a pair of [Voice of Resurgence](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Voice+of+Resurgence). Not quite the card you want against a combo deck.


Roca used the breathing room to resolve [Pyromancer Ascension](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyromancer+Ascension) and [Goblin Electromancer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Electromancer), but was rudely surprised when his opponent dropped [Worship](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Worship). To make matters worse, [Qasali Pridemage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Qasali+Pridemage) was added to the board as insurance against [Pyromancer Ascension](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyromancer+Ascension).

*Marcos Paulo De Jesus Freitas hides behind his “Worship”.*


Roca tried to stay in the game by adopting an alternative route, summoning 8 Goblin tokens with [Empty the Warrens](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Empty+the+Warrens). A third [Voice of Resurgence](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Voice+of+Resurgence) further ensured De Jesus Freitas' victory, for Roca could never find sufficient removal spells to kill all of them and their tokens to get out of the “Worship-lock”.


**Marcos Paulo De Jesus Freitas 1 - Caua Roca 1**


Game 3
======


Despite double [Sleight of Hand](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sleight+of+Hand), Roca failed to find his second land and was quickly under siege by [Wild Nacatl](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Nacatl) and [Qasali Pridemage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Qasali+Pridemage). A third [Sleight of Hand](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sleight+of+Hand) finally netted him a second mana source, but against a deck like Naya Zoo, one turn too late is usually enough to kill you.


Going down to 8 life just after two combat steps (Roca also cracked [Scalding Tarn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scalding+Tarn) for an untapped [Steam Vents](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Steam+Vents)), it looks like “going off” was impossible with the meddlesome [Qasali Pridemage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Qasali+Pridemage) on the table.


[Tarmogoyf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf) shortened the clock yet again, while a [Lightning Bolt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt) finished off Roca.


**Marcos Paulo De Jesus Freitas 2 - Caua Roca 1**


**Marco Paulo De Jesus Freitas advances to 11-0, likely only needing one more win before taking a draw into the Top 8. Caua Roca drops to 9-2 from this defeat.**
