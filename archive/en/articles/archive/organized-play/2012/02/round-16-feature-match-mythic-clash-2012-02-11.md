Samuele Estratti was virtually unknown outside of Europe when he won Pro Tour Philadelphia just a few months ago. After his win, many players questioned whether that finish was just a fluke, or if Samuele Estratti was going to become a force to be reckoned with.


Well, after Samuele Estratti started this weekend with a 9-0 record (making some amazing plays and on-camera bluffs to get there) most players have been convinced that Estratti has what it takes to become a Pro Tour powerhouse.


But if he's going to earn his second Pro Tour Top 8, he's going to need to beat a player who nobody wants to face in order to get there. Paulo Vitor Damo da Rosa (PV), an all-time great who now finds himself within arm's reach of the ninth Pro Tour Top 8 of his career.

*Samuele Estratti wants to prove that his Pro Tour win could be done again. Paulo Vitor Damo da Rosa wants to add a ninth Pro Tour Top 8 to his record. And in the final round, only one of these players will make their way onto the Sunday stage.*

 

### Game 1


PV took a mulligan, but quickly put himself in the driver's seat with two [Rampant Growth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rampant+Growth)s and a [Galvanic Blast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Galvanic+Blast) to deal with Estratti's [Delver of Secrets](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Delver+of+Secrets).


With an abundance of mana at his disposal, PV decided that he could afford to play around [Mana Leak](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak), waiting until he got to seven lands to play his first threat of the game, a [Huntmaster of the Fells](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Huntmaster+of+the+Fells).


A [Midnight Haunting](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Midnight+Haunting) gave Estratti some pressure of his own, and a [Gut Shot](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gut+Shot) plus a [Snapcaster Mage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snapcaster+Mage) allowed the Pro Tour Philadelphia Champion to kill the Huntmaster and trade with the accompanying wolf token.


A second [Huntmaster of the Fells](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Huntmaster+of+the+Fells) got countered by [Mana Leak](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak) plus [Snapcaster Mage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snapcaster+Mage), and a [Runechanter's Pike](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Runechanter%27s+Pike) put Estratti a couple of turns away from flying to victory with his spirit tokens.


A ninth land off the top of his deck and an [Inferno Titan](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inferno+Titan) (that PV could now resolve through Estratti's [Mana Leak](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak)) changed all that.

*PV turns things around with an [Inferno Titan](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inferno+Titan).* 

 

Suddenly Estratti was left without any creatures on his side of the board, and an attack step later he found himself reaching for his sideboard.

### Game 2


Estratti's turn one [Delver of Secrets](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Delver+of+Secrets) transformed into an [Insectile Aberration](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Insectile+Aberration) at the first opportunity possible, and PV found himself under a very real clock before he had even played his second land.


PV again spent his early turns accelerating with two copies of [Rampant Growth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rampant+Growth)s, but without a [Galvanic Blast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Galvanic+Blast), he could only sit and watch as Estratti's 3/2 flier hit him over and over again.


When he got to seven mana, PV tried for an [Inferno Titan](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inferno+Titan) backed up by an [Autumn's Veil](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Autumn%27s+Veil), but Estratti was ready with a [Mana Leak](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak) and a [Negate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Negate).


Estratti's next attack left PV at 5 and forced the Brazilian Pro to pass a turn with no plays so that he would be able to block with an [Inkmoth Nexus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inkmoth+Nexus). Estratti didn't want to trade his 3/2 flier for PV's land that he could pump with a [Kessig Wolf Run](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kessig+Wolf+Run), so he passed his turn with no play as well.


Realizing that he needed to make a move fast, PV again tried to resolve an [Inferno Titan](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inferno+Titan), this time with three extra mana available that he could use to pay for a [Mana Leak](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak).

*Estratti puts his opponent in a bind* 

 

Estratti did in fact [Mana Leak](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak) the [Inferno Titan](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inferno+Titan), forcing PV to seriously think things over. After a bit of deliberation, PV, not wanting to die to a [Moorland Haunt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Moorland+Haunt) activation and a piece of equipment, decided not to pay for the [Mana Leak](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak), simply passing the turn ready to chump block with a [Inkmoth Nexus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inkmoth+Nexus).


A [Vapor Snag](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vapor+Snag) cleared the way for an attack that left PV on 1, and when Estratti used a [Snapcaster Mage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snapcaster+Mage) to flashback his [Vapor Snag](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vapor+Snag) a turn later, the players were off to a deciding third game.

### Game 3


Estratti once again opened on [Delver of Secrets](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Delver+of+Secrets), but this time PV was ready with a [Galvanic Blast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Galvanic+Blast).


[Midnight Haunting](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Midnight+Haunting) gave Estratti something of a clock, but a [Thrun, the Last Troll](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thrun%2C+the+Last+Troll) and a [Slagstorm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Slagstorm) later, Estratti could feel the match slipping away from him.


[Phantasmal Image](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phantasmal+Image) dealt with the [Thrun, the Last Troll](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thrun%2C+the+Last+Troll), but PV was ready to restock his board with a [Huntmaster of the Fells](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Huntmaster+of+the+Fells), followed by a second [Huntmaster of the Fells](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Huntmaster+of+the+Fells) that he forced past Estratti's [Dissipate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dissipate) with an [Autumn's Veil](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Autumn%27s+Veil).


Estratti stuck around for a few more turns, but he failed to draw anything that would let him overcome PV's army (let alone deal with the many titans that were sitting in his hand).


A shake of the hand later, and Paulo Vitor Damo da Rosa had advanced to his 9th Pro Tour Top 8!
