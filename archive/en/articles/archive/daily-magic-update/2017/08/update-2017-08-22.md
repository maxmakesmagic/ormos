The August 22, 2017 Update
==========================

The Daily *Magic* Update is a roundup of everything *Magic* you should know on August 22, 2017. Today's Update is brought to you by pretending to not acknowledge information on the internet. For now.


What to Watch Tonight
=====================


1. Team Draft Super League | [twitch.tv/magic](https://www.twitch.tv/magic) | 5 p.m. PT/8 p.m. ET/midnight UTC

It's Peach Garden Oath (William Jensen, Reid Duke, and Owen Turtenwald) versus Team Madison (Sam Black, Matt Severa, and Justin Cohen) tonight on Team Draft Super League, as we wind our way to the finals next week. This week's winner takes on Dem Boyz (Alexander Hayne, Mike Sigrist, and Steve Rubin) next week. The loser is banished from *Magic* and forced to live out their days in a traveling circus.


After That, Read, Watch, or Listen to These
===========================================


1. [GEOCACHING WITH DINOSAURS!!! (*Ixalan* gamepiece)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP1tzMZY2IY) | 3 Player Politics

The [*Ixalan* geocaching game](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/news/exploring-ixalan-exploring-our-world-2017-08-14) has started to trickle out into the world, and a group of intrepid explorers (plus the two guys who do all the talking) head out into the wilderness to send one such trackable out into the world. Probably finding itself. Traveling for a while. You know, really experiencing life.


<https://www.youtube.com/embed/GP1tzMZY2IY>


1. [I Hid a *Magic: The Gathering* Treasure in the Real World. Here's What Happens Next](https://www.forbes.com/sites/laurenorsini/2017/08/21/i-hid-a-magic-the-gathering-treasure-in-the-real-world-heres-what-happens-next/#6603183d6bb4) | Forbes | Lauren Orsini

A second game piece appears! This one is a tad more urban.


If you'd like to be in the running to receive one of these trackable pieces yourself and set it about its course into the wild, be sure to check out [this page](https://www.geocaching.com/promotions/promo/magic/) and submit your request before the window closes in a few days.


1. [The Team MTG Mint Card Experience](http://www.mtgmintcard.com/articles/writers/eduardo-sajgalik/the-team-mtg-mint-card-experience) | MTG Mint Card | Eduardo Sajgalik

Eduardo Sajgalik might have fallen off the [Top 25](#8) (oops, spoiler alert), but that doesn't stop him from starting off this piece by stating "It's been a good year." And for team MTG Mint Card, it certainly has. Sajgalik recounts what the team is all about and how that builds it toward success.


1. [Attacking in Commander](https://www.brotherswarcast.com/2017/08/22/episode-11-attacking-in-commander/) | The Brothers' War | Ryan and A.J. Greene

Attacking in Commander is an underrated skill—too often players are attacking only when it's lethal, rolling a die to see who they should attack, or just never attacking at all. We can do better. We deserve better.


1. [Switching Colors in Draft](http://www.starcitygames.com/article/35683_Switching-Colors-In-Draft.html) | StarCityGames.com | Ryan Saxe

Saxe has an interesting take on drafting and evaluating picks. Worth the read if you ever plan to draft again in your entire life. Which I'm betting you do.


1. [Everything You Need to Know About MTG League (and Why You Should Give It A Try!)](http://www.manaleak.com/mtguk/2017/08/everything-you-need-to-know-about-mtg-league-and-why-you-should-give-it-a-try/) | ManaLeak.com | Katie Roberts

Store Leagues are really the bee's knees for a lot of players. Truly top notch. Really grand. Roberts explains why.


Top 25
======


1. Brad Moon Rising

There was a lot to celebrate about Brad Nelson's Grand Prix victory this past weekend—three players on the exact same deck, one of them his brother, and all three going 1st, 2nd, and 3rd—but now that that dust has settled, Nelson has something else to celebrate: a spot among the game's current Top 3.


Nelson's four-place bump elevated him into the upper echelon of the rankings. Paulo Vitor Damo da Rosa and Márcio Carvalho are still leagues (read: 5 points) above the next closest competitors, but Nelson, Reid Duke, and Samuel Pardee (who dropped despite a strong Grand Prix) form the next rung on the ladder.


A few rungs down, but certainly charging, are Steven Rubin and Eric Froehlich, who turned strong Grand Prix into five-spot bumps. And just squeaking into the Top 25 thanks to his 2nd-place finish (with that stellar 75), Brian Braun-Duin is proving his World Championship a year ago wasn't a fluke.


That does mean one player drops off, as Eduardo Sajgalik hasn't quite done enough lately to hang on to his Top 25 ranking. One result and he'd be right back on the listing, but, for now, he's the odd man out.

What People Are Talking About
=============================


1. Congratulations to [the Rhino](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKzc-tvIha_H7EHb541nI6g) for approaching 1,000 subscribers!

As of this writing, he's at 992, so who knows where he'll be by the time you actually read this.


At this rate, he'll pass Tolarian Community College around the time he's able to drive. Maybe. I don't know. I didn't do the math.


Deck of the Day
===============


1. [Corey Burkhart's Jeskai God-Pharaoh's Gift](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/gpden17/9-32-decklists-2017-08-20)

Lurking just outside the Top 8 of [Grand Prix Denver](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/gpden17) were a bevy of decks based around [God-Pharaoh's Gift](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=God-Pharaoh%27s+Gift), all played by a bunch of good players. There were a ton of versions of this deck in the Top 16, which means it might be time for the deck to rise again. It has resilience against artifact destruction, it has game against aggressive decks, and it goes over the top of midrange decks. The deck is powerful, fun, and you get to make 4/4 [Walking Ballista](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Walking+Ballista)s with no counters on them, which is just wild.
