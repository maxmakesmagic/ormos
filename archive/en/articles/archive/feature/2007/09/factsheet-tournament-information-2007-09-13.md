Krakow is one of the most beautiful Polish cities, founded more than a thousand years ago. It served as Poland’s capital until the early 17th century. Krakow is seen by many as a magical city. The magic can best be contemplated in one of the hundreds of restaurants, cafes, and outdoor gardens in both districts, offering delicious original cuisine in no less pleasing atmospheres. More info on [www.krakow.pl/miasto/gastronomia](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=www.krakow.pl/miasto/gastronomia) or [www.knajpy.krakow.pl](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=www.knajpy.krakow.pl).  
  

Krakow is rich in history going back to the Romanesque structures seen in the city.  
  

An added attraction is the famous, 700-year-old Wieliczka salt mine nearby with its magnificient St.Kingais Chapel carved of salt 125 meters underground. Like old Krakow, it is listed by UNESCO as World cultural heritage site.  
  

Located not far from Krakow is the site of the former Auschwitz-Birkenau camp. A memento from the World War 2.  
  

Horse-drawn sightseeing tours depart from Barbican at the end of Ul. Florianska.
