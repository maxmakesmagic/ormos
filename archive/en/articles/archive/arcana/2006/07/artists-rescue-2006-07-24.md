Accomplished **Magic** artist Wayne Reynolds had a temporary injury during the time when *Dissension* card art was coming due. He had already done drawings for his work on [Nettling Curse](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nettling+Curse), [Nihilistic Glee](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nihilistic+Glee) and [Trial // Error](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Trial+%2F%2F+Error), and the creative team was happy with the direction he had gone on those pieces. Wayne's fine now, but while he was healing up he couldn’t paint!

Jeremy and Ron helped Wayne out with the final paint job and together they got the pieces done and into the set. That’s why you see joint credits on those three *Dissension* cards.
