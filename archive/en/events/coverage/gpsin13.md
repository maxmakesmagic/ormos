Grand Prix Singapore 2013
-------------------------


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/gpsin13/GPSing-Trophy-Shot.jpg)Ken Yukuhiro is your Grand Prix: Singapore champion! Starting down a game in the finals against Chapman Sim, Yukuhiro defeated the infamously deadly [Pack Rat](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pack+Rat)s in games 2 and 3 with his aggressive Rakdos deck to clinch victory.


Yukuhiro's deck blended focus and ferocity, featuring many of *Return to Ravnica*'s aggressive powerhouses. Trios of [Pursuit of Flight](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pursuit+of+Flight), [Traitorous Instinct](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Traitorous+Instinct) and [Spawn of Rix Maadi](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spawn+of+Rix+Maadi), supported by a stellar selection of removal and aggressive creatures, proved too much for Yukuhiro's opponents. Rounding out the Top 8 Andrew Cantillana, Jun'ya Nakamura, Toshiya Kanegawa, Zhen Xing Gao, Hao-Shan Huang and Ruizi Lin.
