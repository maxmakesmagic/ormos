Preorder with Your Wizards Account
==================================


If you made a *Secret Lair* purchase recently, you may have noticed something new—the ability to log in with your Wizards Account (the same one you use for *MTG Arena* and Wizards Customer Service). This is the first step toward many new features and improvements to the *Secret Lair* experience!


To celebrate, some lucky logged-in users will get a little something extra with their preorder. Specifically, 1,000 customers who place a preorder during Dr. Lair's Secretorium Superdrop will receive a promotional Arcbound Ravager card with their drops.


![Arcbound Ravager card](https://media.wizards.com/2021/images/daily/t4ksRbAwzU.png)


Your first preorder is the only eligible one, and all logged-in customers will have an equal shot (preordering first, preordering more, or preordering multiple times won't increase your chances). Unfortunately, only customers located in North America, excluding Quebec, are eligible to participate in this promotion.


Bring Home Your Wonderment
==========================
