His opponent this round is Jon Finkel, who seems to be back to his old form. There is a lot riding on this match, since the winner can probably draw into Top 8. For Ikeda, it would be a chance to be in the Top 8 of a Pro Tour in his native country, while for Finkel it would be a second Limited Top 8 in a row, and an affirmation that he is still a major force to be reckoned with.

### Game 1

Ikeda mulliganed his opening hand, which got Finkel to pump his fist. The second mulligan got a lighter pumped fist.

Finkel- "That one was just mean."

Ikeda had a first turn [Imagecrafter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Imagecrafter), and Finkel summoned [Flamewave Invoker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flamewave+Invoker) on turn three. Ikeda made a morph creature and passed the turn, and the Invoker got through for two damage. [Ascending Aven](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ascending+Aven) would have given Finkel some pressure in the air, but Ikeda flipped over his morph to reveal Marauder, and shoot it down. The Invoker attacked back for two, and [Keeneye Aven](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Keeneye+Aven) stopped Ikeda's attackers. On the following turn, both of Finkel's creatures came over for four damage, and a morph along with a [Mistform Wall](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mistform+Wall) provided defense.

Ikeda got to six mana and played [Crookclaw Elder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crookclaw+Elder). Finkel attacked with everyone but the Wall, and Ikeda's Marauder blocked Finkel's morph creature. When damage was put on the stack, [Imagecrafter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Imagecrafter) made Marauder a Bird, and the Elder's ability was used to draw a card. Finkel kept adding creatures to the sky, bringing out [Mistform Dreamer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mistform+Dreamer). Ikeda played a great blocker in [Sage Aven](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sage+Aven), which also gave him the other bird he needed to draw extra cards. [Flamewave Invoker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flamewave+Invoker) followed, and with seven lands in play and a [Sage Aven](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sage+Aven) that had just searched, it was apparent that Finkel was living on borrowed time.

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/ptyok03/a797.jpg)Finkel targeted the Elder with [Threaten](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Threaten), activated his Wall, and attacked with all his creatures. The resulting attack brought Ikeda down to one life point, and things looked bad until Ikeda stabilized, killing [Keeneye Aven](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Keeneye+Aven) with [Pinpoint Avalanche](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pinpoint+Avalanche), and [Riptide Biologist](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Riptide+Biologist) with [Fever Charm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fever+Charm). The game was at a stalemate on the board, which meant that Ikeda was free to use his Elder and Aven to draw an extra card every turn. It didn't matter, as Finkel drew [Searing Flesh](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Searing+Flesh) to end the game.

Ikeda- 0 Finkel- 1

### Game 2

Once again, Ikeda had a first turn [Imagecrafter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Imagecrafter), as well as a third turn [Flamewave Invoker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flamewave+Invoker). Finkel played a morph creature on turn three, and Ikeda had [Sage Aven](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sage+Aven). Finkel's morph attacked into the [Sage Aven](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sage+Aven), and he played a second. The Invoker attacked, Finkel blocked with his morph, and after damage went on the stack it flipped over to reveal [Wall of Deceit](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wall+of+Deceit). Ikeda summoned [Covert Operative](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Covert+Operative), giving him a significant clock. Finkel played another morph, while Ikeda started swinging with his Operative.

Both of Finkel's morphs attacked, and after damage went on the stack, an unblocked [Skirk Commando](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skirk+Commando) flipped over and threatened to kill the Aven, which was blocking the other morph. Ikeda made the Commando into a Wizard and tried to kill it with [Fever Charm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fever+Charm), but Finkel countered that with [Ixidor's Will](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ixidor%27s+Will), getting a few laughs and camera flashes from the crowd. Ikeda added [Pinpoint Avalanche](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pinpoint+Avalanche) to the stack, sending the Commando to the graveyard. 

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/ptyok03/a796.jpg)Finkel's morph attacked into Ikeda's, and after damage went on the stack, it flipped over to reveal [Riptide Biologist](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Riptide+Biologist), and [Imagecrafter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Imagecrafter) turned Finkel's morph into a beast. At this point the game went into full race mode, with Finkel playing [Ascending Aven](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ascending+Aven) and [Mistform Dreamer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mistform+Dreamer). Ikeda's Operative continued to attack, while Finkel swung for five with his flyers, then added a second Dreamer and [Mistform Wall](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mistform+Wall) to his team. It was too late, however, and Ikeda's unblockable creature was able to finish the job in time.

Ikeda- 1 Finkel- 1

### Game 3

Finkel double mulliganed, and missed his third land drop after cycling [Slipstream Eel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Slipstream+Eel). He played [Wall of Deceit](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wall+of+Deceit) face up on the following turn, while Ikeda had a morph creature and [Ascending Aven](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ascending+Aven). Finkel played his own morph creature, as Ikeda's Aven came over for three. A second Aven showed up along with a [Goblin Sledder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Sledder), and Finkel was facing six points of damage in the air every turn. He never found an answer.

**Final Result:** Ikeda- 2 Finkel- 1
