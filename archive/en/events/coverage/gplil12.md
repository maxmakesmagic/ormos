Grand Prix Lille 2012
---------------------


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/gplil12/trophy_shot.jpg)Sometime on Saturday lunchtime, round two of GP Lille began. 1505 players could still win. Hundreds hadn't begun. Following his one bye, Richard Parker of England shuffled up his UB Zombies deck for the first time. He won, and won again. Now he was level with the best in the world, the Pros with their three byes. He kept on winning, and by the end of round 7 had locked up a spot on day two. Six players went undefeated on day one. Parker was one of them.


He came back on day two. He carried on winning, and winning, and winning. By the time thirty or so players were desperately scrabbling for places in the top 8, Parker was sitting comfortably ahead of the field at 14-0. Two Intentional Draws saw him into the top 8. Historically, trailblazers fare badly in top 8s. Whether it's simple misfortune, or the pressure of pacesetting, or just heaping expectations on themselves, history is littered with undefeated records that mean nothing when it really matters.


Parker beat RG Aggro in the quarter final. He did it again in the semi final. Only the excellent Simon Diaz with his [Delver of Secrets](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Delver+of+Secrets) deck stood in the path of the unbeaten Parker. In the end, he wasn't just unbeaten, he was unbeatable.


There were other stories too, of course. There always are. Standard proved to be a ton of fun and ultra-versatile, with enough archetypes running around the top tables to keep the most ardent deck tinkerer happy for weeks. RG Aggro bared its claws significantly, while the French Frites deck and UB Control mostly flattered to deceive down the stretch. In the end, though, it turned out that copying [Geralf's Messenger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Geralf%27s+Messenger) with [Phantasmal Image](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phantasmal+Image) , and smashing face with [Phyrexian Obliterator](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phyrexian+Obliterator) , was something nobody had an answer to - at least when it was Parker Perfect asking the questions.


Congratulations to Richard Parker, Grand Prix Lille Champion 2012!
