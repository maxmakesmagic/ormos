Day 2 Coverage



With 753 players in total and 162 still fighting for points and position on the second day, Grand Prix Copenhagen added a lot of insight to the pool of knowledge regarding current Standard. For one thing, White-Blue Control cemented itself as the best nonred choice, putting pro players (10) Javier Dominguez and Martin Dang into the Top 8. Meanwhile, with his own Top 8 finish, Joakim Stahle-Nilsson's proved that Mono-Red didn't need to run Goblin Chainwhirler at all!


In the end, however, some things stayed the same. Deck-wise the finals was a repeat of the previous week's Pro Tour, with Mono-Red Aggro again squaring off against Red-Black Aggro. Results-wise it was a repeat as well, as Tobias Maurer used his mono-colored deck to run over Francisco Sanchez.


Congratulations to Tobias Maurer, champion of Grand Prix Copenhagen 2018!

Day 1 Coverage



Day 1 of Grand Prix Copenhagen had come and gone. It started with 753 players in the morning, but eight quick rounds of Standard cut the field down to a mere 162 in a blur of whirling chains.


Leading the charge into the second day were seven players at 8-0: Jakob Kirkebjerg, Christian Aahlstroem, Love Rask, (10) Javier Dominguez, Markku Anttila, Lukas Blohon, as well as Tobias Maurer. They would have a head start over the competition on Sunday, but said competition was not be underestimated. Just among the people at 7-1, one could find some fearsome opponents such as Martin Müller, Piotr Głogowski, Simon Nielsen, and Christoffer Larsen.


Sunday was going to be tough, it was going to be brutal, it was going to be exciting. So tune back in then for the homestretch and the epic conclusion of Grand Prix Copenhagen 2018!
