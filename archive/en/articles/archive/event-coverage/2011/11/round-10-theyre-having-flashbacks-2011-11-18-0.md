Nico Bohny was 8-1 coming into round 10. After going 5-1 in Standard with Blue-White Delver, he handily 3-0'd his first draft pod. Standing in his way this round was Josh Utter-Leyton, who also 5-1'd Standard (with [Tempered Steel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tempered+Steel)) before 3-0'ing a draft pod of his own.

*Both Nico Bohny and Josh Utter-Leyton have 8-1 records. Who will keep their relatively untouched records going strong?*



### Game 1


Bohny won the die roll, and elected to play, trading his early [Civilized Scholar](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Civilized+Scholar) with Utter-Leyton's [One-Eyed Scarecrow](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=One-Eyed+Scarecrow). Unfortunately, this allowed Utter-Leyton to replace it with a [Makeshift Mauler](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Makeshift+Mauler) to hold off Bohny's [Undead Alchemist](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Undead+Alchemist). Bohny instead took to the air with a [Murder of Crows](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Murder+of+Crows), but Utter-Leyton hit that with a [Grasp of Phantoms](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grasp+of+Phantoms), then knocked it off the top of Bohny's deck with a [Dream Twist](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dream+Twist). Bohny replaced it with a less impressive 3/3 [Boneyard Wurm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Boneyard+Wurm).


Looking for a way past Utter-Leyton's Mauler, Bohny tried to summon a [Skaab Goliath](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skaab+Goliath), but it got [Lost in the Mist](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lost+in+the+Mist), and the [Undead Alchemist](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Undead+Alchemist) wandered off for a bit to try and find it.


Utter-Leyton finally revealed what his Blue-White deck was splashing red for, and cast [Burning Vengeance](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Burning+Vengeance), before flashing back a [Feeling of Dread](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Feeling+of+Dread) to kill off the Alchemist once and for all. He attacked with his Mauler and a [Deranged Assistant](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deranged+Assistant) to finally deal the first damage of the match.

*Bohny's spiders, courtesy of a [Spider Spawning](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spider+Spawning), were too fast of a clock for his opponent's [Burning Vengeance](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Burning+Vengeance) to handle.* 



However, Bohny was also reaching outside of his colors, and cleared the table in a [Blasphemous Act](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blasphemous+Act). Utter-Leyton repaired his side of the board with an [Armored Skaab](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Armored+Skaab) and an [Avacynian Priest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Avacynian+Priest), while Bohny cast a [Spider Spawning](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spider+Spawning) for eight.


Utter-Leyton flashed back a [Desperate Ravings](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Desperate+Ravings) to take down one arachnid, and summoned a [Moon Heron](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Moon+Heron), before taking 5 as the Spiders swarmed aggressively in his direction. Bohny utilized his [Shimmering Grotto](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shimmering+Grotto) to flash back the [Spider Spawning](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spider+Spawning), taking his Spider count up to thirteen. Two attacks later, and Utter-Leyton was buried under the eight-legged menace army.

"Are you gonna play or draw?" Bohny asked, as they shuffled.


"That's a good question," Utter-Leyton responded with a smile, before eventually admitting, "I'll play."


### Game 2


Utter-Leyton again managed a turn four [Makeshift Mauler](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Makeshift+Mauler), and again had the [Grasp of Phantoms](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grasp+of+Phantoms) and [Dream Twist](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dream+Twist) combo for Bohny's [Murder of Crows](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Murder+of+Crows). The Mauler dropped Bohny to single digits, but before Utter-Leyton could seal the deal, Bohny again cleared the room with a [Blasphemous Act](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blasphemous+Act).


This time, Utter-Leyton recovered with a [Moorland Haunt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Moorland+Haunt), while Bohny summoned a 6/6 [Boneyard Wurm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Boneyard+Wurm), and followed that up with a [Spider Spawning](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spider+Spawning). Unable to finish the battle in the air, Utter-Leyton simply flashed back [Dream Twist](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dream+Twist), retrieved it with [Runic Repetition](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Runic+Repetition), and spilled the rest of Bohny's library into his graveyard.

### Game 3


Bohny elected to play in game three, keeping his hand while Utter-Leyton threw back his seven.


Utter-Leyton summoning a [Deranged Assistant](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deranged+Assistant) and a [Moon Heron](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Moon+Heron), as Bohny summoned an [Orchard Spirit](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Orchard+Spirit), and [Undead Alchemist](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Undead+Alchemist).


Utter-Leyton fell to 18, and attacked back for 3, before summoning a [Chapel Geist](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chapel+Geist). Bohny attacked with both creatures. The Geist ate the [Spirit](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spirit), while the Alchemist milled 4 cards, recruiting one Zombie for its efforts. A [Woodland Sleuth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Woodland+Sleuth) swooped in to successfully solve the murder of the [Orchard Spirit](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Orchard+Spirit).

*Utter-Leyton goes big with [Mindshrieker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mindshrieker) to claim the match!* 



Without a fourth land, Utter-Leyton thought about frowning. (Have you ever seen his forehead move? I have not). He attacked with just the Heron, dropping Bohny to 14, before summoning a [Mindshrieker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mindshrieker).


Bohny cast [Forbidden Alchemy](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forbidden+Alchemy) before attacking with his Alchemist. Utter-Leyton offered the [Chapel Geist](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chapel+Geist) trade, and Bohny accepted. Utter-Leyton attacked for 4 in the air, and summoned a [Makeshift Mauler](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Makeshift+Mauler). Bohny needed to find some spiders, and quick. He cast a [Think Twice](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Think+Twice) with flashback, but came up short.


Utter-Leyton activated the [Mindshrieker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mindshrieker) once, hitting [Forbidden Alchemy](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forbidden+Alchemy). He tried again, and was rewarded by a [Skaab Goliath](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skaab+Goliath), easily giving him enough to fly over for the win.
