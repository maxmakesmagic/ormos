Although players may have multiple accounts qualified for the *Worldwake* Championship event, players are not permitted to have more than 1 of their accounts entered in the event. Players are not permitted to have secondary accounts played by another person. If a player is discovered to have more than 1 account playing in a Championship before, during, or after the event, appropriate penalties will be applied (including disqualification from the event with no refund of product or event tickets).

Playing on another person's account, selling your account, etc. are all violations of the Terms of Service. If you play in these, win, and expect to get your prize, be very, very sure you are on your own account. We do not recognize "I and a friend jointly own the account," "It's my brother's account but he gave it to me," or similar. The only exception is an adult may authorize a single dependent child age 13-18 to play on an account that adult has purchased.

A list of all players that have qualified for the *Worldwake* Championship will be maintained on the Wizards of the Coast web site. Players will be registered into the championship after the downtime on Wednesday, March 10th. It will be the player's responsibility to make sure that they have been properly entered into this event and are able to join it PRIOR to the start of the Championship. If a player is qualified and is unable to join the championship, they will need to contact customer service to get this corrected.

**For all *Worldwake* Release Events, Wizards of the Coast reserves the right to modify, reschedule, and/or delete any tournament if, in its sole judgment, that tournament’s integrity has been compromised by an unforeseen technical issue and/or error in that tournament’s administration.**
