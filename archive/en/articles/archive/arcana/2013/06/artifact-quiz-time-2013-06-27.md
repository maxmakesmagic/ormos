Quiz time has come once again and this time we're looking at artifacts in the game of **Magic**. Everyone knows artifacts, everyone loves artifacts, and everyone plays artifacts. But how much do you actually know about artifacts? It's time to find out.


**1.** What is the cheapest artifact printed in last year's ***Magic** 2013*?


*(Difficulty: Easy)*


[Hint](#) - It costs zero mana to cast and has a dead guy in it.

**2.** [Draco](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Draco) has the highest converted mana cost of any non-silver-bordered artifacts at 16, but what is the most expensive non-silver-bordered *noncreature* artifact?


*(Difficulty: Medium)*


[Hint](#) - It costs ten mana and was originally printed in *Arabian Nights*.


[Reveal the answer](#)


![Aladdin's Lamp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?multiverseid=2014&type=card)


**3.** What one mana artifact does the *Return to Ravnica* block share with the *Kamigawa* block?


*(Difficulty: Medium)*


[Hint](#) - It was in *Saviors of Kamigawa* and *Return to Ravnica*.

![Pithing Needle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Pithing%20Needle)


**4.** Which of these artifacts wasn't in 2010's *From the Vault: Relics*?


*(Difficulty: Medium)*


[50/50 Hint](#) - Click this to eliminate two wrong answers.


* [Lotus Petal](#) - RIGHT Lotus Petal did not appear in *From the Vault: Relics*, it was in *From the Vault: Exiled*.
* [Ivory Tower](#) - WRONG It was in the set and even had new art commissioned for it!
* [Memory Jar](#) - WRONG Sorry, it was in there, and it had the art from when it was originally printed in *Urza's Legacy*.
* [Sword of Body and Mind](#) - WRONG It was in the box set as the preview card for the then-upcoming fall set, *Scars of Mirrodin*.

**5.** Looking back at Alpha, since that was the first set of **Magic** ever printed, and if you sort the cards in the set alphabetically, what is the first artifact ever?


*(Difficulty: Hard, Old-Timers Favored)*


[Hint](#) - "A \_ \_ \_---OF---\_ \_ \_ \_ \_ \_"
