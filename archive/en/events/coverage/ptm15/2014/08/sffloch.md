 No. 5 Ranked Player Owen Turtenwald is a titan of the current *Magic* scene. This former Player of the Year is competing in his second Pro Tour Top 8. Turtenwald is armed with a powerful White-Black Midrange deck that put both him and No. 20 Ranked Player William Jensen into the Top 8 of this Pro Tour.




 His opponent, Ivan Floch, is a Pro Tour mainstay with over 160 lifetime Pro Points that's competing in his first Pro Tour Top 8. Floch is playing a dedicated White-Blue Control deck that wins a very long game by countering spells and wiping the board repeatedly before doing it all over again thanks to [Sphinx's Revelation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sphinx%27s+Revelation) and [Elixir of Immortality](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elixir+of+Immortality). Both players have secured their place as the national champion of their countries, the United States and Slovakia respectively, by making it this far in the final Pro Tour of the year.






*Ivan Floch and No. 5 Ranked Player Owen Turtenwald face off in a match between [Sphinx's Revelation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sphinx%27s+Revelation)s and [Underworld Connections](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Underworld+Connections).*
