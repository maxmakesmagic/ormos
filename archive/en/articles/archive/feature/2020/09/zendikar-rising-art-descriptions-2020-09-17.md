*Zendikar Rising* is a wild place with some wild art. Let's take a look at a few of the art descriptions from which the amazing artists drew their inspiration.


Felidar Retreat
===============

**Setting**: Zendikar  
**Color**: White enchantment  
**Location**: A felidar lair  
**Action**: Show a rocky lair belonging to a family of felidars. There are bones littered by a cave entrance and a precarious rocky peak where an adult felidar lounges at the very top watching over the others below. Maybe there's a kitten or two playing.


Canyon Jerboa
=============

**Setting**: Zendikar  
**Color**: White creature  
**Location**: The ground of a rocky valley  
**Intent**: This card shows a stampede from a mouse's perspective.  
**Action**: Show a cute, fantastical mouse based on a jerboa (see reference, it's a small rodent with big back legs for jumping). It stands at the bottom of the ravine and sniffs the air for danger. The pebbles on the ground around it bounce into the air, and dirt billows in the background as if there's an earthquake. A stampede of creatures is coming, but we're too small to see them.  
**Focus**: The mouse


Charix, the Raging Isle
=======================

**Setting**: Zendikar  
**Color**: Blue legendary creature  
**Location**: The sea  
**Action**: Introduce us to Charix, a *massive* crab the size of a small continent. He bursts out of the sea, and water cascades off his shell. His shell has elements of the surrounding land, maybe a couple shrubs grow on it and bits of Skyclave ruin stick to it, giving it a distinctive pattern. He has multiple sets of pincers, but one should be much larger than the others (see fiddler crab reference). Include some elements for scale such as floating ruins or birds—it's important this creature be huge.  
**Focus**: Charix  
**Mood**: An absolute unit of a crab


Confounding Conundrum
=====================

**Focus**: The water puzzle  
**Mood**: Mind-boggling; an obstacle to overcome

=========================

**Setting**: Zendikar  
**Card type**: Black sorcery

**Setting**: Zendikar  
**Color**: Red creature  
**Location**: The top of a cliff edge  
**Action**: Show a canine-inspired take on a red-aligned Zendikar elemental standing at the very top of a precarious cliff. An elemental-meets-animal. It should have clawed paws made for climbing steep cliffs and a molten-red glow to its stone body.

**Mood**: Agile, fierce

=========================

**Focus**: The spitting lizard  
**Mood**: A little goofy, a lot of danger

**Action**: Show Nahiri attempting to calm the Roil using her enhanced lithomancy powers. She stands on a mountain peak, arms outstretched. Giant chunks of rock and ancient hedrons tear out of the land and swirl around her. It looks as if she is about to recreate the hedron network.  
**Focus**: Nahiri's lithomancy  
**Mood**: Stronger and more determined than ever

Maybe some explorers can be seen admiring it from below for scale.  
**Focus**: Ashaya  
**Mood**: A loyal guardian


Lotus Cobra (Showcase)
======================



![](https://media.wizards.com/2020/images/daily/lotus-cobra-showcase_cardart.jpg)Lotus Cobra | Art by: [Bastien Grivet](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?action=advanced&output=spoiler&method=visual&artist=+%5B%22Bastien%20Grivet%22%5D)
**Setting**: Zendikar  
**Color**: Green creature  
**Location**: Hanging above a lotus field

**Focus**: The colorful cobra  
**Mood**: Mesmerizing


Phylath, World Sculptor (Showcase)
==================================



![](https://media.wizards.com/2020/images/daily/phylath-world-sculptor-showcase_cardart.jpg)Phylath, World Sculptor | Art by: [Pascal Blanche](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?action=advanced&output=spoiler&method=visual&artist=+%5B%22Pascal%20Blanche%22%5D)

Omnath, Locus of Creation (Showcase)

**Focus**: Omnath  
**Mood**: Mana manifested


Forsaken Monument
=================

**Focus**: The ghostly room  
**Mood**: Spooky
