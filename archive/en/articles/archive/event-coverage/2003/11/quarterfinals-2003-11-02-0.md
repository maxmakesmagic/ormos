Will a deck with [Tinker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tinker)s and Monoliths win this Pro Tour?

The above questions seem similar, but yet there is one difference. Tomohiro Yokosuka is actually playing [Psychatog](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psychatog) in this tournament, and managed to assure a Top 8 berth. None of the aforementioned cards (from a total of fifty six copies in this Top 8) can be found from his deck. This makes him something of a hero of the people, fighting a just cause in this increasingly standardized world. This is Tomohiro's second Pro Tour, as he finished 25th in Yokohama.

His opponent this round is Gabriel Nassif. Known as Gabe to his friends and Mister N to his enemies, the Frenchman has quite an impressive resume. Masters final, team Pro Tour finals and whatnot. Not bad for someone not old enough to go to a casino.

Gabriel thinks that the matchup is very even, but that his experience will lead to him outplaying the opponent. He also thinks that this is one of the few matchups where [Mana Severance](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Severance) version is worse than normal [Tinker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tinker), as [Upheaval](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Upheaval) and Stroke of Genious provide a good late game. Tomohiro thinks that the match will be decided in great part with the coin flip, and he also says that turn two kills are not nice.

Gabriel won the die roll and chose to go first...but was that the correct call? The pros are still considering this question. He lead with a [Polluted Delta](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Polluted+Delta), sacrificed it to get an [Island](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island) and dropped a [Voltaic Key](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Voltaic+Key). Tomohiro played [Shivan Reef](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shivan+Reef). Gabe cast [Tinker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tinker) with the help of [Ancient Tomb](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ancient+Tomb) to get [Gilded Lotus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gilded+Lotus). Then he followed up with [Brainstorm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brainstorm) and [Mana Severance](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Severance). So much action, and this is only the second turn. Yokosuka played [Brainstorm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brainstorm) at end of turn, and shuffled during his turn with [Polluted Delta](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Polluted+Delta) getting an island. During Gabriel's upkeep Tomohiro [Ice](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ice)d the [Lotus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lotus). He had access to the information about the lands in Gabriel's hand, due to Severance. Maybe Gabriel was out of lands? This proved not to be the case, as the Frenchman played [Ancient Tomb](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ancient+Tomb), [Talisman of Progress](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Talisman+of+Progress) and [Tinker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tinker) for Charbelcher getting a concession from his opponent.

Nassif 1 - 0 Yokosuka

Tomohiro took out [Mana Leak](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak), [Isochron Scepter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Isochron+Scepter), [Intuition](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Intuition) and two [Boomerang](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Boomerang)s for three [Duress](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress) and 2 [Rack and Ruin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rack+and+Ruin). Gabriel replaced two [Voltaic Key](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Voltaic+Key)s and [Mystical Tutor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mystical+Tutor) with two [Deep Analysis](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deep+Analysis) and [Chain of Vapor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chain+of+Vapor).

Yokosuka took a mulligan, and pondered his next hand long and hard before keeping it. Gabriel was fine. Both players dropped [Island](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island) on turn one. I looked around and saw Hans Joachim HÃ¶h drawing cards. There was [Stroke of Genius](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stroke+of+Genius) on the table. He just drew and drew. It seemed like a never-ending process. But let's get back to this match.

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/ptno03/802.jpg)Tomohiro played [Bloodstained Mire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodstained+Mire) while Gabriel had a second [Island](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island). At the end of Yokosuka's third turn, Gabriel got [Mana Severance](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Severance) with Mystical tutor. The Japanese [Ice](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ice)d his land during upkeep but a third [Island](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island) helped cast the Severance. During his fourth turn Gabriel played [Gilded Lotus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gilded+Lotus) with the help of [City of Traitors](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=City+of+Traitors), and Tomohiro played [Fact or Fiction](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fact+or+Fiction) at end of turn. He took two [Counterspell](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterspell)s over two Scepters and [Accumulated Knowledge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Accumulated+Knowledge). Gabriel cast [Mystical Tutor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mystical+Tutor) for [Deep Analysis](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deep+Analysis), but second [Ice](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ice) shut down the [Lotus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lotus) during upkeep. Gabriel was only able to hard cast the Analysis. Tomohiro [Intuition](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Intuition)ed for [Accumulated Knowledge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Accumulated+Knowledge) at end of turn. During his turn he cast it and played Mox in order to avoid discarding, bringing his mana count to seven with a full grip of cards.

Gabriel started casting the threats. Charbelcher got countered and he drew more with Analysis. Tomohiro [Brainstorm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brainstorm)ed, and second Charbelcher went immediately to the graveyard. Another Fact gave the Japanese three [Cunning Wish](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cunning+Wish)es over [Brainstorm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brainstorm) and [Fire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fire)/[Ice](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ice). Nassif got his [Tinker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tinker) countered but resolved a Charbelcher with three mana open. Tomohiro had seven mana open so he cast [Cunning Wish](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cunning+Wish). Oddly he took [Shattering Pulse](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shattering+Pulse) over [Stifle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stifle), meaning that he cannot cast the second Wish right then without dying, essentially wasting three mana.

Gabriel was shaking his head and saying to himself "[Fact or Fiction](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fact+or+Fiction)...makes difference!" Seemed like a strange situation for such an insight, but who am I to question him.

Nassif shot at end of Tomohiro's turn but another Wish got the [Stifle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stifle), and [Shattering Pulse](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shattering+Pulse) without buyback handled the shooter. Gabriel [Tinker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tinker)ed for [Mindslaver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mindslaver) and started to have fun, but not before Tomohiro Wished for [Tsabo's Decree](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tsabo%27s+Decree). Gabriel then played the fine turn of [Psychatog](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psychatog), Decree oneself, and in response discard hand and remove the graveyeard from the game. On his turn the fourth Charbelcher ended the game.

Nassif 2 - 0 Yokosuka

Tomohiro took the fourth [Mana Leak](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak) back in for a Fact of Fiction.

How did the [Psychatog](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psychatog) player lose after drawing so many extra cards? Knowledge for four and two full Facts is quite the load. Gabriel drawing several [Tinker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tinker)s and all four Charbelchers is no picnic for the opponent, but still the main issue was that all the [Duress](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress)es were hiding at the bottom of Tomohiro's deck.

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/ptno03/803.jpg)Yokosuka started with a Delta. Gabriel sped out a Talisman with [Ancient Tomb](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ancient+Tomb), and Tomohiro got [Island](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island) for end of turn [Brainstorm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brainstorm). A second Delta hit play and Gabriel cast his own [Brainstorm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brainstorm). Charbelcher got [Mana Leak](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak)ed during his turn. Tomohiro went [Swamp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swamp), [Duress](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress) seeing Charbelcher, [Tinker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tinker), [Force Spike](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Force+Spike), [Rishadan Port](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rishadan+Port) and [Chain of Vapor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chain+of+Vapor). [Tinker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tinker) got the boot. Gabriel played the shooter during his turn, Force Spiking a [Mana Leak](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak). Yokosuka was lacking a fourth land and just said go. Gabriel Ported the second [Island](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island) during his mainstep. Tomohiro took mana and [Ice](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ice)d the Belcher, but Gabriel just played Tomb and [Mana Severance](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Severance). With nothing but a Mox to play on his turn, Yokosuka succumbed in three games.

Nassif 3 - 0 Yokosuka.

Tomohiro thought that Nassif played well. Also a problem was that without drawing the [Rack and Ruin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rack+and+Ruin)s, he was unable to stop Gabriel ramping up the mana development. Gabriel would have taken Belcher with the [Duress](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress) but otherwise approved of his opponent's actions. He thought that the match was decided with good draws on his part, and an opposing mulligan.
