Saturday, Sept. 8: 10:41 a.m. - Round 1: Ray Weiss vs. Mike Vasovski
--------------------------------------------------------------------



*by Josh Bennett*

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/canat07/D1r1Vasovski.jpg)*Mike Vasovski*
Last year's National Runner-Up, Mike Vasovski, was not the picture of determination as he sat down to his first round.


"I think I was a little more prepared for last year's Nationals. I audibled to this deck at the last minute..." He shrugged.


His opponent, Ray Weiss, was a little more animated despite the early hour. As they shuffled, Vasovski found his game face. They were off.


Weiss played first, starting things off with a second-turn Martyr of Sands off snow-covered plains. Vasovski showed [Wall of Roots](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wall+of+Roots) off blue and green lands, making the matchup clear. While Vasovski suspended a Cloudskate and played a morph, Weiss was working his Scrying Sheets. Unable to find white mana of his own, Vasovski's Court Hussar played Impulse.


Weiss dropped Poryphyry Nodes. It ate the Wall, but the following turn the Cloudskate ticked its last and sent it back to his hand. On this attack, Weiss decided to block and sacrificed his Martyr. He laid down seven white cards.


"That's not bad, I guess," said Vasovski as he jotted them down. Three more Martyrs, [Story Circle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Story+Circle), Debtors' Knell, the Nodes, and a Beacon of Immortality. At first he counted only six.


"So wait, that Martyr is in your yard?"


Weiss shook his head and gestured to the fourth Martyr already in the bin. Vasovski said something unprintable.


"How am I going to win this game?" He dropped another morph. "I know how I'm going to win this game."


Then a minute later, "No, wait. I lied."


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/canat07/D1r1weissvasovski.jpg)Weiss dropped the Nodes and another Martyr. This time it was Venser who sent the enchantment back home. Vasovski sent two of his four ogres. Weiss again laid down his hand for twenty-one life. He had drawn Wrath. On his turn he replayed the Nodes again and Martyr Number Three. An end-of-turn Chord of Calling for six fetched [Brine Elemental](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brine+Elemental) for Vasovski.


He attacked and unmorphed a Shapeshifter after Weiss stuck his Martyr in the way. Weiss came out ahead on the exchange, lifewise. A [Momentary Blink](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Momentary+Blink) on the Cloudskate kept the Nodes off the table for another turn. Weiss tried again, now locked out of all but two white mana. Vasovski continued the lock on his turn, taking another big chunk out of Weiss's admittedly towering life total.


Finally, Weiss had a chance to use his Nodes. Unfortunately, he rushed his decision, offing the morph instead of Venser. He realized it almost immediately. With Blink in the yard and Venser on board he couldn't Wrath. He passed it back, shaking his head. From there, Vasovski's ample mana and Brine Lock proved enough to take the game.


Vasovski 1 - Weiss 0


After matching a pair of Coldsteel Hearts with Walls of Roots, Vasovski tried to answer a [Wrath of God](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wrath+of+God) with [Mystic Snake](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mystic+Snake) only to have it pointed out that his [Nimbus Maze](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nimbus+Maze) could not produce blue.


"Well, I screwed myself on that play."


It was his second warning of the match. Lands kept coming for Vasovski, but Weiss again had the Sheets filling his hand. After both players had seven lands on the table, Weiss drew out the Snake with Adarkar Valkyrie. Vasovski untapped and played a morph.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/canat07/D1r1Weiss.jpg)*Ray Weiss*
Weiss tried Nodes, forcing out a [Momentary Blink](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Momentary+Blink). He immediately followed up with Wrath, but Vasovski flicked out the second Blink to go with his two lands.


"... that sucks." - Ray Weiss


He tried baiting again the following turn with [Sacred Mesa](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sacred+Mesa), eating up one of the graveyard Blinks, and paving the way for his Debtors' Knell, but again Vasovski's two mana were enough, this time with Remand. The packets of four damage were adding up.


Weiss tried again. This time it was [Story Circle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Story+Circle) as the bait, and then Debtors' Knell. His relief was visible when it resolved, but it was short-lived. Vasovski had Cloudskate in hand and now Weiss was at six.


His last gasp was a Faith's Fetters, and naturally the morph was [Willbender](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Willbender). A turn later it was over.


Mike Vasovski defeats Ray Weiss 2-0


  


Saturday, Sept. 8: 12:25 p.m. - Round 2: Michael Thicke vs. Gary Krakower
-------------------------------------------------------------------------


*by Josh Bennett*

  
![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/canat07/D1r2Thicke.jpg)*Michael Thicke*
Two-time National Champion Gary Krakower has been a fixture of Canadian Pro **Magic** since the game's inception. After a first-round loss he faced off against west coast sometimes-writer, sometimes-player Michael Thicke.


"I see you've taken my strategy, lose the first round, face easier competition and tiebreakers be damned?" - Gary Krakower


"My opponent went first turn mountain, Bolt you. That used to mean you were bad." - Michael Thicke


Thicke went down to six cards and opened with a suspended Gargadon and a [Mogg War Marshal](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mogg+War+Marshal)l. Krakower had Simic Signet and [Wall of Roots](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wall+of+Roots), then considered his three mana before passing it back. He Remanded Thicke's attempt at a Tarmogyf. Thicke suspended a [Rift Bolt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rift+Bolt). Krakower made a morph and passed it back.


"That's a ... " - Michael Thicke


"Don't ask me, I don't know what I'm playing." - Gary Krakower


"Well, let's see what he is," said Thicke, unleashing the [Rift Bolt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rift+Bolt) on it. Krakower tapped two and flipped up Shapeshifter, turning into a wall. Thicke Charred it away and suspended another Bolt. Krakower made no play on his turn, and when Thicke replayed his [Tarmogoyf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf) he threw a Mouth of Ronom at it. Unfortunately, land was the fifth card type in a graveyard. Thicke didn't even have to sacrifice a land to his Gargadon to make the save.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/canat07/D1r2Board-%20A%20Beating.jpg)Krakower passed again, then summoned Teferi during combat. He let the 'Goyf through, falling to ten. He hit back for three and played a morph. Thicke sacrificed some lands to remove counters from his Gargadon, leaving it with one, and went forward to his upkeep. When he went to move it into play, Krakower reminded him of Teferi.


"... Oh." - Michael Thicke


"That's why I did that land thing with your [Tarmogoyf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf), to lull you into false confidence. One mistake apiece." - Gary Krakower


Thicke swung again, but this time he was interrupted by an unmorph of [Thelonite Hermit](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thelonite+Hermit). His expression showed he couldn't believe what was happening. Worse still, Krakower had a second Doppleganger to wrap it up.


"What should I sideboard against you? Is that a deck I should know about?" - Michael Thicke


"It's a variation, with my own tweaks. Probably a mistake." - Gary Krakower


This last with Krakower's trademark wry smile.


Krakower 1 - Thicke 0


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/canat07/D1r2Krakower.jpg)*Gary Krakower*
Thicke's start in Game 2 was less explosive. A Seal of Fire, a suspended [Rift Bolt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rift+Bolt), and then an Incinerate on endstep, which was Remanded. That allowed him to make [Keldon Marauders](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Keldon+Marauders). Krakower threw out a morph and used it as a speedbump. With damage on the stack he aimed [Pongify](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pongify) at his morph, forcing the Seal off the table. Thicke still hadn't found a third land.


Krakower untapped and passed it back without a play. Incinerate and the departing Marauders took him to twelve. Finally Thicke found a third land, but had no follow-up. Krakower dropped Teferi and Thicke got in another Incinerate while he could. Krakower returned fire for three. Thicke's Cryoclasm had Krakower at six, and it looked like he might steal a game.


Krakower made an endstep morph and hit for five. Thicke's second Cryoclasm put him to three. Krakower smiled and flipped up the Hermit. Rather than double-check that he had enough damage on table, he morphed a Shapeshifter for some extra damage, swinging for the win.


Krakower 2 - 0


  


Saturday, Sept. 8: 2:43 p.m. - Round 3: Francis Cormier vs. J. Evan Dean
------------------------------------------------------------------------


*by Josh Bennett*

  
![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/canat07/D1r3Dean.jpg)*Evan Dean*
Former National Team Member and internet scribe J. Evan Dean is probably best known for his works over at Starcitygames.com. Today he's chosen green-white aggro as his weapon in Standard. Across from him sat **Magic** *Online* maven and one of Quebec's best, Francis Cormier, who was with Blue-Black Control.


Dean's first play of [Paladin en-Vec](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Paladin+en-Vec) had its soul removed. He cycled a [Horizon Canopy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Horizon+Canopy) and tried a Ledgewalker. Cormier Remanded. He tried again on his next turn, and this time it stuck. Cormier dawdled over his triple [River of Tears](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=River+of+Tears) draw, and Dean started offering helpful suggestions about how to tap his lands.


"I have your best interests at heart." - J. Evan Dean


"The judges don't agree." - Francis Cormier


He eventually played a morph and an untapped Watery Grave, enabling him to [Cancel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cancel) Dean's attempt at a [Molder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Molder)vine Cloak. He had the other half of the equation in hand. He untapped and [Extirpate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Extirpate)d the Cloak, seeing that Dean's four cards were nothing more than three land and [Might of Old Krosa](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Might+of+Old+Krosa).


Dean plucked Selesnya Guildmage, but of course Cormier's last card was [Remove Soul](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Remove+Soul). The Ledgewalker and [Pendelhaven](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pendelhaven) nibbled Cormier to twelve. [Scryb Ranger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scryb+Ranger) joined the team, and Cormier was at nine. He dropped Teferi on end step. [Scryb Ranger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scryb+Ranger) saved Dean three life, but Cormier played a face-down [Brine Elemental](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brine+Elemental) and flipped it up immediately thanks to his wealthy storage lands.


Dean had finally drawn some gas, laying out Heirarch and a second Ledgewalker. Cormier's other morph was the Shapeshifter, and if not for the [Scryb Ranger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scryb+Ranger) things would be very dire indeed for Dean. He untapped his Ledgewalker and hit for two. Cormier had another morph and swung in with it, flipping up a second Elemental to take down the Heirarch, but his time had run out. Dean double-checked Cormier was at seven, then untapped Ledgewalkers on each of their turns. The [Might of Old Krosa](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Might+of+Old+Krosa) revealed earlier provided the last four.


Dean 1 - Cormier 0


For the first few turns, Cormier had ready answers. [Remove Soul](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Remove+Soul) for [Paladin en-Vec](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Paladin+en-Vec), Spell Snare for Ledgewalker, Last Gasp for the [Scryb Ranger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scryb+Ranger) that ate Game 1. Finally, he had to let Dean keep some creatures. He okayed Troll Ascetic and [Saffi Eriksdotter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Saffi+Eriksdotter), buying time on the latter with a Repeal, and Spell Snaring it on the way back down.


Still, Dean had an active threat, and one that he could Cloak up. He beat in for six. [Damnation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Damnation) put that nonsense on hold. Dean rebuilt with a second Paladin and dredged up the Cloak after Cormier played out a morph. He hit for five more and played out a [Soltari Priest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soltari+Priest).


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/canat07/D1r3Cormier.jpg)*Francis Cormier*
The morph (a Shapeshifter, naturally) traded with the Priest, and Dean's Heirarch fell to [Cancel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cancel). Grim Harvest (remember that card?) recurred the Shapeshifter to chump the mighty Paladin. Cormier cycled a Remand on a Ledgewalker and found himself a [Damnation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Damnation), clearing the board.


It looked like things had finally turned for Cormier. Dean had nothing to add to the board. Better still, he had enough land to start making Assembly Workers.


Unfortunately for him, Dean's deck was feeling particularly kind, serving up the brutal Selesnya Guildmage. He played it, and made a saproling in answer to Cormier's morphed Shapeshifter. Dean swung in with both his men and Cormier shrugged.


"I guess if I don't take him down now, I can't win."


He doubled up on the Guildmage. [Pendelhaven](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pendelhaven) and [Might of Old Krosa](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Might+of+Old+Krosa) meant the last four points, giving Dean the match.


J. Evan Dean defeats Francis Cormier 2-0


  


Saturday, Sept. 8: 3:51 p.m. - Round 4: Jason Olynyk vs. Matt Vienneau
----------------------------------------------------------------------


*by Josh Bennett*

  
![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/canat07/D1r4Vienneau.jpg)*Matt Vienneau*
From a strong pod at the top of the standings come two sides of Canadian **Magic** history. One one hand, you have Matt Vienneau, writer, pro, and bon vivant. On the other, you have the Bad News Bears story of 2005 National Champion Jason Olynyk.


Olynyk was quick to diminish his performance in 2005, citing the small turnout in Calgary and a heap of luck. He wasn't looking forward to facing Vienneau.


"Let's see. You have me on play skill, you have me on general knowledge. I have you on luck. What else?" - Jason Olynyk


"I'm good looking, you're ..." - Matt Vienneau


"I'm homely." - Jason Olynyk


"I wouldn't say homely." - Matt Vienneau


Olynyk sent back his first seven, and then his six. Finally, he had an acceptable grip. Vienneau started with a suspended [Shade of Trokair](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shade+of+Trokair), cycled a Marshalling Cry, and played [Prodigal Pyromancer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Prodigal+Pyromancer) before Olynyk found his firstt play: An [Aven Augur](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aven+Augur). Vienneau [Sudden Shock](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sudden+Shock)ed it and swung for three with his Shade.


Olynyk worked to undo his mulligan with a [Foresee](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Foresee). Vienneau hit again and played a [Needlepeak Spider](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Needlepeak+Spider). Olynyk played one of his all-stars: [Serra Sphinx](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Serra+Sphinx). Vienneau sent his monsters again, and Olynyk chose not to block. Vienneau chose not to pump his shade, leaving Olynyk at eight. Vienneau tapped out for [Saltfield Recluse](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Saltfield+Recluse) and [Mogg War Marshal](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mogg+War+Marshal)l. Olynyk played a second Sphinx. The Pyromancer took him to seven.


Vienneau chose not to keep his War Marshall and swung in with some monsters. Olynyk moved to trade one of the Sphinxes for the Spider, but once damage was on the stack, Vienneau showed him [Dust Elemental](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dust+Elemental).


"Well." - Jason Olynyk


That was really all there was to say.


Vienneau 1 - Olynyk 0


Olynyk had a faster start this time, with [Kavu Predator](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kavu+Predator) and a morph. Vienneau answered with [Amrou Scout](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Amrou+Scout) and a Ghostflame on the morph, which was [Shaper Parasite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shaper+Parasite).


"Record this as embarassing, please. [Healing Leaves](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Healing+Leaves) targetting you. Gain three life." - Jason Olynyk


Vienneau pursed his lips. "I guess I should've killed him instead."


Olynyk followed up with a Primal Focemage. Viennuea made a [Needlepeak Spider](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Needlepeak+Spider) and Olynyk sent both into his squad, offering Vienneau a chance to double-up on the 5/5. He declined, instead trading his scout for the Forcemage.


"The parade of bad cards continues," said Olynyk, tapping out for [Vitaspore Thallid](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vitaspore+Thallid) and a less-embarassing [Thallid Germinator](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thallid+Germinator). Vienneau made a [Shade of Trokair](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shade+of+Trokair), and this time agreed to team up on the 5/5. He had no follow-up. Olynyk sent his [Thallid](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thallid)s, losing the Germinator to a [Sudden Shock](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sudden+Shock).


Vienneau tapped his deck. "Anything but a land." But land it was.


An end of turn saproling doubled Olynyk's offensive potential. Vienneau showed disgust at having to squander a [Flowstone Embrace](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flowstone+Embrace) on the [Vitaspore Thallid](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vitaspore+Thallid), but Olynyk wasn't out tricks. [Pongify](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pongify) ugraded it to a 3/3. And though that would be enough, given Vienneau's draw, he put it directly to bed with a bought-back Srpout Swarm.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/canat07/D1r4BigTokens.jpg)Vienneau 1 - Olynyk 1


"Here I thought the [Serra Angel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Serra+Angel) Plan was better than the really bad [Thallid](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thallid) plan, but apparently I was mixed up. They do things differently in the 'Peg."


Veinneau opened with an aggressive start of [Blade of the Sixth Pride](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blade+of+the+Sixth+Pride) and [Goblin Skycutter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Skycutter). Olynyk suspended an [Infiltrator il-Kor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Infiltrator+il-Kor) and then stalled on two islands, playing [Dreamscape Artist](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dreamscape+Artist). Vienneau had [Flowstone Embrace](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flowstone+Embrace) at the ready.


And still no land for Olynyk. Vienneau's monsters weren't giving him much time. "I'm pretty sure I'm dead."


"I'm pretty sure you're dead too," said Vienneau. He drew his card, "Yes, I'm really sure you're dead." He turned over Ghostflame, and Olynyk extended the hand.


Matt Vienneau defeats Jason Olynyk 2-1


  


Saturday, Sept. 8: 4:48 p.m. - Round 5: Andrew Noworaj vs. Andrew Ting-A-Kee
----------------------------------------------------------------------------


*by Josh Bennett*

  
![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/canat07/D1r5Noworaj.jpg)*Andrew Noworaj*
The story of this battle of the Andrews is that both players are facing a downturn in their time to devote to **Magic** as their real-world responsibilities take over. Andrew Noworaj, a former National Top 8'er, is entering the final stages of his accounting degree, while Ting-A-Kee is pursuing extended education in pharmacology. Neither of these are subjects you can afford to snooze through.


"I don't actually get to practice limited all that much. I just learn from all the drafts I have to watch," says Ting-A-Kee, who work at 401 Games, one of the longtime centers of Ontario **Magic**.


Both players agreed that they were more prepared for the constructed portion of the event, a fact rewarded with undefeated records across Day 1's Standard.


"Do you like you draft deck?" - Andrew Ting-A-Kee


"I'm not sure. It's a colour combination I rarely play." - Andrew Noworaj


Noworaj showed a strong opening, suspending first [Durkwood Baloth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Durkwood+Baloth) then [Infiltrator il-Kor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Infiltrator+il-Kor). Ting-A-Kee had [Yixlid Jailer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Yixlid+Jailer) and an endstep [Aven Mindcensor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aven+Mindcensor) after Noworaj's third-turn [Greenseeker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Greenseeker). He hit for two and made a morph. Noworaj hit for three with his Inifiltrator and suspended a [Nantuko Shaman](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nantuko+Shaman).


He took another four damage, falling to twelve. Ting-A-Kee brought out [Rathi Trapper](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rathi+Trapper), pre-emptively answering the Baloth. Noworaj scored a card off his Shaman and swung for six. [Temporal Isolation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Temporal+Isolation) on the Shaman cut it in half. He added a morph to his squad, and answered [Viscid Lemures](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Viscid+Lemures) with [Second Wind](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Second+Wind).


His life total dwindling from the Mindcensor beats, Noworaj pushed his morph in front of Ting-A-Kee's, who pitched his last card to make a giant [Gathan Raiders](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gathan+Raiders). Noworaj wasn't without tricks of his own. His [Shaper Parasite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shaper+Parasite) took out the Trapper on its way to the bin.


"-2/+2?" - Andrew Ting-A-Kee


"I don't think so." - Andrew Noworaj


Now the Baloth was ruling the Red Zone. [Riftsweeper](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Riftsweeper) and [Aven Augur](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aven+Augur) joined Noworaj's party. On his next turn, Ting-A-Kee sent his Raiders with one card in hand. Noworaj called his bluff, and traded [Riftsweeper](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Riftsweeper) and [Greenseeker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Greenseeker) for them.


Finally, Ting-A-Kee was out of gas. His Mindcensor took one for the team, but he could find no answer to Noworaj's 5/5


Noworaj 1 - Ting-A-Kee 0


Ting-A-Kee made a face of resignation when Noworaj again busted out a first turn Baloth. He got on the board quickly, though, with [Benalish Cavalry](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Benalish+Cavalry) and a [Blightspeaker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blightspeaker). Noworaj made a morph. Ting-A-Kee hit for two and sat back on four mana. When the morph hit the red zone he started looking for a rebel. He made two passes through his deck.


"Whoops, I sided it out... How embarassing. I guess I get [Rathi Trapper](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rathi+Trapper) and declare no blocks." - Andrew Ting-A-Kee


Noworaj suspended a Shaman and took two more from the Cavalry. Ting-A-Kee played a morph. His Trapper kept the Shaman from swinging. Noworaj suspended an Infiltrator and passed it back. He took five to the face from the Cavalier and the now-revealed [Gathan Raiders](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gathan+Raiders). He soldiered on, getting a swamp with [Evolution Charm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Evolution+Charm).


Hopes of stabilization soon went out the window. Before he could attack, [Big Game Hunter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Big+Game+Hunter) was fetched to off the Baloth, and Trapper kept the rest of his offense locked down. He had Vorosh the Hunter, but no immediate answer to the trapper.


Ting-A-Kee made it quick, with Marshalling Cry and [Temporal Isolation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Temporal+Isolation).

Noworaj 1 - Ting-A-Kee 1


It was beatdown draws on both sides in the deciding game. Noworaj opened with Infiltrator and [Mire Boa](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mire+Boa). Ting-a-Kee responded with [Benalish Cavalry](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Benalish+Cavalry) and a morph. They traded blows. Ting-A-Kee suspended [Phthisis](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phthisis) and had Cradle to the Grave for an endstep Crookclaw Transmurter. Norowoj replaced it with [Giant Dustwasp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Giant+Dustwasp) and hit for five more.


Ting-A-Kee had Soot for the Wasp, and returned fire, flipping up his Raiders. Noworaj busted him to five. He chumped the incoming raiders, but was pushed back two turns when Ting-A-Kee sent his Infiltrator packing.


They swapped damage again. And then the [Mire Boa](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mire+Boa) had Ting-A-Kee at one, and a lone [Spinneret Sliver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spinneret+Sliver) was standing in the way. Ting-A-Kee paused, took a deep breath, and drew his card.


It was land number six. His last remaining card? [Necrotic Sliver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Necrotic+Sliver) for the match win.


Andrew Ting-A-Kee defeats Andrew Noworaj 2-1


  


Saturday, Sept. 8: 6:07 p.m. - Round 6: Gary Wise vs. Phil Samms
----------------------------------------------------------------


*by Josh Bennett*

The Big Ring tells you that Gary Wise is a Pro Tour Hall of Famer. He's the first to admit, though, that his attitude to the game has changed significantly. He no longer keeps the killer instinct that made him one of the game's best. These days, **Magic** for Wise is about fun. That's why when "Big Shirtless" Boyd Hardie called him up and reminded him that Nationals was taking place in his home town, he decided to come down and enjoy a day of gaming. His busy schedule as a poker reporter keeps him from most events. You'll find his smiling face looking back at you from ESPN.com, Bluff Magazine, and his own site, WiseHandPoker.net.


And then, there's Phil Samms. Arguably the Maritimes' most notorious player, he proved he was more than a loveable buffoon last year by waltzing his way into the Nationals Top 8. Wise was quick to poke fun.


"There were some great stories out of the Maritimes back in the day. I remember one year, at a certain regionals, the Head Judge stood up to make the opening announcement: 'Thank you all for coming, we're really excited to be hosting this year's regional championships. Now, look across from you. That player is your first round opponent.' The thing was, the players hadn't been seated. They were milling around randomly. The PLAYERS got to pick their first round opponent."


Wise opened with [Augur of Skulls](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Augur+of+Skulls) and a [Deepcavern Imp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deepcavern+Imp). Samms followed with a suspended [Infiltrator il-Kor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Infiltrator+il-Kor) and a morph. He outclassed Wise's turn four [Dunerider Outlaw](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dunerider+Outlaw) with a [Prodigal Pyromancer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Prodigal+Pyromancer). Wise untapped and went into the tank. He chose not to sacrifice his Augur, swung for two, and passed it back with his mana up. The Pyromancer ate the Outlaw, and Wise charged up his [Calciform Pools](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Calciform+Pools).


This time, he did sacrifice it, getting some action out of Samms's hand. He took another batch of beats and continued to charge his lands. The next turn, he started tapping mana, and did not stop until he had cashed out all his storage counters. With an embarassed smile he showed Arkoma, Angel of Wrath. Samms nodded. There was nothing he could do.


"Hell of a topdeck. Three spells, nine lands before I drew her." - Gary Wise


Wise 1 - Samms 0


"This game, turn six Akroma is my plan. I'm going to do nothing but charge my lands." - Gary Wise


Wise showed a [Calciform Pools](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Calciform+Pools) on turn two.



![Calciform Pools](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Calciform+Pools)

"There it is! The first piece of the puzzle!" - Phil Samms


He charged it and used it to bring out an [Amrou Scout](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Amrou+Scout). Samms sent it home with Dead, untapped, and dropped a 3/3 [Primal Plasma](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Primal+Plasma). Wise made an [Augur of Skulls](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Augur+of+Skulls) to hold it off, so Samms took to the air with [Whip-Spine Drake](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Whip-Spine+Drake). Unfortunately for Wise, his four land left him no better option than casting [Grave Peril](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grave+Peril).


Worse still, Samms had [Piracy Charm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Piracy+Charm) for his Augur, and hit for six. Wise made a [Fleshwrither](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fleshwrither) to trade with the Plasma, but Samms had the [Brute Force](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brute+Force). That far ahead, his [Mystical Teachings](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mystical+Teachings) for [Sudden Shock](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sudden+Shock) was enough to seal the deal.


Wise 1 - Samms 1


Wise's aggressive draw had the best of Samms early in this game. He had [Amrou Scout](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Amrou+Scout), Cloudchaster Kestrel, and [Deepcavern Imp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deepcavern+Imp). Samms's token resistance was a [Blind Phantasm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blind+Phantasm), and after he passed on four mana the fliers had him to ten.


Wise looked at him, and then shrugged. "Well, if you've got it, you've got it." He added [Amrou Seekers](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Amrou+Seekers) to his squad. Samms smiled. "I don't have it," he said, turning over [Mystical Teachings](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mystical+Teachings), "but I'm gonna get it." His [Sulfurous Blast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sulfurous+Blast) was just what the doctor ordered.


"And with the 2/3, nice." - Gary Wise


"Yes, it's clear I practice." - Phil Samms


He swept the board on his upkeep and got in for an extra two. Wise had nothing more than a [Saltfield Recluse](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Saltfield+Recluse). Samms ratcheted up the beats with [Whip-Spine Drake](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Whip-Spine+Drake).


"Drakey Drakey." - Phil Samms


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/canat07/D1r6psamms.jpg)*Phil Samms*
"Eggs and Bakey." - Gary Wise


"God, WHY did you have to say that? Now I want bacon. I can't take these mind games!" - Phil Samms


Samms added a [Dreamscape Artist](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dreamscape+Artist), but the recluse was slowing the damage. Finally Wise hit a sixth land hit Samms with [Mindstab](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mindstab). Samms [Piracy Charm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Piracy+Charm)ed away Wise's last card ([Rebuff the Wicked](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rebuff+the+Wicked)) and Harrowed in responce.


Naturally, his next draw was action: A [Primal Plasma](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Primal+Plasma) as 2/2 Flier. When Wise found a blank waiting for him, he extended the hand in concession.


Afterwards Wise said that his record would probably keep him from coming back for Day 2. That, and his regular casual playgroup (shoutouts to Phil Gurvich, Chris LeSauvage, Shawn Hearn and Mark Brombacher) were expecting him for some melee. The good news is, that if his work doesn't interfere, we might be seeing more Gary Wise at this years Worlds.


Phil Samms defeats Gary Wise 2-1


  


Saturday, Sept. 8: 7:14 p.m. - Round 7: Shaun Mclaren vs. Andrew Ting-A-Kee
---------------------------------------------------------------------------


*by Josh Bennett*

  
![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/canat07/D1r7TingAKee.jpg)*Andrew Ting-A-Kee*
Edmonton's Shaun Mclaren has quietly worked his way a six-round undefeated record. Joining him there is Toronto's Andrew Ting-A-Kee, and now they will see who will emerge as Day 1's sole undefeated.


Ting-A-Kee started with a suspended [Infiltrator il-Kor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Infiltrator+il-Kor), following up with [Prismatic Lens](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Prismatic+Lens) and [Emberwilde Augur](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Emberwilde+Augur). Mclaren had Thornwield Archer to trade with the 2/1, and a Dead for the incoming Infiltrator. Mclaren stayed defensive, trading a [Grinning Ignus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grinning+Ignus) with [Needlepeak Spider](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Needlepeak+Spider). His big mana deck just needed to weather the early assault.


Ting-A-Kee played a morph and passed it back. Mclaren took advantage of the lull to make a [Gemhide Sliver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gemhide+Sliver) and [Candles of Leng](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Candles+of+Leng). The long game was looking to be in his hands. Ting-A-Kee hit and played [Ironclaw Buzzardiers](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ironclaw+Buzzardiers).


Mclaren's retort was somewhat better. A kicked-up [Pouncing Wurm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pouncing+Wurm) hit the ground runing.


"That's not good." - Andrew Ting-A-Kee


He fought back valiantly, unmorphing a 5/1 [Aquamorph Entity](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aquamorph+Entity) and putting Mclaren to eleven. He suspended [Veiling Oddity](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Veiling+Oddity). Unfortunately for him, Mclaren had a second [Pouncing Wurm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pouncing+Wurm), and Ting-A-Kee was suddenly at two. His chump blockers kept him in the game only a turn longer.


Mclaren 1 - Ting-A-Kee 0


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/canat07/D1r7Mclaren.jpg)*Shaun Mclaren*
Again, Ting-A-Kee started with a suspended Infiltrator, and then a morph. Mclaren got [Nessian Courser](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nessian+Courser) in the way, and forced Ting-A-Kee to spend his fourth turn making [Aquamorph Entity](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aquamorph+Entity) big enough to trade. [Utopia Vow](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Utopia+Vow) shut down his Infiltrator.


Fortune, it seemed, was in no mood to be kind to Ting-A-Kee. With five land and a [Utopia Vow](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Utopia+Vow)ed creature in play, he cycled his [Chromatic Star](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chromatic+Star), but his deck refused to cough up a creature. He unceremoniously burned for one.


Mclaren played a [Herd Gnarr](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Herd+Gnarr) and watched Ting-A-Kee shrug through another turn. Then he took out a sack of doorknobs, in the form of [Grinning Ignus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grinning+Ignus). With his six lands and two counters on [Molten Slagheap](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Molten+Slagheap) he played the Ignus five times and sauntered in for twelve.


Ting-A-Kee drew, laughed to himself, and played [Premature Burial](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Premature+Burial) on the Ignus. "Maybe you don't have any creatures?" he asked hopefully. Mclaren simply untapped and showed them to him.
