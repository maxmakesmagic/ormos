Hélène Bergeot started her career with Wizards of the Coast in France in December, 1995; afterwards, she spent a few years in the European headquarters based in Belgium and eventually relocated to the Renton office. She is currently the director of organized play and trade marketing. 






It recently came to our attention that Jared Boettcher, the 2013–2014 Rookie of the Year, may have engaged in activities that violate Wizards of the Coast's Code of Conduct and the *Magic* tournament floor rules. After a thorough investigation by the Investigation Committee, those activities were unfortunately confirmed. Because these actions occurred at events that led to him earning the Rookie of the Year title, Jared Boettcher has been suspended from playing in sanctioned *Magic* tournaments for 46 months and his Rookie of the Year title has been revoked.



The Investigation Committee reviewed floor reports and video evidence from tournaments in which Boettcher manipulated his opponents' decks. This was not an isolated incident, but rather took place at multiple tournaments during the 2013–2014 season.



Because the title of Rookie of the Year was revoked from Mr. Boettcher, the title will pass to Raymond Perez Jr., who earned 33 Professional Points during the 2013–2014 Premier Play season.



As Rookie of the Year, Mr. Perez will receive an invitation to compete in the 2014 World Championship.



Wizards and the *Magic* community expect all players, especially those at the highest level of competitive play, to be professional, responsible, and sportsmanlike. Wizards of the Coast will always ensure that the integrity of *Magic* and its tournaments are protected.


We’d like to thank our community of players, professionals, and judges in reporting evidence of suspicious behavior so promptly. As a reminder, suspicious behavior at Magic events and evidence can always be reported [here](http://wizards.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/1236/).
