Core set Limited has a tendency to shine light on subjects that remain hidden in more complex formats. It's easy for fundamental Limited concepts to get lost in the fray of color fixing, power, and complex interactions. Core set liberates us a bit and lets us concentrate on some basics for a while.

I like that.

 There are many misconceptions about what makes a good card in Limited, and why. The "why" is the important part. I believe that someone can know something to be true, but without the knowledge of *why* it's true, it's almost meaningless. I've heard people say a card is good or bad—and be correct—yet still lack the ability to explain *why* that is the case. I like to dive deep on subjects like this.
