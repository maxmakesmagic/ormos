The popularity of Abzan is not an exaggeration. The Filipinos love their [Siege Rhino](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Siege+Rhino)s and more than 40% of the field were sporting the powerful beast in their decks, whether they adopted the Aggro or Midrange strategies. For clarity, the Abzan decks containing [Whip of Erebos](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Whip+of+Erebos) have been sub-categorized.


Mardu Midrange proved to be the second most popular color combination, possibly due to its diverse range of threats and impressive removal suite. The most surprising is how poorly Sidisi Whip is faring, with only 2 competitors making it through to Day 2. Perhaps the day of the Sultai Brood is over, for now...

| Mardu Midrange | 19 | 15.45 |
