 Marcus Rosewaterus loves Mark Rosewater. Huge fan. Wants to know if he’ll sign his copy of Drive to Work: Director’s Commentary. Twice. He also used to write for Roseanne. 






Appreciate one of the great geniuses of our time on his time during drive time with the box set release of Drive to Work, the podcast for the *Magic* designer in all of us.

The perfect gift for anyone who loves Rosewater's [columns](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/columns/making-magic-archive), his [Tumblr](http://markrosewater.tumblr.com/), his [Twitter](https://twitter.com/maro254), his [web comic](http://markrosewater.tumblr.com/image/115033228148), his [puzzles](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/magazine/article.aspx?x=mtgcom/feature/35), his [Wikipedia page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Rosewater), his [two credited episodes of *Roseanne*](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0742909/), the back of his cereal boxes, his manga, his Saturday morning cartoon, his spoken-word poetry, his rap album, and, of course, his [Drive to Work Podcasts](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/magic-gathering-drive-to-work/id580709168?mt=2).



More than 200 Podcasts are available in this collected work of tortured, and at times giddy, genius. Everything from the groundbreaking [DTW #1 "Tempest"](http://media.wizards.com/podcasts/magic/DrivetoWorkEp1.m4a) to the seminal game changer ["Future Sight—Part 3,"](http://media.wizards.com/podcasts/magic/drivetowork34futuresight3.mp3) or, as true fans call it, "FSP3."



As a bonus, Mark Rosewater himself has recorded a special, exclusive commentary track to let the reader hear into the mind while hearing into his mind. The commentary on Rosewater's commentary can only come from the man himself: Mark Rosewater.



You can listen to a sample clip from the special commentary track here:
