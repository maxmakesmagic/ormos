The Flashback
=============


Last weekend featured September's two Grand Prix.

Players from all over Europe—and a few Limited aficionados and travel fans from other continents—traveled to Spain last weekend for Grand Prix Madrid, the final Grand Prix to feature *Magic Origins* as its Limited format through the two-day main event.


Many came and tried their best to win—1,416 players, to be precise. However, it was Serbia's Aleksa Telarov, the recent *Magic Online* semifinalist and 2014 World *Magic* Cup quarterfinalist, who took home the trophy this weekend.
