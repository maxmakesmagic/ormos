### Everybody Keep Walking the Dinosaur (Functional)


With *Ixalan*, we changed several extremely Dinosaur-like creatures to actually be Dinosaurs. This prompted no small amount of discussion, and our creature type guru, Kelly Digges, agreed with some of the points raised.


The new additions to the list:


* [Gnathosaur](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gnathosaur) (Lizard to Dinosaur)
* [Pteron Ghost](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pteron+Ghost) (Spirit to Dinosaur Spirit)
* [Regal Behemoth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Regal+Behemoth) (Lizard to Dinosaur)
* [Ripscale Predator](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ripscale+Predator) (Lizard to Dinosaur)

As we depart the dino-tastic plane of Ixalan, we're not planning to do any further updates to dino-fy existing creatures.

### Grafdigger's Cage (Non-Functional)


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Grafdigger%27s+Cage)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grafdigger%27s+Cage)
[Grafdigger's Cage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grafdigger%27s+Cage) has had some confusion throughout the past as to exactly how it interacts with manifest or the sundry other effects that make things creatures but only after they've changed zones. We've cleaned up the wording a little bit to make it less ambiguous: if the card in the old zone is a creature card, it can't move. It doesn't matter what it would look like on the battlefieldâ€”this effect applies to creature cards in the old zone. This allows [Sculpting Steel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sculpting+Steel) to enter the battlefield as an artifact creature, but [Phyrexian Metamorph](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phyrexian+Metamorph) can't enter as a noncreature artifact. Remember that manifest uses the face-down-creature characteristics to determine what values the card has, so those remain cleanly blocked.


**Grafdigger's Cage's old rules text**:


Creature cards can't enter the battlefield from graveyards or libraries.  

Players can't cast spells from graveyards or libraries.


**Grafdigger's Cage's new rules text**:


Creature cards in graveyards and libraries can't enter the battlefield.  

Players can't cast spells from graveyards or libraries.

### Calming Verse and Rhystic Scrying (Non-Functional)


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Calming+Verse)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Calming+Verse) [![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Rhystic+Scrying)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rhystic+Scrying)
We keep finding stray commas hiding in our rules text. It's a little-known fact, but commas are actually delicious, with a close-textured candied filling and finely-spun caramel sugar work. The only possible conclusion is that wherever we spot a comma where it doesn't belong, we must eat it.


**Calming Verse's old rules text**:


Destroy all enchantments you don't control. Then, if you control an untapped land, destroy all enchantments you control.


**Calming Verse's new rules text**:


Destroy all enchantments you don't control. Then if you control an untapped land, destroy all enchantments you control.


**Rhystic Scrying's old rules text**:


Draw three cards. Then, if any player pays 2, discard three cards.


**Rhystic Scrying's new rules text**:


Draw three cards. Then if any player pays 2, discard three cards.

### Fire and Brimstone (Non-Functional)

While investigating what new rules we'd need for the latest *Commander* release, we stumbled upon this card. We have a cleaner way to express what it's saying, so we adapted it to use fewer words.


**Fire and Brimstone's old rules text**:


[Fire and Brimstone](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fire+and+Brimstone) deals 4 damage to target player who declared an attacking creature this turn and 4 damage to you.


**Fire and Brimstone's new rules text**:


[Fire and Brimstone](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fire+and+Brimstone) deals 4 damage to target player who attacked this turn and 4 damage to you.
