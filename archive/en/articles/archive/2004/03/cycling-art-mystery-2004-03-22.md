Scott M. Fischer illustrated a cycle of cycling cards (that's right, a group of related cards, each of which bears the cycling ability) that all featured a similar woman in the art.


Do you know on what cards this art appears? *(Give up? Scroll down to see the answer.)*

Answer: They're the cycling of Runes of Protection from *Urza's Saga* (see below).


Note that **[Rune of Protection: Artifacts](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rune+of+Protection%3A+Artifacts)** and **[Rune of Protection: Lands](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rune+of+Protection%3A+Lands)** were also illustrated by Scott M. Fischer, and may also feature this same woman in their art! (Well, it's debatable whether those hands on [Rune of Protection: Lands](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Rune%2Bof%2BProtection%253A%2BLands) belong to the same woman. But hey, let's call it a 7-card mono-white art cycle, pending any countermanding evidence. Scott, if you're reading, write in and let us know the mystery!)
