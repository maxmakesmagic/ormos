*Stuart Wright*
**Age:** 23


**Hometown:** Frimley


**Occupation:** Magic Player


**Magic Achievements:** T16 PT New Orleans 2003, T8 European Championships 2003


**What was your record in each format?**


**Standard:** 5-0-1  
**RGD Draft:**: 2-1  
***Coldsnap* Draft:** 2-1


**How did you prepare for this tournament?**


Playing lots and lots of tournaments on MTGO. I haven't actually played the deck in a tournament offline until now.


**What Standard deck did you play, and why?**


Vore, because I'm sure it's the best deck in the format.


**Did you have a particular strategy in *Coldsnap* draft?**


I'd be happy with any two of Blue, Black and Red, and ended up with a blue/black deck splashing for three [Surging Flame](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Surging+Flame)s and a [Rimescale Dragon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rimescale+Dragon). Other than that, picking Snow Land very highly.


**If you could choose the venue for the just-announced UK Nationals next year, where would you choose?**


Birmingham, probably. Maybe somewhere a little further north, but somewhere fairly central.

*Craig Stevenson*
**Age:** 32


**Hometown:** Leeds


**Occupation:** Managing Editor of StarCityGames.com


**Magic Achievements:** T4 GP London 2002, T32 PT Houston 2002


**What was your record in each format?**


**Standard:** 4-2  
**RGD Draft:**: 2-1  
***Coldsnap* Draft:** 3-0


**How did you prepare for this tournament?**


Choosing the deck early, plenty of testing with my mates on Team Leeds, playing a lot of MTGO and asking pros online for tips and tricks.


**What Standard deck did you play, and why?**


Ghazi-Glare, because it's fun to play and I've had success with it in both Team and regular Constructed events recently.


**Did you have a particular strategy in *Coldsnap* draft?**


Either the top-heavy Green deck or UB Snow. In the end I first-picked [Ronom Hulk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ronom+Hulk) and somehow ended up with six copies of [Surging Flame](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Surging+Flame).


**If you could choose the venue for the just-announced UK Nationals next year, where would you choose?**


Leeds! Or else somewhere as central as possible.

*Pete Norris*
**Age:** 29


**Hometown:** Cheshire - Craig Jones lives in my basement!


**Occupation:** I design mobile phone networks.


**Magic Achievements:** 2 GP Top 32s, attended 10 Pro Tours, and now English Nationals Top 8!


**What was your record in each format?**


**Standard:** 5-1  
**RGD Draft:**: 2-1  
***Coldsnap* Draft:** 2-1


**How did you prepare for this tournament?**


Built a lot of decks that didn't work, then went with this deck after doing well with it in the Team Pro Tour Qualifiers for Charleston and finding it worked well against the aggro decks in the format.


**What Standard deck did you play, and why?**


BW discard. It's good against decks like Sea Stompy, but weak against Tron - which unfortunately happens to be my quarter-final matchup.


**Did you have a particular strategy in *Coldsnap* draft?**


I was open to going for a risky strategy as I thought I needed to 3-0, so I was considering going for a ripple plan. I ended up with a strong BG deck with 4 [Aurochs Herd](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aurochs+Herd), 2 [Grim Harvest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grim+Harvest) and other strong cards.


**If you could choose the venue for the just-announced UK Nationals next year, where would you choose?**


Birmingham. It's central, easy to get to and has an airport.

*David Yendall*
**Age:** 14

**Magic Achievements:** Devon County Champion


**What was your record in each format?**


**Standard:** 6-0  
**RGD Draft:**: 0-3  
***Coldsnap* Draft:** 3-0


**How did you prepare for this tournament?**


Testing and casual play with friends - I wasn't really expecting to make Top 8!


**What Standard deck did you play, and why?**


A homemade four-colour control deck, it tested well and I know the deck.


**Did you have a particular strategy in *Coldsnap* draft?**


I went for an aggressive GW plan, with a low mana curve and splashing red for burn.


**If you could choose the venue for the just-announced UK Nationals next year, where would you choose?**


London

Tested with friends in our local group.


**What Standard deck did you play, and why?**


[Greater Good](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Greater+Good) Gifts - it has a good matchup with Zoo, I'm comfortable with the deck and it qualified me.


**Did you have a particular strategy in *Coldsnap* draft?**


Force the UR Snow deck, easier than it sounds as red is so deep.


**If you could choose the venue for the just-announced UK Nationals next year, where would you choose?**


London or Cardiff

Izzetron. It's powerful and I know the deck well.

I was happy to adjust to the packs, I didn't want to force any particular strategy.


**If you could choose the venue for the just-announced UK Nationals next year, where would you choose?**


England would be nice.
