I had a scrappy 4-color control/proliferate deck. It was amazing and I had some excellent games.





**What did you draft today, and how did that go?**


I drafted Elementals in the first draft, which was stellar. My second draft was average, but was a very successful green-white tokens deck.




**What were your best commons or uncommons this weekend? Why?**


[Nest Invader](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nest+Invader)! It's power, acceleration, and great at chump blocking.




**What do you want open for pack one, pick one? Why?**


Savaged Twister. It leads me where I want to be.






**What have you done to #MakeMagicHistory?**


I finally have a *Magic* resume for my personal #MagicHistory.
