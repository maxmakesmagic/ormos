You may have seen **[Oyobi, Who Split the Heavens](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oyobi%2C+Who+Split+the+Heavens)** spitting out 3/3 flying spirits in ***Magic** Online*. There's original art for those spirit tokens that you can see in the game.

The art for those 3/3 spirits was created by [Matt Thompson](http://gatherer.wizards.com/default.asp?first=1&last=100&term=Matt+Thompson&Field_Artist=on&setfilter=Allsets&colorfilter=All&output=summary&sort=name&x=31&y=32). Would you like to see the full art in its hi-res glory?

Thought you might.

If you look closely at the art of [Oyobi, Who Split the Heavens](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oyobi%2C+Who+Split+the+Heavens) by [Chris Moeller](http://gatherer.wizards.com/default.asp?first=1&last=100&term=christopher+moeller&Field_Artist=on&setfilter=Allsets&colorfilter=All&output=summary&sort=name&x=47&y=26), you can see the soaring, birdlike spirits that served as the basis for Matt's design.
