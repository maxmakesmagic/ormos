Magic Online: Creating an Account
=================================



 Posted in [ARTICLES](/en/articles)
 on December 8, 2013 










Please note, if you had an account on a previous version of Magic Online, you can log on to the current version by using your old user name and password.  All of your account's contents were moved over to the current version.  If you forgot your password, you can learn how to retrieve it [here](http://wizards.custhelp.com/cgi-bin/wizards.cfg/php/enduser/std_adp.php?p_faqid=1308).  If you've forgotten your user name, please contact Customer Service [here](http://wizards.custhelp.com/cgi-bin/wizards.cfg/php/enduser/std_adp.php?p_faqid=489).


To create a new account, go to the [Magic the Gathering Online webpage](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Digital/MagicOnline.aspx) and click on the create new account link.


The rest of the process is very self explanatory, however, feel free to use this guide for reference.  If you enter information that's invalid or incorrect, a small error message will appear by the field that needs to be changed.

If you are not old enough to complete account activation, you must have a parent or legal guardian complete the account activation for you.  Please have them complete the account setup process for you.


Next, you will need to pick a User Name or User ID.  Please read the [Naming Policy](http://wizards.custhelp.com/cgi-bin/wizards.cfg/php/enduser/std_adp.php?p_faqid=1357) to make sure the name you want is allowed.  A box will appear on the field indicating if the desired name is available or not.  If it is not, you'll have to pick another.   Once you find a suitable name that is available, you will need to choose a password, security question, and security answer.

You will need to choose a password that is at least 7 characters long and contain at least one numeric, lower, and upper case character.  Your security question answer should be something that cannot be easily guessed; however, you will need to make sure it's something you can remember as you will be asked for the answer when contacting Customer Service for assistance.
