This will be Calgary's first Grand Prix, where western hospitality and the warmth of summer promise to make it an exciting and entertaining weekend for **Magic** fans from both near and far. 

Located at the TELUS Convention Center right in the heart of downtown Calgary, all of the city's amenities will be at your fingertips before, during, and after the tournament. The state-of-the-art facility is a stone's throw from a plethora of dining options and hotels, adjacent to the city's transit system, and within arm's reach of numerous shopping and night life attractions.

 In addition to a challenging Standard main event, the weekend offers something to appeal to **Magic** players of every taste and ability. Whether you're committed to the entire weekend or just a couple of hours, Grand Prix Calgary has something for you. Kicking off with a free Mini-Master event on Friday and ending with the increasingly popular Sunday Super Series (offering a trip to Seattle to hobnob with the folks from Wizards of the Coast), the weekend will offer a full slate of side events from a variety of formats. Visit [www.westcanevents.com](http://www.westcanevents.com) for a full side event schedule, as well as a list of vendors, artists, and additional information. 

  

 *The **Magic: The Gathering**  Grand Prix tournament series is a great reason to get out into the **Magic** tournament community, catch up with old friends, meet some new ones, and play some great **Magic**. Grand Prix tournaments are world-wide open events that allow all **Magic**  players to participate and experience the thrill of a large-scale competition. In addition to cash prizes, a high Planeswalker Points multiplier, and exclusive foil promo cards for participants, Grand Prix feature a host of other activities, including side events and artist signings (prizes subject to change).

**Tournament Format**
  


* [Standard](http://www.wizards.com/Magic/TCG/Resources.aspx?x=judge/resources/sfrstandard)
* Deck lists are required.
* Players must use the same deck on Day 2 that they used on Day 1.


**Tournament Structure** 


* Modified Swiss-style (50-minute rounds).
* If 799 or fewer players register for the event, all players with an X-2-0 or better record OR the top 64 players—whichever number is greater—will advance to the second day of the event.
* If 800 or more players register for the event, all players with an X-2-0 or better record OR the top 128 players—whichever number is greater—will advance to the second day of the event.
* The Top 8 players after the final Swiss round on Day 2 will advance to the Top 8 single-elimination finals.
* Top 8 playoff matches will be best 2 of 3, and have no time limit. (Players are still expected to play at a normal pace and complete playoff matches in a reasonable amount of time.)
* Where necessary, the standings after the Swiss rounds will still be used to determine final order in the standings.
* For the first game of each match in the Top 8, the player that finished higher in the Swiss rounds chooses either to play first or to play second. For subsequent games in each Top 8 match, the usual Play/Draw rule applies (loser of the previous game decides whether to play first in the next game).


**Judges**
  
 The Head Judge for Grand Prix Calgary is Scott Marshall. Judge applications for certified judges are located at the [**Magic** judge website](http://apps.magicjudges.org) .

Previous qualification may be through a Qualifier tournament, through performance at a professional tournament, or by being an invited DCI player (valid upon the date of the official rank announcement for the appropriate professional tournament).

(For Grand Prix Calgary, the cutoff date will be July 24.) Points earned in tournaments held at the Grand Prix event site do not count toward earned byes at that Grand Prix. Byes will be given to players in the Grand Prix based on the following criteria:

**Trial winners**
  
 Winners of a Trial tournament are awarded 3 byes in the Grand Prix that it feeds. Trial byes are not cumulative with other byes and do not pass down. Byes are not cumulative throughout the season or year. Byes do not pass down under any circumstances. Players who accumulate multiple byes to a particular Grand Prix tournament receive only the bye for the greatest number of rounds. For complete information about Grand Prix byes and their corresponding competitive season, please check the [2012 Magic Premier Event Invitation Policy](http://www.wizards.com/wpn/Document.aspx?x=Magic_The_Gathering_Premier_Event_Invitation_Policy).
