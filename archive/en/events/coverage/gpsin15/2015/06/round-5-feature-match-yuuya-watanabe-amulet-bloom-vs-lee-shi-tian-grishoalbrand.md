It would be hard-pressed for anyone to find a better featured match than this one. In fact, it was probably impossible this weekend.


With 7 Pro Tour Top 8s and 27 Grand Prix Top 8s between them, (3) Yuuya Watanabe and (4) Lee Shi Tian were the highest ranked players in the room, and also the players with the most Pro Points. Both of them are tied at 56, the frontrunners to represent Asia Pacific at the World Championships.


However, what was really at stake was a shot at being the Player of the Year. Both players have yet to utilize their Grand Prix Cap fully and any points they pick up today would increase their point total at full face value. With Eric Froelich at 60 and Sam black at 57, either of these players could steal the title and it starts with this match.


Both players have chosen the fastest decks in the format, but anyone who's been paying attention to the world of Modern should know that Lee's advantaged.


Grishoalbrand is potentially faster than Amulet Bloom and also had the full quad of [Blood Moon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Moon) in the sideboard.


Let's see if that will become Watanabe's downfall.


Game One
========


Watanabe pondered hard about his initial seven and decided it was acceptable. After all, it contained [Amulet of Vigor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Amulet+of+Vigor), which he cast off a turn one [Sunhome, Fortress of the Legion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sunhome%2C+Fortress+of+the+Legion). He didn't have [Summer Bloom](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Summer+Bloom) to go bonkers though.


Thereafter, he used [Khalni Garden](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Khalni+Garden) to get himself an irrelevant Plant token. Thanks to [Amulet of Vigor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Amulet+of+Vigor), he was able to untap the land to cast [Ancient Stirrings](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ancient+Stirrings) for [Vesuva](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vesuva).


Lee had a rather poor start and could only manage [Faithless Looting](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Faithless+Looting) and double [Night's Whisper](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Night%27s+Whisper) on his first three turns, still failing to find [Goryo's Vengeance](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goryo%27s+Vengeance).


Both players played each turn as though it was their last and neither player knew for sure if they would live to see their next turn.


However, with Lee not having the kill, Watanabe turned up the heat with a second [Amulet of Vigor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Amulet+of+Vigor). That allowed him to put into play [Simic Growth Chamber](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Simic+Growth+Chamber), untapping it twice to power out [Hive Mind](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hive+Mind).


He tried to end the game there with [Summoner's Pact](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Summoner%27s+Pact) but Lee wasn't going to scoop just like that. Lee resolved his free copy of [Summoner's Pact](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Summoner%27s+Pact) to find [Borborygmos Enraged](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Borborygmos+Enraged), Watanabe used his copy to find [Azusa, Lost but Seeking](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Azusa%2C+Lost+but+Seeking).


On Lee's upkeep, he tapped all his three lands for mana, and added a 4th mana with [Simian Spirit Guide](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Simian+Spirit+Guide). [Manamorphose](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Manamorphose) converted a red mana into green, allowing him to pay for [Summoner's Pact](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Summoner%27s+Pact) to stay alive.

*Yuuya Watanabe fails to kill with [Hive Mind](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hive+Mind) trickery and goes with brute force instead.*


However, Watanabe simply untapped the next turn and cast [Summer Bloom](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Summer+Bloom) to generate sufficient mana for a pair of [Primeval Titan](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Primeval+Titan)s.

Game Two
========


Lee fanned opened his cards and pretty much decided to keep his hand instantly. Watanabe went down to six, and soon found out why Lee had been so nonchalant.


Pitching a pair of [Simian Spirit Guide](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Simian+Spirit+Guide), he threw out [Blood Moon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Moon) on his very first turn, causing the audience and Watanabe to wince.

With Watanabe totally locked out, Lee proceeded to cast [Desperate Ritual](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Desperate+Ritual) to resolve [Through the Breach](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Through+the+Breach). [Worldspine Wurm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Worldspine+Wurm) rushed into the red zone and when it bit the dust at the end of the turn, that left three 5/5 Wurms in its wake.


Watanabe of course had no solution and scooped up his cards without ever casting a single card in his hand, nor using a single mana all game.

Game Three
==========


Watanabe led with [Amulet of Vigor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Amulet+of+Vigor), and Lee started to shake his head profusely. He had [Blood Moon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Moon) and [Simian Spirit Guide](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Simian+Spirit+Guide) in his hand, but might not even survive to cast it. Using his first turn to cast [Faithless Looting](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Faithless+Looting), he passed his turn after discarding [Griselbrand](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Griselbrand).


**Lee:** "Second turn kill?"


**Watanabe:** "Maybe not."


Watanabe's hand was weak, consisting only [Azusa, Lost but Seeking](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Azusa%2C+Lost+but+Seeking) and lands, plus a very crucial [Seal of Primordium](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seal+of+Primordium).


That was the perfect answer to Lee's [Blood Moon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Moon), which he had a Forest to cast it off with. Watanabe bounced [Tolaria West](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tolaria+West) with [Boros Garrison](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Boros+Garrison) and transmuted it for [Summoner's Pact](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Summoner%27s+Pact), threatening the win next turn.


Lee was ready with a replacement copy of [Blood Moon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Moon), cheating death once again. Watanabe once again sank into the rut, immobilized.

*Lee Shi Tian's trusty [Blood Moon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Moon)s paves the way for an unobstructed victory.*


Flashing back [Faithless Looting](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Faithless+Looting), Lee found [Goryo's Vengeance](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goryo%27s+Vengeance) which allowed him to reanimate [Griselbrand](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Griselbrand). Going through the motions of drawing almost his entire deck by chaining [Nourishing Shoal](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nourishing+Shoal)s, Watanabe eventually extended his hand while lamenting how bad a matchup this actually was.

Lee Shi Tian defeats Yuuya Watanabe and moves on to 5-0.
