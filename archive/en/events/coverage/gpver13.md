Grand prix Verona 2013
----------------------


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/gpver13/trophy-shot.jpg)Mike Krasnitski came out of nowhere to take the title here at Grand Prix Verona. This is the first major title for his country, and his fellow Ukrainians were out in full force, cheering for him all throughout the Top 8 and carrying him off into the sunset afterwards. And his road to victory was by no means easy, as he had to defeat both Platinum pros in this Top 8. First, he dispatched Shahar Shenhar in the quarterfinals, then Italian Samuele Estratti in the semis. Finally, in the final, he met Andreas Nilsson and his black-red Zombies, and again his green-white-black, or "Junk", Reanimator prevailed, a deck touted over last week by both Martin JÅ¯za and Brad Nelson.


Coming into the tournament, the aggressive weenie decks in Naya and Jund were at the top of everyone's mind, but if anything, this Grand Prix marks the beginning of what some have called "The Restoration." [Thragtusk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thragtusk) s and, most fittingly, [Restoration Angel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Restoration+Angel) s abounded in several of the winning decks, including Krasnitski's, proving that midrange strategies are still a force to be reckoned with.


Good night from all of us here in Verona, Italy, and congratulations to Mike Krasnitski, our Grand Prix Verona 2013 Champion!
