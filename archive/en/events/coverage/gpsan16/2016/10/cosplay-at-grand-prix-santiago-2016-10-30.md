“I've been cosplaying now for three years. I enjoy the craft and process of creating the costume, I enjoy playing the character, and I especially enjoy sharing with the community. I've always liked card games, I played back in high school. What draws me to Magic is the lore. I've read up about it, and I like the power of bringing the characters to life from a picture.”


“Chandra is my favourite character in Magic. I had made a costume of Chandra once before, but I wanted to do a complete makeover of the costume because of the printing of [Chandra, Torch of Defiance](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chandra%2C+Torch+of+Defiance). I made the costume again from scratch, improving on everything I didn't like, and focusing on the little details.”


“Working on the Saheeli costume was much easier than Chandra. I picked Saheeli because I wanted to play a major character in the story, but not one we had seen before. I'm still working on the costume details, it's almost ready.”


**[Archangel Avacyn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Archangel+Avacyn)/[Avacyn, the Purifier](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Avacyn%2C+the+Purifier) & [Nahiri, the Harbinger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nahiri%2C+the+Harbinger) ([Fauna](https://www.facebook.com/faunacosplay))**

“I've been doing cosplay for four or five years, but I've been doing fashion design, leather goods, and other artisan work for 15 years. I've been cosplaying Magic now for three years. I cosplay Magic as I think it is so much more than just a card game. The artwork is amazing, the design, the art direction is so beautiful.”


“I chose Avacyn because I really love the character. The artwork is amazing; I instantly fell in love the it first time I saw it. It broke my heart when Avacyn died. My boyfriend, Big Fortuna, made the structure for the wings, and I made the cover with the feathers. I had to individually glue and stitch each feather to the fabric, and I went mad in the process! I made the armour and Big made the staff. Nahiri is the favourite card of my best friend. Nahiri was a lot quicker, just three days, though the sword is taking some extra time.”
