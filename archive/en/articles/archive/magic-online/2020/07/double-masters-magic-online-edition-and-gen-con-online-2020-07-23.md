Hello, *Magic Online* fans!


*Double Masters* is just around the corner, and previews are in full swing. [Check 'em out](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/card-image-gallery/double-masters) to see what powerful, awesome cards you get to draft when *Double Masters* events start on MTGO Friday, July 31, at 10 a.m. PT!


In addition, Gen Con Online is also next week, and we're happy to be working with Gen Con and Pastimes to bring Gen Con fans a suite of events. Check out the details below (hint: they are awesome and include a new feature we're testing out for this event).


Our maintenance will be Wednesday, July 29, and will start at 9 a.m. PT as usual with a target uptime of 12 p.m. noon PT. After we're back up, you can expect the following:


* Treasure Chests will be updated. We've made some big adjustments based on your feedback, and you can see the details below. As always, opening Treasure Chests after the downtime will provide cards based on this updated collation, regardless of when the Treasure Chests were earned.
* Support for *Double Masters* will be delivered, including updates to the Draft scene. Note that *Double Masters* will not be officially released until the morning of Friday, July 31. Once it is released, players will need to restart *Magic Online* to get the card data.
* Gen Con Online Code Redemption will be available for players who have signed up for events through Gen Con Online and Pastimes Games, and most Gen Con Online events will be published with the exception noted for *Double Masters* events above.

*DOUBLE MASTERS* RELEASE
========================


*Double Masters* is the set so nice, they had to name it twice . . . or, uh . . . double. Packed full of awesome cards, *Double Masters* features a unique collation that includes two rare or mythic rare cards and two foil cards (which could also be rare or mythic rare) in each pack. In fact, the packs are so awesome that when you draft, you'll make two first picks!


That's right! Each time you make your first selection from a pack in *Double Masters*, you'll get to make two selections. And since we had to update *Magic Online* to support the feature, we went ahead and overhauled the Draft scene to boot. Let's look at what changed.


![](https://media.wizards.com/2020/images/daily/Draft%20View%201.png)


*(Editor's Note: No pack will contain this many Expedition Maps.)*


Most obvious are the updated visuals, which now match the Play Lobby and other recent changes in the client. This overhaul also includes improving the information display. The Draft timer is now much more obvious and includes a "Submit" button that is active after you've reserved all your selections. Cards the system will automatically select for you if your timer runs out are now highlighted when you receive the pack. We've also made it clearer how many selections you must make and what your last selection is.


In addition, we've added a new display section that houses the sideboard, the table view, the filters, and the format and pack information. Hovering over those icons will temporarily open the desired area and let you interact with the contents while your cursor is there. Clicking on the icon will open the desired area and lock it open.


![](https://media.wizards.com/2020/images/daily/Draft%20View%202.png)


*(Editor's Note: This is also an impossible number of Expedition Maps. But, hey, we're still in the middle of previews.)*


Making Draft selections is largely unchanged. Clicking on a card will reserve, and clicking on a reserved card will unreserve it. Double-clicking will select it. You can also drag and drop cards or use the right-click context menu to make your selections. It is worth noting that when you've reserved multiple cards, reserving a card will unreserve your oldest selection. For example, let's say you need to make two selections and you reserve card 1 and then card 2. Once you click to reserve card 3, card 1 will no longer be reserved.


Beyond supporting *Double Masters*, the work we've done on Draft lays the foundation for some other interesting new experiences. Check out the Alternative Play schedule below for some more teasers.


*MAGIC ONLINE* MEETS GEN CON ONLINE!
====================================


We are happy to announce that *Magic Online* is joining forces with Gen Con and Pastimes this year to provide some unique *Magic* experiences, though, due to the pandemic, we're bringing the fun to our house! The *Magic* at Gen Con Online events start on July 30 and run through August 2. We'll be hosting the events, but Pastimes will be taking care of the entry and the prizes for these special events.


And we mean all-caps SPECIAL—like access to nearly every *Magic Online* card for up to a week special! Keep reading for the details.


To participate in Gen Con Online, you'll need two things: an entry token for the format (or formats if you're feeling saucy) you're interested in and a *Magic Online* account.


You can purchase event entries from the [Gen Con Online website](https://www.gencon.com/event_finder?search=Magic+Online). The Pastimes team will email you a code that you can redeem in the *Magic Online* store for the event entry object. After the event is over, we'll send the Pastimes team the results (though, please allow 48 hours for us to get the info transferred), and they will let you know how to claim your prizes at PastimesEvents.com.


If you don't have a *Magic Online* account yet, no worries. We no longer require a fee when creating a basic *Magic Online* [account](https://magic.wizards.com/en/mtgo#download-now), but not only do those accounts come with a selection of cards to get you started, they can also redeem codes and play in events, so there is no better time to get started.


If that wasn't enough, each player who redeems a code for a Gen Con Online Vintage or Legacy Constructed event entry will have access to almost every card on *Magic Online* until Wednesday, August 5. This lets players who may not be veteran *Magic Online* players participate without worrying about building a complete collection of Vintage or Legacy cards—though, long-time *Magic Online* veterans will also get this benefit if they sign up for a Gen Con Constructed event!


Once a player has redeemed the code for a Gen Con Constructed event, all the player needs to do is go to their collection and start building decks. Players will be able to test out decks in the Open Play area of the play lobby, or even in leagues. Since this is a trial run of this feature, not all versions of cards will be available to use. We recommend that players who are new to *Magic Online,* Vintage, or Legacy play some matches in the Open Play area to become familiar with the *Magic Online* interface and any decks they are thinking about playing before diving into any events.


Please note Gen Con Online code redemption will not be available until Wednesday, July 29, after our maintenance downtime (roughly 12 p.m. noon PT) and that the Gen Con *Double Masters* events will not be available to join until *Double Masters* goes live at 10 a.m. PT on Friday, July 31. Also note that while each format has its own entry token, that token can be used in any one of the corresponding scheduled events. Each event will have a limit of 672 players, however, and entry is strictly on a first come, first served basis.


Since we're offering digital events for Gen Con Online, we also wanted to make sure *Magic Online* players had some digital prizes to select from, so we've provided *Core Set 2021* boosters, *Core Set 2021* complete sets, *Double Masters* boosters, and *Double Masters* complete sets to put up on the *Magic* at Gen Con Online prize wall. Again, if you earn prizes, the Pastimes team will let you know how to get them at [PastimesEvents.com](http://pastimesevents.com/event-info/).

*DOUBLE MASTERS* TREASURE CHEST UPDATE
======================================


*Magic Online*'s vision is simple: More cards. More formats. More *Magic*. We've heard the conversations around Treasure Chests and how hard it is to find some cards distributed exclusively this way. This is counter to our "more cards" philosophy, so we've made several significant changes to the Treasure Chest collation in this update. Let's go through them and talk about what they mean for the future of Treasure Chests.


The main change is on the master table: the introduction of the "*Jumpstart*/C20" category for this season. We've added the *Ikoria* Commander and *Jumpstart* cards to this section with a 35% drop rate. This means more than a third of chests will have a card from one of those two sets. With loads of chests opened every week, this should significantly increase the supply of these cards.


The other change is to the curated sheet. We've removed a lot of cards, significantly reducing the number of possibilities of any given curated drop's contents. By doing this, the cards that remain will appear more often, giving presence on the curated sheet more meaning and weight. The curated sheet will continue to rotate, so just because a card has left the sheet for this iteration of Chests doesn't mean it won't be back. (It'll probably be back.)


The [Treasure Chest page](https://magic.wizards.com/en/MTGO/articles/archive/magic-online/treasure-chest-card-list-info) will be updated before *Double Masters* releases on July 29.


ALTERNATIVE PLAY CALENDAR
=========================


For the first two weeks of *Double Masters*, we're going to let that Draft format stand on its own. It's a great format with a unique Draft rule, and it's worth playing. We'll also offer a Sealed Deck league for you Sealed Deck aficionados.


But then, we're going to pull out some stops.


* From August 12–26, we're running the original CHAOS! Draft. Tons of sets from *Magic*'s history all coming together into the experience that we know and love.
* On August 26, lasting for two weeks until September 9, we're debuting something new. Something *Magic*'s never done before, either in digital or tabletop, and it's something that *Magic Online* is uniquely positioned to do. There's more information to come about that experience later, but in the meantime, all we can share is the name: "Supreme Draft."
* From September 9–16, we're going to be running a week of a new Cube Spotlight. We'll have the designer's in-depth article posted closer to the launch of that event.
* From September 16–30, the Modern Cube returns for two weeks. In the middle of this, *Zendikar Rising* comes out, but the Modern Cube will still be with us for the first week of that set. Play your favorite or don't pick a side and play both! We won't judge.

After that . . . well, you'll need to wait until we talk more about *Zendikar Rising* to hear about our plans for that Alternative Play calendar.
