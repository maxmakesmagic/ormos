**Hometown:** Sugar Loaf, New York, USA  
**Age:** 25  
**Occupation:** MTG




**What deck are you playing today and why?**  

 Jund. I had intended to play [Goryo's Vengeance](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goryo%27s+Vengeance) but I lost my deck on the plane! Jund is my backup and it's always served me well! I don't want to play against Yuta Takahashi because he is so good, but [Collected Company](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Collected+Company) decks are good matchups for me.




**Record for Day 1:** 8-1 (3 Byes)  
**Record for Day 2:** 4-1-1




**Previous *Magic* Accomplishments:**  

 1 Pro Tour Top 8, 11 Grand Prix Top 8s, 2011 *Magic Online* Champion. Runner-Up at the World Championships 2013

**Hometown:** Tokyo, Japan
