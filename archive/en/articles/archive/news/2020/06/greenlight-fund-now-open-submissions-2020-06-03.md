We are excited to announce that submissions for the Greenlight Fund are now open to all *Magic* content creators!


[It has been 5 months since we announced](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/news/announcing-magic-gathering-creator-program-2020-01-23) the *Magic* Creator Program and the Greenlight Fund! Since then, we have begun accepting hundreds of applications for the beta Creator Program in the US, Canada, and residents all throughout Europe. We are excited to see the growth of the Creator Program and are actively working on expanding it to even more regions and languages this year.


For those who need a reminder, the Greenlight Fund is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for our highest-quality producers and expert community builders to bring brand-new shows to life. We have set aside up to $1 million to seed new *Magic* series this year. Whether you want to showcase tabletop or digital *Magic*—or a combination of both—the Greenlight Fund can help make your vision a reality.


Here is how it works. You submit a business proposal for the first season of your new *Magic* show, whether it's a pre-produced video, live stream, novella, podcast, etc. We pick the ideas we think could grow to become a cornerstone of the community (think *Game Knights*, *Friday Nights*, *What The Deck* . . . or anything *Rhystic Studies* releases). If your idea is selected, we cover production for the first season to establish your audience. From there, it's yours to own, manage, and keep growing.


At the end of the day, we're looking for great, compelling *Magic* content. And we're willing to fund anything from $5,000 ideas to $250,000 ideas. If all of this sounds interesting to you, keep reading below for how to submit your application.


The Application
===============


The Greenlight Fund submission process is a bit different than originally announced. Now you can apply right here from the *Magic* website. You do not need to be a part of the Creator Program. And you do not need an active YouTube, Twitch, or Mixer channel.

**Greenlight Fund Application Form**


* What is your name?

* How will you set up your series to be self-sustaining after the Greenlight Fund has run out?
* Will you have any other sponsors for this series? If so, who?
* If awarded Greenlight Funds, when would we expect the first episode to premier? What would the release schedule look like?
* Describe in detail what this series will entail. What sort of content will you be focusing on? (We are expecting a couple paragraphs here.)
* Budget requested:
* How will this budget be used? Where will the money go?
* Additional notes you would like to include:




Greenlight Fund applications will go through a final round of reviews by a panel of internal stakeholders across multiple teams before we reach out to those whose submissions are accepted. This panel will be reviewing submissions based off many factors.


The selection criteria could include:


* Budget requirements and its use based on scope of series.
* Estimated success of content during its first season, and the content's continued success after Greenlight Fund sponsorship has ended.
	+ Community adoption, how many views and/or listens is the series receiving?
	+ How is the audience engaging, what is the community impact?
* Unique content ideas or opportunities our current creator community is not producing.
* Content that can reach outside of the current community and expand *Magic*'s fan base.
* Wizards of the Coast's marketing needs based on current and/or upcoming product releases.
* Being a positive brand ambassador, with a track record of professionalism.

These will be used as guidelines when reviewing, though all are not required for a submission to be accepted by us. We are determined to keep opportunities open so that the best creators in our community can shine through. After all, we just want to help you make content you and the community are excited for!

Thank you for making the *Magic* creator community one of the best in the industry!

Now, let's go make great things happen!


FAQ
===


**How long do I have to submit my idea?**


The last day an application can be submitted for 2020 review will be September 30, 2020.


**Is the Greenlight Fund open for international applicants?**


Yes! Please review the Terms of Participation for details.


**How old do I have to be to submit an application?**


Applicants must be at least 18 years of age to qualify for the Greenlight Fund.


**Will the Greenlight Fund be extended to 2021?**


We hope so, but not guaranteed. We expect to learn a lot during the 2020 season of the *Magic* Greenlight Fund. If we have found the Greenlight Fund initiative was successful, based on the goals that we used to review applications above, we will find ways to continue its support.


**What if COVID-19 has affected my approved proposal, can I differ its production?**


If a fund recipient's proposed series is affected by the constraints COVID-19 has had on its production, we will work with the recipient to find a mutual solution to continue the content in a safe and beneficial way.


**Is the Greenlight Fund only available to those who stream *MTG Arena*?**


No! We are excited to receive applications from creators on all video platforms, podcasters, even article writers. Content can include gameplay, focus on any format or platform (paper, *MTG Arena*, MTGO), cosplay content, deck techs . . . basically anything *Magic* related, we are interested!


**Can I submit multiple applications?** 


There is no limit on the number of proposals a participant can submit; however, each proposal must be separate and unique from any other proposal submitted by that participant. Proposals which subvert the submission process are void.


**What if I want to pitch a show idea that already exists or have already pitched elsewhere?**


The first thing you need to make sure of is that you own the idea or show. If no one else owns it, then you can pitch it. The next thing you need to keep in mind is we are looking for shows that can grow and sustain. So, say you pitch us to fund your podcast that hasn't grown in over two years. That may count against you in the evaluation.


**Do I need to be part of the *Magic* Creator Program to submit for the Greenlight Fund?**


You do not need to be part of the Creator Program to apply. It will not block you from having your submission reviewed and awarded funds if the series is approved.


**If I already create *Magic* content, will that help me or hurt me?**


Having a track record of creating good content will likely help you. But that doesn't mean you should feel discouraged if you're newer to content creation. Ultimately, we want the best and freshest ideas to win.


**What if I already have an existing channel? How will my channel be impacted?** 


Much like the answer to the above question, having your own channel with a track record of creating good content helps but is no guarantee. Information regarding ownership rights is detailed in the Terms of Participation, outlined at the end of this article.


**How will I know if my application has been approved or not?**


We will reach out by email if we require further information about your submission or if your submission is approved as is. Instructions will follow in that email.


Submitting a Proposal as part of this Program does not guarantee that your Proposal (or any Proposal) will be selected. Any Proposals selected, will be selected by Wizards, in its sole and absolute discretion.


**How will I know if my application has been rejected?**


We expect to receive hundreds of solid proposals, and even more applications beyond that. Once we have chosen all the finalists, we will also send emails to those proposals that have been rejected.


There are many reasons why a project could be rejected, we will try to be as detailed in the reasoning as possible, when necessary. Keep in mind that not all projects may be approved, even if they are good projects. There may be times we have to reject a submission based on marketing priority of other projects, or how we are needing to distribute the Greenlight Fund across multiple projects.


**If my proposal has been rejected, can I resubmit it?**


You certainly can, however, we would suggest you make edits to your project for a better chance at approval. If we see multiple submissions for the same project, by the same user, the project will be automatically rejected.


**How long should I expect to wait before I receive an email?**


Expect at least a month for the review process. We expect many applications for the Greenlight Fund and want to give each one the attention it deserves to give it a fair review. An email reply may take some time, and we appreciate your patience while we review all Greenlight Fund applications.


However, if your application was not completed enough to warrant feedback, you will not receive an email.


**How long do I have to review an offer of funding before I accept?**


Chosen participants will be notified by email of their submission acceptance and will be required to accept or reject the offer within seven (7) days of date of issuance. If a potential fund recipient does not respond to the initial notification within the time period stated, all required documents are not returned within the specified time period, a notification is returned as undeliverable, or a potential fund recipient is not in compliance with these terms, the funds allocated to the participant will be forfeited at Wizards of the Coast's discretion.


**How mature can my content be?**


*Magic* is a game for ages 13 and up. Your content standards don't have to be the same as things you see Wizards of the Coast create. However, if your content isn't suitable for a wide variety of players of different ages and backgrounds, it runs the risk of being rejected. As a reminder, all content and proposals must adhere to Wizards of the Coast's [Code of Conduct](https://company.wizards.com/legal/code-conduct) and [Fan Content](https://company.wizards.com/fancontentpolicy) Policies.


**Can I include other products or brands in my content idea?**


You will only be able to use IP owned by Wizards of the Coast in your show. Additional sponsors you may have will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis and must be disclosed in your submission.


**How will I actually develop my series? Is Wizards producing it, or am I?**


Think of us as the investors. You will manage your show yourself or with your crew, and we will provide the funding for the first season.


**Will Wizards of the Coast handle any of the taxes on these funds?**


No. Any and all federal, state, and local taxes associated with acceptance and use of the funds are the sole responsibility of the fund recipient.


**You said one of the selection criteria is "Wizards's marketing needs." Does my show have to market new card sets?**


No, it doesn't! The important thing here is that we want to show off new and exciting things related to *Magic*. If we're between two similar ideas, and one of them could more easily include new cards, formats, characters, or topics related to the *Magic* franchise, this one will likely edge out the other.


**What happens after the first season? Do I have to keep making my show?** 


You're under no obligation to keep producing your show once the first season is done. But our goal is to pick the ideas that can grow into long-lasting series. Additionally, Wizards may choose to help fund additional seasons if we see promise that needs more time to grow.


**What's considered a season? Are their requirements for episodes or hours' worth of content?** 


There is not a minimum number of hours or episodes of content you will need to fulfill for your submission to qualify for internal review. However, we will be reviewing how much content both parties can expect based on the amount of budget being requested. In the application, there will be questions based on budget and content that will help us understand your plans. If accepted, the fund recipient and Wizards of the Coast will mutually agree on the amount of content being produced with those funds being rewarded.


**Do I own my idea? What does Wizards own?**


If you read the Terms of Participation, you will see you own your idea and content. Wizards is providing a sponsorship for the first season of your show, so you are under contract to deliver what you say you will. After that first season is done, Wizards can choose to provide additional funding for future seasons. Additionally, if you want to sell your idea down the road, Wizards has the right to negotiate to buy it from you first. Besides that, the show is yours to own and grow. Any IP owned by Wizards that's used in your content (e.g. products, content, logo, trademarks), we maintain ownership of.
