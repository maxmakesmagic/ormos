|  **Q: Big fan; I'll try to keep it short. If you could please find a way to turn Friday Nights into say a full half-hour sitcom I would love that. I would probably pay money for it, or something similar. —Arthur** |  |  |

Hi there Arthur, thanks so much!
A half-hour sitcom would probably be a prohibitive amount of work for us, but it would mean we'd be forced to play more Magic... for research purposes, you understand. Hmm.
Regardless, I've learned to "never say never" in the land of web video, but I think [Friday Nights](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Archive.aspx?author=LoadingReadyRun) is pretty happy with its current format, and we're just thrilled that you and so many other people enjoy it. That's why we make it, after all.
Thanks for watching!
—Graham |
