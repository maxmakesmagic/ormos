Josh Rider is trying his best not to let his success get the better of him. All weekend he's looked nothing but baffled at the match wins he kept racking up, and now that he's sitting in the semifinals he's pretty sure the whole thing is some kind of practical joke. Richard Hoaen also thought he wasn't going to be playing on Sunday, after drafting what he called The Worst Deck Ever and then losing his standard deck. He chose to drop rather than play out the last round. Ryan Fuller and David Rood convinced him to undrop, offering to lend him a copy of the deck. Then some chicanery happened, where he was left off the pairings and emergency paired against a four-point player, Adam Whitehead. He couldn't even beat him, but since Whitehead was out of contention anyways, he conceded the match to Hoaen. Not only that, but he even found his deck at the lost and found. It must have been fate. The matchup is Hoaen's [Psychatog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psychatog) against Rider's black-green Cemetery. 

### Game 1

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/natcan03/a896.jpg)Rider's lack of mulligans came back to haunt him as he was forced to go down to five cards. Hoaen jokingly reached to increment his game count. An early [Cabal Therapy](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cabal+Therapy) from Rider for [Counterspell](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterspell)s missed, but saw that Hoaen had a pair of [Concentrate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Concentrate)s, [Psychatog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psychatog) and [Smother](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Smother) in hand. Two turns later, Rider played a mainphase [Caller of the Claw](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Caller+of+the+Claw). Hoaen moved to [Smother](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Smother).

 "You, my friend, are jumping the gun" – Josh Rider

He flashed back his Therapy and hit the [Concentrate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Concentrate)s. Hoaen put out his [Psychatog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psychatog). Rider needed a swamp rip to put it under his [Butcher](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Butcher), but found none. Hoaen hit and played his fourth land. Rider found a forest, and tried [Phantom Centaur](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phantom+Centaur), reaching for coins from his pocket.

 "[Cunning Wish](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cunning+Wish), you don't need those." – Richard Hoaen

"Oh good, thanks." – Josh Rider

Hoaen fetched the [Logic](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Logic) from his board and shut down the Centaur. Finally Rider got the swamp for his [Butcher](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Butcher). Hoaen made no play. Rider got in with a Herald. Hoaen played his sixth land and went for the throat with [Upheaval](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Upheaval). Rider floated two mana, and Hoaen's face fell. Rider showed him the [Smother](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Smother). Rider replayed his Herald and it was [Smother](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Smother)ed, giving him another Herald.

"So we're at card parity after I double-mulliganed? That's certainly something." – Josh Rider

"Certainly something." – Richard Hoaen

"Certainly something." – Josh Rider

Hoaen played a land and passed. Rider Therapied him for [Counterspell](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterspell), missed, but saw [Concentrate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Concentrate), [Psychatog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psychatog), [Innocent Blood](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Innocent+Blood) and [Smother](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Smother). He immediately sacrificed his Herald to steal the [Concentrate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Concentrate), but forgot to search for another. He shook his head at his mistake. Hoaen made no play. Rider made [Stronghold Assassin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stronghold+Assassin). Hoaen dug for more action with [Deep Analysis](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deep+Analysis). Rider hit and made a Herald.

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/natcan03/a898.jpg)Finally Hoaen was moved to action. He spent his Blood and dropped [Psychatog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psychatog). Rider tried [Faceless Butcher](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Faceless+Butcher), but Hoaen had the [Circular Logic](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Circular+Logic). The next turn Rider tried again, but this time [Butcher](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Butcher) fell to [Counterspell](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterspell), and [Living Wish](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Living+Wish) to [Circular Logic](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Circular+Logic), leaving him empty-handed. 

Hoaen [Smother](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Smother)ed the Assassin and started swinging. Rider found an Elf for insurance before the [Psychatog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psychatog) would be lethal, and then managed to resolve [Oversold Cemetery](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oversold+Cemetery). He got back his [Phantom Centaur](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phantom+Centaur), which also resolved. He waited a couple of turns before daring to swing, so he'd have a few more blockers and a [Call](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Call)er in hand. Finally he swung. Hoaen smiled and nudged his [Psychatog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psychatog) to block.

"That may work in round two." – Josh Rider

"I assure you it didn't. He had [Wonder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wonder) in the graveyard." - Richard Hoaen

Hoaen fell to four and got one more draw. He flipped it over for all to see. It was not [Upheaval](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Upheaval).

Rider 1 – Hoaen 0

### Game 2

"JoshR, you double-mulliganed and won? What a sack!" – Mark Zajdner

Even with the boisterous "ScrubbyZ" in the house, it was all business for Game 2. Rider aimed for [Counterspell](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterspell) with [Cabal Therapy](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cabal+Therapy), and hit, seeing [Concentrate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Concentrate) and [Deep Analysis](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deep+Analysis). Rider spent his second turn searching for [City of Brass](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=City+of+Brass) with [Living Wish](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Living+Wish), and on his third tried for Llanowar Elf. Hoaen had [Counterspell](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterspell).

He eagerly tapped out for [Concentrate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Concentrate), and Rider came back at him with [Braids, Cabal Minion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Braids%2C+Cabal+Minion). Hoaen sacrificed a land, played another and [Deep Analysis](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deep+Analysis). Rider sacrificed a land and played out Herald and [Birds of Paradise](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Birds+of+Paradise). Hoaen put a Plague on [Birds](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Birds), while Rider's Herald took one for the team and got a friend. Hoaen kept drawing cards, managing to keep pace.

The big move was when Hoaen resolved [Zombie Infestation](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Zombie+Infestation) with a grip of six. It broke [Braids](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Braids)'s hold, especially after he pitched two Deep Analyses. Rider had the [Ray of Revelation](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ray+of+Revelation) to cut it down, but the two Zombies Hoaen made gave him room to maneuver. He had a counterspell for [Caller of the Claw](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Caller+of+the+Claw). He tried [Upheaval](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Upheaval), but had to give Rider the first land drop.

He had [Force Spike](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Force+Spike) ready for [Oversold Cemetery](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oversold+Cemetery), but [Braids](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Braids) resolved. Hoaen lost a land and Blooded it away. He followed up with [Psychatog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psychatog). Rider was shocked to find [Phantom Centaur](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phantom+Centaur) waiting at the top of his library.

"I won't block if you won't." – Richard Hoaen

"No deal." – Josh Rider

Rider tried another Centaur, but Hoaen had the [Logic](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Logic). That was okay, though, because Rider had the [Smother](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Smother). 

 "I don't believe this guy." – Richard Hoaen

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/natcan03/a897.jpg)"Who's the loser match?" – Elijah Pollock

"Uh, Guillaume and me. I mean..." – Richard Hoaen

Rider 2 – Hoaen 0

### Game 3

Hoaen's promise that he would "get creative" came to fruition with a first-turn [Duress](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress). It snagged an [Oversold Cemetery](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oversold+Cemetery). He saw that Rider's hand was [Phantom Centaur](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phantom+Centaur), [Braids](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Braids), Baloth, [Caller of the Claw](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Caller+of+the+Claw) and two land. Unfortunately, Rider's draw step yielded a [Smother](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Smother), so when Hoaen went for [Psychatog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psychatog) he was disappointed.

Rider untapped and Therapied for [Counterspell](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterspell)s, and scored. He noted a pair of [Logic](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Logic)s and [Upheaval](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Upheaval) in Hoaen's hand. Hoaen played his third land and was done. Rider did the same. Hoaen missed his third land drop, and passed the turn. Rider tried an end-of-turn [Caller of the Claw](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Caller+of+the+Claw), which Hoaen [Ghastly Demise](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ghastly+Demise)d. Unfortunately for him, Rider pulled up land number four, and threw down [Phantom Centaur](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phantom+Centaur).

Hoaen took the beats and hoped to draw an answer. His [Logic](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Logic)s took down [Braids](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Braids) and Baloth, but the 5/3 monster was unstoppable, and he soon succumbed.

**Final Result:** Josh Rider defeats Richard Hoaen 3-0
