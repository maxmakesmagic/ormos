From Rei Nakazawa, **Magic** creative text writer:  

Function: noun  

Etymology: Both of the major new species introduced in *Odyssey* are named after the type of animal they're based on. "Aven," of course, comes from the word *avian*, as in *bird*. "Cephalid" is derived in much the same way from *cephalopod*, which is the class of animal that includes squid, cuttlefish, and octopi.
