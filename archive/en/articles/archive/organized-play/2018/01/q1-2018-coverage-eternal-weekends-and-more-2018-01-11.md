Buckle up, because after a few weeks of hiatus and with a new year ahead of us, today's edition of Organized Play is packed with all sorts of stuff that'll interest you, including playmats, coverage deets, Eternal Weekend news, and some 2017–18 Team Series roster additions and updates.


All Sorts of Premier Event Goodness

The remaining Grand Prix in March will be receiving text coverage as our live video teams rest up and prepare for a stretch of events through the spring (Marc Calderaro in Phoenix, Chapman Sim in Kyoto with Japanese-language video by Nico Nico, and Tobi Henke in Amsterdam). We'll have a coverage roster article addressing the spring in the coming weeks, but until then, here are the playmats through mid-April!

[GP Seattle](http://cfbevents.com/gpseattle) kicks off April with a Grand Prix double-header featuring a Legacy main event on Friday and Saturday alongside a Standard main event on Saturday and Sunday.

![](https://media.wizards.com/2017/images/daily/OP20180111_Hartford.png)


Sydney has the wrinkle of being a Team Unified Modern main event, so players who compete in that one will have the chance of getting one of these three offerings.

That's a lot of Grand Prix, a lot of coverage, and a whole lot of playmats . . . and oh, right, there's more! The prize wall at GPs will showcase this season's Grand Prix T-shirt for you to pick up, themed to *Rivals of Ixalan*.

That's all for GPs this week. But we're not done just yet.


Eternal Weekend News
====================


Eternal Weekend returns in 2018, and with some big news—an expansion into Asia!


That's right! Eternal Weekends are coming! The first will take place in Paris, France, the weekend of May 5, as Europe's best Eternal players—and very likely some globetrotters as well—make their way to battle for the titles of Legacy and Vintage Champions.


The second Eternal Weekend takes place the weekend of August 18 in Yokohama, Japan, as the Legacy and Vintage Championships make their way to Japan for the very first time.


The third Eternal Weekend will take place in the United States, and we'll have more information available to you later this year on the location as those details are finalized.


2017–18 Team Series Updates
===========================


Since Pro Tour *Ixalan*, a couple of changes have taken place on a few of the competing teams in the 2017–18 Pro Tour Team Series. We also have a slew of newcomers who will be making a fashionably late debut at Pro Tour *Rivals of Ixalan* with their squads.


First, the changes:


* On Catharsis, Niels Noorlander has stepped away from the roster, and Piotr Glogowski has been officially substituted on to the primarily European team.
* On MetaGame Gurus Moon, Travis Woo has been substituted off the team and has been replaced with Shahar Shenhar on their squad.

A team made up entirely of Spanish players, including [Pro Tour *Fate Reforged*](https://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/ptfrf) Champion Antonio Del Moral Léon, Musashos is looking to kick off their 2017–18 season by defending their home turf in Bilbao.


**Mutility**
