 Better known as NumotTheNummy, Kenji is a lover of all things Magic. A "legendary streamer," you can almost always find him playing Magic Online over at his Twitch channel. When he's not playing Magic, Kenji enjoys long walks on the beach, romantic comedies, and devouring the hopes and dreams of the innocent. 






Pro Tour *Amonkhet* has come and gone, and wow was it spectacular! A few old favorites (Marvel) and a bunch of new strategies came to the forefront as players edged their way to a hopeful Top 8 slot. As custom with any Pro Tour, I've ran a series of matches with some of the best and sweetest decks to come from the tournament. What was the story of Pro Tour *Amonkhet*? Eldrazi versus Zombies. Fitting to the storyline *Eldritch Moon*, Zombies were able to overcome the monstrous Eldrazi in spectacular fashion.


So, what decks did I choose for this version of Running the Gauntlet? Enjoy the videos below to find out!

For those who watched, you may have noticed I added an extra match in there, one that I believe to have definitely been worth it. You get your Zombies, your Eldrazi, and maybe even a sun; what more could you want?


If you're a fan of Standard I would highly recommend giving at least one of these decks a try—they all have something fun and unique about them. The Pro Tour is simply a snapshot of what the best players in the world think will be good in a specific environment. There will always be room for innovation and wonder—the key is trying new things out.


Until next time, this is Kenji "NumotTheNummy" Egashira signing out. May all your suns set twice and all your Zombies be . . . well, Zombies.
