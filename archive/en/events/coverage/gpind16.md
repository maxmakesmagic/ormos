GRAND PRIX INDIANAPOLIS 2016
============================




Almost 2,000 players are battling Modern after the reverberations of *Eldritch Moon*! Check out the action on [twitch.tv/channelfireball](http://www.twitch.tv/channelfireball).
















GRAND PRIX INDIANAPOLIS 2016
----------------------------




* [Day 1 Coverage](#tabs-0)


Day 1 Coverage



Come one, come all! See the grandiose, grandiloquent, grand-poobah spectacle that is Grand Prix Indianapolis! There are almost 2,000 players sitting down to pound out the Modern format—and a lot of poundin’ needs doin’, let me tell you. Just because the *Magic* World Championships is next week doesn’t mean there isn’t some amazing action set to go down this weekend, especially in a format as crazy as Modern.


It’s been just a few months since the last batch of Modern Grand Prix events, but a lot has changed since then. Specifically, *Eldritch Moon* has happened. Cards from the new block have already made themselves known—like Prized Amalgam and Insolent Neonate. But what about, say, Emrakul, the Promised End? What about Thalia, Heretic Cathar? Eldritch Evolution? Elder Deep-Fiend? Grim Flayer? Bedlam Reveler? Haunted Dead? Spell Queller?


The list goes on *ad infinitum*—or, more appropriately—Ad Nauseam.


There will be some wonderful things afoot this weekend. Even some World Championship competitors have taken a break from testing to come in Indiana for the show. You can catch all the Modern-infused wonder all weekend here, and streaming on [twitch.tv/channelfireball](https://www.twitch.tv/channelfireball). The mayhem is already getting underway. So sit back, and enjoy the splendor.
