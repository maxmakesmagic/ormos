Standard Super League kicks off Season 2 tonight, and it should be fun to see what these twelve competitors do with the current wide-open Standard format.

Watch [twitch.tv/magic](http://www.twitch.tv/magic) tonight, August 11 at 6:00 p.m. PT (UTC-7) for the first episode of Standard Super League's second season!


Standard Super League decklists can be found [here](http://magic.wizards.com/en/MTGO/articles/archive/magic-online/standard-super-league-season-2-decklists).

The format for this season is three groups of four players each: the Brewers, the Streamers, and the Group of Death. Over the next three weeks, there's a round robin within each group, and then the top two players from each group will advance to a single-elimination playoff on September 8 (with the top two group winners receiving byes).


Andrew Cuneo's innovative [Sphinx's Tutelage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sphinx%27s+Tutelage) deck just won Grand Prix San Diego in the hands of Michael Majors. Does he have another trick up his sleeve? (Spoiler: yes, always.) Paul Rietzl just made Top 4 at that same Grand Prix; what will he bring to the table for his Super League debut? Tune in tonight at 6 p.m. Pacific (UTC-7) and find out. You'll also get to find out if he's as good at commentary as I think he'll be, because the players will be rotating through the commentary booth VSL-style.


Meanwhile, congratulations to, well, me for winning the Vintage Super League with [Grixis Pyromancer](http://magic.wizards.com/en/MTGO/articles/archive/magic-online/vintage-super-league-decklists#Buehler).

Losing Round 1 meant I had to win the maximum possible number of matches to come out on top of the double-elimination bracket, including four matches on the final show. Pulverize was probably my MVP, as bringing two in out of the sideboard (along with four [Ingot Chewer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ingot+Chewer)s and an extra Mountain) allowed me to beat both the Shops decks I ran into. Cabal Therapy is also a fun card to play with, and I do recommend the deck to any Vintage players who like interaction and decision-making.


I will be joined by Eric Froehlich and Chris Pikula in this fall's Super League Championship. Tom Martell also qualified for the LCQ that will immediately precede the SLC. But now it's time to see who can succeed in Standard. Tonight should be great!
