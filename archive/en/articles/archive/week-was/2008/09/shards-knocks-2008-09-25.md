Ready for the new-set smell of freshly cracked packs that can only be experienced at a Prerelease. I will be at Neutral Ground in New York this Saturday trying to hold my own alongside Jon Finkel and Steve O'Mahoney-Schwartz as the first inductees into the Neutral Ground Hall of Fame. The three of us will be competing in a Sealed Deck tournament against thirteen invitation-only players at 12 noon, hoping not to embarrass ourselves with the new cards. As such, I have spent quite a lot of time poring over the *Shards of Alara*[Visual Spoiler](/magic/TCG/Article.aspx?x=mtg/tcg/shardsofalara/spoiler) of known cards trying to understand the shards and to get a sense for what to expect from my wily opponents.

In addition to all the cards that have been previewed over the past three weeks here at **magicthegathering.com** there are images of all the cards that have been spoiled in magazines, other websites, podcasts, and videos. It is a tantalizing array of cards from what looks to be a powerful, colorful, and exciting set.

I have made no secret of my love for Ajani Vengeant, writing about it in a previous column. For Limited this card will lock down an attacker each turn, build up counters, and then kill any straysâ€”or an opponent if the timing is right. It is sure to be a Limited powerhouse but my eye is on this card for Constructed.

Since it is the Prerelease promotional card I will be playing in as many events as I can this weekend in an attempt to get a playset of the foiled alternate art version for Constructed. My red-white land destruction deck loses [Avalanche Riders](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Avalanche+Riders) when *Time Spiral* block rotates out but will try to replace it with the red-white planeswalker. I don't know if the deck is going to be competitive but it certainly takes great joy in playing against decks with abundant non-basic lands.
