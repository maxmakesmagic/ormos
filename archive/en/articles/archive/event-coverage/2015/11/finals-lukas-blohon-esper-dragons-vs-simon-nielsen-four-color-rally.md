 The big story to come out of this Grand Prix was that the two biggest European pro teams each found a way to beat the Rhino in the room with a different [Jace, Vryn's Prodigy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace%2C+Vryn%27s+Prodigy) deck. Team Cabin Crew (represented here by Gold level pro Lukas Blohon) put two players in the Top 8 with Esper Dragons [after discovering](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/gpbru15/resurgence-esper-dragons-2015-11-15) that that deck had a good matchup against Abzan. Team EUreka (represented here by Simon Nielsen, a member of the Danish World *Magic* Cup winning team) put three members in the Top 8 after coming to the seemingly counter-intuitive conclusion that Four-Color Rally could smash Abzan.



The Four-Color Rally players on Team EUreka had approximately a 23-1 record against Abzan in this event and roughly a 90% win percentage as a whole! As they explained to me, Abzan decks were usually not fast enough against them, especially considering they could chump block and Abzan was lacking sufficient cheap interaction. As a result, the [Rally the Ancestors](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rally+the+Ancestors) deck typically had enough time to set up a [Zulaport Cutthroat](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Zulaport+Cutthroat) kill. [Anafenza, the Foremost](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Anafenza%2C+the+Foremost) could shut down the engine, but according to them, just four Anafenzas wasn't good enough. Abzan players wouldn't always draw it and the Rally deck still had [Sidisi's Faithful](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sidisi%27s+Faithful) and [Murderous Cut](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Murderous+Cut) to deal with the legend. While they claimed that the deck was broken, they did warn that it was not easy to play and likened it to the practice-rewarding [Amulet of Vigor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Amulet+of+Vigor) combo deck in Modern.


But I disgress. Abzan was last week's deck. Well, it was still the most popular deck in Day 2 of this event, but judging by the Top 8 and their incredibly high win percentages, the breakout decks in Brussels were Esper Dragons and Four-Color Rally. So there couldn't be a more fitting finals.


Notably, Blohon had already fought this exact matchup several times in the Swiss and twice in the Top 8: he defeated Magnus Lantto in the quarterfinals and Martin Müller in the semifinals. So Blohon knew what to do in this matchup, but the [Rally the Ancestors](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rally+the+Ancestors) deck was so successful that it put three people in the Top 8. Also, Nielsen had beaten Blohon's teammate (16) Ondřej Stráský in the quarterfinals. Would Lukas Blohon be able to triumph over Rally one more time to win the tournament, or would Simon Nielsen be able to take the trophy with arguably the best-performing deck in the tournament?


Game 1
======


Nielsen was on the play, while Blohon had to mulligan into a weak hand. Once the game began, Nielsen played a bunch of quick creatures and started attacking Blohon with [Zulaport Cutthroat](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Zulaport+Cutthroat), [Catacomb Sifter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Catacomb+Sifter), and [Grim Haruspex](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grim+Haruspex).

A pair of [Foul-Tongue Invocation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Foul-Tongue+Invocation)s was not the answer that Blohon needed against that swarm of weenies. He tried to get back in the game with a turn-five [Dragonlord Ojutai](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragonlord+Ojutai), which was the best he could hope for, but it wasn't enough because Nielsen already had a dominating board presence that could easily exploit his death triggers.

Game 2
======


The key card in this game came from Blohon's sideboard. On turn four, Blohon cast [Infinite Obliteration](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Infinite+Obliteration), naming [Nantuko Husk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nantuko+Husk). Nielsen, with merely a [Zulaport Cutthroat](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Zulaport+Cutthroat) on the board, revealed a hand of all spells (three [Collected Company](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Collected+Company) and one [Rally the Ancestors](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rally+the+Ancestors)) but lost all the sacrifice outlets from his deck. Could Nielsen still win without [Nantuko Husk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nantuko+Husk)s?


Over the course of the next few turns, Nielsen bricked with [Collected Company](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Collected+Company) and merely assembled a ragtag beatdown team of [Zulaport Cutthroat](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Zulaport+Cutthroat) and Elvish Visionaries. It didn't seem to be good enough, especially once Blohon attacked with [Dragonlord Ojutai](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragonlord+Ojutai) and stabilized the board with [Arashin Cleric](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arashin+Cleric). Blohon may have had [Zurgo Bellstriker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Zurgo+Bellstriker) and [Ulamog, the Ceaseless Hunger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ulamog%2C+the+Ceaseless+Hunger) in mind when he put [Arashin Cleric](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arashin+Cleric) and [Infinite Obliteration](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Infinite+Obliteration) in his sideboard, but they were both great against Nielsen.

Nielsen tried to fight back with [Abzan Ascendancy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Abzan+Ascendancy), but without [Nantuko Husk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nantuko+Husk), he was unable to turn any of his creatures into a flying chumpblocker, and [Dragonlord Ojutai](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragonlord+Ojutai) soared over for the kill.

Game 3
======


The games so far had taken a while, so both players went for a quick restroom break. Some of the Danes who were watching the Top 8 from the sidelines joked about replacing Nielsen's deck by a [Giant Spider](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Giant+Spider) deck while he was gone, just to see the look on his face when he would draw his opening hand, but eventually play resumed without shenanigans.


Nielsen was on the play in the final game, but unfortunately for him, his seven-card and six-card hands did not contain enough lands, so he was forced to mulligan down to five cards in search of a keepable hand.


Turn-two [Zulaport Cutthroat](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Zulaport+Cutthroat) and turn-three [Nantuko Husk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nantuko+Husk) was a pretty good curve for a mulligan to five, but Blohon's deck didn't stumble. [Ultimate Price](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ultimate+Price) destroyed [Nantuko Husk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nantuko+Husk); [Jace, Vryn's Prodigy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace%2C+Vryn%27s+Prodigy) transformed into [Jace, Telepath Unbound](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace%2C+Telepath+Unbound); and [Dig Through Time](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dig+Through+Time) offered more card selection.


Eventually, Blohon cleared the way with [Duress](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress), played [Dragonlord Ojutai](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragonlord+Ojutai), and ended the game with four attacks. The 5/4 flier had not been seen much lately, but here in Brussels it showed that it still was one of the best cards in Standard.

Congratulations to Lukas Blohon, your Grand Prix Brussels champion! He had a fourth-place finish, a third-place finish, and a second-place finish at Grand Prix events before, but now he could finally add that coveted first place to his résumé.
