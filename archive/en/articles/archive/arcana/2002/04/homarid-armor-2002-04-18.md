[Homarid](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Homarid)s were a race of blue creatures from *Fallen Empires* (read more about them in [this article](http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=mtgcom/daily/bb6)) whose powers were, shall we say, less than amazing.


The *Alliances* team wanted to bring them back, with a few new cards like Homarid Armor, but the continuity people felt differently. "Players don't really like Homarids," they argued, "so why would we make more?"


So they changed the name to Viscerid, which they claimed were an advanced, evolved form of Homarids. And thus [Viscerid Armor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Viscerid+Armor) was born.
