Fifty-Two Gates
===============



 Posted in **From the Lab**
 on May 20, 2013 










Hello, and welcome to Gate Week! I'm going all-out for this celebration of the Gate subtype, with fifty-two Gates between two decks. In fact, there is only one land present that is not a Gate: [Maze's End](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Maze%27s+End). 

![](https://media.wizards.com/images/magic/daily/ftl/ftl248_mazesend.jpg)[Maze's End](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Maze%27s+End) | Art by [Cliff Childs](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoileramp;method=visualamp;action=advancedamp;artist=%5B%22Cliff%20Childs%22%5D)

Ten Out of Ten
 Several people have inquired about a dedicated [Maze's End](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Maze%27s+End) deck, so I decided to create one. I've seen [Maze's End](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Maze%27s+End) in two decks to date: As a primary win condition alongside [Door to Nothingness](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Door+to+Nothingness) in a [Fog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fog) deck, and as an alternate win condition in a five-color [Sliver Overlord](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sliver+Overlord) Commander deck. However, this is the Johnny column, so I'll be taking a more combo-oriented route with the deck. [Maze's End](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Maze%27s+End) requires you to have one of each of the ten Guildgates on the battlefield. Fortunately, you don't have to have gotten all of those with [Maze's End](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Maze%27s+End). Playing them from your hand is just fine, as long as you use [Maze's End](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Maze%27s+End) once you have at least nine of them to activate the game-winning ability. 

[![](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Maze%27s+End)](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Maze%27s+End)  
 There are a lot of great ways to dump Gates onto the battlefield quickly. [Summer Bloom](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Summer+Bloom) is one of the best, letting you immediately drop three lands into the battlefield. That can get you halfway to your goal of ten Gates as soon as turn three. [Azusa](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Azusa) costs one more mana but allows you to play two extra lands every turn. Even if you don't have three lands in your hand, she allows you to activate [Maze's End](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Maze%27s+End) and play it again immediately without skipping your regular land drop for the turn.

[Oracle of Mul Daya](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oracle+of+Mul+Daya) also lets you play an extra land each turn, with the added benefit of allowing you to play lands from the top of your library. With a deck that's more than half land, this is like drawing two extra cards per turn much of the time. [Explore](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Explore) is another great card from *Zendikar* block, not only allowing you an extra land drop but replacing itself with another card. Even if you don't have another land in your hand, there's a better than 50/50 chance you'll find one off that draw. 

[Sylvan Scrying](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sylvan+Scrying) and [Expedition Map](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Expedition+Map) can be used to find [Maze's End](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Maze%27s+End) or one of the Gates you don't have yet, getting you closer to victory. Finally, [Moment's Peace](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Moment%27s+Peace) can buy you two turns to win the game when your opponent manages to put lethal damage on the board.

Hold It
[Hold the Gates](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hold+the+Gates) is an oft-overlooked card from *Gatecrash* that I've been quite enamored with since its release. [Vigilance](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vigilance) and a potentially huge amount of extra toughness are a surefire recipe for winning combat. When the card was first released, [I examined a deck](http://www.gatheringmagic.com/mikecannon-gatecrash-standard-deck-lists-03182013-the-death-gates/) that took advantage of its interaction with small creatures with deathtouch. This time, I'll be taking a more aggressive approach. 

 Last week, I used [Mannichi, the Fevered Dream](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mannichi%2C+the+Fevered+Dream) to turn [Goblin Caves](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Caves) into something a bit more useful. My man Mannichi is back again, making [Hold the Gates](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hold+the+Gates) give all our creatures +1/+0 for each Gate instead. [Doran, the Siege Tower](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Doran%2C+the+Siege+Tower) will also make an appearance, making high-toughness creatures deal huge damage as well. 



|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  |  |

  
Now, for some creatures. Mannichi is going to make the new toughness of our creatures pretty small, so we'll need something to combat that. Double strike is my favorite creature keyword, and it works quite well here. Although a 1/5 with double strike may not be very threatening, a 5/1 certainly is.

[Fencing Ace](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fencing+Ace) is the basic cheap double-striker. No frills, but it is easy to cast. [Boros Swiftblade](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Boros+Swiftblade) gives you an extra toughness, effectively an extra power in this deck, but it does require you to have red mana as well as white. [Viashino Slaughtermaster](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Viashino+Slaughtermaster) is just a red [Fencing Ace](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fencing+Ace) most of the time, but if you do happen to have a black and a green mana you're not using, you can give it +1/+1 until end of turn. That boost may seem small, but it's twice as significant on a creature with double strike. While initially I looked at creatures with other abilities, like [Skyhunter Skirmisher](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skyhunter+Skirmisher)'s flying and [Hound of Griselbrand](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hound+of+Griselbrand)'s undying, the double colored mana turned me away. I'd hate to be stuck with those in hand and no [Chromatic Lantern](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chromatic+Lantern) to make casting them possible. [Marisi's Twinclaws](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Marisi%27s+Twinclaws) costs twice as much mana as the other creatures in the deck at four, but it's reasonably easy to cast thanks to hybrid, and even without [Hold the Gates](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hold+the+Gates), Mannichi and Doran can turn it into a four-power creature with double strike.

[Idyllic Tutor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Idyllic+Tutor) and [Enlightened Tutor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Enlightened+Tutor) make sure you can find [Hold the Gates](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hold+the+Gates) every game, since it's so crucial to this deck's plan of attack. Last but not least, [Chromatic Lantern](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chromatic+Lantern) can help you get the four colors of mana this deck can require at one time or another.

An A-maze-ing Battle
 The time has come to toss these competitors into the arena and see who earns the right to be champion of the Gates. Will this be the end for [Maze's End](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Maze%27s+End), or will it manage to break its opponent's hold? Let's find out. 

Game 1
 The End started off with [Gruul Guildgate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gruul+Guildgate), and Gates of Wrath played one from Boros. An [Expedition Map](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Expedition+Map) and another Gate followed for The End, and Gates of Wrath played another Gate and cast [Enlightened Tutor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Enlightened+Tutor), finding [Hold the Gates](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hold+the+Gates). The End cast [Explore](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Explore) and played two more Gates, and Gates of Wrath cast [Boros Swiftblade](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Boros+Swiftblade) and passed the turn.

 The End cast another [Explore](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Explore), sacrificed [Expedition Map](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Expedition+Map) to find [Maze's End](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Maze%27s+End), and played it along with another Gate before ending the turn. Gates of Wrath cast [Hold the Gates](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hold+the+Gates), and [Boros Swiftblade](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Boros+Swiftblade) attacked for 2. It then passed the turn. [Maze's End](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Maze%27s+End) searched up a Guildgate, and another [Explore](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Explore) allowed The End to replay [Maze's End](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Maze%27s+End) as well as another Gate. Gates of Wrath attacked for 2 and cast another Swiftblade before passing the turn.. 

 The End cast [Sylvan Scrying](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sylvan+Scrying), played the eighth Gate and passed the turn. Gates of Wrath played a Gate, cast [Doran, the Siege Tower](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Doran%2C+the+Siege+Tower), and attacked for 32. The End survived thanks to [Moment's Peace](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Moment%27s+Peace), then played the ninth Gate and searched up the final one with [Maze's End](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Maze%27s+End) to win the game. 

Game 2
 Each side played a Gate and passed, then The End cast an [Expedition Map](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Expedition+Map) on turn two. Gates of Wrath cast [Viashino Slaughtermaster](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Viashino+Slaughtermaster) and ended the turn. The End cast [Summer Bloom](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Summer+Bloom) and played four Gates before passing the turn. Gates of Wrath cast [Chromatic Lantern](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chromatic+Lantern) and attacked for 2 with the [Slaughter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Slaughter)master. It then ended the turn.

 The End cast [Azusa, Lost but Seeking](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Azusa%2C+Lost+but+Seeking), then sacrificed [Expedition Map](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Expedition+Map) to find [Maze's End](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Maze%27s+End) and played it along with another Gate. The End passed the turn, and Gates of Wrath attacked for 2 with the [Slaughter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Slaughter)master. It then cast [Fencing Ace](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fencing+Ace) and [Boros Swiftblade](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Boros+Swiftblade) and passed the turn. The End searched for a Gate with [Maze's End](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Maze%27s+End), replayed it, and passed the turn. 

 Gates of Wrath cast [Hold the Gates](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hold+the+Gates) and another [Viashino Slaughtermaster](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Viashino+Slaughtermaster), then attacked for 6, dropping The End to 10 life. The End searched up another Gate and passed the turn. Gates of Wrath cast a second [Hold the Gates](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hold+the+Gates) and attacked for 10, pumping up one of the [Slaughter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Slaughter)masters. The End cast [Moment's Peace](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Moment%27s+Peace) to survive another turn. 

[Maze's End](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Maze%27s+End) searched up another Gate, and Gates of Wrath cast [Mannichi, the Fevered Dream](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mannichi%2C+the+Fevered+Dream), activated it and attacking for 88 damage. [Moment's Peace](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Moment%27s+Peace) flashed back to stop the damage, and [Maze's End](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Maze%27s+End) searched up the Ninth Guildgate. However, another 88 damage came crashing in the following turn, and The End couldn't find a [Moment's Peace](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Moment%27s+Peace). 

Game 3
 Both decks played Gates and passed the turn until The End cast [Sylvan Scrying](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sylvan+Scrying) on turn three to find [Maze's End](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Maze%27s+End). Gates of Wrath cast [Viashino Slaughtermaster](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Viashino+Slaughtermaster) before ending the turn, and The End cast [Azusa, Lost but Seeking](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Azusa%2C+Lost+but+Seeking), playing [Maze's End](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Maze%27s+End) and two other Gates. 

 Gates of Wrath cast [Doran, the Siege Tower](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Doran%2C+the+Siege+Tower) and attacked for 2. It ended the turn, and The End cast [Explore](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Explore), played three Guildgates, then activated [Maze's End](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Maze%27s+End) and replayed it. Gates of Wrath played a Guildgate and cast [Hold the Gates](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hold+the+Gates). Doran attacked for 9, and [Viashino Slaughtermaster](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Viashino+Slaughtermaster) attacked for 10. The latter was blocked by Azusa, and The End dropped to 9 life. The End cast [Expedition Map](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Expedition+Map), sacrificing it to search up ninth Guildgate, and [Maze's End](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Maze%27s+End) found up the final one to win the game.
