Have you ever jotted down a decklist in Notepad or Word? Have you then wished that you could load that text decklist directly into ***Magic** Online*? Oh, say, something like this, for example:

Well, now you can. ***Magic** Online* now understands text decklists.


As usual, it doesn't matter whether you actually own all the cards in the deck -- it will just highlight those that you haven't collected yet. Try this: download the above deck by *right-clicking* this link and selecting "Save Target As...":


[![Right-click and select 'Save Target As' to download this deck as a Magic Online .txt file](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/console/icon_txtdownload.gif)](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=magic/decks/2004ChampsAlabama1.txt)  
*Right-click and "Save Target As"*


Save the file to your ***Magic** Online* decks folder (\Program Files\Wizards of the Coast\Magic Online\decks) and then fire up ***Magic** Online*. When you go to the Deck Editor tab and hit Load, you're now able to specify "Files of type" \*.txt. There's Radford's deck, smiling back at you.


### Want Tons More Standard Decklists?


Want to do that again? Oh, say, around 500 more times?


Head over to the **[2004 Champs Decklists](/en/events/coverage/2004-champs-decklists)** page and download Standard decklists to your heart's content. Right-click the .txt decklist icon in the upper-right and go nuts.


### Can I Make My Own *Magic Online* Decklists Now?


Yep. Follow the formatting conventions above (one card per line, a space between the number of cards and the card name, and one line that says "Sideboard" separating the maindeck from sideboard) and you can make text decklists yourself.


***Magic** Online* and text decklists: a match made in heaven.
