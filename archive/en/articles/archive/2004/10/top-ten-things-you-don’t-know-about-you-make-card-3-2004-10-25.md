### Number 10 – It starts today


The waiting is over. (Well, kind of. I’ll get to that in a moment.) It’s time to let all of you design another **Magic** card.


### Number 9 – It’s going to be different


The first two “You Make the Card” features were big successes. We knew we wanted to do a third, but we felt that it needed a twist. Something that would give it its own identity. And boy, I think we succeeded.

### Number 8 – *You* are going to illustrate the card!


By “you” I mean a reader of **magicthegathering.com**. One of the biggest complaints about the first two “You Make the Card” features was that “you” got to make every aspect of the card – except for the art. So when we were looking for a way to set the third “You Make the Card” apart, we realized that we could have a reader do the art. And that is just the tip of the iceberg.


### Number 7 – We’re going to *start* with the art


We’re not waiting to get to the new part. Before you finish today’s article, you will know how you can submit a piece of art that might end up on a **Magic** card. Jeremy Cranford, **Magic**’s Art Director (with some help from the rest of the Creative Team) will then select a limited number of the very best pieces of art for you to vote on. The winning piece from the vote will appear on the third “You Make the Card”.


### Number 6 – Here’s what we need


Each person may submit one piece of art. The final full-color painting should be submitted as an RGB jpeg file. It needs to be 1MB or less in size. It is okay to shoot a jpeg of your painting with a digital camera. Digital paintings are acceptable. Note that the final art shown on the card will be 2 1/16” wide by 1 9/16” tall. Art not fitting those dimensions will be cropped. Once we choose the winner, we will contact them and we will arrange for shipping of the final art.


### Number 5 – Wait, there’s more


When you email your submission to us at the link below, you'll need to include the following:



> 
> * Name
> * Email address
> * Phone number where we can reach you
> * Your birthday (day, month, and year)
> * An acknowledgement that you've read (and agree to) the terms of the legal text
> 



### Number 4 – Our lawyers inform us there’s even more.


Before you send in your submission, you need to read the [legal text (click here)](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/feature/236legaltext) that we just told you about in Number 5.

### Number 3 – Almost done, I promise


Once you have your piece of art (and the info from Number 5), you need to send it using [this email address (click here)](mailto:ymtc3@wizards.com).


### Number 2 – Here’s the deadline


All art will need to be submitted by Monday, November 15, 2004.


### Number 1 – Once you’ve selected a piece of art, you’ll design the card “top down”


This is the other big difference in this version of “You Make the Card”. We’re not starting with a color or a card type. We’ll be starting with the piece of art and designing “top down”. Each choice you dictate will decide what the next thing we need to vote on is. The primary goal is to make a cool **Magic** card that best utilizes the art you’ve chosen. **Magic**’s designers have done this on numerous occasions. Now it’s your turn.


That’s the ten things you didn’t know. When you visit the site in January you’ll be able to begin shaping Magic’s next reader-designed card, vote by vote.


As always, have fun!
