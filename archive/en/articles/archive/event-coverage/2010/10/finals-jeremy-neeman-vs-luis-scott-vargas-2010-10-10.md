*The crowds gather as the finals get underway.* |


LSV elected to play. Neeman powered out a turn two [Gold Myr](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gold+Myr), which LSV answered with a [Grand Architect](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grand+Architect). Unfazed, Neeman cast an [Auriok Replica](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Auriok+Replica). LSV didn't have any plays on turn four, making Neeman slightly suspicious. He decided to find out. [Grand Architect](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grand+Architect) powered out a [Darksteel Sentinel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Darksteel+Sentinel), which blocked and killed the Replica. Neeman summoned a Goblin Artisan and passed. LSV summoned a [Clone Shell](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Clone+Shell) and attacked with his [Darksteel Sentinel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Darksteel+Sentinel), which Neeman declined to block.


Post combat, LSV summoned a [Perilous Myr](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Perilous+Myr) and used his final mana to [Galvanic Blast](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Galvanic+Blast) the Artisan. Neeman reset his board with a [Glint Hawk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glint+Hawk), bouncing an [Accorder's Shield](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Accorder%27s+Shield). LSV attacked with all his creatures. Neeman blocked the [Sentinel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sentinel) and took 3 from the Myr and Shell. Post combat, [Darksteel Sentinel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Darksteel+Sentinel) tapped for mana to summon an [Auriok Replica](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Auriok+Replica), who tapped himself and the remaining lands to cast a [Chrome Steed](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chrome+Steed). Neeman smiled at the massive army growing opposite him.


"That guy's alright," he quipped, pointing to the [Grand Architect](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grand+Architect).


"Yeah, he does his thing", LSV agreed.

*Luis Scott-Vargas. Poison Status: Zero.* |


LSV attacked with his team once more. Neeman cast a [Soul Parry](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soul+Parry), slowing down the damage and letting the [Perilous Myr](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Perilous+Myr) die without any ill after-effects. LSV shrugged, waited a turn, and attacked again for the win.


Luis Scott-Vargas 1 – Jeremy Neeman 0


First play of game two went to LSV, with a Spikeshot elder and a follow-up [Copper Myr](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Copper+Myr). Neeman summoned an [Auriok Replica](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Auriok+Replica), which was happy to stare down the opposing army. LSV nonchalantly cast his [Grand Architect](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grand+Architect), then tapped it and the [Copper Myr](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Copper+Myr) for an [Auriok Replica](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Auriok+Replica). Neeman summoned an [Oxidda Scrapmelter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oxidda+Scrapmelter) and took out LSV's Replica before attacking. LSV summoned a [Saberclaw Golem](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Saberclaw+Golem). Neeman cast a [Tumble Magnet](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tumble+Magnet) and tapped down the Golem, attacking with both his creatures. He cast a [Glint Hawk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glint+Hawk) and bounced his [Tumble Magnet](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tumble+Magnet).


LSV summoned a Vulshok replica and swung with his Golem. Neeman declined to block and fell to 15. Neeman attacked with his [Glint Hawk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glint+Hawk) and re-cast his [Tumble Magnet](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tumble+Magnet). The [Spikeshot Elder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spikeshot+Elder) pinged Neeman for 1 at the end of his turn, then LSV considered his options. Neeman's [Tumble Magnet](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tumble+Magnet) tapped down the [Saberclaw Golem](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Saberclaw+Golem), and LSV simply cast a [Perilous Myr](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Perilous+Myr) and passed. Neeman attacked with his [Glint Hawk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glint+Hawk). LSV shot his own [Perilous Myr](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Perilous+Myr) and then used the 2 damage to kill the Hawk. Neeman cycled an [Origin Spellbomb](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Origin+Spellbomb) and cast an [Arrest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arrest) on the Grand Arbiter. LSV declared no attacks on his turn, but hit a critical fourth mountain, giving his [Spikeshot Elder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spikeshot+Elder) two activations a turn. Neeman summoned a [Blade-Tribe Berserkers](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blade-Tribe+Berserkers), and LSV shot the [Auriok Replica](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Auriok+Replica) in response to keep Neeman off metalcraft. LSV once again declared no attackers, content to sit behind his wall of men and react to Neeman's plays.

Neeman cast a [Strata Scythe](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Strata+Scythe), fetching out a [Mountain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mountain). With 6 lands in play, the Equipment would turn any creature into a massive beater. Neeman suited up his [Berserk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Berserk)ers and swung for nine. LSV chumped with an [Iron Myr](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Iron+Myr) and then ended Neeman's turn taking out the Myr token and shooting Neeman down to 13. After LSV had no plays on his turn, Neeman attacked once more with his [Berserk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Berserk)ers. LSV blocked with his [Vulshok Replica](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vulshok+Replica) and sacrificed it to hit Neeman for 3 damage. [Tumble Magnet](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tumble+Magnet) removed LSV's remaining blockers, and Neeman's next attack was lethal.


Jeremy Neeman 1 – Luis Scott-Vargas 1


LSV began the action with his [Perilous Myr](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Perilous+Myr). Neeman summoned a [Leaden Myr](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leaden+Myr) to keep up. LSV summoned a [Trinket Mage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Trinket+Mage). Neeman bounced his Myr to summon a [Glint Hawk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glint+Hawk), then re-cast it. LSV found his [Grand Architect](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grand+Architect), tapping his men down to summon a [Soliton](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soliton). Neeman's [Oxidda Scrapmelter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oxidda+Scrapmelter) took care of the artifact creatures, and both the [Glint Hawk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glint+Hawk) and the [Leaden Myr](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leaden+Myr) began the beatdown. LSV summoned a [Kuldotha Phoenix](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kuldotha+Phoenix), and it and the [Trinket Mage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Trinket+Mage) attacked Neeman. Neeman was unconcerned about his life totals, falling to 11. Neeman had a [Vulshok Heartstoker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vulshok+Heartstoker) and swung in with a 4-power [Glint Hawk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glint+Hawk), then a post-combat [Arrest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arrest) for the Phoenix. LSV cast a [Flight Spellbomb](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flight+Spellbomb) but had no profitable attacks, leaving his men at home.


Neeman cast an [Auriok Replica](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Auriok+Replica) and passed, while LSV had a [Chrome Steed](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chrome+Steed). Neeman summoned a [Glimmerpoint Stag](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glimmerpoint+Stag), blinking his [Scrap](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scrap)melter out of the game. When it returned, it destroyed the [Chrome Steed](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chrome+Steed), which LSV replaced with a [Saberclaw Golem](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Saberclaw+Golem). Neeman had a [Shatter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shatter) for it, and his army began to outclass LSV's. Neeman attacked with both his 3/3's, and LSV's [Trinket Mage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Trinket+Mage) traded with the Stag. LSV took 3 from the [Scrap](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scrap)melter. Neeman had a non-metalcrafted [Blade-Tribe Berserkers](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blade-Tribe+Berserkers) to bolster his side of the board. Neeman attacked with his entire team. LSV blocked, lost creatures, looked to his deck, found nothing, and extended his hand in congratulations.
