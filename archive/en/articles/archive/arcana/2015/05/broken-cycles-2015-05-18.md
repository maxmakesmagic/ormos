Cycles! Throughout *Magic*'s history, there have been many cycles—a set of cards found in all five colors, connected by a theme. *Modern Masters 2015 Edition* features many cards that were a part of a cycle—but most of these cycles are incomplete in this set. How well do you know the cycles of *Magic*?



Here are 10 questions to test your cyclical knowledge. (That's two cycles' worth!)

> 
> 1. [Primeval Titan](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Primeval+Titan) is missing all of his brethren. (He's so lonely.) Can you name the other four? (4 points)
> 2. [Elesh Norn, Grand Cenobite](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elesh+Norn%2C+Grand+Cenobite) is the white Praetor of *New Phyrexia*. What is the name of the Praetor with the smallest converted mana cost? (1 point)
> 3. [Cranial Plating](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cranial+Plating) was a part of a cycle of two-mana artifacts from *Fifth Dawn*. What were the names of the other artifacts? (4 points)
> 4. [Spectral Procession](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spectral+Procession) is a part of a cycle of instants and sorceries with three hybrid mana. What is the name of the GREEN one? (1 point)
> 5. [Wilt-Leaf Liege](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wilt-Leaf+Liege) is the white-green hybrid Liege. [Creakwood Liege](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Creakwood+Liege) is the black-green hybrid Liege. What is the name of the white-black hybrid Liege? (1 point)
> 6. [Nobilis of War](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nobilis+of+War) is part of a cycle of hybrid Spirit Avatars from *Eventide*. Can you name the other four? (8 points, because their names are ridiculous.)
> 7. [Cryptic](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cryptic+Command) and [Profane Command](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Profane+Command) are part of a cycle of Commands that had you "choose two." What is the name of the one with the highest mana cost? (1 point)
> 8. [Leyline of Sanctity](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leyline+of+Sanctity) was a part of a cycle of Leylines printed in *Magic 2011*. There was another cycle of Leylines printed earlier, in *Dissension*. However, one of the colors only has ONE Leyline instead of two. Which one? (1 point)
> 9. [Celestial Purge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Celestial+Purge) was a part of a cycle of enemy color "hate cards" in *Magic 2010*. Which card from that cycle was ONLY printed in *M10*? (2 points)
> 10. Name [Guile](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Guile)'s four friends in its cycle. (4 points)
>

How'd you do?



**26 points — Cyclical Champion!** Either you have an encyclopedic knowledge of cycles, or you cheated with Google and [Gatherer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/). Well done either way!



**18-25 — Cycle Scientist!** It's okay, I can't keep all the names of those *Eventide* Spirit Avatars straight either.



**9-18 — Cycle Sicko!** Not bad! A few Giants' names might've escaped, and who remembers "Tower Above" was a *Magic* card anyway?



**3-9 — Cycle Challenged**. Maybe it's time to brush up on your cycles….



**0-2 — Cycle Clueless**. It's okay, I have a bad memory for names of things too.
