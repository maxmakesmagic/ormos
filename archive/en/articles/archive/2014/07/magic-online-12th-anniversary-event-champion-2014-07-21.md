A great celebration was had by all! Well, except for Xenagos. Just because he's the God of Revels, he thinks he can show up to any party uninvited.


Luckily, our *Magic Online* 12th Anniversary Event Champion was there to bounce him from the party.

Anniversary Event Finals Recap
[Top](#top)

The *Magic Online* 12th Anniversary Championships saw yumyum\_popcorn facing off against umbrella\_merc with their *Modern Masters* draft decks. Yumyum\_popcorn played a Blue/Black deck that was fairly faerie heavy. Umbrella\_merc brought a Blue/Green deck, with a splash of White, that made strong use of fliers, Suspend, and some faeries in the mix as well. Let’s see how they matched up!


**Game One**


The beginning of game one was punctuated by impressive displays of back-and-forth spell slinging. Yumyum\_popcorn’s [Pestermite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pestermite) allowed yumyum\_popcorn to stave off attacks in the air from umbrella\_merc’s [Mothdust Changeling](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mothdust+Changeling) before finally trading, sending both faeries to the graveyard.


Yumyum\_popcorn started off turn 6 with two creatures on the field, [Tidehollow Sculler](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tidehollow+Sculler) and [Rathi Trapper](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rathi+Trapper). By playing a [Marsh Flitter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Marsh+Flitter), yumyum\_popcorn was able to more than double the amount of creatures on the field due to the two 1/1 black Goblin Rogue tokens that come into play with [Marsh Flitter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Marsh+Flitter). Yumyum\_popcorn didn't stop there though. On turn 7, Yumyum\_popcorn played a [Cloudgoat Ranger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloudgoat+Ranger), bringing not only the 3/3 Ranger out onto the field, but three 1/1 white Kithkin Soldier tokens as well. Umbrella\_merc was able to get a [Durkwood Baloth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Durkwood+Baloth) onto the battlefield, but it just wasn’t enough to stave the tide of yumyum\_popcorn's creatures. Umbrella\_merc conceded on turn 9.

**Game 2**


Umbrella\_merc started off with a turn 1 [Mothdust Changeling](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mothdust+Changeling) to begin ticking off points of damage in the air by turn 2. When the [Mothdust Changeling](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mothdust+Changeling) went in for another attack on Turn 3, yumyum\_popcorn responded by sending a [Peppersmoke](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Peppersmoke) in its direction, which would have destroyed it had umbrella\_merc not countered by playing [Spellstutter Sprite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spellstutter+Sprite), negating the [Peppersmoke](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Peppersmoke).


![](http://www.wizards.com/mtg/images/digital/magiconline/game2turn3.png)
Umbrella\_merc began summoning a steady stream of counter-carrying creatures on turn 4. [Durkwood Baloth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Durkwood+Baloth) started off the list by going into Suspend for five turns. After that, umbrella\_merc brought out two [Thallid Shell-Dweller](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thallid+Shell-Dweller)s over the next several turns.


![](http://www.wizards.com/mtg/images/digital/magiconline/game2turn8.png)
In the meantime, yumyum\_popcorn managed to play [Adarkar Valkyrie](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Adarkar+Valkyrie) alongside [Kira, Great Glass-Spinner](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kira%2C+Great+Glass-Spinner). [Kira, Great Glass-Spinner](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kira%2C+Great+Glass-Spinner) blocked a [Latchkey Faerie](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Latchkey+Faerie), destroying both, allowing [Adarkar Valyrie](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Adarkar+Valyrie) to bring [Latchkey Faerie](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Latchkey+Faerie) back to the field under yumyum\_popcorn’s control. Or it would have had umbrella\_merc not sacrificed the [Aether Spellbomb](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aether+Spellbomb) that’d been sitting on the field to return [Latchkey Faerie](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Latchkey+Faerie) back to umbrella\_merc’s hand, quickly stomping out what may have been a reversal in the course of the game.


By the next turn, umbrella\_merc’s [Durkwood Baloth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Durkwood+Baloth)’s Suspend time expired, one [Thallid Shell-Dweller](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thallid+Shell-Dweller) spawned a Saproling, then the second Shell-Dweller spawned a second the next turn. On turn 10, umbrella\_merc returned the Valkyrie to yumyum\_popcorn’s hand with an [Aethersnipe](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aethersnipe), and attacked with everything, bringing yumyum\_popcorn to a single point of life. Yumyum\_popcorn got the [Adarkar Valkyrie](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Adarkar+Valkyrie) back to the field the next turn, but couldn't stop umbrella\_merc from taking the game.

**Game 3**


![](http://www.wizards.com/mtg/images/digital/magiconline/game3turn4-2.png)
The field populated quickly in the tie-breaker game with yumyum\_popcorn casting a [Marsh Flitter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Marsh+Flitter) to go along with a [Pestermite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pestermite), bringing the creature count up to four for yumyum\_popcorn. Umbrella\_merc cast a token generating creature as well, the legendary Moonfolk Wizard, [Meloku the Clouded Mirror](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Meloku+the+Clouded+Mirror)!


Umbrella\_merc decided to stop yumyum\_popcorn’s token creation by blinking. The first of yumyum\_popcorn’s Goblin tokens was lost to a bounce by [Aethersnipe](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aethersnipe) on turn 5. Maintaining momentum, umbrella\_merc’s [Giant Dustwasp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Giant+Dustwasp) came out of Suspend on turn 6, allowing umbrella\_merc to start swinging with [Aethersnipe](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aethersnipe) and the [Giant Dustwasp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Giant+Dustwasp). Yumyum\_popcorn, undamaged at that point in the match, took one hit from the duo, dropping to a life total of 11.


Little by little, umbrella\_merc had been bringing 1/1 Illusion tokens onto the field with [Meloku the Clouded Mirror](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Meloku+the+Clouded+Mirror)’s ability. By turn 7, the machine had been set in motion, and umbrella\_merc began an onslaught over the next two turns that yumyum\_popcorn wasn’t able to turn back, despite extensive countering.
