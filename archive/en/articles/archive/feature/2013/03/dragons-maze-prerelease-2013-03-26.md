At PAX East 2013 this past weekend, we announced the *Theros* block, but the main focus was the upcoming **Magic** set: *Dragon's Maze*, happening on April 27-28, 2013. We'll have the full panel online later this week for those of you who want to see it from start to finish. Until then, here are just a few of the things we talked about: We revealed the Maze Runners for each guild, such as Teysa, Envoy of Ghosts (representing Orzhov); the Dimir's Mirko Vosk, Mind Drinker; and even the full reveal of Gruul's champion: Ruric Thar - including his card!

So let's look at the *Dragon's Maze* Prerelease! I don't want to dive too deep into it but it's going to be the final event for the *Return to Ravnica* block, and since it is a bit different from the previous two we want to make sure you all are prepared for what you're getting into!


At your store you're going to be diving into your own Implicit Maze, competing against the other guilds to see who can win the race to Maze's End. Just by participating you'll get the promo Maze's End!

The Guild Prerelease packs at the *Dragon's Maze* Prerelease are going to be a bit different than those you used at the *Return to Ravnica* and *Gatecrash* Prereleases. Inside they will have:


 


* One *Return to Ravnica* Guild Booster Pack
* Four *Dragon's Maze* Booster Packs
* One *Gatecrash* Guild Booster Pack

![Dragon's Maze Guild Prerelease Packs](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/arcana/1197_guildprereleasepacks.jpg)For example, let's say you choose Boros as your guild at the Prerelease, then your guild pack could contain:


 


* Azorius (Shares white)
* Izzet (Shares red)
* Rakdos (Shares red)
* Selesnya (Shares white)

Also, for the purposes of the Prerelease activity, the guild you choose is the guild you are allied with for the event. Sure, you can pick the guild you are on [Planeswalker Points](http://www.planeswalkerpoints.com), but you don't have to. Your Planeswalker Points guild has no direct bearing on the Implicit Maze.


We'll dive deeper into the Prerelease as the event grows nearer, so be sure to check back on April 22 for the full Prerelease Primer we do for every set!
