The inner town is protected by UNESCO as World Heritage, and is known for its charming squares and fancy shopping streets. But Verona is also the city where Romeo met Juliet, and where you find the third-biggest amphitheatre in the world! 



 *The **Magic: The Gathering**  Grand Prix tournament series is a great reason to step up your game, catch up with old friends, meet some new ones, and play **Magic**. Grand Prix tournaments are world-wide open events that allow all **Magic** players to participate and experience the thrill of a large-scale competition over three days. In addition to cash prizes, a high Planeswalker Points multiplier, and exclusive foil promo cards for participants, the Grand Prix features a host of other activities, including side events and artist signings. Side-event tournaments begin Friday, with the Grand Prix main event running Saturday and Sunday. Find out more about the Grand Prix [tournament schedule here](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/TCG/Events.aspx?x=grandprix/welcome#2013).*

 If you register with sleep-in, you have to send your decklist by e-mail to [decklist@tournamentcenter.eu](mailto:decklist@tournamentcenter.eu) before Wednesday March 6, 20:00.   
 If we don't receive your decklist or if it contains errors, you will be subject to the appropriate penalties (such as a game loss). At the event, you just have to go to the Side Events Stage before the start of your round to hand in your Media Publicity Form, and to collect your participation foil. 
  The main tournament at Verona is open to **Magic** players of all ages. 


 Players must have a signed publicity release form to be included in Wizards of the Coast's official online event coverage. Forms can be downloaded [here](http://www.wizards.com/dci/downloads/publicityrelease_grandprix_2011.pdf) (15k PDF) and will be available onsite. Minors must have a parent or guardian's signature on this form. Publicity releases will be handed out and collected during the players meeting on Saturday morning. 



**Tournament Format**
  


* [Standard](/en/node/704561)
* Deck lists are required.
* Players must use the same deck on Day 2 that they used on Day 1.


**Tournament Structure** 


* Modified Swiss-style (50-minute rounds).
* If 799 or fewer players register for the event, all players with an X-2-0 or better record OR the top 64 players—whichever number is greater—will advance to the second day of the event.
* If 800 or more players register for the event, all players with an X-2-0 or better record OR the top 128 players—whichever number is greater—will advance to the second day of the event.
* The Top 8 players after the final Swiss round on Day 2 will advance to the Top 8 single-elimination finals.
* Top 8 playoff matches will be best 2 of 3, and have no time limit. (Players are still expected to play at a normal pace and complete playoff matches in a reasonable amount of time.)
* Where necessary, the standings after the Swiss rounds will still be used to determine final order in the standings.
* For the first game of each match in the Top 8, the player that finished higher in the Swiss rounds chooses either to play first or to play second. For subsequent games in each Top 8 match, the usual Play/Draw rule applies (loser of the previous game decides whether to play first in the next game).


**Judges**
  
 The Head Judge for this event will be Carlos Ho. The Regional Judge Coordinator is Cristiana Dionisio. Judges interested in working at this event should submit an application through the [**Magic** judge website](http://apps.magicjudges.org) .

* Players are responsible for bringing their own method of tracking life totals, card sleeves, and appropriate counters or tokens.
* In the event that a player who wins an invitation to a Pro Tour stop at a Grand Prix has already qualified for an invitation, the invitation does not pass down under any circumstances. Previous qualification may be through a Qualifier tournament, through performance at a professional tournament, or by being an invited DCI player (valid upon the date of the official rank announcement for the appropriate professional tournament).

 Byes earned through Planeswalker Points are calculated using the Planeswalker Point totals from all reported events as of the Wednesday immediately before the Grand Prix. (For Grand Prix Verona, the cutoff date will be March 6.) Points earned in tournaments held at the Grand Prix event site do not count toward earned byes at that Grand Prix. Byes will be given to players in the Grand Prix based on the following criteria:

**Trial winners**
  
 Winners of a Trial tournament are awarded 3 byes in the Grand Prix that it feeds. Trial byes are not cumulative with other byes and do not pass down. Byes are not cumulative throughout the season or year. Byes do not pass down under any circumstances. Players who accumulate multiple byes to a particular Grand Prix tournament receive only the bye for the greatest number of rounds. For complete information about Grand Prix byes and their corresponding competitive season, please check the [2012 Magic Premier Event Invitation Policy](http://www.wizards.com/wpn/Document.aspx?x=Magic_The_Gathering_Premier_Event_Invitation_Policy).

### Artist Information


 Come and meet **Magic: The Gathering** artist Karl Kopinski during the Grand Prix.   
  
 Saturday: 10:00 - 12:00, 13:00 – 17:00   
 Sunday: 10:00 - 12:00, 13:00 – 17:00   
  
Karl Kopinski
  
 Born and raised in Nottingham, England, Karl Kopinski has been drawing basically since he was able to hold a pencil. From an early age he drew pictures of Tarzan (never with nipples though!) Spider-man, Batman, Robin Hood (of course) and Space: 1999 (shows how old he is!), among many others. He went on to study fine art at university where none of his tutors recognized nor seemed remotely interested in his ability and love of painting. He worked for Games Workshop's monthly comic, and after seven years and far, far too many pictures of space marines, he took the leap into the unknown that is the freelance world and hasn’t looked back since.
