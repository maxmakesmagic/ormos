You arrive late for the design meeting. This is a meeting to discuss the large set that’s several years in the future.


You walk in to hear the team talking about purple. “Are we discussing the sixth color again?”


As you sit down, you wonder: “Why don’t they ever pick orange?”


When the team asks why you’re late you use the “WotC time” excuse. You see, up until six months ago, all meeting at Wizards started at ten after the hour. This was called “WotC time.” Ever since the change, people use “I'm not used to non-WotC time” as an excuse for showing up late. Of course, it only works if you’re ten minutes late or less. Luckily, you made it just in time.
