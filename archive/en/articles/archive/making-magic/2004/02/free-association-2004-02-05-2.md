Bleeder cards are cards that slowly drain the life off a player. Examples of bleeder cards would be [Cursed Land](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cursed+Land), [Feedback](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/daily/mr110-feedback) and [Wanderlust](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wanderlust). A bleeder deck is one that slows down the game with a strong defense allowing bleeder cards to slowly sap away the opponent's life total.

You see, about a month after I casually mentioned I would be willing to move to Seattle, R&D brought me out for an official interview. One by one I sat down with different members of R&D. But I already knew them from having freelanced, so most of the interviews turned out to be, “So, do you have any questions.”

But one R&D member, Joel Mick, was determined to ask me actual questions. The first question: “Did you bring any decks with you.”

“Yes,” I said. “This deck is called Rupert.”

As a quick aside I used to name my decks by, well, naming my decks. Rupert was a bleeder deck that abused [Land Tax](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Land+Tax) (a long time before most players realized how broken it was – it would be restricted over a year later). 

Joel pulled out a deck and we played. And I won. Joel seemed impressed. As that was the closest thing I had to an interview (note: interviews these days are a little more stringent), I like to think that winning that game helped me get a job. Thanks Rupert.

And thanks to all of you for sticking with me for what (at least to date) has to be my most offbeat article. (And that bar wasn't all that low to begin with).

Join me next week when I involve you all in a very different, but possibly more important, way.

Until then, may all your job interviews go as smoothly.
