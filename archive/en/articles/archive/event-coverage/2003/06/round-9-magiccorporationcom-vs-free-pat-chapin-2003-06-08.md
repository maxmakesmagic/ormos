Both these Pro Teams scraped into day two with two losses. The pressure is on now as if they are to have the slightest chance of making top 4 then they both need to win out.

| C Andrew Stokinger | vs. | Christophe Haim |

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gpams03/a919.jpg)Mikey P has an unwinnable matchup and Andy Stokinger shouldn't lose so the key match is the black-white mirror between Ed Fear and Raphael Levy. Last time these met was at World's 2000 where Levy came out the better.


### Game 1


The Frenchman wasn't having much fun this time round. He won the roll and elected to go first and managed to make only swamps and a [Carrion Feeder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Carrion+Feeder). By the time Levy found a plains Fear was beating him down with two morphs and a [Severed Legion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Severed+Legion).


Levy finally cast his second spell, an [Aven Redeemer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aven+Redeemer), on turn 6. Fear flipped over a [Skinthinner](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skinthinner) and sent that to the 'yard. Levy fetched it back with a [Misery Charm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Misery+Charm). Fear [Swat](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swat)ted it back to the 'yard. Levy scooped.


"Always a bad sign when you sideboard in Rochester," Ed Fear said going into his sideboard. "Means you messed up somewhere."


Fear 1-0 Levy


Around this time Pustilnik had a [Goblin Grappler](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Grappler) with [Dragon Fangs](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragon+Fangs) and [Crown of Fury](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crown+of+Fury) and Stokinger had just dropped [Pemmin's Aura](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pemmin%27s+Aura) on a morph.


### Game 2


Game 2 started badly for Levy again. He had to mulligan and then skipped turn three without playing a spell. He had a [Consumptive Goo](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Consumptive+Goo) to Fear's morph and [Withered Wretch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Withered+Wretch)


"He's playing Goo-go," Fear said when Levy passed turn 4 without playing a spell either.


Fear attacked with his morph anyway and Levy made it a little smaller and his Goo bigger but chose not to block just in case. Fear dropped a morph and [Carrion Feeder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Carrion+Feeder) to try and overwhelm Levy before the Goo got out of hand.


Both Stokinger and Pustilnik went 1-0 up at this point to give Free Pat Chapin a lead across the board.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gpams03/a918.jpg)Levy Gooed the Feeder and nailed the Wretch with a [Misery Charm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Misery+Charm) before bolstering his defenses with a [Starlight Invoker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Starlight+Invoker).


Fear ran three morphs in only for Levy to pick the right blocks and send a [Skinthinner](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skinthinner) and [Wingbeat Warrior](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wingbeat+Warrior) to the graveyard for no loss. Fear had to finish the Goo off with [Profane Prayers](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Profane+Prayers) before it got to dangerous.


It seemed like Levy might pull back into the game as he summoned a [Smokespew Invoker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Smokespew+Invoker) and took out a second facedown [Skinthinner](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skinthinner) on Fear's side of the table. Then Fear found [Decree of Justice](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Decree+of+Justice). Although he only had enough mana to create one angel this was problem enough for Levy. [Dragon Scales](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragon+Scales) on the angel dropped Levy to 4 and left him having to keep 8 mana a turn open for the [Starlight Invoker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Starlight+Invoker) to stay alive. He tried to break out of this imposed lock by dropping a [Dive Bomber](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dive+Bomber) to chump for a turn while he got some more creatures. Unfortunately Fear had the [Pacifism](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pacifism) to take the match.


Ed Fear beat Raphael Levy 2-0


Free Pat Chapin 1-0 magiccorporation.com


Haim and Canu both leveled their matches to keep the overall match alive.


### Game 3


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gpams03/a917.jpg)Game 3 of the seat C match between Haim and Stokinger saw Haim's white-blue deck holding off Stokinger's [Mistform Warchief](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mistform+Warchief), morph and a [Callous Oppressor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Callous+Oppressor) with a [Noble Templar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Noble+Templar) and [Aven Redeemer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aven+Redeemer). Haim was also playing red and when he found a mountain he was able to get rid of the Oppressor with [Scattershot](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scattershot).


This was starting to look like the key match as Canu had just summoned a turn 4 [Forgotten Ancient](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forgotten+Ancient) to give Pustilnik real worries in his game.


Things weren't exactly peachy for Stokinger either as Haim dropped [Pemmin's Aura](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pemmin%27s+Aura) on the Templar. The Morphling with three extra toughness looked a lot more menacing than Stokinger's [Primoc Escapee](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Primoc+Escapee). The American made another morph and considered his options.


They were not good as a second Templar arrived for Haim.


Fear called for the "Savage Miser" hat and it managed to work it's magic as, despite facing a [Forgotten Ancient](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forgotten+Ancient) spitting out counters everywhere, Pustilnik ripped the vital 7th land to send a game winning [Searing Flesh](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Searing+Flesh) to Canu's head. Somehow he'd pulled out an unlikely victory.


It also turned out to be absolutely vital as Stokinger ran out chump blockers in extras turns and succumbed to Haim's [Glintwing Invoker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glintwing+Invoker) and "Morphling"


**Final Result:** Free Pat Chapin beat magiccorporation.com 2-1
