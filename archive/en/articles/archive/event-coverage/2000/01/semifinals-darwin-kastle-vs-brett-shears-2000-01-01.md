Kastle played a black-blue-red control deck with some interesting cards that he included four copies of. Kastle had four Lobotomies and [Recoil](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Recoil)s, two cards that are often not even in other players' black-blue-red decks. He also played four [Void](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Void)s, a card that most players are afraid to play four of due to its high casting cost. Interestingly, Kastle only played two [Urza's Rage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Urza%27s+Rage)s which is usually a card the deck does not leave home without.


Shears was playing his updated version of bkowal.dec. His version contained three [Plague Spitter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plague+Spitter)s and two Spite/Malices. He also cut the [Prohibit](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Prohibit)s from the deck. 


The matchup seemed highly in Kastle's favor. His deck was clearly tuned for a control on control game with four main deck [Lobotomy](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lobotomy). He was also able to be completely reactive since his kill was entirely burn. Shears on the other hand would have to pursue an aggro-control strategy in order to win. His kill was entirely creature based. His one advantage was that Kastle could only deal with [Spiritmonger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spiritmonger) with his four [Recoil](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Recoil)s and two [Tsabo's Decree](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tsabo%27s+Decree)s if one ever hit the board.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/GPDEN01/184sfkastleshears.jpg)Game one started, continued, and ended badly for Shears. First Shears mulliganed. Then, Kastle [Exclude](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Exclude)d his first two creatures. Kastle then followed this up with a [Lobotomy](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lobotomy) on Shear's [Mystic Snake](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mystic+Snake)s. This allowed Shears to play a Spitter which got [Recoil](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Recoil)ed and [Undermine](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Undermine)d. Kastle killed the next Zombie that Shears played and then [Void](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Void)ed away two [Spiritmonger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spiritmonger)s, one in play and one in Shear's hand. Many turns passed with both players laying land and saying go. Finally Shears broke the silence by trying to play his third [Spiritmonger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spiritmonger), but Kastle won the counterwar and Raged Shears out two turns later.


Both players went to their sideboards. Kastle brought in four [Gainsay](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gainsay) and four [Addle](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Addle), while Shears sided in four [Addle](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Addle), four [Gainsay](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gainsay), and three [Disrupt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Disrupt). 


Game two saw Shears hit every break. He [Addle](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Addle)d turn two, and seeing that Kastle was land shy took his Fire/Ice over a [Gainsay](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gainsay). Kastle tried to cycle the Fire/Ice he drew on the next turn, but Shears would not have it, and [Gainsay](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gainsay)ed it. This left Kastle on four lands and Shears was able to get himself a solid mana advantage. He played a Zombie which got Raged. Then he played a Monger which got [Recoil](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Recoil)ed. Kastle tried to take the opportunity while the Monger was in Shears' hand to [Void](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Void) it away, but it got [Undermine](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Undermine)d. Shears played the Monger which swang for six the next turn to finish off Kastle.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/GPDEN01/183sfshears.jpg)Game three started with another mulligan from Shears. His turn two [Addle](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Addle) on black found Kastle with a land heavy draw. Kastle's only two non-land cards were [Undermine](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Undermine) and Agenda (he had kept an opening draw of 6 land and an Agenda). Shears took the [Undermine](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Undermine) and played a third turn [Plague Spitter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plague+Spitter) that he was easily able to protect the entire distance. Kastle played one card the entire game: A [Recoil](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Recoil) that got [Undermine](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Undermine)d.


Shears won 2-1
