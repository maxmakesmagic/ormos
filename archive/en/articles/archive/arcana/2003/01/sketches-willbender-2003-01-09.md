This week's "Sketches" looks at one of the upcoming *Legions* cards, [Willbender](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Willbender) by Eric Peterson.


### 1. Art Description


These are the instructions given to the artist:


"Color: Blue. Location: Riptide Project.  
 Action: Show a refugee Wizard surrounded by a blue magical bubble that is repelling a magical spell coming from outside the picture.  
 Focus: Refugee Wizard.   
 Notes: Refugee Wizard can be male or female."


### 2. Sketch


This is the preliminary sketch submitted by Eric. One problem the Creative team had was that the Wizard's bubble was absorbing the spell and not deflecting it. The "deflection" was drawn in ballpoint pen by someone here at Wizards to indicate what needed changed.


### 3. Final Art


Here is a large version of the final piece. The spell is clearly being deflected to a new target, which is what Willbender does mechanically.


### 4. Card


Finally, here is the card as you'll see it at the prerelease.
