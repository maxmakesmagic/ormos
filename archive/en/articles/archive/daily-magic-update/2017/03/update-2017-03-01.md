The Daily *Magic* Update is a roundup of everything *Magic* you should know on March 1, 2017. Today's Update is brought to you by Liliana. There was much fretting over whether she would return, but *~~Wish Fulfillment~~* *Modern Masters 2017* is trying pretty hard not to let you down.


Today's Previews
================


1. [*Modern Masters 2017* Preview: Liliana of the Veil](http://www.channelfireball.com/articles/modern-masters-2017-preview-liliana-of-the-veil/) | ChannelFireball | Luis Scott-Vargas

Yup, she's here, too. And she's just as amazing as ever before.

The secret fourth Merfolk Lord returns to copy things cheaply then run away if you breathe on it.


1. [[출처] 모던마스터 2017 프리뷰 Abyssal Specter|작성자 매직 더 개더링](http://mtgko.blog.me/220947240391) | MTGKO.blog.me

I'm not sure what the rest of it says, but it says "[Abyssal Specter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Abyssal+Specter)" over and over again, so I'm pretty sure that's what's being previewed here.


Also, that art is fantastic. [Hypnotic Specter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hypnotic+Specter)'s little brother is no slouch.

Playing Standard with 4 [Sphinx's Revelation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sphinx%27s+Revelation), 4 [Supreme Verdict](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Supreme+Verdict), and 4 [Detention Sphere](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Detention+Sphere) might have been the best thing since playing 4 [Mulldrifter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mulldrifter) was possible. Yes, maybe even better than [Panharmonicon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Panharmonicon)/[Cloudblazer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloudblazer) (which is basically just casting [Sphinx's Revelation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sphinx%27s+Revelation) on a 2/2).

I don't know if you can read the article, but you can definitely read the image and revel in its angelic glory.


1. [Spoiler Exclusivo Modern Masters 2017!! #Mtgmm3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7A5rx_JuNr4&t=100s)| UMotivo

You may or may not understand what he's saying, but you can certainly understand the image he shows off starting around the 1:40 min mark.

I can only give antagonistic cards to so many players. Some players actually have good histories with some of these cards.


1. [Official MM2017 Spoiler Card - Ask Your Spirits](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2gzSVIgkEw) | Loading Ready Run

Fun fact—this is actually how we talk to LoadingReadyRun about upcoming projects.

1. [Exclusive LR Modern Masters 2017 Edition Preview Cards!](http://lrcast.com/exclusive-lr-modern-masters-2017-edition-preview-cards/) | LRCast | Marshall Sutcliffe

For those who don't know Marshall, there is no card in Modern we could have possibly given him that would top this one for him—plus we added a common helper that's going to make his favorite card that much more absurd.

Sacrifice all the things!


1. [Hareruya Exclusive: Modern Masters 2017 - Preview Card!](http://www.hareruyamtg.com/article/en/category/detail/91) | Hareruyamtg.com | Atsushi Ito

If you've been paying attention to Modern lately, you'll certainly know this card on sight. There just aren't that many 13/13s running around. Or loping. Shambling? Whatever shadows do.

Ah, yes. This is what my nightmares look like.

Now those are some rarity downshifts that will make a difference. Pauper, here they come.


1. [Light My Fire](http://www.gatheringmagic.com/andrewjessup-03012017-light-my-fire/) | Gathering Magic | Andrew Jessup

New art, same powerful Storm enabler.


Still to Come
=============


1. [Magic Mics](https://www.twitch.tv/magicmics) | 11 p.m. ET/8 p.m. PT | Evan Erwin, Erin Campbell, Reuben Bresler

Join the crew tonight for an exclusive preview card. Plus, Evan will tap dance for you. I swear. Probably.


1. [Stay Nerd](http://www.staynerd.com/)

It won't be in English, but the site has plenty of pretty pictures, so I'm sure you'll be able to find it. Whatever it might be.


1. More Twitter previews coming your way

We have two more previewing cards on Twitter today:


* Mark Rosewater: [@maro254](https://twitter.com/maro254)
* Joe Lossett: [@oarsman79](https://twitter.com/oarsman79)

Just be sure to use the hashtag #whereismypreviewcard when bothering them about it. I'm sure they'll love that.


1. [Strictly Better MTG](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpZCNYMXJI_ptSBD3t47NOQ)

That's right, wizards, Dev has his first previews. Yes, previews. Plural.


1. [PureMTGO](http://puremtgo.com/)

Spoiler: Their preview card can be played on *Magic Online*. True story!


Top 25
======


1. Strasky and Larsson move on up

Just last week, Joel Larsson was on the trapdoor of the Top 25 hoping to stave off falling off.


And so he did.


Moving up four spots, Larsson is now a far more secure No. 21 in the world, while Samuel Black slips down to No. 25.


The only other big mover this week was Ondrej Strasky, who took a mighty 6-place leap to No. 13 on the back of a strong Grand Prix performance. The Czech player may be young, but he has to be feeling pretty good about his ascension up the list of the top players in the world.
