Although Akito Shinodaâ€™s deck is listed as 5-color, in reality it was more of a base-Jeskai deck splashing for the two other colors. As the only Jeskai drafter at the table, he was able to snag up all of the good Jeskai rares, from [Mantis Rider](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mantis+Rider) to [Flying Crane Technique](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flying+Crane+Technique). As it turns out, finding the underdrafted color is a great strategy for winning a Grand Prix!
