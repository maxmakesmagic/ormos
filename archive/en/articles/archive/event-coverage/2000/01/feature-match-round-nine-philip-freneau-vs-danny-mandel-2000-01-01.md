### THE MATCHUP


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/GPMINN01/960.jpg)Phil, a card-carrying member of Team ABU, was sporting a U-W-b deck...wait, come back!...don't stop reading!...it has Dromar, not [Desolation Angel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Desolation+Angel). See? It's different.


Danny, from Your Move Games, had a Phelddagrif-based U-W-g deck. As he admitted after the match...this was a bad matchup, and it went poorly for him.


### THE MATCH


In game one, Phil (going first) set the tempo early by Vindicating Danny's blue mana and [Sunscape Familiar](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sunscape+Familiar), and then dropping a Lynx. Danny did not have a resolved play until turn ten, when he put out a [Meddling Mage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Meddling+Mage), used [Mystic Snake](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mystic+Snake) to stop the [Dromar's Charm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dromar%27s+Charm), named [Desolation Angel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Desolation+Angel) with something approaching relief...


...and then watched Phil slam down Dromar on his next turn.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/GPMINN01/959.jpg)While Danny had a Phelddagrif as an answer, he was forced to [Absorb](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Absorb) Phil's maindecked [Gainsay](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gainsay) (Danny: "I thought this was a bad matchup before I saw maindeck [Gainsay](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gainsay)") and had no blue mana left to stop Dromar from washing out green. On his twelfth turn, he tried the hippo again, Phil showed an [Absorb](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Absorb), and Danny scooped.


Game two looked a little more even, for a while. Danny's analysis after the fact was accurate (and this reporter is paraphrasing, but will use quotes anyway, because that way people will take it more seriously);


"What favors Phil is that I have one window: the mid-game. Phil owns the early game with Lynxes, and the late game with Dromar and superior countermagic. If I can get a hippo through on turns four or five, I can preserve it. But that didn't happen."


It wasn't for lack of trying. Danny kept one of two Lynxes at bay with a [Sunscape Familiar](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sunscape+Familiar) for a while, [Absorb](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Absorb)ed a [Meddling Mage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Meddling+Mage)...and then gamely split up three consecutive end-of-turn [Fact or Fiction](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fact+or+Fiction)s (turns 7, 8, and 9) as Phil accumulated tremendous card advantage. One interesting split (the last) had Danny put Dromar and [Vindicate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vindicate) in one pile, leaving Lynx and two Plains in the other. This was smooth, since Phil only had six mana and both players new Dromar was a dead card.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/GPMINN01/956.jpg)But the third Lynx ended up being critical anyway, since Danny found a second wall. While he was able to [Aura Blast](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aura+Blast) Phil's [Yawgmoth's Agenda](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Yawgmoth%27s+Agenda), the kitties were enough to finish the job.


Sideboarding: Danny pulled [Exclude](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Exclude)s and a [Disrupt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Disrupt) or two out in favor of [Gainsay](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gainsay)s and [Aura Blast](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aura+Blast)s; Phil pulled his [Probe](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Probe)s and Verdicts to get two each of [Meddling Mage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Meddling+Mage), [Voice of All](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Voice+of+All), [Stormscape Apprentice](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stormscape+Apprentice), and two more [Gainsay](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gainsay).
