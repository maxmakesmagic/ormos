Berkowitz Destroys Detroit!
===========================

Jordan Berkowitz is the Grand Prix: Detroit Champion!
-----------------------------------------------------


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gpdetr05/fin.jpg)Pro Tour Venice Top 8 finisher Jordan Berkowitz squared off with another Pro Tour Top 8 player in the finals of this Limited Grand Prix event. With a remarkable streak of strong money finishes at the last two years of Limited Pro Tours, Rich Hoaen was the favorite coming into this very experienced Top 8 field. Rich drafted a red-white deck and cruised past Sam Gomersall and Michael Krumb before falling to Jordan and his green-black, self-described "pile" in a grueling three-game match.


Jordan drubbed Osyp Lebedowicz in two fast games in the quarterfinals and proceeded to [Bile Urchin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bile+Urchin) Jeroen Remie out twice in the semis. Against Hoaen he split the first two before an exacting drawn-out rubber game. Rich was gaining massive amounts of life via [Genju of the Fields](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Genju+of+the+Fields) and plinking away with [Frostwielder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Frostwielder) while Jordan attempted to reach critical mass. He built a Rube Goldbergian endgame that involved [Honden of Life's Web](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Honden+of+Life%27s+Web), [Long-Forgotten Gohei](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Long-Forgotten+Gohei), [Dance of Shadows](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dance+of+Shadows), [Devouring Greed](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Devouring+Greed), and some very tricky math.


Jordan nearly skipped out on the main event to go see his beloved 76ers in playoff action against the Detroit Pistons in the NBA playoffs. Between the $2,400 cash prize and the thumping his Sixers took in Game 1, it seemed like he made the right decision.
