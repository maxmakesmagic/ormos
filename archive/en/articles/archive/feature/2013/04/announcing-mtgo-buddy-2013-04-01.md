Today, I’m super excited to announce a new project from Wizards of the Coast’s digital studio: **Magic Online** Buddy featuring everybody's new **Magic** friend: Planey!


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/arcana/1201_mtgobuddy_ny2an8zx.jpg)With the work being done on the **Magic Online** Wide Beta, it was suggested that as a way to help players get better at **Magic** we could utilize groundbreaking technology creating a helpful avatar.


Let’s say you’re drafting *Gatecrash* and aren’t sure what to pick when faced with a pack:


Click the new **Magic Online** Buddy icon and up pops “Timmy” the helpful **Magic** helper.

“Spike” will be keyed toward helping players become more competitive. We've trained its AI engine using millions of lines of **Magic Online** chat logs, it will speak using the gamer jargon they are already familiar with:

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/arcana/1201_planey_of4fscom_2.jpg)We have a lot more planned for **Magic Online** Buddy including more personas such as: Johnny, Vorthos, Melvin, MaRo, Dr. Richard Garfield, Garvas Elscott, Fblthp and more!


We hope you're as excited as we are about this new technology for the **Magic Online** client!
