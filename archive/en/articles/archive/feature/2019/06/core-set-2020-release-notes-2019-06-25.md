The Release Notes include information concerning the release of a new *Magic: The Gathering* set, as well as a collection of clarifications and rulings involving that set's cards. It's intended to make playing with the new cards more fun by clearing up the common misconceptions and confusion inevitably caused by new mechanics and interactions. As future sets are released, updates to the *Magic* rules may cause some of this information to become outdated. If you can't find the answer you're looking for here, please contact us at [Support.Wizards.com](http://support.wizards.com/).


The "General Notes" section includes release information and explains the mechanics and concepts in the set.


The "Card-Specific Notes" section contains answers to the most important, most common, and most confusing questions players might ask about cards in the set. Items in the "Card-Specific Notes" section include full card text for your reference. Not all cards in the set are listed.

Set Theme: Chandra Nalaar
=========================


*Core Set 2020* prominently features the fiery Planeswalker Chandra Nalaar—her suite of awesome pyromantic abilities is represented not only by a variety of her spells, but also on three planeswalker cards available in booster packs (one uncommon, one rare, and one mythic rare) and a fourth that is included in the Chandra Planeswalker Deck.


![Chandra, Novice Pyromancer](https://media.wizards.com/2019/m20/en_6nUh8cUFNU.png)


Chandra, Novice Pyromancer  

3R  

Legendary Planeswalker — Chandra  

5  

+1: Elementals you control get +2/+0 until end of turn.  

−1: Add RR.  

−2: Chandra, Novice Pyromancer deals 2 damage to any target.


The rules for planeswalker cards are unchanged for this release.


* Planeswalker cards have subtypes (such as "Chandra" or "Ajani") that other cards may reference, but these carry no inherent rules meaning. For example, you can't control two planeswalkers named Chandra, Novice Pyromancer because they are legendary permanents subject to the "legend rule," but you can control both Chandra, Novice Pyromancer and Chandra, Acolyte of Flame.
* A planeswalker enters the battlefield with a number of loyalty counters on it equal to its starting loyalty, which is printed in the lower-right corner of the card. Damage dealt to a planeswalker causes that planeswalker to lose that many loyalty counters.
* If a planeswalker's loyalty reaches 0, it's put into its owner's graveyard just like a creature with 0 toughness. There's no way to bring a planeswalker to 0 loyalty and then sacrifice it for another effect.
* You may activate one loyalty ability of each planeswalker you control during your turn any time you could cast a sorcery. To do so, pay its loyalty cost by adding or removing the appropriate number of loyalty counters.
* If a planeswalker has a triggered or static ability, that ability continues to function even after you've activated a loyalty ability of that planeswalker.
* When a planeswalker spell you control resolves during your turn, you have priority before any other player can cast spells (including instant spells) or activate abilities. If it's your main phase and the stack is empty, you can activate an ability of one of your planeswalkers before anyone can try to remove it from the battlefield.
* The easiest way to get rid of planeswalkers is by attacking them. As you choose attacking creatures, you choose for each of those creatures whether it's attacking an opponent or a planeswalker an opponent controls. Players can block creatures attacking their planeswalkers with creatures they control. Any unblocked creatures attacking a planeswalker deal combat damage to that planeswalker, and that planeswalker doesn't deal any damage back.
* Some spells can deal damage directly to planeswalkers. These may say specifically that they can target a planeswalker or deal damage to a planeswalker, but they may also say that they can deal damage to "any target" or similar. The phrase "any target" means "target creature, planeswalker, or player."



---

Returning Keyword: Protection
=============================


Starting with the *Core Set 2020* set, the protection keyword is coming out of retirement and will be regularly appearing in sets again. This keyword encompasses four ways to protect permanents or players.


![Apostle of Purifying Light](https://media.wizards.com/2019/m20/en_uSeWUp8z4X.png)


Apostle of Purifying Light  

1W  

Creature — Human Cleric  

2/1  

Protection from black *(This creature can't be blocked, targeted, dealt damage, enchanted, or equipped by anything black.)*  

2: Exile target card from a graveyard.


The rules for protection are unchanged for this release.


* If a permanent has protection from a color, it means four things:
* Damage that would be dealt to that permanent by a source of that color is prevented.
* Auras and Equipment of that color can't be attached to that permanent.
* Creatures of that color can't block that permanent.
* That permanent can't be the target of spells of that color or abilities of sources of that color.
* Nothing other than the events specified above is prevented or illegal. A creature with protection from white will be destroyed by Planar Cleansing; a creature with protection from green will get +2/+2 and gain trample from Overcome; and a creature with protection from black will be denied +1/+1 counters thanks to Blightbeetle's effect.
* A permanent gaining protection may cause a spell or ability on the stack to have an illegal target. As a spell or ability tries to resolve, if all its targets are illegal, that spell or ability doesn't resolve. None of its effects happen, including effects unrelated to the target. If at least one target is still legal, the spell or ability does as much as it can to the remaining legal targets, and its other effects still happen.
* Protection applies only while the object with protection is on the battlefield. For example, a creature spell that has protection from blue may be the target of a blue spell that will counter it, and a creature card in a graveyard that has protection from black may be the target of a black spell that will return it.



---

Returning Mechanic: Leylines
============================


The Leylines are a cycle of five enchantments that come with an unusual feature: If you happen to have one or more of them in your opening hand, you can put them onto the battlefield before the game begins!


![Leyline of the Void](https://media.wizards.com/2019/m20/en_JfUgN6LLnC.png)


Leyline of the Void  

2BB  

Enchantment  

If Leyline of the Void is in your opening hand, you may begin the game with it on the battlefield.  

If a card would be put into an opponent's graveyard from anywhere, exile it instead.


The rules relating to Leylines are unchanged for this release.


* A player's "opening hand" is the hand of cards the player has after all players have finished taking mulligans.
* If players have any cards in hand that allow actions to be taken from a player's opening hand (such as Leylines), the starting player is the first to do so. That player may take any such actions available to them in any order, then each other player in turn order may do the same. Then the first turn begins.



---

Rules Update: Taking Mulligans
==============================


Following its successful test earlier this year, a new procedure for taking mulligans is being put into effect with the release of the *Core Set 2020* set. This rule change applies to all formats of play as of Friday, July 12, 2019.


The new rule for the mulligan procedure is as follows:


103.4. Each player draws a number of cards equal to their starting hand size, which is normally seven. (Some effects can modify a player's starting hand size.) A player who is dissatisfied with their initial hand may take a mulligan. First, the starting player declares whether they will take a mulligan. Then each other player in turn order does the same. Once each player has made a declaration, all players who decided to take mulligans do so at the same time. To take a mulligan, a player shuffles the cards in their hand back into their library, draws a new hand of cards equal to their starting hand size, then puts a number of those cards equal to the number of times that player has taken a mulligan on the bottom of their library in any order. Once a player chooses not to take a mulligan, the remaining cards become that player's opening hand, and that player may not take any further mulligans. This process is then repeated until no player takes a mulligan. A player can take mulligans until their opening hand would be zero cards.


* After drawing seven cards, a player may choose to shortcut the mulligan process and simply declare that they will take a mulligan before putting any cards on the bottom on their library. However, if any effects allow them to take other actions any time they could take a mulligan, they must first put the appropriate number of cards on the bottom of their library before they can take those actions.
* In a multiplayer game, the first mulligan a player takes is "free." This means that the first time a player takes a mulligan, they don't put any cards on the bottom of their library. The second time that player takes a mulligan, they put one card on the bottom of their library, and so on.



---

CARD-SPECIFIC NOTES
===================


![Act of Treason](https://media.wizards.com/2019/m20/en_33j8rKF1bo.png)


Act of Treason  

2R  

Sorcery  

Gain control of target creature until end of turn. Untap that creature. It gains haste until end of turn. *(It can attack and T this turn.)*


* Act of Treason can target any creature, even one that's untapped or one you already control.
* Gaining control of a creature doesn't cause you to gain control of any Auras or Equipment attached to it.



---

![Aerial Assault](https://media.wizards.com/2019/m20/en_0EC9gg7x7A.png)


Aerial Assault  

2W  

Sorcery  

Destroy target tapped creature. You gain 1 life for each creature you control with flying.


* If the target creature is an illegal target by the time Aerial Assault tries to resolve, the spell doesn't resolve. You won't gain life. If the target is legal but is not destroyed (most likely because it has indestructible), you will gain life.
* Any abilities that trigger as the target creature is destroyed won't resolve until after you've gained life.
* If any creatures were exiled "until" the target creature left the battlefield, those creatures will return before you gain life.



---

![Aether Gust](https://media.wizards.com/2019/m20/en_WacQqz62Gp.png)


Aether Gust  

1U  

Instant  

Choose target spell or permanent that's red or green. Its owner puts it on the top or bottom of their library.


* The owner of the target spell or permanent chooses to put it either on the top or bottom of their library.
* If a spell is put into its owner's library, it's removed from the stack and thus will not resolve. The spell isn't countered; it no longer exists. This works against a spell that can't be countered.



---

![Agent of Treachery](https://media.wizards.com/2019/m20/en_dclLIOYvDO.png)


Agent of Treachery  

5UU  

Creature — Human Rogue  

2/3  

When Agent of Treachery enters the battlefield, gain control of target permanent.  

At the beginning of your end step, if you control three or more permanents you don't own, draw three cards.


* Gaining control of a creature doesn't cause you to gain control of any Auras or Equipment attached to it. Gaining control of an Aura or Equipment doesn't change what it's currently attached to.
* Agent of Treachery's effect lasts indefinitely. It doesn't wear off during the cleanup step, and it doesn't expire if Agent of Treachery leaves the battlefield. In a multiplayer game, it does expire if you leave the game.
* A token's owner is the player who created it.
* If you don't control three permanents you don't own as your end step begins, Agent of Treachery's last ability doesn't trigger. If you no longer control three permanents you don't own as it resolves, you won't draw three cards. Those don't have to be the same three permanents each time.
* If you gain control of a permanent "until end of turn," that effect will wear off during the cleanup step, after the end step. You'll control that permanent while considering Agent of Treachery's last ability.



---

![Agonizing Syphon](https://media.wizards.com/2019/m20/en_NJthacUDIO.png)


Agonizing Syphon  

3B  

Sorcery  

Agonizing Syphon deals 3 damage to any target and you gain 3 life.


* If the chosen target becomes an illegal target for Agonizing Syphon, the spell won't resolve. You won't gain life.



---

![Ajani, Inspiring Leader](https://media.wizards.com/2019/m20/en_2DIhurUi4F.png)


Ajani, Inspiring Leader *(Planeswalker Deck only)*  

4WW  

Legendary Planeswalker — Ajani  

5  

+2: You gain 2 life. Put two +1/+1 counters on up to one target creature.  

−3: Exile target creature. Its controller gains 2 life.  

−10: Creatures you control gain flying and double strike until end of turn.


* You may activate Ajani's first ability without choosing any target. If you do, you will gain 2 life. However, if you do choose a target and the target creature is an illegal target by the time the ability tries to resolve, the ability doesn't resolve. You won't gain 2 life.
* If the target creature is an illegal target by the time Ajani's second ability tries to resolve, the ability doesn't resolve. No player will gain life.
* Ajani's last ability affects only creatures you control at the time it resolves. Creatures you begin to control later in the turn won't gain flying or double strike.



---

![Ajani, Strength of the Pride](https://media.wizards.com/2019/m20/en_EkWdzcQnjE.png)


Ajani, Strength of the Pride  

2WW  

Legendary Planeswalker — Ajani  

5  

+1: You gain life equal to the number of creatures you control plus the number of planeswalkers you control.  

−2: Create a 2/2 white Cat Soldier creature token named Ajani's Pridemate with "Whenever you gain life, put a +1/+1 counter on Ajani's Pridemate."  

0: If you have at least 15 life more than your starting life total, exile Ajani, Strength of the Pride and each artifact and creature your opponents control.


* If a planeswalker you control is also a creature (most likely because it's Gideon), it will be counted twice as Ajani's first ability resolves.
* The tokens created by Ajani's second ability are similar to the card Ajani's Pridemate, but they have no mana cost and their converted mana cost is 0.
* If Ajani's Pridemate is dealt lethal damage at the same time that you gain life, it won't receive a counter from its ability in time to save it.
* The ability of Ajani's Pridemate triggers just once for each life-gaining event, whether it's 1 life from Impassioned Orator or 4 life from Dawning Angel. If you gain an amount of life "for each" of something or "equal to the number" of something, that life is gained as one event and the ability of Ajani's Pridemate triggers only once.
* Each creature with lifelink dealing combat damage causes a separate life-gaining event. For example, if two creatures you control with lifelink deal combat damage at the same time, Ajani's Pridemate's ability will trigger twice. However, if a single creature you control with lifelink deals combat damage to multiple creatures, players, and/or planeswalkers at the same time (perhaps because it has trample or was blocked by more than one creature), the ability will trigger only once.
* Whether you have at least 15 life more than your starting life total is determined as Ajani's last ability resolves.
* In a Two-Headed Giant game, life gained by your teammate won't cause Ajani's Pridemate's ability to trigger, even though it will cause your team's life total to increase.
* In a Two-Headed Giant game, Ajani's last ability exiles permanents as long as your team's life total is greater than your team's starting life total by 15 or more life.



---

![Ancestral Blade](https://media.wizards.com/2019/m20/en_rtAjgzb0HU.png)


Ancestral Blade  

1W  

Artifact — Equipment  

When Ancestral Blade enters the battlefield, create a 1/1 white Soldier creature token, then attach Ancestral Blade to it.  

Equipped creature gets +1/+1.  

Equip 1 *(1: Attach to target creature you control. Equip only as a sorcery.)*


* The Soldier token that you create enters the battlefield as a 1/1 creature. Any abilities that trigger when a creature with a certain power enters the battlefield will see the token enter as a 1/1 creature.
* No player may take any actions between the time you create the Soldier token and the time Ancestral Blade becomes attached to it.



---

![Angel of Vitality](https://media.wizards.com/2019/m20/en_zFyuR07mBT.png)


Angel of Vitality  

2W  

Creature — Angel  

2/2  

Flying  

If you would gain life, you gain that much life plus 1 instead.  

Angel of Vitality gets +2/+2 as long as you have 25 or more life.


* If you control two Angels of Vitality and you would gain life, you gain that much life plus 2. A third Angel of Vitality has you gain that much life plus 3, and so on.
* The middle ability of Angel of Vitality applies just once to each life-gaining event, whether it's 1 life from Impassioned Orator or 4 life from Dawning Angel. If you gain an amount of life "for each" of something or "equal to the number" of something, that life is gained as one event and the ability of Angel of Vitality applies only once.
* Each creature with lifelink dealing combat damage causes a separate life-gaining event. For example, if two creatures you control with lifelink deal combat damage at the same time, Angel of Vitality's second ability will apply twice. However, if a single creature you control with lifelink deals combat damage to multiple creatures, players, and/or planeswalkers at the same time (perhaps because it has trample or was blocked by more than one creature), the ability will apply only once.
* If Angel of Vitality is dealt damage and your life total is increased to 25 or more before state-based actions are performed (most likely because Angel of Vitality is dealt combat damage at the same time that a creature you control with lifelink deals combat damage), Angel of Vitality's last ability applies before checking whether it's destroyed for having lethal damage marked on it.
* Because damage remains marked on a creature until it's removed as the turn ends, nonlethal damage dealt to Angel of Vitality may become lethal if your life total drops below 25 during that turn.
* In a Two-Headed Giant game, life gained by your teammate won't cause Angel of Vitality's second ability to apply, even though it will cause your team's life total to increase.
* In multiplayer formats where your life total doesn't start at 20, Angel of Vitality's last ability still applies if your life total is 25 or more.
* In a Two-Headed Giant game, Angel of Vitality's last ability applies as long as your team's life total is 25 or more.



---

![Angelic Gift](https://media.wizards.com/2019/m20/en_SRFLT0LnhG.png)


Angelic Gift  

1W  

Enchantment — Aura  

Enchant creature  

When Angelic Gift enters the battlefield, draw a card.  

Enchanted creature has flying.


* If the target creature is an illegal target by the time Angelic Gift tries to resolve, the spell doesn't resolve. It won't enter the battlefield, so you won't draw a card.



---

![Atemsis, All-Seeing](https://media.wizards.com/2019/m20/en_Z119ZEEuYW.png)


Atemsis, All-Seeing  

3UUU  

Legendary Creature — Sphinx  

4/5  

Flying  

2U, T: Draw two cards, then discard a card.  

Whenever Atemsis, All-Seeing deals damage to an opponent, you may reveal your hand. If cards with at least six different converted mana costs are revealed this way, that player loses the game.


* Every *Magic* card has exactly one converted mana cost. A card with no mana cost has a converted mana cost of 0, and 0 can be one of the six converted mana costs that count toward Atemsis's ability.
* If a card in your hand has X in its mana cost, the value of X is considered to be 0.
* The converted mana cost of a split card is determined by combining its two halves. For example, the converted mana cost of Fire//Ice in your hand is 4.
* If an effect causes you to play with your hand revealed, you can still reveal your hand as Atemsis's last ability resolves. The ability works as normal.



---

![Bag of Holding](https://media.wizards.com/2019/m20/en_vLNv4ugk3L.png)


Bag of Holding  

1  

Artifact  

Whenever you discard a card, exile that card from your graveyard.  

2, T: Draw a card, then discard a card.  

4, T, Sacrifice Bag of Holding: Return all cards exiled with Bag of Holding to their owner's hand.


* If you discard a card but that card is not in your graveyard as Bag of Holding's first ability resolves, that card remains wherever it has moved.
* If you control more than one Bag of Holding, you choose which one will hold the discarded card. Other Bags of Holding can't return that card.
* You both draw and discard while Bag of Holding's second ability is resolving. No player may take any action—nor can anything else happen—until you've both drawn and discarded.
* If Bag of Holding leaves the battlefield, the items it contained are exiled forever (and, perhaps, scattered throughout the Astral Plane). If the same Bag of Holding card returns to the battlefield, it's considered a new object without access to the cards stored by the old object.



---

![Barkhide Troll](https://media.wizards.com/2019/m20/en_Fz3HNL6bEq.png)


Barkhide Troll  

GG  

Creature — Troll  

2/2  

Barkhide Troll enters the battlefield with a +1/+1 counter on it.  

1, Remove a +1/+1 counter from Barkhide Troll: Barkhide Troll gains hexproof until end of turn. *(It can't be the target of spells or abilities your opponents control.)*


* Because damage remains marked on a creature until it's removed as the turn ends, nonlethal damage dealt to Barkhide Troll may become lethal if you activate its last ability during that turn.



---

![Befuddle](https://media.wizards.com/2019/m20/en_zXEFO1uyMs.png)


Befuddle  

2U  

Instant  

Target creature gets -4/-0 until end of turn.  

Draw a card.


* If the target creature is an illegal target by the time Befuddle tries to resolve, the spell doesn't resolve. You won't draw a card.



---

![Bishop of Wings](https://media.wizards.com/2019/m20/en_ohqipnuKY2.png)


Bishop of Wings  

WW  

Creature — Human Cleric  

1/4  

Whenever an Angel enters the battlefield under your control, you gain 4 life.  

Whenever an Angel you control dies, create a 1/1 white Spirit creature token with flying.


* If Bishop of Wings dies at the same time as one or more Angels you control, its last ability triggers for each of those Angels.
* If an effect (such as that of Arcane Adaptation) causes Bishop of Wings to be an Angel, its first ability triggers as it enters the battlefield and its last ability triggers as it dies.



---

![Bladebrand](https://media.wizards.com/2019/m20/en_rQ0JYl08Wv.png)


Bladebrand  

1B  

Instant  

Target creature gains deathtouch until end of turn. *(Any amount of damage it deals to a creature is enough to destroy it.)*  

Draw a card.


* If the target creature is an illegal target by the time Bladebrand tries to resolve, the spell doesn't resolve. You don't draw a card.



---

![Blightbeetle](https://media.wizards.com/2019/m20/en_a87SmAghWw.png)


Blightbeetle  

1B  

Creature — Insect  

1/1  

Protection from green *(This creature can't be blocked, targeted, dealt damage, enchanted, or equipped by anything green.)*  

Creatures your opponents control can't have +1/+1 counters put on them.


* Blightbeetle doesn't remove any +1/+1 counters already on creatures your opponents control.
* Creatures your opponents control won't receive +1/+1 counters as they enter the battlefield.
* If a replacement effect allows a player to modify or replace an event by putting +1/+1 counters on a creature affected by Blightbeetle, that player may apply that replacement effect, but they won't get counters. If the original event is entirely replaced (such as by applying Vigor's replacement effect), the entire original event simply doesn't happen.
* If the cost of an ability or an additional cost of a spell requires putting +1/+1 counters on a creature affected by Blightbeetle, that cost can't be paid. If a resolving spell or ability says that a player may put +1/+1 counters on that creature, that player can't choose to do so.



---

![Blood for Bones](https://media.wizards.com/2019/m20/en_iHkoXlj31q.png)


Blood for Bones  

3B  

Sorcery  

As an additional cost to cast this spell, sacrifice a creature.  

Return a creature card from your graveyard to the battlefield, then return another creature card from your graveyard to your hand.


* You must sacrifice exactly one creature to cast this spell; you can't cast it without sacrificing a creature, and you can't sacrifice additional creatures.
* Once you begin to cast Blood for Bones, no player may take actions until you're done. Notably, opponents can't try to remove the creature you wish to sacrifice.
* Blood for Bones doesn't target the creature cards to return from your graveyard. This means that, while the spell is resolving, no player may take any actions between the time you choose the cards and return them.
* The creature sacrificed to cast Blood for Bones may be one of the cards chosen to be returned.
* Any abilities that trigger as the creature card is returned to the battlefield won't resolve until after Blood for Bones is finished resolving.

Bloodthirsty Aerialist  

1BB  

Creature — Vampire Rogue  

2/3  

Flying  

Whenever you gain life, put a +1/+1 counter on Bloodthirsty Aerialist.


* The ability of Bloodthirsty Aerialist triggers just once for each life-gaining event, whether it's 1 life from Impassioned Orator or 4 life from Dawning Angel. If you gain an amount of life "for each" of something or "equal to the number" of something, that life is gained as one event and the ability of Bloodthirsty Aerialist triggers only once.
* If Bloodthirsty Aerialist is dealt lethal damage at the same time that you gain life, it won't receive a counter from its ability in time to save it.
* Each creature with lifelink dealing combat damage causes a separate life-gaining event. For example, if two creatures you control with lifelink deal combat damage at the same time, Bloodthirsty Aerialist's ability will trigger twice. However, if a single creature you control with lifelink deals combat damage to multiple creatures, players, and/or planeswalkers at the same time (perhaps because it has trample or was blocked by more than one creature), the ability will trigger only once.
* In a Two-Headed Giant game, life gained by your teammate won't cause the ability to trigger, even though it caused your team's life total to increase.

As an additional cost to cast this spell, sacrifice a creature.  

Destroy target creature.


* You must sacrifice exactly one creature to cast this spell; you can't cast it without sacrificing a creature, and you can't sacrifice additional creatures.
* Once you begin to cast Bone Splinters, no player may take actions until you're done. Notably, opponents can't try to remove the creature you wish to sacrifice.

Bone to Ash  

2UU

Counter target creature spell.  

Draw a card.


* A creature spell that can't be countered is a legal target for Bone to Ash. The creature spell won't be countered when Bone to Ash resolves, but you'll still draw a card.

Flying  

Spells your opponents cast that target Boreal Elemental cost 2 more to cast.


* To determine the total cost of a spell, start with the mana cost or alternative cost you're paying, add any cost increases (such as that of Boreal Elemental), then apply any cost reductions. The converted mana cost of the spell remains unchanged, no matter what the total cost to cast it was.
* An opponent's spell that targets Boreal Elemental more than once costs only 2 more to cast.

2/1  

Flash *(You may cast this spell any time you could cast an instant.)*  

Whenever you cast a spell during an opponent's turn, put a +1/+1 counter on Brineborn Cutthroat.


* Brineborn Cutthroat must be on the battlefield for its last ability to function. Notably, the ability won't trigger as you cast Brineborn Cutthroat during an opponent's turn.
* Brineborn Cutthroat's ability resolves before the spell that caused it to trigger. It resolves even if that spell is countered.

Brought Back  

WW  

Instant  

Choose up to two target permanent cards in your graveyard that were put there from the battlefield this turn. Return them to the battlefield tapped.


* A permanent card is an artifact, creature, enchantment, land, or planeswalker card.
* If you return an Aura this way, you choose what the Aura will enchant just before it enters the battlefield, but you can't choose any permanent cards that will enter the battlefield at the same time as that Aura. An Aura returning to the battlefield this way doesn't target the player or permanent it will enchant, so permanents or players with hexproof may be chosen; however, the chosen recipient must be able to legally be enchanted by the Aura, so a player or permanent with protection from one of the Aura's qualities can't be chosen this way. If there's nothing legal for the Aura to enchant, it stays in the graveyard.
* Permanent spells that were countered earlier in the turn never entered the battlefield, so they won't be legal targets for Brought Back.

Cavalier of Dawn  

2WWW  

Creature — Elemental Knight  

4/6  

Vigilance  

When Cavalier of Dawn enters the battlefield, destroy up to one target nonland permanent. Its controller creates a 3/3 colorless Golem artifact creature token.  

When Cavalier of Dawn dies, return target artifact or enchantment card from your graveyard to your hand.


* You may put Cavalier of Dawn's enters-the-battlefield ability onto the stack without choosing any target. It will resolve with no effect. However, if you do choose a target and the target permanent is an illegal target by the time that ability tries to resolve, the ability won't resolve. No player will create a Golem token. If the target is legal but not destroyed (most likely because it has indestructible), its controller will create a Golem token.

1R: Creatures you control get +1/+0 and gain haste until end of turn.  

When Cavalier of Flame enters the battlefield, discard any number of cards, then draw that many cards.  

When Cavalier of Flame dies, it deals X damage to each opponent and each planeswalker they control, where X is the number of land cards in your graveyard.


* As Cavalier of Flame's enters-the-battlefield ability resolves, you may choose to discard zero cards. You just won't draw any cards.
* In a Two-Headed Giant game, Cavalier of Flame's last ability causes the opposing team to be dealt X damage twice.

Cavalier of Night  

2BBB  

Creature — Elemental Knight  

4/5  

Lifelink  

When Cavalier of Night enters the battlefield, you may sacrifice another creature. When you do, destroy target creature an opponent controls.  

When Cavalier of Night dies, return target creature card with converted mana cost 3 or less from your graveyard to the battlefield.


* Cavalier of Night's enters-the-battlefield ability goes on the stack without a target. While that ability is resolving, you may sacrifice another creature. When you do, the reflexive triggered ability triggers and you pick a target creature to be destroyed. This is different from effects that say "If you do . . ." in that players may take actions after you've sacrificed the creature but before the target creature is destroyed.
* While resolving Cavalier of Night's enters-the-battlefield ability, you can't sacrifice more than one creature.
* If a card in a graveyard has X in its mana cost, X is considered to be 0.
* If a creature card with converted mana cost 3 or less becomes a copy of Cavalier of Night, its last ability can target itself when it dies.

3/2  

Flash *(You may cast this card any time you could cast an instant.)*  

Flying  

Celestial Messenger gets +1/+1 as long as you control a Yanling planeswalker.

4  

0: Put a loyalty counter on each red planeswalker you control.  

0: Create two 1/1 red Elemental creature tokens. They gain haste. Sacrifice them at the beginning of the next end step.  

−2: You may cast target instant or sorcery card with converted mana cost 3 or less from your graveyard. If that card would be put into your graveyard this turn, exile it instead.


* Chandra's first ability will put a counter on herself as well as any other red planeswalkers you control. This doesn't cause any other planeswalkers' loyalty abilities to be activated.
* You must pay the costs for the spell you wish to cast with Chandra's last ability. If that spell has any alternative costs, you may pay those.
* If a card in your graveyard has X in its mana cost, X is considered to be 0 while you target it with Chandra's last ability; however, once you begin to cast it, you choose a value for X. If this causes the converted mana cost to become greater than 3, you can still cast the spell.
* If you wish to cast the target card, you must cast it while Chandra's last ability is resolving. You can't cast it later in the turn.

Legendary Planeswalker — Chandra

This spell can't be countered.  

+2: Each opponent gets an emblem with "At the beginning of your upkeep, this emblem deals 1 damage to you."  

−3: Chandra, Awakened Inferno deals 3 damage to each non-Elemental creature.  

−X: Chandra, Awakened Inferno deals X damage to target creature or planeswalker. If a permanent dealt damage this way would die this turn, exile it instead.


* A spell or ability that counters spells can still target Chandra. When that spell or ability resolves, Chandra won't be countered, but any additional effects of that spell or ability will still happen.
* Emblems aren't permanents and can't be exiled or destroyed. Once you have an emblem, there's no way to remove it.
* The ability of Chandra's emblem triggers at the beginning of the upkeep of the player who gets the emblem, not the upkeep of Chandra's controller.
* A player may have more than one of Chandra's emblems. Each one's ability triggers separately.
* The replacement effect of Chandra's last ability will exile the target creature or planeswalker if it would die this turn for any reason, not just due to lethal damage.
* If Chandra's last ability doesn't deal damage (most likely because the damage has been prevented in some way), the target won't be exiled if it would die.
* In a Two-Headed Giant game, Chandra's first ability grants an emblem to each opponent. The opposing team will be dealt 1 damage twice during their upkeep.
* If you leave a multiplayer game, your opponents keep any emblems Chandra gave them. Each opponent owns the emblem Chandra gives them. In multiplayer, your opponents continue to burn after you and Chandra leave the game.

−8: Chandra, Flame's Fury deals 10 damage to target player and each creature that player controls.


* If the target creature is an illegal target by the time Chandra's second ability resolves, the ability doesn't resolve. No player is dealt damage. Similarly, if the target player is an illegal target by the time Chandra's last ability resolves, no creatures are dealt damage.
* Chandra's last ability targets the player, not their creatures. A creature with hexproof may be dealt damage this way.

+1: Elementals you control get +2/+0 until end of turn.

−2: Chandra, Novice Pyromancer deals 2 damage to any target.


* Chandra's first ability affects only Elementals you control at the time it resolves. Elementals you begin to control later in the turn won't get +2/+0.
* Because it's a loyalty ability, Chandra's second ability isn't a mana ability. It can be activated only any time you could cast a sorcery. It uses the stack and can be responded to.

Chandra's Flame Wave deals 2 damage to target player and each creature that player controls. Search your library and/or graveyard for a card named Chandra, Flame's Fury, reveal it, and put it into your hand. If you search your library this way, shuffle it.


* If the target player is an illegal target by the time Chandra's Flame Wave resolves, the spell doesn't resolve. No creatures or players are dealt damage, and you won't search for Chandra, Flame's Fury.
* Chandra's Flame Wave targets the player, not their creatures. A creature with hexproof may be dealt damage this way.

Whenever you activate a loyalty ability of a Chandra planeswalker, you may pay 1. If you do, copy that ability. You may choose new targets for the copy.  

1, T, Discard a Mountain card or a red card: Draw a card.


* You can't pay 1 more than once for each time the triggered ability of Chandra's Regulator resolves.
* Copying a loyalty ability doesn't add or remove loyalty counters from any object.
* If the loyalty ability has −X in its cost, the copy uses the same value of X.
* The triggered ability of Chandra's Regulator and the copy it creates both resolve before the loyalty ability that caused it to trigger. They resolve even if that loyalty ability is countered.
* A Mountain card is a land card with the subtype Mountain, not any land card with a mana ability that produces red mana. Land cards are normally colorless, even if they produce red mana.

Whenever an opponent is dealt noncombat damage, Chandra's Spitfire gets +3/+0 until end of turn.

* The last ability of Chandra's Spitfire triggers just once for each event in which an opponent is dealt noncombat damage, regardless of how much damage that player is dealt.
* In a multiplayer game, if a source deals damage to multiple opponents at the same time, the last ability of Chandra's Spitfire will trigger as many times as there are opponents who were dealt damage.

* Colossus Hammer can be attached to a creature that didn't have flying to begin with. It just won't lose flying.
* If the equipped creature gains flying after Colossus Hammer became attached to it, it will keep flying.
* If an ability of the equipped creature states that it has flying "as long as" a particular condition is true, Colossus Hammer will still stop the creature from having flying, even if the condition becomes true. For example, if the equipped creature "has flying as long as it's attacking," it will not have flying, even if it attacks after Colossus Hammer becomes attached to it.

When Dungeon Geists enters the battlefield, tap target creature an opponent controls. That creature doesn't untap during its controller's untap step for as long as you control Dungeon Geists.


* If another player gains control of Dungeon Geists, its effect expires. It won't keep the creature from untapping anymore, even if you later regain control of Dungeon Geists.
* Dungeon Geists's triggered ability can target a tapped creature. If the targeted creature is already tapped when it resolves, that creature just remains tapped and won't untap during its controller's next untap step.
* If Dungeon Geists leaves the battlefield before its triggered ability has resolved, the target creature will be tapped, but it will be able to untap as normal.

Flying, deathtouch  

Embodiment of Agonies enters the battlefield with a +1/+1 counter on it for each different mana cost among nonland cards in your graveyard. *(For example, 2B and 1BB are different mana costs.)*


* Every *Magic* card has either no mana cost or exactly one mana cost. A card with no mana cost is never counted by Embodiment of Agonies. A card with a mana cost of 0 is counted.
* Embodiment of Agonies checks the mana symbols in a card's mana cost. For example, a mana cost of X is different than a mana cost of 0.
* Hybrid mana symbols are treated as the actual symbols, not as either of their two components individually. For example, b/r, B, and R are three different mana costs.
* The mana cost of a split card is determined by its two halves combined. For example, the mana cost of Fire//Ice in your graveyard is 2UR, the same as the mana cost of Ral's Outburst.
* Alternative costs, additional costs you could pay, cost increases, and cost reductions are all ignored by Embodiment of Agonies.
* If you return Embodiment of Agonies from your graveyard to the battlefield, its last ability counts itself.

Epicure of Blood  

4B  

Creature — Vampire  

4/4  

Whenever you gain life, each opponent loses 1 life.


* The ability of Epicure of Blood triggers just once for each life-gaining event, whether it's 1 life from Impassioned Orator or 4 life from Dawning Angel. If you gain an amount of life "for each" of something or "equal to the number" of something, that life is gained as one event and the ability of Epicure of Blood triggers only once.
* Each creature with lifelink dealing combat damage causes a separate life-gaining event. For example, if two creatures you control with lifelink deal combat damage at the same time, Epicure of Blood's ability will trigger twice. However, if a single creature you control with lifelink deals combat damage to multiple creatures, players, and/or planeswalkers at the same time (perhaps because it has trample or was blocked by more than one creature), the ability will trigger only once.
* In a Two-Headed Giant game, life gained by your teammate won't cause the ability to trigger, even though it caused your team's life total to increase.
* In a Two-Headed Giant game, Epicure of Blood's ability causes the opposing team to lose 1 life twice.

If you don't, the ability won't trigger at all. The ability will check again as it tries to resolve. If, at that time, you don't control another creature named Faerie Miscreant, the ability will have no effect.

Field of the Dead enters the battlefield tapped.  

T: Add C.  

Whenever Field of the Dead or another land enters the battlefield under your control, if you control seven or more lands with different names, create a 2/2 black Zombie creature token.


* If you control multiple lands with the same name, only one of those lands will count toward the seven or more required to create a Zombie. For example, if you control four lands named Plains, two named Island, and one named Field of the Dead, you control three lands with different names.
* Field of the Dead's last ability counts itself and the land entering the battlefield in addition to whichever other lands you control.
* If multiple lands enter the battlefield simultaneously, possibly including Field of the Dead itself, all of those lands are counted. For example, if you sacrifice eight lands while resolving Scapeshift and search your library for five different basic land cards, two Field of the Dead cards, and one other land card with a different name, you'll create sixteen Zombie tokens.

Flood of Tears  

4UU  

Sorcery  

Return all nonland permanents to their owners' hands. If you return four or more nontoken permanents you control this way, you may put a permanent card from your hand onto the battlefield.


* If you return four or more nontoken permanents, the permanent card you put onto the battlefield may be one of the cards returned to your hand this way.
* Any abilities that trigger as the nonland permanents are returned are put onto the stack at the same time as any abilities that trigger as the permanent card is put onto the battlefield (if applicable).
* If a permanent would be returned to your hand but ends up in another zone (most likely because an effect exiled it instead or because it's a player's commander in the Commander variant) Flood of Tears counts it when determining whether four or more of your nontoken permanents were returned.

* A spell or ability that counters spells can still target Fry. When that spell or ability resolves, Fry won't be countered, but any additional effects of that spell or ability will still happen.
* If the target creature or planeswalker is an illegal target by the time Fry tries to resolve, the spell won't resolve and will be put into its owner's graveyard with no effect. This is true even though it can't be countered.

![Gargos, Vicious Watcher](https://media.wizards.com/2019/m20/en_o9zDckmAEd.png)


Gargos, Vicious Watcher  

3GGG  

Legendary Creature — Hydra  

8/7  

Vigilance  

Hydra spells you cast cost 4 less to cast.  

Whenever a creature you control becomes the target of a spell, Gargos, Vicious Watcher fights up to one target creature you don't control.


* To determine the total cost of a spell, start with the mana cost or alternative cost you're paying, add any cost increases, then apply any cost reductions (such as that of Gargos). The converted mana cost of the spell remains unchanged, no matter what the total cost to cast it was.
* Gargos's cost-reduction ability affects only generic mana in a Hydra's cost. For example, if you cast a Hydra spell with mana cost 2GGG, it will cost GGG to cast, not G.
* If a spell has X in its mana cost, you choose the value for X before applying cost reductions. For example, if you cast a Hydra spell with mana cost XGG and choose for X to be 6, you pay 2GG. Any of that Hydra's abilities that refer to X still uses 6 as the value for X regardless of what you actually paid.
* Gargos's cost-reduction ability applies only while it's on the battlefield. Gargos doesn't reduce its own cost.
* Gargos's controller chooses which creature (if any) Gargos will fight, not the controller of the spell.
* If a spell targets one creature you control multiple times, Gargos's ability triggers once. If that spell targets multiple creatures you control, Gargos's ability triggers once for each of those creatures.
* Gargos's triggered ability resolves before the spell that caused it to trigger. It resolves even if that spell is countered.
* If the target creature is an illegal target when Gargos's last ability tries to resolve, the ability doesn't resolve. If Gargos is no longer on the battlefield, the target creature won't deal or be dealt damage.

Enchantment — Aura  

Enchant creature  

Enchanted creature gets +0/+2 and assigns combat damage equal to its toughness rather than its power.  

Enchanted creature has "2W: Untap this creature."


* Gauntlets of Light's effect doesn't change the enchanted creature's power; it changes only the amount of combat damage that creature assigns. All other rules and effects that check power or toughness use the actual values. For example, if a creature fights while enchanted by Gauntlets of Light, that creature will deal damage equal to its power, not its toughness.

Haste  

Whenever you discard a card, Glint-Horn Buccaneer deals 1 damage to each opponent.  

1R, Discard a card: Draw a card. Activate this ability only if Glint-Horn Buccaneer is attacking.


* The middle ability of Glint-Horn Buccaneer is a triggered ability, not an activated ability. It doesn't allow you to discard a card whenever you want; rather, you need some other way of discarding a card, such as by activating its last ability.
* In a Two-Headed Giant game, Glint-Horn Buccaneer's triggered ability causes the opposing team to be dealt 1 damage twice.

Scry 1. *(Look at the top card of your library. You may put that card on the bottom of your library.)*


* You can't choose "artifact" or "colorless" as Gods Willing asks you to choose a color because those are not colors.
* If the target creature is an illegal target by the time Gods Willing tries to resolve, the spell doesn't resolve. You won't scry 1. If the target creature becomes an illegal target while Gods Willing is resolving (most likely because you gave it protection from white), you do scry 1.

Golos, Tireless Pilgrim  

5  

Legendary Artifact Creature — Scout  

3/5  

When Golos, Tireless Pilgrim enters the battlefield, you may search your library for a land card, put that card onto the battlefield tapped, then shuffle your library.  

2WUBRG: Exile the top three cards of your library. You may play them this turn without paying their mana costs.


* If you don't play some or all of the cards exiled with Golos's last ability, those cards remain in exile.
* Golos's last ability doesn't change when you can play the exiled cards. For example, if you exile a sorcery card, you can cast it only during your main phase when the stack is empty. If you exile a land card, you can play it only during your main phase and only if you have an available land play remaining.
* If a spell has X in its mana cost, you must choose 0 as the value of X when casting it without paying its mana cost.
* If you cast a card "without paying its mana cost," you can't choose to cast it for any alternative costs. You can, however, pay additional costs. If the card has any mandatory additional costs (such as that of Bone Splinters), you must pay those to cast the card.

* The size of the bonus is determined as Growth Cycle begins to resolve; it won't change later in the turn if the number of Growth Cycles in your graveyard changes.
* Because Growth Cycle is still on the stack as you perform its instructions, it isn't in your graveyard and won't add to the bonus the creature gets.

Whenever equipped creature attacks, Heart-Piercer Bow deals 1 damage to target creature defending player controls.  

Equip 1 *(1: Attach to target creature you control. Equip only as a sorcery.)*

For example, if you have a legendary creature card in your graveyard, you can cast it only during your main phase when the stack is empty.

At the beginning of your end step, if a player lost 4 or more life this turn, put a +1/+1 counter on Knight of the Ebon Legion. *(Damage causes loss of life.)*


* Knight of the Ebon Legion looks at your entire turn to determine whether a player lost 4 or more life. It doesn't matter how many players lost 4 or more life, only whether anyone did. It also doesn't matter whether Knight of the Ebon Legion was on the battlefield when they lost life.
* It doesn't matter whether a player has 4 or less life than they started the turn with. If a player lost 4 life but also gained 6 life, that player still lost 4 life.
* A player doesn't need to have lost 4 life all at once. If a player loses 2 life twice during a turn, that player lost 4 life during that turn, and Knight of the Ebon Legion receives a +1/+1 counter.
* A player loses life if they pay life.

Exile target creature an opponent controls with converted mana cost 2 or less and all other creatures that player controls with the same name as that creature. Then that player reveals their hand and exiles all cards with that name from their hand and graveyard.


* If a creature on the battlefield has X in its mana cost, X is considered to be 0.
* The converted mana cost of a token that isn't a copy of another object is 0. A token that is a copy of another object has the same converted mana cost as that object.
* The name of a creature token is the same as the creature types specified as it was created unless the token is a copy of another creature or the effect that created the token specifically gives it a different name.
* Legion's End targets only one creature. Other creatures will be exiled even if they have hexproof, and cards in its controller's hand and graveyard will be exiled even if that player has hexproof.
* If the target creature is an illegal target by the time Legion's End tries to resolve, the spell doesn't resolve. No player reveals their hand, and nothing is exiled.

If Leyline of Abundance is in your opening hand, you may begin the game with it on the battlefield.  

Whenever you tap a creature for mana, add an additional G.  

6GG: Put a +1/+1 counter on each creature you control.


* An ability that triggers "whenever you tap a creature for mana" triggers only if you activate a mana ability of a creature including T in its cost. Mana abilities that don't include the T symbol and instead say "Tap an untapped creature you control" or similar won't cause Leyline of Abundance's second ability to trigger. Similarly, it won't trigger if you tap a creature to activate a mana ability of another object (even if that mana ability also includes T).

If a card would be put into an opponent's graveyard from anywhere, exile it instead.

Loxodon Lifechanter  

5W  

Creature — Elephant Cleric  

4/6  

When Loxodon Lifechanter enters the battlefield, you may have your life total become the total toughness of creatures you control.  

5W: Loxodon Lifechanter gets +X/+X until end of turn, where X is your life total.


* You can activate Loxodon Lifechanter's last ability after it has entered the battlefield but before its first ability has resolved.
* You choose whether to change your life total and, if you choose to do so, you set your life total to the appropriate number while Loxodon Lifechanter's triggered ability is resolving. No player may take any actions between the time you choose to set your life total and the time your life total changes.
* For your life total to become a certain number, you gain or lose the corresponding amount of life. For example, if your life total is 4 when the ability resolves and your creatures have a total of 6 toughness, the ability will cause you to gain 2 life; alternatively, if your life total is 10 when the ability resolves, it will cause you to lose 4 life if you choose to change your life total. Other cards that interact with life gain or life loss will interact with this effect accordingly.
* If you set your life total to become equal to the toughness of creatures you control, this happens once. If the toughness of your creatures changes later, it won't affect your life total.
* The value of X is determined only as Loxodon Lifechanter's last ability begins to resolve. It won't change later in the turn if your life total changes.

Creature — Pegasus  

2/1  

Flying  

Loyal Pegasus can't attack or block alone.


* If you control more than one Loyal Pegasus, they can attack or block together, even if no other creatures attack or block.
* Although Loyal Pegasus can't attack alone, other attacking creatures don't have to attack the same player or planeswalker. For example, Loyal Pegasus could attack an opponent and another creature could attack a planeswalker that opponent controls. Similarly, other blocking creatures don't have to block the same creature that Loyal Pegasus blocks.
* Once Loyal Pegasus has attacked or blocked, it will remain in combat even if you no longer control another attacking or blocking creature.
* If an effect says that Loyal Pegasus attacks or blocks "if able," and you control one or more other creatures that are able to attack or block, you must attack or block with Loyal Pegasus and at least one other creature.
* In a Two-Headed Giant game, Loyal Pegasus can attack or block with a creature controlled by your teammate, even if no other creatures you control are attacking or blocking.

Whenever another creature enters the battlefield under your control, Marauding Raptor deals 2 damage to it. If a Dinosaur is dealt damage this way, Marauding Raptor gets +2/+0 until end of turn.


* Effects that reduce the generic mana cost of a spell (such as that of Marauding Raptor) can't reduce that spell's colored mana requirements.
* Marauding Raptor's cost reduction doesn't affect itself.

![Mask of Immolation](https://media.wizards.com/2019/m20/en_qfWEYd5h4L.png)


Mask of Immolation  

1R  

Artifact — Equipment  

When Mask of Immolation enters the battlefield, create a 1/1 red Elemental creature token, then attach Mask of Immolation to it.  

Equipped creature has "Sacrifice this creature: It deals 1 damage to any target."  

Equip 2 *(2: Attach to target creature you control. Equip only as a sorcery.)*


* No player may take any actions between the time you create the Elemental token and the time Mask of Immolation becomes attached to it.
* The equipped creature is the source of the activated ability and the source of the damage, not Mask of Immolation. This means that a green creature equipped by Mask of Immolation may deal damage to a creature with protection from red but may not deal damage to a creature with protection from green.

3W  

Creature — Human Artificer  

1/1  

When Master Splicer enters the battlefield, create a 3/3 colorless Golem artifact creature token.  

Golems you control get +1/+1.


* Because damage remains marked on a creature until it's removed as the turn ends, nonlethal damage dealt to Golems you control may become lethal if Master Splicer leaves the battlefield during that turn.

![Masterful Replication](https://media.wizards.com/2019/m20/en_hnpiRUtT24.png)


Masterful Replication  

5U  

Instant  

Choose one —  

• Create two 3/3 colorless Golem artifact creature tokens.  

• Choose target artifact you control. Each other artifact you control becomes a copy of that artifact until end of turn.


* Masterful Replication copies the printed values of the target artifact. It won't copy counters on that artifact or effects that have changed its power, toughness, types, color, or so on. Notably, it won't copy effects that made the target artifact become an artifact creature if it isn't normally an artifact creature.
* An Equipment that becomes a copy of a creature becomes unattached if it was attached to a creature. An Equipment that becomes a copy of another Equipment remains attached if it was attached to a creature.
* If the target artifact is copying something else, then your artifacts become copies of whatever the target artifact copied.
* Becoming a copy won't change whether an artifact is a token.

Might of the Masses  

G  

Instant  

Target creature gets +1/+1 until end of turn for each creature you control.

* If Moldervine Reclamation leaves the battlefield at the same time that one or more creatures you control die, its ability triggers for each of those creatures.
* If a creature you control dies at the same time that your life total becomes 0 or less, you lose the game before Moldervine Reclamation's ability can save you.

Legendary Planeswalker — Yanling

+1: Until your next turn, up to one target creature gets -5/-0.  

−3: Return up to two target creatures to their owners' hands.  

−7: Creatures you control with flying get +5/+5 until end of turn.


* Mu Yanling's last ability affects only creatures you control with flying at the time it resolves. Creatures you begin to control later in the turn (or creatures that that gain flying later in the turn) won't get +5/+5.
* In a multiplayer game, if you leave the game after Mu Yanling's first ability resolves but before your next turn begins, its effect lasts until your next turn would have begun. It neither expires immediately nor lasts indefinitely.

Legendary Planeswalker — Yanling  

2  

+2: Until your next turn, up to one target creature gets -2/-0 and loses flying.  

−3: Create a 4/4 blue Elemental Bird creature token with flying.  

−8: You get an emblem with "Islands you control have 'T: Draw a card.'"


* Mu Yanling's first ability can target a creature that doesn't have flying. The creature just gets -2/-0.
* After Mu Yanling's first ability has resolved, the target creature will have flying again if another effect grants it flying.
* An Island is a land with the subtype Island, not any land with a mana ability that produces blue mana.
* Tapping an Island for mana is an activated ability. You can't activate that ability and also activate the ability it gains from Mu Yanling's emblem.
* In a multiplayer game, if you leave the game after Mu Yanling's first ability resolves but before your next turn begins, its effect lasts until your next turn would have begun. It neither expires immediately nor lasts indefinitely.

Mystic Forge  

4  

Artifact  

You may look at the top card of your library any time.  

You may cast the top card of your library if it's an artifact card or a colorless nonland card.  

T, Pay 1 life: Exile the top card of your library.


* Mystic Forge lets you look at the top card of your library whenever you want (with one restriction—see below), even if you don't have priority. This action doesn't use the stack. Knowing what that card is becomes part of the information you have access to, just like you can look at the cards in your hand.
* If the top card of your library changes while you're casting a spell, playing a land, or activating an ability, you can't look at the new top card until you finish doing so. This means that if you cast the top card of your library, you can't look at the next one until you're done paying for that spell.
* You must follow the normal timing permissions and restrictions of the spells you cast from your library.
* You still pay all costs for a spell you cast from your library, including additional costs. You may also pay alternative costs.

Destroy target artifact or enchantment. You gain 3 life.

Nightpack Ambusher  

2GG  

Creature — Wolf  

4/4  

Flash  

Other Wolves and Werewolves you control get +1/+1.  

At the beginning of your end step, if you didn't cast a spell this turn, create a 2/2 green Wolf creature token.


* A creature that's both a Wolf and a Werewolf gets only +1/+1 from Nightpack Ambusher's ability.
* Because damage remains marked on a creature until it's removed as the turn ends, nonlethal damage dealt to other Wolves and Werewolves you control may become lethal if Nightpack Ambusher leaves the battlefield during that turn.
* Nightpack Ambusher looks at the entire turn to see if you have cast a spell, even if Nightpack Ambusher wasn't on the battlefield when that spell was cast. Notably, you won't get a Wolf token during your end step if you cast Nightpack Ambusher during your turn.
* If you cast a spell that was countered, Nightpack Ambusher's last ability doesn't trigger.

Omnath, Locus of the Roil  

1GUR  

Legendary Creature — Elemental  

3/3  

When Omnath, Locus of the Roil enters the battlefield, it deals damage to any target equal to the number of Elementals you control.  

Whenever a land enters the battlefield under your control, put a +1/+1 counter on target Elemental you control. If you control eight or more lands, draw a card.


* The number of Elementals you control is counted as Omnath's first ability resolves. If Omnath is still on the battlefield, it will count itself.
* You may choose Omnath as the target of its own second ability.
* If the target Elemental is an illegal target by the time Omnath's second ability tries to resolve, the ability doesn't resolve. You don't draw a card if you control eight or more lands. If the target is legal but can't have a +1/+1 counter put on it (most likely because an opponent controls Blightbeetle), you do draw a card if you control eight or more lands.

Overcome  

3GG

Creatures you control get +2/+2 and gain trample until end of turn. *(They can deal excess combat damage to the player or planeswalker they're attacking.)*


* Overcome affects only creatures you control at the time it resolves. Creatures you begin to control later in the turn won't get +2/+2 or gain trample.

2G

3/2  

When Overgrowth Elemental enters the battlefield, put a +1/+1 counter on another target Elemental you control.  

Whenever another creature you control dies, you gain 1 life. If that creature was an Elemental, put a +1/+1 counter on Overgrowth Elemental.


* If a creature you control dies at the same time that your life total becomes 0 or less, you lose the game before Overgrowth Elemental's last ability can save you.
* If Overgrowth Elemental dies at the same time as one or more other creatures you control, Overgrowth Elemental's last ability triggers for each of those other creatures. You will gain 1 life for each of them, but if any of those creatures were Elementals, Overgrowth Elemental won't get a +1/+1 counter since it's already left the battlefield.

Prized Unicorn *(Welcome Deck only)*  

3G  

Creature — Unicorn  

2/2  

All creatures able to block Prized Unicorn do so.


* If a creature the defending player controls can't block Prized Unicorn for any reason (such as being tapped), then it doesn't block Prized Unicorn. If there's a cost associated with having a creature block Prized Unicorn, the defending player isn't forced to pay that cost, so it doesn't have to block.
* If more than one Prized Unicorn is attacking, creatures that could block must block one Prized Unicorn, but they don't all have to block the same Prized Unicorn.

U, T: Search your library for a card named Heart-Piercer Bow or Vial of Dragonfire, reveal it, put it into your hand, then shuffle your library.


* Activated abilities contain a colon. They're generally written "[Cost]: [Effect]." Some keyword abilities, such as equip, are activated abilities and will have colons in their reminder text. You can't spend mana added by this ability to pay costs of triggered abilities of artifacts such as the first ability of Chandra's Regulator.
* The mana generated by Renowned Weaponsmith's first ability can't be spent to activate abilities of artifact sources that aren't on the battlefield.

![Repeated Reverberation](https://media.wizards.com/2019/m20/en_HPeoeeD4M2.png)


Repeated Reverberation  

2RR  

Instant  

When you next cast an instant spell, cast a sorcery spell, or activate a loyalty ability this turn, copy that spell or ability twice. You may choose new targets for the copies.


* If you cast one Repeated Reverberation after another, you'll copy the second Repeated Reverberation twice. Each resolves, creating three delayed triggered abilities. The next spell you cast or loyalty ability you activate after that will be copied six times. If that spell is also a Repeated Reverberation, the following spell or ability will be copied fourteen times. A fourth Repeated Reverberation will copy the next spell or ability thirty times. Reverberations repeated beyond that shall be left as an exercise for the reader.
* Repeated Reverberation's ability will copy any instant or sorcery spell or loyalty ability, not just one with targets.
* Copies are created even if the spell or ability that caused Repeated Reverberation's ability to trigger has been countered by the time that ability resolves. The copies resolve before the original spell or ability.
* The copies will have the same targets as the spell or ability they're copying unless you choose new ones. You may change any number of the targets, including all of them or none of them. The new targets must be legal.
* If the spell that's copied is modal (that is, it says "Choose one —" or the like), the copies will have the same mode or modes. You can't choose different ones.
* If the spell or ability that's copied has an X whose value was determined as it was cast, the copies will have the same value of X.
* You can't choose to pay any additional costs for the copies. However, effects based on any additional costs that were paid for the original spell are copied as though those same costs were paid for the copies too.
* The copies made by Repeated Reverberation's ability are created on the stack, so they're not "cast" or "activated." Abilities that trigger when a player casts a spell or activate an ability don't trigger.
* Copying a loyalty ability doesn't add or remove loyalty counters from any object.

Legendary Creature — Angel  

5/4  

Flying  

Other multicolored creatures you control get +1/+0.  

Whenever another multicolored creature you control dies, return it to its owner's hand at the beginning of the next end step.


* If a multicolored creature you control leaves the graveyard after it dies but before the delayed triggered ability resolves, it will not return to its owner's hand.
* If an effect causes a non-multicolored creature to become multicolored and that creature dies, the non-multicolored card will return to its owner's hand.
* If Rienne dies at the same time as one or more other multicolored creatures you control, its last ability triggers for each of those creatures.
* If Rienne leaves the battlefield after its ability has triggered but before the next end step, its delayed triggered ability will still return the card.

Whenever Risen Reef or another Elemental enters the battlefield under your control, look at the top card of your library. If it's a land card, you may put it onto the battlefield tapped. If you don't put the card onto the battlefield, put it into your hand.


* If you put the card into your hand, you don't have to reveal it. You also don't have to tell your opponent whether it's a nonland card or a land card you decided not to put onto the battlefield tapped.

Rotting Regisaur  

2B  

Creature — Zombie Dinosaur  

7/6  

At the beginning of your upkeep, discard a card.


* Because the upkeep step is before the draw step, you discard for Rotting Regisaur's triggered ability before you draw a card for your turn.
* If you have no cards in hand when Rotting Regisaur's triggered ability resolves, you simply don't discard any cards. There's no penalty for being unable to do so.

Rubblebelt Recluse *(Welcome Deck only)*  

4R  

Creature — Ogre Berserker  

6/5  

Rubblebelt Recluse attacks each combat if able.


* If Rubblebelt Recluse can't attack for any reason (such as being tapped or having come under that player's control that turn), then it doesn't attack. If there's a cost associated with having it attack, its controller isn't forced to pay that cost, so it doesn't have to attack in that case either.

* If you cast a spell that was countered, you can't cast another spell during the same turn.

Salvager of Ruin  

3  

Artifact Creature — Construct  

2/1  

Sacrifice Salvager of Ruin: Choose target permanent card in your graveyard that was put there from the battlefield this turn. Return it to your hand.


* Because targets are chosen for activated abilities before costs (such as "Sacrifice Salvager of Ruin") are paid, Salvager of Ruin's ability can't target itself.
* A permanent card is an artifact, creature, enchantment, land, or planeswalker card.
* Salvager of Ruin's ability can target a permanent card in your graveyard that was put there from the battlefield before Salvager of Ruin entered the battlefield during the same turn.
* Permanent spells that were countered earlier in the turn never entered the battlefield, so they are not legal targets for Salvager of Ruin's ability.

Flying  

At the beginning of your end step, if an opponent lost life this turn, put a +1/+1 counter on Savage Gorger. *(Damage causes loss of life.)*


* Savage Gorger looks at your entire turn to determine whether an opponent lost any life. It doesn't matter how many opponents lost life or how much life they lost, only whether any of them did. It also doesn't matter whether Savage Gorger was on the battlefield when they lost life.
* It doesn't matter whether an opponent has less life than they started the turn with. If a player lost 4 life but also gained 6 life, that player still lost 4 life.
* A player loses life if they pay life.

When Scampering Scorcher enters the battlefield, create two 1/1 red Elemental creature tokens. Elementals you control gain haste until end of turn. *(They can attack and T this turn.)*


* Scampering Scorcher's ability affects only Elementals you control as the ability resolves (after creating the Elemental tokens). This means that those tokens and Scampering Scorcher itself will gain haste. Elementals you begin to control later in the turn won't gain haste.

3/3  

When Scholar of the Ages enters the battlefield, return up to two target instant and/or sorcery cards from your graveyard to your hand.

Whenever Scorch Spitter attacks, it deals 1 damage to the player or planeswalker it's attacking.

* You must choose one or more of the five colors of *Magic* while resolving Scuttlemutt's last ability. You can't choose "artifact," "colorless," or "chartreuse."
* The target creature has only the colors Scuttlemutt gives it—Scuttlemutt's ability overwrites any previous colors the creature had.
* In the Commander variant, the color identities of cards are determined as the game begins. Changing the colors of a player's commander doesn't affect its color identity or the cards that can be legally included in the deck.

Whenever a creature enters the battlefield under your control, scry 1. *(Look at the top card of your library. You may put that card on the bottom of your library.)*  

Whenever you cast a spell that targets a creature you control, draw a card.


* If multiple creatures enter the battlefield under your control simultaneously, you'll scry 1 for each of those creatures. You won't look at more than one card from your library at once.
* Season of Growth's last ability resolves before the spell that caused it to trigger. It resolves even if that spell is countered.
* Season of Growth's last ability triggers when you cast a spell that has multiple targets, as long as at least one of those targets is a creature you control. It doesn't trigger multiple times if you cast a spell that targets a creature you control multiple times or that targets multiple creatures you control.

Sephara, Sky's Blade  

4WWW  

Legendary Creature — Angel  

7/7  

You may pay W and tap four untapped creatures you control with flying rather than pay this spell's mana cost.  

Flying, lifelink  

Other creatures you control with flying have indestructible. *(Damage and effects that say "destroy" don't destroy them.)*


* To pay Sephara's alternative cost, you may tap any untapped creatures you control with flying, including ones you haven't controlled continuously since the beginning of your most recent turn.
* To determine the total cost of a spell, start with the mana cost or alternative cost you're paying (such as Sephara's alternative cost), add any cost increases, then apply any cost reductions. The converted mana cost of the spell remains unchanged, no matter what the total cost to cast it was.
* Because damage remains marked on a creature until it's removed as the turn ends, lethal damage dealt to other creatures you control with flying may cause them to be destroyed if Sephara leaves the battlefield during that turn.

* A spell or ability that counters spells can still target Shifting Ceratops. When that spell or ability resolves, Shifting Ceratops won't be countered, but any additional effects of that spell or ability will still happen.
* Multiple instances of reach, trample, and/or haste on the same creature are redundant.

Skyknight Vanguard  

RW  

Creature — Human Knight  

1/2  

Flying  

Whenever Skyknight Vanguard attacks, create a 1/1 white Soldier creature token that's tapped and attacking.


* You choose which player or planeswalker the token is attacking. It doesn't have to be attacking the same player or planeswalker that Skyknight Vanguard is attacking.
* Although the token is an attacking creature, it was never declared as an attacking creature. This means that abilities that trigger whenever a creature attacks won't trigger when the token enters the battlefield attacking.

Sleep Paralysis  

3U  

Enchantment — Aura  

Enchant creature  

When Sleep Paralysis enters the battlefield, tap enchanted creature.  

Enchanted creature doesn't untap during its controller's untap step.


* If the target creature is an illegal target by the time Sleep Paralysis tries to resolve, the spell doesn't resolve. It won't enter the battlefield, so its ability won't trigger.

Sorin, Imperious Bloodlord  

2B  

Legendary Planeswalker — Sorin  

4  

+1: Target creature you control gains deathtouch and lifelink until end of turn. If it's a Vampire, put a +1/+1 counter on it.  

+1: You may sacrifice a Vampire. When you do, Sorin, Imperious Bloodlord deals 3 damage to any target and you gain 3 life.  

−3: You may put a Vampire creature card from your hand onto the battlefield.


* Multiple instances of deathtouch and/or lifelink on the same creature are redundant.
* Sorin's second ability goes on the stack without a target. While that ability resolves, you may sacrifice a Vampire. When you do, the reflexive triggered ability triggers and you pick a target to be dealt damage. This is different from effects that say "If you do . . ." in that players may take actions after you've sacrificed the creature but before damage is dealt.
* If the target of the reflexive triggered ability is an illegal target as that ability tries to resolve, it doesn't resolve. You won't gain 3 life.

+1: Up to one target creature gets +2/+0 until end of turn.  

−2: Sorin, Vampire Lord deals 4 damage to any target. You gain 4 life.  

−8: Until end of turn, each Vampire you control gains "T: Gain control of target creature."


* If the chosen target is an illegal target by the time Sorin's second ability tries to resolve, the ability doesn't resolve. You won't gain 4 life.
* The control-change effect from ability granted by Sorin's last ability lasts indefinitely. It doesn't wear off during the cleanup step, and it doesn't expire if Sorin or a Vampire whose ability was activated leaves the battlefield. In a multiplayer game, it does expire if you leave the game.

![Tale's End](https://media.wizards.com/2019/m20/en_HlBPJXnir2.png)


Tale's End  

1U  

Instant  

Counter target activated ability, triggered ability, or legendary spell.


* Tale's End can't target an activated or triggered mana ability. An activated mana ability is one that adds mana to a player's mana pool as it resolves, doesn't have a target, and isn't a loyalty ability. A triggered mana ability is one that adds mana to a player's mana pool and triggers on an activated mana ability.
* Activated abilities are written in the form "[Cost]: [Effect]." Some keyword abilities (such as equip) are activated abilities and will have colons in their reminder texts, if applicable.
* Triggered abilities use the word "when," "whenever," or "at." They're often written as "[Trigger condition], [effect]." Some keyword abilities are triggered abilities and will have "when," "whenever," or "at" in their reminder text.
* Abilities that create replacement effects, such as a permanent entering the battlefield tapped or with counters on it, can't be targeted. Abilities that apply "as [this creature] enters the battlefield" are also replacement effects and can't be targeted.
* If you counter a delayed triggered ability that triggered at the beginning of the "next" occurrence of a specified step or phase, that ability won't trigger again the following time that step or phase occurs.

Tectonic Rift  

3R  

Sorcery  

Destroy target land. Creatures without flying can't block this turn.


* If the target land is an illegal target by the time Tectonic Rift tries to resolve, the spell doesn't resolve. Creatures without flying will be able to block as normal. If the target is legal but not destroyed (most likely because it has indestructible), creatures without flying will be unable to block.
* Because it doesn't modify the characteristics of creatures, Tectonic Rift can affect creatures that enter the battlefield or lose flying after the spell resolves, and it will stop affecting creatures that gain flying.

![Thirsting Bloodlord](https://media.wizards.com/2019/m20/en_barKYTULgo.png)


Thirsting Bloodlord *(Planeswalker Deck only)*  

2BB  

Creature — Vampire  

3/3  

Other Vampires you control get +1/+1.


* Because damage remains marked on a creature until it's removed as the turn ends, nonlethal damage dealt to other Vampires you control may become lethal if Thirsting Bloodlord leaves the battlefield during that turn.

![Thought Distortion](https://media.wizards.com/2019/m20/en_7Dr5KWAk0C.png)


Thought Distortion  

4BB  

Sorcery  

This spell can't be countered.  

Target opponent reveals their hand. Exile all noncreature, nonland cards from that player's hand and graveyard.


* A spell or ability that counters spells can still target Thought Distortion. When that spell or ability resolves, Thought Distortion won't be countered, but any additional effects of that spell or ability will still happen.
* If the target player is an illegal target by the time Thought Distortion tries to resolve, the spell won't resolve and will be put into its owner's graveyard with no effect. This is true even though it can't be countered.

Thunderkin Awakener  

1R  

Creature — Elemental Shaman  

1/2  

Haste  

Whenever Thunderkin Awakener attacks, choose target Elemental creature card in your graveyard with toughness less than Thunderkin Awakener's toughness. Return that card to the battlefield tapped and attacking. Sacrifice it at the beginning of the next end step.


* The target card must have lesser toughness both as Thunderkin Awakener attacks and as its triggered ability resolves. Other abilities that trigger whenever Thunderkin Awakener attacks can't raise its toughness in time to allow the ability to target cards with greater toughness.
* If Thunderkin Awakener leaves the battlefield after it has attacked but before its triggered ability resolves, use its toughness as it last existed on the battlefield to determine whether the card is still a legal target.
* You choose which player or planeswalker the returned creature is attacking. It doesn't have to be attacking the same player or planeswalker that Thunderkin Awakener is attacking.
* Although the returned creature is an attacking creature, it was never declared as an attacking creature. This means that abilities that trigger whenever a creature attacks (such as that of Thunderkin Awakener itself) won't trigger when it enters the battlefield attacking.
* If the new creature leaves the battlefield before the end step, that card remains in its current zone. It won't be sacrificed.

Lifelink *(Damage dealt by this creature also causes you to gain that much life.)*  

Whenever Tomebound Lich enters the battlefield or deals combat damage to a player, draw a card, then discard a card.


* You draw a card and discard a card all while Tomebound Lich's triggered ability is resolving. Nothing can happen between the two, and no player may choose to take actions.

![Twinblade Paladin](https://media.wizards.com/2019/m20/en_UYIBgJ4R1A.png)


Twinblade Paladin *(Planeswalker Deck only)*  

3W  

Creature — Human Knight  

3/3  

Whenever you gain life, put a +1/+1 counter on Twinblade Paladin.  

As long as you have 25 or more life, Twinblade Paladin has double strike. *(It deals both first-strike and regular combat damage.)*


* The first ability of Twinblade Paladin triggers just once for each life-gaining event, whether it's 1 life from Impassioned Orator or 4 life from Dawning Angel. If you gain an amount of life "for each" of something or "equal to the number" of something, that life is gained as one event and the ability of Twinblade Paladin triggers only once.
* If Twinblade Paladin is dealt lethal damage at the same time that you gain life, it won't receive a counter from its ability in time to save it.
* Each creature with lifelink dealing combat damage causes a separate life-gaining event. For example, if two creatures you control with lifelink deal combat damage at the same time, Twinblade Paladin's first ability will trigger twice. However, if a single creature you control with lifelink deals combat damage to multiple creatures, players, and/or planeswalkers at the same time (perhaps because it has trample or was blocked by more than one creature), the ability will trigger only once.
* If you're dealt first-strike combat damage that brings your life total below 25, Twinblade Paladin will immediately lose double strike. It won't deal regular combat damage unless you bring your life total back to 25 or more before the regular combat damage step.
* If Twinblade Paladin gains double strike after combat damage has already been dealt (most likely because a creature with lifelink dealt combat damage), Twinblade Paladin will deal only regular combat damage.
* In a Two-Headed Giant game, life gained by your teammate won't cause the first ability to trigger, even though it caused your team's life total to increase.
* In a Two-Headed Giant game, Twinblade Paladin has double strike as long as your team has 25 or more life.

When Undead Servant enters the battlefield, create a 2/2 black Zombie creature token for each card named Undead Servant in your graveyard.


* Count the number of Undead Servants in your graveyard as the ability resolves to determine how many tokens to put onto the battlefield. If Undead Servant dies in response to its own triggered ability and is in your graveyard as that ability resolves, it will count toward the number of Zombies you get.

![Unholy Indenture](https://media.wizards.com/2019/m20/en_gAGCDnnOcT.png)


Unholy Indenture  

2B  

Enchantment — Aura  

Enchant creature  

When enchanted creature dies, return that card to the battlefield under your control with a +1/+1 counter on it.


* Once Unholy Indenture returns the creature, it's considered a new object with no relation to the object that it was. Auras that were attached to it won't return to the battlefield (including Unholy Indenture itself). Equipment that was attached to it will remain unattached. Any counters that were on it won't be put on the new creature.
* You control the returned creature, regardless of who controlled it before it died.
* If the returned creature enters with any other counters, it enters with those counters plus an additional +1/+1 counter.
* If Unholy Indenture enchants a token, it won't be returned to the battlefield when it dies.
* If multiple players each control an Unholy Indenture attached to one creature, the player who will control the returned creature is the last player in turn order from the player whose turn it is at the time the creature dies. In a two-player game, this means the player whose turn it is not. In a multiplayer game, this means the player closest to the right of the player whose turn it is.
* In a multiplayer game, if a player leaves the game, all cards that player owns leave as well. If you leave the game, the creature you control from Unholy Indenture's effect is exiled.

Draw a card if an opponent has cast a blue or black spell this turn. Spells you control can't be countered this turn. You and permanents you control gain hexproof from blue and from black until end of turn. *(You and they can't be the targets of blue or black spells or abilities your opponents control.)*


* Veil of Summer has no effect until it resolves. It can be countered.
* If your opponents have cast more than one blue or black spell, you still draw only one card as Veil of Summer resolves.
* A spell or ability that counters spells can still target your spells after Veil of Summer resolves. When that spell or ability resolves, your spell won't be countered, but any additional effects of the countering spell or ability will still happen.

4/4  

Whenever you lose life for the first time each turn, put a +1/+1 counter on Vengeful Warchief. *(Damage causes loss of life.)*


* You put only one +1/+1 counter on Vengeful Warchief, no matter how much life you lost.
* A player loses life if they pay life.
* If you pay life to cast a spell or activate an ability, you don't put a +1/+1 counter on Vengeful Warchief until after you've finished casting that spell or activating that ability. You put the counter on Vengeful Warchief before that spell or ability resolves.
* If Vengeful Warchief comes under your control after you've already lost life in a turn, its ability can't trigger during that turn.

Vivien, Arkbow Ranger  

1GGG  

Legendary Planeswalker — Vivien  

4  

+1: Distribute two +1/+1 counters among up to two target creatures. They gain trample until end of turn.  

−3: Target creature you control deals damage equal to its power to target creature or planeswalker.  

−5: You may choose a creature card you own from outside the game, reveal it, and put it into your hand.


* You choose how the counters will be distributed as you activate Vivien's first ability. Each target creature must be assigned at least one counter. This means that you can't put two counters on one creature but give two creatures trample.
* You can activate Vivien's first ability without choosing any target creatures. The counters won't be put on anything. This is a change from previous rules regarding distributing counters.
* If one of the two target creatures becomes an illegal target in response to Vivien's first ability, the +1/+1 counter that would have been put on that creature is lost. It can't be put on the legal target.
* If either target is an illegal target as Vivien's second ability tries to resolve, the creature you control won't deal damage.
* In a casual game, a card you choose from outside the game comes from your personal collection. In a tournament event, a card you choose from outside the game must come from your sideboard. You may look at your sideboard at any time.

* If there are no creature cards in your library as Vivien's second ability resolves, you reveal your library then put it back in a random order.

Vivien's Crocodile *(Planeswalker Deck only)*  

2G  

Creature — Crocodile Spirit  

3/3  

Vivien's Crocodile gets +1/+1 as long as you control a Vivien planeswalker.


* Because damage remains marked on a creature until it's removed as the turn ends, nonlethal damage dealt to Vivien's Crocodile may become lethal if your Vivien planeswalker leaves the battlefield during that turn.

When Voracious Hydra enters the battlefield, choose one —  

• Double the number of +1/+1 counters on Voracious Hydra.  

• Voracious Hydra fights target creature you don't control.


* If the target of Voracious Hydra's second mode isn't a legal target as the ability resolves, or if Voracious Hydra has left the battlefield, neither creature will deal or be dealt damage. The ability won't change to the first mode if the target is illegal.
* Because fighting isn't combat damage, trample has no effect during the fight.

GGGGG: Untap target land you control. It becomes a 5/5 Elemental creature with haste. It's still a land. *(This effect lasts as long as that land remains on the battlefield.)*


* Wakeroot Elemental's ability can target a land that's already a creature or a land that's already untapped. The ability will untap it if possible and set its base power and toughness to 5/5. Any counters or effects modifying that creature's power and toughness will continue to apply, and any effects that set the creature's power and toughness will be overwritten.

Warden of Evos Isle

2/2  

Flying  

Creature spells with flying you cast cost 1 less to cast.


* A creature spell that doesn't have flying won't cost less even if an effect will cause the creature to have flying once on the battlefield. This is also true if the creature spell itself has an ability that gives it flying once on the battlefield under certain conditions, even if those conditions are true.
* The last ability of Warden of Evos Isle can't reduce the colored mana requirement of a creature spell with flying.

Wildfire Elemental *(Planeswalker Deck only)*  

2RR  

Creature — Elemental  

3/3  

Whenever an opponent is dealt noncombat damage, creatures you control get +1/+0 until end of turn.


* Combat damage is the damage that's dealt automatically by attacking and blocking creatures. Any other damage is noncombat damage, even if it's dealt during a combat phase by an attacking or blocking creature.
* Wildfire Elemental's ability triggers once for each event in which an opponent is dealt noncombat damage, regardless of how much damage that player is dealt.
* Wildfire Elemental's ability affects only creatures you control at the time it resolves. Creatures you begin to control later in the turn won't get +1/+0.
* In a multiplayer game, if a source deals damage to multiple opponents at the same time, Wildfire Elemental's ability will trigger that many times.

When Wolfkin Bond enters the battlefield, create a 2/2 green Wolf creature token.  

Enchanted creature gets +2/+2.


* You need a creature for Wolfkin Bond to target as you cast it. It can't enter the battlefield attached to the Wolf token it will create.
* If the target creature is an illegal target by the time Wolfkin Bond tries to resolve, the spell doesn't resolve. It won't enter the battlefield, so its ability won't trigger.

When Wolfrider's Saddle enters the battlefield, create a 2/2 green Wolf creature token, then attach Wolfrider's Saddle to it.  

Equipped creature gets +1/+1 and can't be blocked by more than one creature.  

Equip 3 *(3: Attach to target creature you control. Equip only as a sorcery.)*


* The Wolf token that you create enters the battlefield as a 2/2 creature. Any abilities that trigger when a creature with a certain power enters the battlefield will see the token enter as a 2/2 creature before Wolfrider's Saddle becomes attached.
* No player may take any actions between the time you create the Wolf token and the time Wolfrider's Saddle becomes attached to it.
* If the equipped creature has menace, it can't be blocked at all.

Creature — Elf Scout  

2/2  

Whenever one or more tokens enter the battlefield under your control, put that many +1/+1 counters on Woodland Champion.


* The number of +1/+1 counters you put on Woodland Champion is the number of tokens that entered the battlefield under your control, even if some or all of them leave the battlefield before the triggered ability resolves.

![Yarok, the Desecrated](https://media.wizards.com/2019/m20/en_JdyCz86JOo.png)


Yarok, the Desecrated  

2BGU  

Legendary Creature — Elemental Horror  

3/5  

Deathtouch, lifelink  

If a permanent entering the battlefield causes a triggered ability of a permanent you control to trigger, that ability triggers an additional time.


* Yarok affects a permanent's own enters-the-battlefield triggered abilities as well as other triggered abilities that trigger when that permanent enters the battlefield. Such triggered abilities start with "when" or "whenever."
* Replacement effects are unaffected by Yarok's ability. For example, a creature that enters the battlefield with one +1/+1 counter on it won't receive an additional +1/+1 counter.
* Abilities that apply "as [this creature] enters the battlefield," such as choosing a color with Diamond Knight, are also unaffected.
* You don't need to control the permanent entering the battlefield, only the permanent that has the triggered ability.
* Yarok's effect doesn't copy the triggered ability; it just causes the ability to trigger twice. Any choices made as you put the ability onto the stack, such as modes and targets, are made separately for each instance of the ability. Any choices made on resolution, such as whether to put counters on a permanent, are also made individually.
* If you somehow control two Yaroks, a permanent entering the battlefield causes abilities to trigger three times, not four. A third Yarok causes abilities to trigger four times, a fourth causes abilities to trigger five times, and so on.
* If a permanent entering the battlefield at the same time as Yarok (including Yarok itself) causes a triggered ability of a permanent you control to trigger, that ability triggers an additional time.
* If a triggered ability is linked to a second ability, additional instances of that triggered ability are also linked to that second ability. If the second ability refers to "the exiled card," it refers to all cards exiled by instances of the triggered ability.
* In some cases involving linked abilities, an ability requires information about "the exiled card." When this happens, the ability gets multiple answers. If these answers are being used to determine the value of a variable, the sum is used. For example, if Elite Arcanist's enters-the-battlefield ability triggers twice, two cards are exiled. The value of X in the activation cost of Elite Arcanist's other ability is the sum of the two cards' converted mana costs. As the ability resolves, you create copies of both cards and can cast none, one, or both of the copies in any order.

4/4  

When Yarok's Wavecrasher enters the battlefield, return another creature you control to its owner's hand.


* If you control no other creatures when the triggered ability resolves, you simply don't return anything. There's no penalty for being unable to do so.
