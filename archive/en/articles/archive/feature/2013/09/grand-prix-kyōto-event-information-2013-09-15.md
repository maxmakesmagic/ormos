![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/promo/grandprix_2013_2.jpg)*Get your promo card by playing in the Grand Prix (while supplies last).*Kyōto is truly the heart of Japan, having been the center for politics, economy, and culture as the capital of the nation from 794 to 1868. Some of the still-functioning shrines and temples in the city actually date back to this period, all of them among the seventeen World Heritage sites located here.


 Kyōto also has a long history associated with **Magic**. It was here that Tsuyoshi Fujita launched his career with a win using Necro-Donate at Grand Prix Kyōto 2000, Yūya Watanabe splashed onto the scene as an amateur with his win at Grand Prix Kyōto 2007, and Gabriel Nassif's epic draw of [Cruel Ultimatum](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cruel+Ultimatum) for the win at Pro Tour Kyōto 2009 will forever be part of the annals of the game. 


Come join us in Kyōto this November to write a new page in history with the first team event in Japan in more than seven years. This ancient city, renowned for its hospitality and gorgeous sights, awaits you.



 *The **Magic: The Gathering**  Grand Prix tournament series is a great reason to step up your game, catch up with old friends, meet some new ones, and play **Magic**. Grand Prix tournaments are world-wide open events that allow all **Magic** players to participate and experience the thrill of a large-scale competition over three days. In addition to cash prizes, a high Planeswalker Points multiplier, and exclusive foil promo cards for participants, the Grand Prix features a host of other activities, including side events and artist signings. Side-event tournaments begin Friday, with the Grand Prix main event running Saturday and Sunday.

### Artist Information


 Scheduled artists for Grand Prix Kyōto are Tyler Jacobson, Ryan Pancoast, and Matt Stewart. 


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/gpkyo13/tylerjacobson.jpg)
**Tyler Jacobson**



 During his youth, Tyler Jacobson was heavily inspired by the science fiction and fantasy films of the late 1970s through mid 1990s. This led him down the road to creating imaginative imagery and eventually he ended up at the Academy of Art University in San Francisco California. After receiving an MFA in Illustration he soon began working for Wizards of the Coast, creating illustrations for Dungeons & Dragons. A few years later he managed to get noticed by the art directors at **Magic: The Gathering**, a game whose imagery also provided inspiration for his early art education and ultimately helped him decide to become an illustrator. 


Currently he works as a freelance illustrator in Olympia, Washington, creating fantasy illustration as well as non-fantasy for a variety of clients. He still holds a deep love for film and the magic of the cinema when he isn't busy painting and drawing heroes and monsters. 


 You can see Tyler's work at his website, [www.tylerjacobsonart.com](http://www.tylerjacobsonart.com) as well as on his blog, [tylerjacobson.blogspot.com/](http://tylerjacobson.blogspot.com/).

**Ryan Pancoast**



 Ryan Pancoast was born and raised in Connecticut where his favorite childhood toy was a pad of sketch paper. After earning a BFA in Illustration from Rochester Institute of Technology (Rochester, New York), he tried a career in the editorial field before landing unexpectedly in the fantasy genre. Ryan started painting exclusively in oils in 2008 and soon thereafter started working for **Magic: The Gathering**, starting with ***Magic** 2010* . He still considers himself a student, learning through trial-and-error and inspired by the talent of other **Magic** artists. Ryan lives in Providence, Rhode Island with his wife Shelly and their two cats.

**Matt Stewart**



 A freelance illustrator and painter, Matt's love for fantasy started with reading J.R.R. Tolkien and playing a lot of Dungeons & Dragons. After graduating from Parsons School of Design in 1999, Matt has worked in the gaming and publishing fields, including such clients as Wizards of the Coast, Blizzard Entertainment, Night Shade Books, and Tor Books. Matt's first cards were for the *Future Sight* set, and he has illustrated over 70 **Magic: The Gathering** cards since. Matt lives in Runnemede, N.J. along with his wife Gina, who is also an artist.
