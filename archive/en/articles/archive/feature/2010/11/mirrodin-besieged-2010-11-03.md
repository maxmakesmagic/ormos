### *A World Divided*


In the *Mirrodin Besieged* set, the Phyrexian assault on the metallic plane of Mirrodin intensifies. The Mirran resistance rallies to survive and overcome. Both sides bring the full might of their arsenals to bear. Not only does this set have more of what made the *Scars of Mirrodin* set great—incredible artifacts, poison, Equipment, Myr—but it also has some innovative and deadly new tricks. And again, nearly every card in the set has a symbol of its allegiance in its text box.


As the fate of one world hangs in the balance, **Magic** players in our world get to enjoy all the wicked weapons this war has to offer. Which side has earned your allegiance?
