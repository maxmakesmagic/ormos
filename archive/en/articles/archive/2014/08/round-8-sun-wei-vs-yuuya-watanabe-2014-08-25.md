Yuuya Watanabe has been on the bubble before. In fact, he is also rather good at coming back from the clutches of death to win the entire tournament outright. Not that he is envious of his current predicament (5-2), but his opponent Sun Wei certainly wasn't happy to be paired against the Japanese superstar either.


Watanabe has chosen Mono Black Devotion as his weapon of choice this weekend, while Sun opted to play Mono Blue Devotion instead.


**Game One**


Sun opened with a seemingly aggressive start involving triple [Cloudfin Raptor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloudfin+Raptor) and double [Mutavault](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mutavault). There was one problem though, Sun was stuck on just a single blue mana.


When Watanabe used [Thoughtseize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtseize) to remove [Frostburn Weird](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Frostburn+Weird) and [Lifebane Zombie](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lifebane+Zombie) to exile [Judge's Familiar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Judge%27s+Familiar), the trio of 0/1 raptors looked really awkward indeed.


Sun was forced to use [Rapid Hybridization](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rapid+Hybridization) to kill [Pack Rat](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pack+Rat)s, but Watanabe was ready with a replacement. Failing to draw a second Island, Sun conceded with two [Frostburn Weird](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Frostburn+Weird)s in his grip. Weird game (pun intended).

*Sun Wei stumbles on a rather awkward draw, involving three [Cloudfin Raptor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloudfin+Raptor)s which were unable to evolve.* 

**Sun Wei 0 â€“ Yuuya Watanabe 1**



**Game Two**


This time, Sun failed to draw a one-drop but least he was able to deploy [Frostburn Weird](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Frostburn+Weird), [Tidebinder Mage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tidebinder+Mage) and [Nightveil Specter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nightveil+Specter), now that he had access to three Islands. Watanabe's draw was considerably slower, and could only manage [Underworld Connections](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Underworld+Connections) and [Desecration Demon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Desecration+Demon).


Sun attacked with his trio before destroying the demon with [Rapid Hybridization](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rapid+Hybridization) after it had been declared as a blocker. Watanabe took a light scratch, but he replaced the fallen demon with another, keeping Sun's entire army at bay.


Watanabe continued to draw cards with two [Underworld Connections](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Underworld+Connections) but Sun wanted his fingers in the "card advantage pie" too. After casting [Bident of Thassa](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bident+of+Thassa), he sacrificed [Mutavault](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mutavault) to tap down [Desecration Demon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Desecration+Demon), allowing [Nightveil Specter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nightveil+Specter) to attack unopposed. This granted him a Swamp, useful for casting any of Watanabe's future spells.


However, Watanabe put a stop to that plan. He attacked with [Desecration Demon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Desecration+Demon) for 7 and drained Sun for 8 more with [Gray Merchant of Asphodel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gray+Merchant+of+Asphodel). [Cyclonic Rift](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cyclonic+Rift) could only delay his death. Ignoring the [Mutavault](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mutavault)s still in play, Grey Merchant would enter play for yet another time seal the deal regardless.

*Watanabe keeps things in check with a pair of [Desecration Demon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Desecration+Demon)s and [Underworld Connections](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Underworld+Connections).* 

**Yuuya Watanabe defeats Sun Wei and moves to 6-2.**
