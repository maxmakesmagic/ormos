Showcase Qualifiers

Each Showcase Qualifier is a scheduled Swiss-style event with a Top 8 playoff. The winner of each Showcase Qualifier earns a spot in the final Showcase event and a chance to earn their share of $70,000 and an upcoming Premier Event invitation.


Showcase Qualifiers are scheduled as follows:
