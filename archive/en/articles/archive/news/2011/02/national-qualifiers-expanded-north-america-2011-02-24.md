In Wizards of the Coast’s continuing efforts to build strong **Magic: The Gathering**  player communities in hobby stores, we are changing how National Qualifiers in the United States and Canada will be run in 2011. 


Starting this year, Nationals Qualifiers in the U.S. and Canada will be run by both Professional Tournament Organizers and Wizards Play Network Advanced-level stores. North American National Qualifiers will also be held across multiple weekends.


On April 16, “National Qualifier – Regional” tournaments will be held in 17 cities in the United States and 4 cities in Canada. Each of these tournaments will offer 8 invitations to their respective country’s National Championship. These tournaments will be run by Professional Tournament Organizers, in a similar fashion to previous National Qualifiers.


On April 23-24, and April 30-May 1, select WPN Advanced-level stores in the United States and Canada will run “National Qualifier – WPN” tournaments. Each of these tournaments will offer 1 invitation to their respective country’s National Championship. Approximately 165 stores in the United States and 45 stores in Canada will be able to run a National Qualifier tournament.


Additional information regarding National Qualifiers in the United States, Canada, and other countries will be posted in the coming months.
