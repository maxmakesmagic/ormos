This week's "Sketches" looks at one of the new *Legions* "Muses," [Seedborn Muse](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seedborn+Muse) by Adam Rex. Adam has been doing **Magic** art since *Mirage*, so he is an old hand at it.

### 1. Art Description

These are the instructions given to the artist:

"Color: Green Location: Krosan Forest.  
 Action: Show a beautiful female Spirit, somewhat ghostlike, in the Krosan Forest surrounded by large and vicious looking Krosan plants. She is walking past the plants unconcerned."

### 2. Sketch

This is the preliminary sketch submitted by Adam.

The internal Creative team here felt that Adam's first sketch was a little too dainty and delicate for what looked to be a powerful card, so they asked him to make some slight changes. His updated sketch satisfied all involved parties.

### 3. Final Art

Here is a large version of the final piece. The plants aren't quite so noticeable now because the background is muted. The focus is clearly on the Muse.

### 4. Card

Finally, here is the card as you'll see it at the prerelease.
