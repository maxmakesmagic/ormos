![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/GPMON01/696.jpg)Michael Turian wins the die roll and chooses to play. Please remember from the draft coverage, Michael has a Blue-Black deck with [Aboshan, Cephalid Emperor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aboshan%2C+Cephalid+Emperor) and three [Psychatog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psychatog)s. Goochie (no one calls him Walter) drafted a Green-Red deck with a bunch of burn and fat green creatures.


Goochie comes out with a [Wild Mongrel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Mongrel) and Turian answers with one of his many [Psychatog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psychatog)s. After casting [Rabid Elephant](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rabid+Elephant), [Werebear](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Werebear), and [Springing Tiger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Springing+Tiger), Turian gets in a discard fight with his [Psychatog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psychatog) against the [Wild Mongrel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Mongrel). After discarding two cards each, Turian casts [Skeletal Scrying](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skeletal+Scrying) for Four, putting himself at 8. Then Mike continues to discard for [Psychatog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psychatog), eventually winning the discard war after five cards and removing cards from his graveyard.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/GPMON01/697.jpg)Goochie keeps checking Mike's life total. There's a [Scorching Missile](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scorching+Missile) in Goochie's hand and he's just drawn into a [Liquid Fire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Liquid+Fire). Goochie calls a judge over for a ruling and leaves the table. Another judge, Cyril Grillon, comes over to watch the board. 


"How many cards do I have in my hand?" He asks.  

"None," says Turian.   

Cyril looks again at the board, sees Turian's two [Psychatog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psychatog)s and Emperor, and at his own side of the board, and then says, "I scoop."


The spectators giggle a little and Goochie returns. Goochie casts [Liquid Fire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Liquid+Fire) on Turian's Emperor, but Turian responds by [Repel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Repel)ling it to the top of his library. The spell counters itself because the target was removed, and Goochie's last hope to burn Mike out is lost.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/GPMON01/695.jpg)Game two Goochie decides to play and only draws mountains for the first five turns, and he's sitting with a lonely [Ember Beast](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ember+Beast) on the board, with a bunch of green cards in his hand. During the course of the first five turns, Mike [Aether Burst](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aether+Burst)s and Repels this poor [Ember Beast](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ember+Beast). 


Goochie finally draws a Forest and casts [Rabid Elephant](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rabid+Elephant), but is unfortunately behind in the race. Turian ends up beating him down with an overabundance of fliers and [Psychatog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psychatog)s.
