### What *New Phyrexia* Common Do You Most Want to Open?


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/ptnag11/scott-vargas.jpg)**Luis Scott-Vargas:** [Grim Affliction](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grim+Affliction). [Volt Charge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Volt+Charge) is a close second, but [Grim Affliction](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grim+Affliction) is way better in the decks that it's actually good in.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/ptnag11/lax.jpg)**Ari Lax:** [Pith Driller](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pith+Driller).


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/ptnag11/yurchick.JPG)**Adam Yurchick:** [Volt Charge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Volt+Charge).


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/ptnag11/watanabe.jpg)**Yuuya Watanabe:** [Grim Affliction](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grim+Affliction).


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/ptnag11/calcano.jpg)**Christian Calcano:** [Volt Charge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Volt+Charge).


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/ptnag11/black.jpg)**Sam Black:** It's a toss-up between Binding Souleater and [Volt Charge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Volt+Charge). I think that [Blinding Souleater](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blinding+Souleater) is a stronger card overall, but I've had a lot of success drafting mono-red.
