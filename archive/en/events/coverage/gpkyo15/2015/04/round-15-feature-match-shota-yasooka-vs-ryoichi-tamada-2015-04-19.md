After 14 swiss rounds, it all came down to this. Both Players, Shota Yasooka and Ryoichi Tamada, wanted a spot in the Top 8, but only the winner of this match would get it. For Shota Yasooka this would be his 19th Grand Prix top 8 and his second straight in Kyoto. After going 9-0 day 1, the former Player of the year lost his first match on day 2 to Tomoharu Saito. From there he battled back with his OmniTell deck. It seemed so simple; Yasooka just needed to resolve a pair of Show and Tells and the top 8 would be his.


His opponent, Ryoichi Tamada, was hungry for his third Grand Prix top 8. The software engineer from Wakayama brought Temur Delver to Kyoto. The most popular type of Delver deck in Day 2, Tamada had been seen attacking with undercosted creatures Blue and Green thus far. With Temur Delver, there exists starts that seem impossible to overcome: turn 1 [Delver of Secrets](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Delver+of+Secrets) into a fist full of countermagic. Can Tamada ride one of his Insectile Aberrations to top 8?

**The Games:**


Tamada had the ideal start for his deck: turn 1 Delver of Secrets. Yasooka let it resolve, but it took a turn to transform. When it finally did, Tamada went full on aggression, casting Forked Bolt directly at Yasooka's face and dropping him to 14.


After taking a couple of attacks from Insectile Aberration, Yasooka baited out a [Spell Pierce](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spell+Pierce) by casting [Dig Through Time](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dig+Through+Time) at the end of Tamada's turn. When he passed his turn back Yasooka stopped Tamada during his upkeep. Yasooka used [Cunning Wish](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cunning+Wish) to find a [Lightning Bolt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt) from his sideboard and cast it on the 3/2; Tamada stopped him with a Force of Will. With only one card in hand, expecting the coast to be clear, Yasooka went for [Show and Tell](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Show+and+Tell) on his turn. Tamada's last card? Another [Force of Will](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Force+of+Will) that he hard-cast to stymie Yasooka's plans.


Tamada untapped and drew another Delver of Secrets. Knowing that his opponent was cardless, Yasooka resolved [Show and Tell](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Show+and+Tell) and put [Omniscience](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Omniscience) into play. with [Omniscience](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Omniscience) in play Yasooka cast Emrakul, the Aeons Torn. With the 15/15 Yasooka took the first game of the match

**Shota Yasooka 1 - 0 Ryoichi Tamada**


Game 2 started much the same as game 1; Tamada cast a turn 1 Delver of Secrets.


It took nearly 4 turns for [Delver of Secrets](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Delver+of+Secrets) to transform. In the meantime, Tamada added a [Nimble Mongoose](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nimble+Mongoose) to his board and quickly got Threshold. His pair of creatures made short work of Yasooka's life total, dropping him to 12 in a flash.


On Tamada's next turn, Yasooka decided to pick a fight over Tamada's Ponder. A tactic he had been using all weekend, when the dust settled Yasooka got Tamada to waste a [Force of Will](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Force+of+Will) in order to resolve the sorcery.

Sitting at 6 life and facing down 6 damage on the following turn, Yasooka had one turn to go for his combo. Thinking that the coast was clear due to the exchange on the previous turn, Yasooka slammed down a Show and Tell. When his [Show and Tell](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Show+and+Tell) resolved he put [Omniscience](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Omniscience) into play. From there he cast Emrakul and won the match


**Shota Yasooka wins 2-0 over Ryoichi Tamada**
