But that’s not all.


### “The Goblin Game”


PAX was also the site of Wizards of the Coast’s announcement of a new game code-named “The Goblin Game.” Wizards’ next foray into the online world, “The Goblin Game” is a web-based strategy game in which factions of goblins vie for dominance across a fantasy empire.


The yet-to-be-officially-named “Goblin Game” will hold open beta this December.
