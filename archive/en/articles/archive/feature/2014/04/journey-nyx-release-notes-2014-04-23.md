The Release Notes include information concerning the release of a new **Magic: The Gathering** set, as well as a collection of clarifications and rulings involving that set's cards. It's intended to make playing with the new cards more fun by clearing up the common misconceptions and confusion inevitably caused by new mechanics and interactions. As future sets are released, updates to the **Magic** rules may cause some of this information to become outdated. If you can't find the answer you're looking for here, please contact us at Wizards.com/CustomerService.


The "General Notes" section includes release information and explains the mechanics and concepts in the set.


The "Card-Specific Notes" section contains answers to the most important, most common, and most confusing questions players might ask about cards in the set. Items in the "Card-Specific Notes" section include full card text for your reference. Not all cards in the set are listed.

**New Ability Word: *Constellation***


The starry realm of Nyx beckons to all people of *Theros*, with its groups of stars representing the gods above. *Constellation* is an ability word that appears in italics at the beginning of abilities that trigger whenever an enchantment enters the battlefield under your control. (An ability word has no rules meaning.)


![](https://media.wizards.com/images/magic/tcg/products/jou/aasd7y23m34co/4kMDv8c3mQ_EN.jpg)Humbler of Mortals  
![4 Mana](https://web.archive.org/web/20150525105735im_/http://archive.wizards.com/images/Symbols/Symbol_4_mana.gif)![Green Mana](https://web.archive.org/web/20150515165945im_/http://archive.wizards.com/images/Symbols/green_mana.gif)![Green Mana](https://web.archive.org/web/20150515165945im_/http://archive.wizards.com/images/Symbols/green_mana.gif)  

Enchantment Creature — Elemental  

5/5  
**Constellation** — Whenever Humbler of Mortals or another enchantment enters the battlefield under your control, creatures you control gain trample until end of turn.


* A constellation ability triggers whenever an enchantment enters the battlefield under your control for any reason. Enchantments with other card types, such as enchantment creatures, will also cause constellation abilities to trigger.
* An Aura spell without bestow that has an illegal target when it tries to resolve will be countered and put into its owner's graveyard. It won't enter the battlefield and constellation abilities won't trigger. An Aura spell with bestow won't be countered this way. It will revert to being an enchantment creature and resolve, entering the battlefield and triggering constellation abilities.
* When an enchantment enters the battlefield under your control, each constellation ability of permanents you control will trigger. You can put these abilities on the stack in any order. The last ability you put on the stack will be the first one that resolves.




---


**New Ability Word: *Strive***


The challenges of *Theros* often require extraordinary effort to overcome. Some instants and sorceries in this set can target any number of creatures. *Strive* is an ability word that appears in italics at the beginning of abilities on these instants and sorceries that increase the cost for each target beyond the first. (An ability word has no rules meaning.)


![](https://media.wizards.com/images/magic/tcg/products/jou/aasd7y23m34co/gHCkYTAndt_EN.jpg)Desperate Stand  
![Red Mana](https://web.archive.org/web/20150518222449im_/http://archive.wizards.com/images/Symbols/red_mana.gif)![White Mana](https://web.archive.org/web/20160519004405im_/http://archive.wizards.com/images/Symbols/white_mana.gif)  

Sorcery  
**Strive** — Desperate Stand costs ![Red Mana](https://web.archive.org/web/20150518222449im_/http://archive.wizards.com/images/Symbols/red_mana.gif)![White Mana](https://web.archive.org/web/20160519004405im_/http://archive.wizards.com/images/Symbols/white_mana.gif) more to cast for each target beyond the first.  

Any number of target creatures each get +2/+0 and gain first strike and vigilance until end of turn.


* You choose how many targets each spell with a strive ability has and what those targets are as you cast it. It's legal to cast such a spell with no targets, although this is rarely a good idea. You can't choose the same target more than once for a single strive spell.
* The mana cost and converted mana cost of strive spells don't change no matter how many targets they have. *Strive* abilities affect only what you pay. For example, the converted mana cost of Desperate Stand is always 2.
* If all of the spell's targets are illegal when the spell tries to resolve, it will be countered and none of its effects will happen. If one or more of its targets are legal when it tries to resolve, the spell will resolve and affect only those legal targets. It will have no effect on any illegal targets.
* If such a spell is copied, and the effect that copies the spell allows a player to choose new targets for the copy, the number of targets can't be changed. The player may change any number of the targets, including all of them or none of them. If, for one of the targets, the player can't choose a new legal target, then it remains unchanged (even if the current target is illegal).
* If a spell or ability allows you to cast a strive spell without paying its mana cost, you must pay the strive cost for each target beyond the first.




---


**Returning Mechanic with a Cruel Twist: Bestow and Opponents' Creatures**


Introduced in *Theros*, the bestow ability allows you to cast a card either as an enchantment creature or as an Aura enchantment. When cast as Auras, the cards with bestow in *Theros* and *Born of the Gods* provided benefits to the enchanted creatures. While it was always possible to enchant a creature controlled by an opponent this way, it was rarely advisable. Some cards with bestow in this set convey drawbacks to the enchanted creature and will more frequently enchant creatures controlled by an opponent.


![](https://media.wizards.com/images/magic/tcg/products/jou/aasd7y23m34co/V3BPqHgGlq_EN.jpg)Gnarled Scarhide  
![Black Mana](https://web.archive.org/web/20150528034551im_/http://archive.wizards.com/images/Symbols/black_mana.gif)  

Enchantment Creature — Minotaur  

2/1  

Bestow ![3 Mana](https://web.archive.org/web/20170413165507im_/http://archive.wizards.com/images/Symbols/Symbol_3_mana.gif)![Black Mana](https://web.archive.org/web/20150528034551im_/http://archive.wizards.com/images/Symbols/black_mana.gif)*(If you cast this card for its bestow cost, it's an Aura spell with enchant creature. It becomes a creature again if it's not attached to a creature.)*  

Gnarled Scarhide can't block.  

Enchanted creature gets +2/+1 and can't block.


* You still control the Aura, even if it's enchanting a creature controlled by another player.
* If the enchanted creature leaves the battlefield, the Aura stops being an Aura and remains on the battlefield. Control of that permanent doesn't change; you'll control the resulting enchantment creature.
* Similarly, if you cast an Aura spell with bestow targeting a creature controlled by another player, and that creature is an illegal target when the spell tries to resolve, it will finish resolving as an enchantment creature spell. It will enter the battlefield under your control.

**Returning Mechanic: Gods and Devotion to Two Colors**


The five Gods that appear in the *Journey into Nyx* set each have an ability that refers to your devotion to two colors.


![](https://media.wizards.com/images/magic/tcg/products/jou/aasd7y23m34co/VSGCafGR68_EN.jpg)Pharika, God of Affliction  
![1 Mana](https://web.archive.org/web/20170413165508im_/http://archive.wizards.com/images/Symbols/Symbol_1_mana.gif)![Black Mana](https://web.archive.org/web/20150528034551im_/http://archive.wizards.com/images/Symbols/black_mana.gif)![Green Mana](https://web.archive.org/web/20150515165945im_/http://archive.wizards.com/images/Symbols/green_mana.gif)  

Legendary Enchantment Creature — God  

5/5  

Indestructible  

As long as your devotion to black and green is less than seven, Pharika isn't a creature.  
![Black Mana](https://web.archive.org/web/20150528034551im_/http://archive.wizards.com/images/Symbols/black_mana.gif)![Green Mana](https://web.archive.org/web/20150515165945im_/http://archive.wizards.com/images/Symbols/green_mana.gif): Exile target creature card from a graveyard. Its owner puts a 1/1 black and green Snake enchantment creature token with deathtouch onto the battlefield.


* Your devotion to two colors is equal to the number of mana symbols that are the first color, the second color, or both colors among the mana costs of permanents you control. Specifically, a hybrid mana symbol counts only once toward your devotion to its two colors. For example, if the only nonland permanents you control are Pharika, God of Affliction and Golgari Guildmage (whose mana cost is ![Black or Green Mana](https://web.archive.org/web/20150921023527im_/http://archive.wizards.com/images/Symbols/Symbol_BG_mana.gif)![Black or Green Mana](https://web.archive.org/web/20150921023527im_/http://archive.wizards.com/images/Symbols/Symbol_BG_mana.gif)), your devotion to black and green is four.

**Other Returning *Theros* and *Born of the Gods* Themes and Mechanics** 


The *Journey into Nyx* set features many mechanics, keywords, and rules introduced in the *Theros* set. For more information on enchantment creatures, the "Nyx" starry sky frame element, bestow, heroic, monstrosity and monstrous creatures, devotion, scry, and Gods, please see the *Theros* Release Notes. For more information on inspired, please see the *Born of the Gods* Release Notes. Release Notes for each set can be found at [archive.wizards.com/Magic/tcg/resources.aspx?x=magic/rules/faqs](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/tcg/resources.aspx?x=magic/rules/faqs).

**Rule Change: The "Planeswalker Uniqueness Rule" and the "Legend Rule"**


Two rule changes introduced with the ***Magic** 2014* Core Set impact how cards in the *Journey into Nyx* set function.


Under the previous rules, if there were two or more legendary permanents with the same name on the battlefield or two or more planeswalkers that share a subtype (such as "Jace") on the battlefield, they would all be put into their owners' graveyards as a state-based action. These rules have changed. The new rules are as follows:


704.5j If a player controls two or more planeswalkers that share a planeswalker type, that player chooses one of them, and the rest are put into their owners' graveyards. This is called the "planeswalker uniqueness rule."


704.5k If a player controls two or more legendary permanents with the same name, that player chooses one of them, and the rest are put into their owners' graveyards. This is called the "legend rule."

Enchantment Creature — Human Soldier  

2/1  

You have hexproof. *(You can't be the target of spells or abilities your opponents control.)*


* Your opponent can't target you with spells that deal damage or abilities that cause their sources to deal damage, even if he or she intends to redirect the damage to a planeswalker you control.

Enchantment Creature — Zombie  

2/2  
*Constellation* — Whenever Agent of Erebos or another enchantment enters the battlefield under your control, exile all cards from target player's graveyard.


* The constellation ability is mandatory. If you are the only legal target (perhaps because your opponent has hexproof), you must target yourself and exile all the cards from your graveyard.

Planeswalker — Ajani  

4  

+1: Distribute three +1/+1 counters among one, two, or three target creatures you control.  

+1: Look at the top four cards of your library. You may reveal an Aura, creature, or planeswalker card from among them and put it into your hand. Put the rest on the bottom of your library in any order.  

-8: You gain 100 life.


* You announce how many counters will be placed on each target creature as you activate Ajani's first ability. Each target must receive at least one counter.
* If one or more, but not all, of the targets of the first ability are illegal when that ability tries to resolve, no counters will be placed on illegal targets. You can't change the distribution you announced when you activated the ability; the excess counters are just lost.

Enchantment — Aura  

Enchant creature  

Enchanted creature has double strike as long as it's an enchantment. Otherwise, prevent all damage that would be dealt by enchanted creature. *(A creature with double strike deals both first-strike and regular combat damage.)*


* Armament of Nyx continuously checks to see whether the creature it's enchanting is an enchantment or not. If the creature isn't an enchantment and becomes one, or it is an enchantment and stops being one, the effect will change.

Equip ![2 Mana](https://web.archive.org/web/20150519185605im_/http://archive.wizards.com/images/Symbols/Symbol_2_mana.gif)


* The +1/+1 counter is put on the equipped creature before combat damage is dealt.
* If you move Armory of Iroas from one creature to another, any +1/+1 counters on the first creature remain where they are.

Legendary Enchantment Creature — God  

5/4  

Indestructible  

As long as your devotion to white and black is less than seven, Athreos isn't a creature.  

Whenever another creature you own dies, return it to your hand unless target opponent pays 3 life.


* You are a creature's owner if the card representing it began the game in your deck, or if it's a token that entered the battlefield under your control.
* Athreos's last ability will trigger if a token creature you own dies. The target opponent has the option to pay 3 life, although the token can't return to your hand.
* It doesn't matter who controlled the creature when it died. Athreos's last ability will trigger if you owned that creature.
* The target opponent chooses whether to pay 3 life when Athreos's last ability resolves. You won't return the card to your hand if that player pays 3 life or if the card leaves the graveyard before the ability resolves.
* If there are no legal targets for Athreos's last ability (perhaps because each of your opponents has hexproof), it will be removed from the stack with no effect. No one may pay 3 life and you won't return the creature card to your hand.

![](https://media.wizards.com/images/magic/tcg/products/jou/aasd7y23m34co/IFNqbcqrHT_EN.jpg)Banishing Light  
![2 Mana](https://web.archive.org/web/20150519185605im_/http://archive.wizards.com/images/Symbols/Symbol_2_mana.gif)![White Mana](https://web.archive.org/web/20160519004405im_/http://archive.wizards.com/images/Symbols/white_mana.gif)  

Enchantment  

When Banishing Light enters the battlefield, exile target nonland permanent an opponent controls until Banishing Light leaves the battlefield. (That permanent returns under its owner's control.)


* Banishing Light's ability causes a zone change with a duration, a new style of ability that's somewhat reminiscent of older cards like Oblivion Ring. However, unlike Oblivion Ring, cards like Banishing Light have a single ability that creates two one-shot effects: one that exiles the permanent when the ability resolves, and another that returns the exiled card to the battlefield immediately after Banishing Light leaves the battlefield.
* If Banishing Light leaves the battlefield before its enters-the-battlefield ability resolves, the target nonland permanent won't be exiled.
* Auras attached to the exiled permanent will be put into their owners' graveyards. Equipment attached to the exiled permanent will become unattached and remain on the battlefield. Any counters on the exiled permanent will cease to exist.
* If a token is exiled, it ceases to exist. It won't be returned to the battlefield.
* The exiled card returns to the battlefield immediately after Banishing Light leaves the battlefield. Nothing happens between the two events, including state-based actions. Banishing Light and the returned card aren't on the battlefield at the same time.
* In a multiplayer game, if Banishing Light's owner leaves the game, the exiled card will return to the battlefield. Because the one-shot effect that returns the card isn't an ability that goes on the stack, it won't cease to exist along with the leaving player's spells and abilities on the stack.

![1 Mana](https://web.archive.org/web/20170413165508im_/http://archive.wizards.com/images/Symbols/Symbol_1_mana.gif)![Blue Mana](https://web.archive.org/web/20150519185605im_/http://archive.wizards.com/images/Symbols/blue_mana.gif)  

Creature — Human Wizard  

2/1  

Each instant and sorcery spell you cast costs ![1 Mana](https://web.archive.org/web/20170413165508im_/http://archive.wizards.com/images/Symbols/Symbol_1_mana.gif) less to cast for each creature it targets.  
*Heroic* — Whenever you cast a spell that targets Battlefield Thaumaturge, Battlefield Thaumaturge gains hexproof until end of turn.


* Battlefield Thaumaturge's first ability doesn't change that spell's mana cost or converted mana cost. It changes only the amount you actually pay (the "total cost" of the spell).
* To calculate the total cost of an instant or sorcery spell you're casting, start with the mana cost (or alternative cost, if applicable), add all cost increases (including additional costs such as those imposed by strive abilities), then subtract all cost reductions (such as the one created by Battlefield Thaumaturge's first ability) .
* The cost reduction created by Battlefield Thaumaturge's first ability can reduce only the generic portion of the spell's total cost. Colored mana requirements aren't affected.
* The cost reduction is ![1 Mana](https://web.archive.org/web/20170413165508im_/http://archive.wizards.com/images/Symbols/Symbol_1_mana.gif) per target creature, even if the spell targets a creature more than once.

Creature — Giant  

10/10  

When Bearer of the Heavens dies, destroy all permanents at the beginning of the next end step.


* The effect of the ability will destroy all permanents on the battlefield as it resolves. It doesn't matter if those permanents were on the battlefield when Bearer of the Heavens died.
* If Bearer of the Heavens dies during an end step, the delayed triggered ability will trigger at the beginning of the next turn's end step.

Any number of target creatures can't block this turn.


* Blinding Flare can target any creature, including those you control.

Creature — Human Soldier  

2/1  
*Heroic* — Whenever you cast a spell that targets Bloodcrazed Hoplite, put a +1/+1 counter on it.  

Whenever a +1/+1 counter is placed on Bloodcrazed Hoplite, remove a +1/+1 counter from target creature an opponent controls.


* Bloodcrazed Hoplite's last ability will trigger whenever any +1/+1 counter is placed on it, not just ones due to its heroic ability.
* If multiple +1/+1 counters are placed on Bloodcrazed Hoplite simultaneously, its last ability will trigger once for each of those counters.
* If Bloodcrazed Hoplite enters the battlefield with +1/+1 counters on it, its last ability will trigger once for each of those counters.

Enchantment Creature — Insect  

1/1  

When Brain Maggot enters the battlefield, target opponent reveals his or her hand and you choose a nonland card from it. Exile that card until Brain Maggot leaves the battlefield.


* Brain Maggot's ability causes a zone change with a duration, a new style of ability that's somewhat reminiscent of older cards like Tidehollow Sculler. However, unlike Tidehollow Sculler, Brain Maggot has a single ability that creates two one-shot effects: one that exiles the nonland card when the ability resolves, and another that returns the exiled card to its owner's hand immediately after Brain Maggot leaves the battlefield.
* If Brain Maggot leaves the battlefield before its enters-the-battlefield ability resolves, the opponent will reveal his or her hand, but no card will be exiled.
* The exiled card returns to its owner's hand immediately after Brain Maggot leaves the battlefield. Nothing happens between the two events, including state-based actions.
* In a multiplayer game, if Brain Maggot's owner leaves the game, the exiled card will return to its owner's hand. Because the one-shot effect that returns the card isn't an ability that goes on the stack, it won't cease to exist along with the leaving player's spells and abilities on the stack.

Creature — Human Rogue  

2/3  
*Inspired* — Whenever Daring Thief becomes untapped, you may exchange control of target nonland permanent you control and target permanent an opponent controls that shares a card type with it.


* The exchange of control lasts indefinitely. It doesn't expire when Daring Thief leaves the battlefield.
* Gaining control of an Aura or Equipment doesn't cause it to move, though gaining control of an Equipment will allow you to activate its equip ability to attach it to a creature you control later.
* The relevant card types (that is, the ones a permanent can have) are artifact, creature, enchantment, planeswalker, and tribal.
* If the full exchange can't happen, perhaps because one of the targets is illegal as the inspired ability tries to resolve, then nothing happens. No permanents change controllers.
* If another spell or ability allows you to change the targets of the ability (or perhaps copy it and choose new targets for the copy), you can change the targets only such that the final set of targets is still legal. For example, if the ability targets a creature you control and a creature an opponent controls, you couldn't change just the second target to a noncreature permanent controlled by that player. You could, however, change just the second target to a creature controlled by a different opponent. The two new targets can share a different card type than the two original targets did.
* Although the permanent you control can't be a land, the other target can, provided it shares a card type with the first target. For example, you could target an artifact you control and an artifact land controlled by an opponent.

* When you search the target's controller's graveyard, hand, and library, you may leave any cards with that name in the zones they're in. You don't have to exile them.

Enchantment  

Flash  

Whenever a creature you control dies, each opponent sacrifices a creature.


* When the triggered ability resolves, first the player whose turn it is (if that player is an opponent) chooses which creature he or she will sacrifice, then each other opponent in turn order does the same, then all chosen creatures are sacrificed at the same time.
* None of the opponents are targeted. An opponent with hexproof would still sacrifice a creature.
* If multiple creatures you control die at the same time, Dictate of Erebos's triggered ability will trigger that many times.
* If you control more than one Dictate of Erebos and a creature you control dies, each of the triggered abilities will trigger. Each opponent will sacrifice a creature each time one of those abilities resolves.
* If you and an opponent each control a Dictate of Erebos and a creature dies, a chain reaction happens. First the ability of one player's Dictate of Erebos will trigger, causing each opponent to sacrifice a creature. That sacrifice causes the ability of the other player's Dictate of Erebos to trigger, and so on.

Enchantment  

Flash  

If a source would deal damage to a permanent or player, it deals double that damage to that permanent or player instead.


* Dictate of the Twin Gods applies to any damage, not just combat damage. It also doesn't matter who controls the source of the damage that's being dealt.
* The source of the damage doesn't change. A spell that deals damage will specify the source of the damage, often the spell itself. An ability that deals damage will also specify the source of the damage, although the ability itself will never be that source. Often the source of the ability is also the source of the damage.
* If more than one Dictate of the Twin Gods is on the battlefield, damage dealt will double for each one (two of them will end up multiplying the damage by four, three of them by eight, and four of them by sixteen).
* If multiple effects modify how damage will be dealt, the player being dealt damage or the controller of the permanent being dealt damage chooses the order to apply the effects. For example, the ability of Decorated Griffin says "Prevent the next 1 combat damage that would be dealt to you this turn." Suppose you would be dealt 3 combat damage and you activate the ability of Decorated Griffin. You can either (a) prevent 1 damage first and then let Dictate of the Twin Gods's effect double the remaining 2 damage, for a result of being dealt 4 damage, or (b) double the damage to 6 and then prevent 1 damage, for a result of being dealt 5 damage.

Whenever a player casts a spell with converted mana cost 3 or less, Eidolon of the Great Revel deals 2 damage to that player.

* Casting a spell for an alternative cost, such as a bestow cost, doesn't change its converted mana cost. Similarly, casting a spell with an additional cost, such as a spell with a strive ability, doesn't change its converted mana cost. For example, casting Gnarled Scarhide (a card with mana cost ![Black Mana](https://web.archive.org/web/20150528034551im_/http://archive.wizards.com/images/Symbols/black_mana.gif) and bestow cost ![3 Mana](https://web.archive.org/web/20170413165507im_/http://archive.wizards.com/images/Symbols/Symbol_3_mana.gif)![Black Mana](https://web.archive.org/web/20150528034551im_/http://archive.wizards.com/images/Symbols/black_mana.gif)) for its bestow cost will cause Eidolon of the Great Revel's ability to trigger.

* The target creatures copy the printed values of the chosen creature, plus any copy effects that have been applied to it. They won't copy counters on that creature or effects that have changed the creature's power, toughness, types, color, or so on.
* If the creatures copy a creature that's copying a creature, they will become whatever the chosen creature is copying.
* This effect can cause the targets to stop being creatures. For example, if they each become a copy of a land that has become a creature, the effect that turned that land into a creature won't be copied. The targets will become noncreature lands.
* Effects that have already applied to the target creatures will continue to apply to them. For example, if Giant Growth had given one of those creatures +3/+3 earlier in the turn, then Polymorphous Rush makes it a copy of Pensive Minotaur (a 2/3 creature), it will be a 5/6 Pensive Minotaur.

1/1  
*Heroic* — Whenever you cast a spell that targets Sage of Hours, put a +1/+1 counter on it.  

Remove all +1/+1 counters from Sage of Hours: For each five counters removed this way, take an extra turn after this one.


* You must remove all +1/+1 counters from Sage of Hours to activate its ability, even if the number of counters isn't a multiple of five. For example, if you remove twelve counters to activate the ability, you'll take two extra turns. If you remove three counters, you won't take any extra turns.

Sightless Brawler can't attack alone.  

Enchanted creature gets +3/+2 and can't attack alone.


* Sightless Brawler or the creature it enchants can be declared as an attacker only if another creature is declared as an attacker at the same time.
* If you control more than one creature that can't attack alone, they can both attack together, even if no other creatures attack.
* Although Sightless Brawler or the creature it enchants can't attack alone, other attacking creatures don't have to attack the same player or planeswalker. For example, Sightless Brawler could attack an opponent and another creature could attack a planeswalker that opponent controls.
* If a creature that can't attack alone also must attack if able, its controller must attack with it and another creature if able.
* In a Two-Headed Giant game (or in another format using the shared team turns option), Sightless Brawler (or the creature it enchants) can attack with a creature controlled by your teammate, even if no other creatures you control attack.

Choose any number of target creatures you control. For each of them, put a token that's a copy of that creature onto the battlefield. Those tokens have haste. Exile them at the beginning of the next end step.


* The tokens copy exactly what was printed on the original creature and nothing else (unless that permanent is copying something else or is a token; see below). It doesn't copy whether that creature is tapped or untapped, whether it has any counters on it or Auras and Equipment attached to it, or any non-copy effects that have changed its power, toughness, types, color, and so on.
* If the copied creature has ![X Mana](https://web.archive.org/web/20150421062918im_/http://archive.wizards.com/images/Symbols/X_mana.gif) in its mana cost, X is considered to be 0.
* If the copied creature is copying something else (for example, if the copied creature is a Clone), then the token enters the battlefield as whatever that creature copied.
* If the copied creature is a token, the token created by Twinflame copies the original characteristics of that token as stated by the effect that put that token onto the battlefield.
* Any enters-the-battlefield abilities of the copied creature will trigger when the token enters the battlefield. Any "as [this permanent] enters the battlefield" or "[this permanent] enters the battlefield with" abilities of the copied creature will also work.
* The tokens see each other enter the battlefield. If any of them have a triggered ability that triggers whenever a creature enters the battlefield, they'll trigger for one another.
* If another creature becomes or enters the battlefield as a copy of the token, that creature will have haste, but you won't exile it. However, if Twinflame creates multiple tokens copying a single creature due to a replacement effect (like the one Doubling Season creates), you'll exile each of them.

Sorcery  

You control target player during that player's next turn. Exile Worst Fears. *(You see all cards that player could see and make all decisions for the player.)*


* While controlling another player, you can see all cards that player can see. This includes cards in that player's hand, face-down cards that player controls, his or her sideboard, and any cards in his or her library that he or she looks at.
* The player you're controlling is still the active player during that turn.
* While controlling another player, you also continue to make your own choices and decisions.
* While controlling another player, you make all choices and decisions that player is allowed to make or is told to make during that turn. This includes choices about what spells to cast or what abilities to activate, as well as any decisions called for by triggered abilities or for any other reason.
* You can't make the affected player concede. That player may choose to concede at any time, even while you're controlling him or her.
* You can't make any illegal decisions or illegal choices—you can't do anything that player couldn't do. You can't make choices or decisions for that player that aren't called for by the game rules or by any cards, permanents, spells, abilities, and so on. If an effect causes another player to make decisions that the affected player would normally make (such as Master Warcraft does), that effect takes precedence. In other words, if the affected player wouldn't make a decision, you wouldn't make that decision on his or her behalf.
* You also can't make any choices or decisions for the player that would be called for by the tournament rules (such as whether to take an intentional draw or whether to call a judge).
* You can use only the affected player's resources (cards, mana, and so on) to pay costs for that player; you can't use your own. Similarly, you can use the affected player's resources only to pay that player's costs; you can't spend them on your costs.
* You only control the player. You don't control any of his or her permanents, spells, or abilities.
* If the target player skips his or her next turn, you'll control the next turn the affected player actually takes.
* Multiple player-controlling effects that affect the same player overwrite each other. The last one to be created is the one that works.
* You could gain control of yourself using Worst Fears, but unless you do so to overwrite someone else's player-controlling effect, this doesn't do anything.
