The **Magic Online** 2014 Community Cup—the annual showdown between Wizards of the Coast's best and brightest and some guys and gals that you all like for some reason—is coming soon! September 12–14, to be exact. 

 Somehow, the dastardly Community Team managed to best the noble, good-looking Wizards Team [last year](/en/events/coverage/2013-magic-online-community-cup), but this feels like a comeback year for those of us in the building. 

 But that, in a way, is up to you. The Community Team is made up of players you choose—streamers, writers, and people who generally give back to and make up the **Magic** Community—and nominations are open now. 

 So if you have someone you'd like to nominate for defeat participation, just click [here](http://wizards.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/2279).
