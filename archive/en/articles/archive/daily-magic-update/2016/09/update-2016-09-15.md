The Daily *Magic* Update is a roundup of everything *Magic* you should know on September 15, 2016. Today's Update is brought to you by [David Williams](#dw). Team Grand Prix Champion. *Master Chef* Finalist. Way more famous than any of us.


Today's Previews
================


For the previews not already found on DailyMTG, look no further than this section here. Well, click on the links below, but, no further than that. After that, you're good for the day.


1. 

<https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2FMagicTheGathering.kr%2Fposts%2F1190157424375375%3A0&width=500>


Hm. Korean. Let's see what [translation Reddit has come up with](https://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/52u2b2/kld_age_of_innovation/d7nan4e). Yup, that looks right, though the name is Era of Innovation. Good enough.


1. [Fairgrounds Warden](https://twitter.com/Wizards_MagicEU/status/776404058173280256) | Wizards\_MagicEU

So, when Fairground Warden exiles a creature, would you say that creature has been Dwarfed?


1. [Marionette Master](http://tokyomtg.com/articles.html) | Tokyomtg.com

The article is in Japanese, but the abilities are simple and powerful, but they certainly make you make a choice. As a 1/3 for 4BB, it better have some powerful text. And it does. It has fabricate 3, and when an artifact goes to the graveyard, it makes an opponent lose live equal to Marionette Master's power. So you either get a 4/6 that clocks the opponent for 4 every time an artifact dies, or a 1/3 and three 1/1s, all ready to die and ping the opponent.


1. [Exclusive Kaladesh Preview – Insidious Will!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2cPJo55bxo&feature=youtu.be) | The Mana Source | Wedge

My favorite comment I found on players discussing this card was this: [Choose zero, one, or two. There are now that many of target spell.](https://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/52uh2q/the_mana_source_exclusive_kld_preview_insidious/d7ni67u)

1. Also coming today

Two more previews are planned for today—the last day of previews! [@ElaineChase](https://twitter.com/ElaineChase) will show off a card later today, and the [Polygon](http://www.polygon.com/) previews that didn't happen yesterday should happen today. Probably. Who knows.


Plus, as the last day before the full set releases, sometimes we have a little fun and just start throwing cards out there. Who knows.


Twitter Kind of Exploded Yesterday
==================================


There were a lot of conversations that happened yesterday, so let's touch on a few of them. First, something fun to start us off right.



1. > 
> They got it right. He was the best on day 1. The best throughout the show and the best in the finale. Congrats [@djshaunoneale](https://twitter.com/djshaunoneale) [#MasterChef](https://twitter.com/hashtag/MasterChef?src=hash)
> 
> 
>  — David Williams (@dwpoker) [September 15, 2016](https://twitter.com/dwpoker/status/776284096477564928)

David Williams might not have won Master Chef, but it was really cool seeing a well-known *Magic* player take a turn on another big stage and excel. Congratulations to David Williams for making the finals of Master Chef. Now we know why Matt Sperling and Paul Rietzl had to slum it with—wait, Jelger Weigersma? The Hall of Fame pro? Ok, he works too.


1. > 
> I have a talent for saying terrible jokes. This has nothing to do with a bad joke.
> 
> 
>  — Helene Bergeot (@HeleneBergeot) [September 14, 2016](https://twitter.com/HeleneBergeot/status/776205711160152064)

Ok, so what this was about was a store that offered a “Ladies' Night” for *Magic* where women played for free. What started as a questionable promotion spiraled out of control when a customer questioned whether the promotion was offensive, and received a response that could charitably be called—well, you couldn't really charitably call it anything. It was mean.


Then, the social media account doubled down by posting an even worse hypothetical tournament about feelings being hurt and something about holding hands and aliens. I'm not going to share it here (or the name of the store). At any rate, it wasn't a response we'd want to see from a store running our tournaments. As of now, [we're looking into it](https://twitter.com/HeleneBergeot/status/776122236021317632), but that's all we can say for the time being.


1. > 
> Brad and Cedric just emailed me their proposal for the 24 Worlds slots. [pic.twitter.com/HeydPKkfPf](https://t.co/HeydPKkfPf)
> 
> 
>  — Matt Sperling (@mtg\_law\_etc) [September 14, 2016](https://twitter.com/mtg_law_etc/status/776136028956467200)

Finally, yesterday saw many people discussing the World Championship slots for next year and the fact that the World Champion—in this case, Brian Braun-Duin—wasn't automatically qualified for next year. We [announced that change back on August 2](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/news/pro-tour-eldritch-moon-organized-play-announcement-world-championship-pro-tour-2016-08-02), but since few people actually imagine they'll really win the thing, the community just started picking up on it. Opinions seemed split, as many pros noted that the 13-17 point head start winning the thing gets you is a pretty good launching pad to getting back—and maybe if you don't get back, you shouldn't be there. Others noted that they enjoyed the storyline of the defending champion coming back to defend their title. There was also talk about the *Magic Online* champion slot, but, as that one was previously announced, there was no way to change it. It is under discussion for future World Championships.


After All of That, Listen to This
=================================


1. [*Eldritch Moon* Sunset and *Kaladesh* Rules Show](http://lrcast.com/limited-resources-354-eldritch-moon-sunset-and-kaladesh-rules-show/) | Limited Resources | Marshall Sutcliffe and Luis Scott-Vargas

Marshall and Luis take one last, longing look back at *Eldritch Moon* before talking *Kaladesh* rules in preparation for their upcoming 37-hour long set review show. Give or take 15 hours.


Deck of the Day
===============


1. Mardu Control

Mardu strategies have always felt just outside the cusp of playability, but Adam Grimes had a relatively successful outing at the StarCityGames Open in Richmond two weekends ago with the list below. His Top 16 finish highlights how strong black-based control strategies are right now, and how customizable control decks can be at the moment.


Like the other decks we looked at this week, this one survives largely intact except for one very big loss—[Languish](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Languish). Fumigate, previewed in today's [Beyond the Basics](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/beyond-basics/now-or-later-2016-09-15), is a strong sweeper that will be a welcome addition to white-based control, but in a deck that wants to cast both [Liliana, the Last Hope](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Liliana%2C+the+Last+Hope) and [Chandra, Flamecaller](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chandra%2C+Flamecaller) (and, let's be honest, probably Chandra, Torch of Defiance as well), relying on a WW spell as your sweeper of choice is problematic.


Most everything else sticks around. [Galvanic Bombardment](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Galvanic+Bombardment) has already replaced [Fiery Impulse](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fiery+Impulse) here, and [Read the Bones](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Read+the+Bones), is relatively replaceable. [Infinite Obliteration](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Infinite+Obliteration) goes away, but it's really only useful in a few matchups.


But the good news is the planeswalker core stays around, and adds another Chandra to the mix. That might be enough to bring [Goblin Dark-Dwellers](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Dark-Dwellers) back into the fold. But only time, and tournaments, will tell.
