![Weird token](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/mtgcom/arcana1000/1039_weirdcard.jpg)When you crank out a token creature in ***Magic** Online*, the game doesn't tear off a piece of paper and scrawl "*saporling*" on it, or grab a face-down Swamp and call it good -- it mocks up a full-color card, complete with unique art, for that token creature. It follows that original art has to be commissioned for those token-generating cards. And it follows further that we'll show you high-resolution versions of them here in Magic Arcana. 


*Guildpact* is home to [several token-generating cards](http://gatherer.wizards.com/?first=1&last=100&term=token&Field_Name=on&Field_Rules=on&Field_Type=on&setfilter=Guildpact&colorfilter=All&typefilter=All&output=summary&sort=name&x=38&y=25). Some use token art that was previously commissioned for *Ravnica: City of Guilds*; for example, [Seize the Soul](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seize+the+Soul) uses the same [1/1 white Spirit token with flying](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=magic/images/mtgcom/arcana1000/1039_token_spirit.jpg) that [Transluminant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Transluminant) and [Twilight Drover](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Twilight+Drover) used. 


 But here are some that were all-new for *Guildpact*. The art team likes to have the same artist who illustrated the original token-generating card illustrate the token art, for visual similarity. Check it out.
