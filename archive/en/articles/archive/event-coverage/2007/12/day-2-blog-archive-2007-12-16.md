December 16th, 11:03 a.m. – It's D-Day
--------------------------------------


1340 players have become 128, and now they sit down to draft three packs of Lorwyn. Three rounds later they get to do it all again, and then the best of the best get a final try to turn treefolk, merfolk and more into solid gold, or as close to solid gold as the US dollar gets. We're joined by special guest analyst Ervin Tormos, bringing us fresh transatlantic perspective on the Draft format as Day Two gets under way.

December 16th, 8:20 a.m.: Marijn Lybaert, Elvish Drafter
--------------------------------------------------------


*by Hanno Terbuyken*

We left off yesterday evening with Marijn Lybaert, and it seemed only fitting to kickstart Sunday's tired early hours with the same 9-0 player. Watching Marijn draft was like a swimming lesson in a sea of green, with the occasional cuttlefish passing. That's not to say he drafted anything blue, of fishy. But the Belgian drowned in a sea of green.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gpstu07/marijn_draft.jpg)*Marijn Lybaert reaching out for success.*It started in pack one, when Marijn shuffled [Merrow Harbinger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Merrow+Harbinger) and [Changeling Titan](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Changeling+Titan) to the front of his first pick. Many pros betray an affection to blue cards, Faeries and Merfolk in particular, but the siren call of the azure depths didn't get through to Marijn. He picked [Changeling Titan](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Changeling+Titan), then [Eyeblight's Ending](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eyeblight%27s+Ending) second, with [Mudbutton Torchrunner](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mudbutton+Torchrunner) failing to get Marijn's attention.


A third pick [Lys Alana Huntmaster](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lys+Alana+Huntmaster) scribbled "Elves!" all over Marijn's hands. And while the occasional blue Harbinger slyly waved at Marijn in passing, the Belgian was as green as a thicket of algae: [Battlewand Oak](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Battlewand+Oak), [Fertile Ground](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fertile+Ground), [Lys Alana Scarblade](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lys+Alana+Scarblade) as sixth pick, then [Elvish Branchbender](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elvish+Branchbender) and as eighth card [Hornet Harasser](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hornet+Harasser)s. Removal remained scarce during the whole draft, but Marijn had something better. A second [Lys Alana Scarblade](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lys+Alana+Scarblade) as tenth pick, followed by Warren-Scourge Elves and a late Fertile ground fortified his Elvish plans.


Marijn opened a weak pack two, and had to go to Jagged Scar Archers as his first pick, and his second pick, a very solid selection for a dedicated Elf deck. Still, the draft could have gone haywire, but instead, it went ballistic. [Lys Alana Huntmaster](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lys+Alana+Huntmaster) #2 as fourth pick made sure that Marijn was not straying from the Elvish ways. The pack just had more Elves, like [Nath's Elite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nath%27s+Elite), [Gilt-Leaf Ambush](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gilt-Leaf+Ambush), [Skeletal Changeling](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skeletal+Changeling) and a [Battlewand Oak](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Battlewand+Oak) (not an Elf). The only pick that made Marijn think was pick three, [Elvish Promenade](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elvish+Promenade) over [Incremental Growth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Incremental+Growth).


Then, Marijn opened an extraordinarily weak third pack – for him, at least. He found [Wort, Boggart Auntie](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wort%2C+Boggart+Auntie), staring at him next to [Nath's Elite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nath%27s+Elite) and and [Moonglove Extract](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Moonglove+Extract). Marijn moved to take out the Goblin lady, but cautioned himself and remembered his complete lack of removal. So [Moonglove Extract](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Moonglove+Extract) it was. "I needed the removal, and I didn't want to screw Jan over if he was in red", explained Marijn afterwards. He was feeding Jan Doise, a fellow Belgian, and preferred cooperative drafting.


Then came a second pick Warren Pilferes over [Wren's Run Vanquisher](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wren%27s+Run+Vanquisher) and [Elvish Branchbender](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elvish+Branchbender). Another pick where Marijn commented: "I so regretted taking [Warren Pilferers](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Warren+Pilferers) over the Branchbender – then it tabled!" Yes, it came back. Because Elves were not really in demand...


Pick three: [Lys Alana Huntmaster](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lys+Alana+Huntmaster) #3.  

Pick four: [Leaf Gilder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leaf+Gilder) ("I wish I had more of these", Marijn said after the draft).  

Pick five: [Lys Alana Huntmaster](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lys+Alana+Huntmaster) #4.


Assorted Elves joined Marijn's swarm in the last picks, like [Moonglove Winnower](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Moonglove+Winnower), [Elvish Branchbender](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elvish+Branchbender) and the third [Jagged-Scar Archers](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jagged-Scar+Archers). What can you say? Even though Marijn had few mana fixers and even less removal, the four Huntmasters formed a more than solid backbone for this deck. Ultimately, Marijn ended up with 18 Elves, threatening to simply run his opponents over with a lot of creatures. He had picked one [Hurly-Burly](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hurly-Burly) away, so it wouldn't devastate him, but that card can be a dreamcrusher against his deck.


"I guess I can't complain", said the Belgian. "I guess I could want some removal, but I have these", pointing at two [Lys Alana Scarblade](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lys+Alana+Scarblade)s. The allegedly most popular tribe – Faeries – doesn't worry Marijn at all. He indicated his three [Jagged-Scar Archers](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jagged-Scar+Archers): "These are good against Faeries!" Very true. We'll see if the Belgian can keep up his run!

December 16th, 10:17 a.m.: Feature match round 11: Richard Hoaen (CAN) vs Marijn Lybaert (BEL)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


*by Hanno Terbuyken*

Marijn: "Is your deck good?"  

Rich: "It's okay. Yours?"  

Marijn: "It should be good, but it didn't deliver in the first round."


**Game 1:**


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gpstu07/rhoaen.jpg) The Canadian mastermind kicked off with [Runed Stalactite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Runed+Stalactite) and [Squeaking Pie Sneak](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Squeaking+Pie+Sneak). Marijn curved out with his deck, accelerating into [Lys Alana Huntmaster](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lys+Alana+Huntmaster) with [Leaf Gilder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leaf+Gilder) and prepared to bury Hoaen under a barrage of Elves. [Nath's Elite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nath%27s+Elite) won a clash for Marijn and gave him Elven Promenade.


Rich: "Don't do that again."


The Belgian's attack sapped six, then ten life from Hoaen. At one life, Hoaen had ran out of blockers.


Rich Hoaen 0, Marijn Lybaert 1


**Game 2:**


Again, Marijn had acceleration (this time with [Fertile Ground](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fertile+Ground)), and Rich Hoaen had [Runed Stalactite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Runed+Stalactite). Marijn merely played [Elvish Branchbender](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elvish+Branchbender) this time instead of one of his four Huntmasters. Rich Hoaen seemed to hope that he could stall the ground with Hrnet Harassers and start pecking through the air with [Thieving Sprite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thieving+Sprite), but [Jagged-Scar Archers](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jagged-Scar+Archers) made that plan collapse. Instead, the Canadian used [Peppersmoke](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Peppersmoke) to get rid of [Skeletal Changeling](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skeletal+Changeling) at an opportune moment, and attacked on the ground. Hornet Harrassers with [Runed Stalactite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Runed+Stalactite), Sneaking Pie Sneak and [Thieving Sprite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thieving+Sprite) stood against Marijn's Archers, [Elvish Branchbender](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elvish+Branchbender) and [Nath's Elite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nath%27s+Elite) (with a clash counter).


Marijn took it and went to 4. The Belgian seemed to have something up his sleeve, as he tried to work out how to deal the requisite 18 damage to Rich Hoaen. A Forest (thanks, Branchbender!) and the Elite took Hoaen to 9 and into kill range. Marijn had left enough blockers behind to survive one more turn, at just one life. But Rich Hoaen had different plans.


P.S.: [Tarfire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarfire) you.


Rich Hoaen 1, Marijn Lybaert 1


**Game 3:**


"You got pretty lucky there were no pro-Elves guys in the draft", Rich analyzed, while Marijn hypothesized: "I would have won that game if I had played first." The two players knew the value of having the first crack in Lorwyn draft. Rich commented that yesterday, he didn't care, but today, the first play would be a contested privilege.


Again, Rich Hoaen led with [Squeaking Pie Sneak](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Squeaking+Pie+Sneak), killed by [Moonglove Extract](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Moonglove+Extract). Marijn wished he had kept the removal two turns later, as Rich presented [Mudbutton Torchrunner](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mudbutton+Torchrunner) and [Tar Pitcher](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tar+Pitcher). Both kill nearly every creature in Marijn's deck, so the Belgian was not in an enviable position.


Torchrunner 2-for-1'ed Marijn as exected, and the Belgian had to build anew with [Lys Alana Huntmaster](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lys+Alana+Huntmaster). The second Huntmaster in his hand was hit by a [Mournwhelk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mournwhelk), the one in play caught [Weed Strangle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Weed+Strangle), but the third one stuck. Only by now, Rich Hoaen had [Axegrinder Giant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Axegrinder+Giant) in play to waltz over Marijn. "There is no good block here", sighed the Belgian when Rich came to town with the the Giant and a new [Mudbutton Torchrunner](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mudbutton+Torchrunner).


Marijn blocked the 'runner, lost his third Huntmaster and went to 6. He saw no way to escape the Giant. Scooping his lands up, Marijn shook his head: "I played bad."


Rich Hoaen 2, Marijn Lybaert 1


"Are you playing the two mana 1/1? The [Scarred Vinebreeder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scarred+Vinebreeder)? I think he's really good," Rich Hoaen advised. Marijn had to admit that he didn't have any, and mourned his deck's lack of punch in the face of opposing removal. With the Huntmasters gone, the Elf deck seemed to be not explosive enough to break through a ground stall.


  


December 16th, 11:47 a.m.: News and Notes
-----------------------------------------


*by Hanno Terbuyken*

\* Yesterday, head judge Riccardo Tessitori announced that 30 players had returned an illegal decklist. With almost 1340 players there, that is not nearly as much as it could have been.


\* Ace podcaster Rich Hagon used his stand-up comedy roots to make up the Lorwyn movie trilogy: Lorwyn 1 – Mayhem in the Meadows, with the two sequels Lorwyn 2 – Massacre on the Moor and Lorwyn 3 – The Killing Fields.


\* Two players managed to finish a match with a 3-2 record in yesterday's main event. How does that work, you might ask? Easy: One of them played [Incendiary Command](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Incendiary+Command), chosing the Pyroclasm effect and the Winds of Change. Unfortunately, the two players treated it like a Wheel of Fortune, discarding their hands and both drawing a new hand of seven. That, of course, is drawing extra cards. Both players simultaneously received a game loss, bringing the match to a 2-2 result. But with enough time left in the round, the players still had to play to determine a winner, and the match ended 3-2.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gpstu07/ben.jpg)*Ben Coleman doing quite well on table 1, under the heedful eyes of GP teen Morgane Kelterbaum.*\* Ben Coleman, assistant podcaster, has been trying something new this weekend: "Inside the GP", it's called. Ben has been playing all weekend, bringing an inside look at how a GP works to the listeners out there. After round 12, he sports an X-3-1 record, much better than the two podcasters had expected. He'll keep on playing until he loses another match, and then return to his regular podcasting duties. Meanwhile, Ervin Tormos has been helping Rich Hagon out, providing his insight and draft coverage.


  


December 16th, 12:19 p.m: Taking names in the first draft
---------------------------------------------------------


*by Daniel Ullenius*

What were some of the big names playing? Is blue really the favorite color of the upper echelon of Magic? We took a look to see what they had cooking.


**Gabriel Nassif:** U/W Merfolk  

Nassif first picked a [Sygg, River Guide](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sygg%2C+River+Guide) in the first pack over an [Oblivion Ring](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oblivion+Ring), a choice he admitted to regret when he ended up with a deck without very many good Merfolks. The deck will tries to go with the aggro-plan instead of the more common mode of "flip your adversaries libraries into their graveyards whilst gaining lots of life before anyone can do anything". Double [Benthicore](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Benthicore) helped a lot with the beatdown, but Nassif was not satisfied with his deck, having not enough card quality.


**Shuuhei Nakamura:** B/U/w Merfolk/Faeries  

The man from Japan drafted what is probably one of the best draft decks in the room. As if [Wydwen, the Biting Gale](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wydwen%2C+the+Biting+Gale) was not flashy enough, Shuuhei also had three Sentinels of Glen Elandra. Together with the awesome stopping power of [Guile](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Guile) plus Cryptic AND [Profane Command](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Profane+Command) it gives  

Nakamura-san what can be described as a Limited version of the Sonic Boom-deck.


**Raphael Levy:** B/U Merfolks/Faeries  

Raph decided to go black after picking up [Dread](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dread) as his first pick in the first booster. He then continued into blue when he got a [Mistbind Clique](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mistbind+Clique) and an [Aethersnipe](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aethersnipe) together with two [Silvergill Adept](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Silvergill+Adept), and the rest of the deck built itself.


In one game, Levy started with a turn two Adept, followed by a revealed [Silvergill Douser](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Silvergill+Douser). A Plover Knight from the opponent a couple of turns later was condescended by [Broken Ambitions](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Broken+Ambitions), and a [Goldmeadow Harrier](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goldmeadow+Harrier) was denied by a [Spellstutter Sprite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spellstutter+Sprite). Raphael charged and passed the turn, and in his opponents upkeep, down came a 4/4 Flying Time Walk. And the Hall of Famer had [Fallowsage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fallowsage) and [Aethersnipe](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aethersnipe) in hand to deal with any mass removal. Good Game.


**Guillaume Wafo-Tapa:** G/W Kithkin/Elves  

The resident genius went against the flow among the pros and drafted an aggressive white/green Kithkin/Elves deck that exchanged the power of bombs for the raw almost-constructed power provided by turn one [Goldmeadow Stalwart](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goldmeadow+Stalwart)s, turn two [Wren's Run Vanquisher](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wren%27s+Run+Vanquisher) and a turn three [Imperious Perfect](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Imperious+Perfect). If having eight power on the table on turn three, with your opponent already being damaged, was not enough, the deck would continue to swarm the enemy with [Jagged-Scar Archers](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jagged-Scar+Archers) and extremely synergistic [Woodland Changeling](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Woodland+Changeling)s, not to forget flying 3/3 First Strikers.


**Andre Coimbra:** G/R/b Treefolk  

If Wafo-Tapa tried to go against the majority of pros with his Green/White aggro deck, then Portuguese pro Andre Coimbra must have tried harder. Green/red Treefolk is probably not the most common archetype, but when you get the entire Treefolk team, including a splashed [Thorntooth Witch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thorntooth+Witch), you do not complain to much. However, the deck's synergy does not end there. With almost all of his creatures having 3 toughness or more, [Ashling the Pilgrim](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ashling+the+Pilgrim) and [Incendiary Command](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Incendiary+Command) will Wrath of God away his opponents board, while leaving Coimbra's men free to move in for the kill. And in case those two Plauge Winds wouldn't do the job, the Portuguese also had a midgame bomb in the enormous [Cloudthresher](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloudthresher).

December 16th, 2:20 p.m.: Feature match round 13: Raul Porojan (DEU) vs Vasicek Martin (SVK)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


*by Daniel Ullenius*

Both players started of knowing that however won would be preparing for some Top-8-Magic. Raul Porojan played a Giant/Elemental deck with lots of [Smokebraider](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Smokebraider)s and [Stinkdrinker Daredevil](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stinkdrinker+Daredevil)s, whilst Vasicek Martin played a very similar deck, but with lots of synergistic Goblins.


**Game 1:**


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gpstu07/porojan.jpg)*Raul Porojan on the way to his second GP Top 8.* Vasicek won the die roll and opted to play. Both players started off with Mountain openings, but the first play was from Vasicek who had [Ashling the Pilgrim](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ashling+the+Pilgrim), which grew to a 4/4 pretty quickly. Raul followed up with [Stinkdrinker Daredevil](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stinkdrinker+Daredevil) into an [Axegrinder Giant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Axegrinder+Giant), which put considerable pressure on Martin.


Vasicek played a 3/2 Adderstaff Boggart and clashed [Nameless Inversion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nameless+Inversion) against Porojans Swamp. Porojan charged ahead with the Axegrinder on the following turn, and the Giant drew blood. It turned out that the nightmare for Vasicek had only begun when Raul played an [Hamletback Goliath](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hamletback+Goliath).


Martin had a knife to his throat and decided to charge in with Adderstaff to see if Raul had forgotten about [Nameless Inversion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nameless+Inversion): The removal spell could have destroyed a blocking Hamletback. Porojan played it smart, did not block, and answered with a [Shriekmaw](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shriekmaw) the next turn, which put his opponent into scoop mode.


Raul Porojan 1, Vasicek Martin 0


**Game 2:**


Vasicek was on the play again, but decided to go to Paris before starting. He looked really unhappy when scanning his new six, but decided to keep. Both players started with two lands, but Raul had a [Smokebraider](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Smokebraider) on turn 2. Vasicek could not kill it, but instead of a crazy early elemental it attacked for one.


Martin started to gain some ground as he played [Tar Pitcher](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tar+Pitcher) and a Marsh Fitter, killing [Smokebraider](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Smokebraider) with a pitched token. Raul thought for a while, and then played an Elemental Harbinger, fetching [Shriekmaw](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shriekmaw). Martin charged in to the red zone after a [Caterwauling Boggart](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Caterwauling+Boggart) had joined his team, making them very difficult to block. The newly-drawn [Shriekmaw](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shriekmaw) from Raul killed the [Tar Pitcher](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tar+Pitcher), who took the [Shriekmaw](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shriekmaw) with him. [Warren Pilferers](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Warren+Pilferers) joined Vasicek's team, picked up the [Tar Pitcher](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tar+Pitcher) and swung for 8. Now it was Raul's turn to be under pressure, but Porojan took it cool and played [Giant Harbinger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Giant+Harbinger) for [Ghostly Changeling](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ghostly+Changeling).


Raul had bigger creatures, but Vascicek had an evil Boggart who made blocking a real hassle for Raul. A [Hornet Harasser](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hornet+Harasser) joined Martins team and killed the giant during combat, which put Raul on a very low 5 life. Elemental Harbinger for Martin got him a [Nameless Inversion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nameless+Inversion).


When all seemed lost for Raul, he played the [Ghostly Changeling](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ghostly+Changeling), followed by a [Thundercloud Shaman](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thundercloud+Shaman). [Weed Strangle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Weed+Strangle) killed the Giant, who had killed half of Vasicek's team, and the Changeling had to stand in the way of Vasicek's Pilferers.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gpstu07/martin.jpg)*Vasicek Martin representing Slovakia at the top tables.*Raul went into the think tank, and played a [Warren Pilferers](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Warren+Pilferers) of his own, returning his [Shriekmaw](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shriekmaw). The Pilferers died to an Inversion, and Martin swung for 4. The flier died to yet another [Nameless Inversion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nameless+Inversion), and on his turn Raul played his walking Terror, killing off Vasiceks newly summoned [Tar Pitcher](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tar+Pitcher). However, when Vasicek found [Eyeblight's Ending](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eyeblight%27s+Ending) for the [Shriekmaw](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shriekmaw) on the top of his library, the game was over.


Raul Porojan 1, Vasicek Martin 1


Its not exiting if its not down to one game, right?


**Game 3:**


Raul kept his opening seven, while Martin was not content with his draw. The next six were more his cup of tea, and he kept.


The unusual start Mountain vs Mountain was followed by a turn one Elemental Harbinger for Martin, fetching him a [Nameless Inversion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nameless+Inversion). Raul gave the Inversion a target with [Stinkdrinker Daredevil](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stinkdrinker+Daredevil), and Vasicek missed a land drop on his turn. Raul started to build up pressure with [Lowland Oaf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lowland+Oaf), and next turn [Warren Pilferers](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Warren+Pilferers) got him the Stinkdrinker back and he swung for 6.


Martin played a small but deadly [Mudbutton Torchrunner](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mudbutton+Torchrunner), but that did not keep Raul from charging into the red zone. Mudbutton killed the Oaf, and an [Axegrinder Giant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Axegrinder+Giant) join his team. Martin passed and killed the attacking, axe-wielding Giant with [Eyeblight's Ending](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eyeblight%27s+Ending).


Raul built an army of elementals with [Flamekin Brawler](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flamekin+Brawler) and [Ceaseless Searblades](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ceaseless+Searblades). Vasicek thought for a while, and then played [Boggart Loggers](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Boggart+Loggers). Raul had the superior board position and charged with Pilferers and the Searblades. Vasicek took three like a man and Raul played his Stinkdrinker again. Martin fought with another [Lowland Oaf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lowland+Oaf) of his own, but a discount Heartcage Giant from Raul ended the game and took him to the Top 8.


Raul Porojan 2, Vasicek Martin 1


  


December 16th, 2:53 p.m.: Draft feature with Shuuhei Nakamura
-------------------------------------------------------------


*by André Coimbra*

During the last seasons, Magic has been dominated by the Japanese players that have been attending lots of Grand Prix and posting solid scores at the Grand Prix circuit, as well as the Pro Tours. One of the faces of the Japanese dominance over our favorite game is one of Japan's finest: Shuuhei Nakamura. Today, at the first table in the second draft of Grand Prix Stuttgart, the Japanese player needed a 2-1 score to get a shot at the GP title and the chance to get a good start in the Player of the Year race. Before the draft, he talked about his preference for blue in this draft format, as he thinks it is the best color overall.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gpstu07/shuuhei_2.jpg)*Amidst the press of press, Shuuhei Nakamura appeals to a higher power.*The story of this draft could have been about how Shuuhei Nakamura got the blue deck he wanted so much. However, the first booster didn't provide any good blue cards at all, so our Pro Player got to choose between [Moonglove Extract](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Moonglove+Extract) and [Incandescent Soulstoke](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Incandescent+Soulstoke), trying to not get into any kind of non-blue tribal theme by taking the artifact. I think I saw his eyes shining when he happily second picked [Surgespanner](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Surgespanner) over [Tar Pitcher](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tar+Pitcher) and [Briarhorn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Briarhorn). On the third pick, he faced another interesting choice in a booster without any blue interesting cards, as he got to choose between [Avian Changeling](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Avian+Changeling) and [Changeling Hero](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Changeling+Hero), picking [Avian Changeling](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Avian+Changeling). There weren't many blue or black cards going around in the remains of the first booster, so Shuuhei chose to pick the best cards from the remaining three colors that were available at each pack. Most of them were white.


Surely if you get lots of white cards on the first booster, you don't mind to see [Cloudgoat Ranger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloudgoat+Ranger) as your first pick of the second booster. That is exactly what happened to Shuuhei Nakamura, when he took only a split second to make his choice. Still on this booster, the Level 5 mage faced the choice of [Goldmeadow Stalwart](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goldmeadow+Stalwart) over [Masked Admirers](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Masked+Admirers), showing that if he couldn't play blue, he would like to draft a fast white tempo deck, in order to try to beat the slower decks at the table. Rounding out this booster, he got some fast creatures and combat tricks in white and green, sticking with his tempo plan.


The third booster started just like the first one, giving Shuuhei a [Moonglove Extract](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Moonglove+Extract), which he took over [Shapesharer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shapesharer). Following the [Moonglove Extract](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Moonglove+Extract) came the hardest pick of the draft, as he had to choose between [Avian Changeling](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Avian+Changeling), [Epic Proportions](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Epic+Proportions) and [Changeling Hero](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Changeling+Hero) – which is pretty much the same choice he got on the first booster, but with a [Epic Proportions](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Epic+Proportions) to make it harder. Once again, he took [Avian Changeling](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Avian+Changeling), proving that if there was a reason to take it in the first booster, the same reason applies in the third booster.


On his third pick of the third booster, he saw another [Shapesharer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shapesharer), but [Kinsbaile Balloonist](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kinsbaile+Balloonist) seemed better than splashing the blue card in his white/green deck. The last interesting choice came in the fourth pick, where he got to choose between a possible third [Avian Changeling](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Avian+Changeling), [Plover Knights](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plover+Knights) or a splashable Doran. Any guesses? Surely he likes [Avian Changeling](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Avian+Changeling) a lot, but this time he took [Plover Knights](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plover+Knights) over it, in order to get some mid-game when the initial rush wouldn't be enough to win the game on the spot.


In the end, he built a solid fast white deck, featuring some green for combat purposes and utility creatures, as well as some aggressive creature drops with evasion. Is this a recipe for another Top 8 finish, or maybe even his third Grand Prix win? Keep an eye on the coverage to find out!


  


December 16th, 3:30 p.m. – Tighter than a Tight Thing
-----------------------------------------------------


*by Rich Hagon*

Remember those 25 players who made it to 7-2 last night but still didn't get a chair at the Sunday dance? Well, as I write 15 players are battling it out for 8 spots at the top table, as the first Sunday Shootout of the new season comes into focus. Japan's Shuuhei Nakamura and Belgium's Fried Meulders are just two of the contenders who can't be safe despite a stellar 12-2 record. Can they make it in?

December 16th, 2:40 p.m.: Feature match round 13: Robert van Meedevort (NLD) vs Marc Vogt (DEU)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


*by Hanno Terbuyken*

Marc Vogt is the story of the tournament. The young German won 12 matches in a row, leading the Swiss and acing his first draft pod – all without byes! It was his first GP ever, and his march to 36 points was certainly impressive. After the second draft, he met Robert van Meedevort at the feature match table. The Dutchman is certainly no stranger to the limelight, being part of last year's title-winning Netherland's National team. He was in a win-and-in situation, because at 33 points, a win would give him enough leeway to eke out a Top 8 appearance.


**Game 1:**


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gpstu07/vogt.jpg)*Not a very happy looking Marc Vogt, although he still had every chance for Top 8.*Marc was quickly ahead on permanents, with [Shapesharer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shapesharer), [Pestermite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pestermite) and [Elvish Harbinger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elvish+Harbinger). But Robert was ahead in terms of power: He dropped [Nova Chaser](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nova+Chaser), pumped and hasted it with [Inner-Flame Acolyte](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inner-Flame+Acolyte) and smashed for 12. Marc was tapped out and fell to 6, but had [Shapesharer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shapesharer) to defend and [Cloudgoat Ranger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloudgoat+Ranger) to help him out. Paying for the Ranger left him tapped out, though, and Robert used that window of opportunity to trample over Marc's four creatures after frying the [Cloudgoat Ranger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloudgoat+Ranger).


The German prodigy fell to 1. Even though Robert lost the [Nova Chaser](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nova+Chaser), he sat on a comfortable 11 life. A turn later, [Moonglove Extract](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Moonglove+Extract) from the Durchman finished off the German.


Robert van Meedevort 1, Marc Vogt 0


**Game 2:**


"This is the first time I've lost a Game 1 at this GP", said Marc, illustrating his 12-0 run. He was on the play to try and take yet another match, but had no permanent to stop Robert's [Flamekin Brawler](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flamekin+Brawler). [Fire-Belly Changeling](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fire-Belly+Changeling) joined the Dutchman's team, and Marc finally joined the fray with [Kinsbaile Balloonist](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kinsbaile+Balloonist).


Robert championed [Nova Chaser](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nova+Chaser) again, going to 8 from the next attack but still looking good. He had [Moonglove Extract](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Moonglove+Extract) to kill Marc's Imperial Perfect and smashed with the Chaser at the next possible opportunity. It dealt no damage: Marc had [Aethersnipe](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aethersnipe) to get rid of the [Nova Chaser](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nova+Chaser) pro tem, as it were.


[Changeling Hero](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Changeling+Hero) from Marc promised more permanent help, to give him a solid life buffer between Robert van Meedevort and the end of his winning streak. 12-15 in favor of Vogt were the life totals, and the German regained balance by dispatching Robert's new [Imperious Perfect](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Imperious+Perfect) with [Moonglove Extract](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Moonglove+Extract).


[Nova Chaser](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nova+Chaser) from Robert was held at bay by Marc's [Stonybrook Angler](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stonybrook+Angler), and then killed by [Neck Snap](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Neck+Snap). Marc produced [Shapesharer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shapesharer) and a [Cloudgoat Ranger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloudgoat+Ranger), and that was game. Or was it? robert tried to keep himself alive and kicking, but with now two [Changeling Hero](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Changeling+Hero)es facing him, the Dutchman needed a miracle. Robert managed to kill half of the Changeling duo, but Marc had a *third* [Changeling Hero](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Changeling+Hero), and finally was game.

**Game 3:**


Robert tried to get early pressure on with [Ethereal Whiskergill](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ethereal+Whiskergill), taking Marc to 15. I got a glimpse of the German's hand, and the two [Changeling Hero](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Changeling+Hero)es there had apparently made him keep those seven.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gpstu07/meedevort.jpg)*"Crack my knuckles, end your streak": Robert van Meedevort tried to stop the high flyer.*The problems with Champions is, though, that you need creatures to champion. And Robert was burning every one of Marc's critters with [Lash Out](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lash+Out) and [Moonglove Extract](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Moonglove+Extract), even winning the clash on Lash out. All the while, Robert's creatures were whittling away at Marc's life.


The German had his back against the wall. [Smokebraider](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Smokebraider) and [Incandescent Soulstoke](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Incandescent+Soulstoke) had relentlessly taken him to a very low life total. Marc had fewer creatures than Robert and could not stop the bleeding. On one life, the German died with three [Changeling Hero](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Changeling+Hero)es in his hand, and his winning streak was broken.

December 16th, 3:36 p.m.: Feature Match round 14: Fried Meulders (BEL) vs Raphael Levy (FRA)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


*by André Coimbra*

Even when players travel overseas to play on the Grand Prix circuit, there are still some important matches played by players from the same continent. At Grand Prix Stuttgart, it was no different. The Belgian Fried Meulders played against Raphael Levy in a match where the defeated player would be out of Top 8 contention.


**Game 1:**


Meulders got a blistering start with a second turn [Woodland Changeling](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Woodland+Changeling), third turn [Blind-Spot Giant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blind-Spot+Giant). The only answer that Levy found for that start was an Evoked [Aethersnipe](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aethersnipe) on his third turn and then [Glen Elendra Pranksters](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glen+Elendra+Pranksters) to block the Changeling Bear. As if one [Woodland Changeling](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Woodland+Changeling) and one [Blind-Spot Giant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blind-Spot+Giant) was not enough for Meulders, he played another one of each, putting more pressure on the table. Levy played [Warren Pilferers](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Warren+Pilferers) to get his [Aethersnipe](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aethersnipe) back and killed one of the [Woodland Changeling](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Woodland+Changeling) on his opponent's turn, when he got attacked with the full team.


[Aethersnipe](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aethersnipe) bounced a Giant again and Levy was ready to kill some of the opposing team with his big creature, but a [Flamekin Spitfire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flamekin+Spitfire) on Meulders' second main phase ruined Levy's plans, giving him a big edge on the table. Raph played [Thieving Sprite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thieving+Sprite) and his opponent discarded his only card: [Changeling Hero](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Changeling+Hero), this being the last play before the French player conceded.


During sideboarding, Raphael Levy took a deep breath and commented: "That was a good draw".


Fried Meulders 1, Raphael Levy 0


**Game 2:**


The Belgian native repeated his first turns from Game 1, but this time Raphael Levy played an early [Deeptread Merrow](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deeptread+Merrow) and a [Thieving Sprite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thieving+Sprite) to slow Fried down. The Belgian used [Lash Out](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lash+Out) and a [Flamekin Spitfire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flamekin+Spitfire) which gave him a small edge. Levy played [Glen Elendra Pranksters](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glen+Elendra+Pranksters), as well as [Inkfathom Divers](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inkfathom+Divers), getting [Warren Pilferers](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Warren+Pilferers) from the top four cards of his Library and switching to attack mode with his flier. To fight an evasion war, Meulders played [Bog-Strider Ash](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bog-Strider+Ash) and started attacking back.


Some people say that sometimes, defending is the best strategy to be offensive, and using that philosophy, the French player bounced the opposite [Woodland Changeling](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Woodland+Changeling) with his [Aethersnipe](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aethersnipe), making the Giant useless. Levy followed it up with an attack. What the Hall of Fame player missed was [Crush Underfoot](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crush+Underfoot), which killed [Aethersnipe](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aethersnipe) on his end of turn and allowed Fried to get an attack in, taking Levy to 4 life.


[Thieving Sprite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thieving+Sprite) discarded [Changeling Hero](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Changeling+Hero) and revealed card [Elvish Harbinger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elvish+Harbinger). [Flamekin Spitfire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flamekin+Spitfire) killed the small Faerie. When Fried Meulders attacked with his Giant, Levy blocked with his remaining Faerie, played [Footbottom Feast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Footbottom+Feast) and recovered all his creatures from the graveyard. That allowed him to cast his [Aethersnipe](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aethersnipe) again, after which Fried conceded.


Fried Meulders 1, Raphael Levy 1


**Game 3:**


Meulders decided to keep his initial seven cards, and when Levy was resolving his first mulligan, he asked if Meulder had the "god draw" again. If Meulders had answered that question, the answer would probably have been no. This time, Meulders played [Fire-Belly Changeling](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fire-Belly+Changeling) instead of [Woodland Changeling](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Woodland+Changeling) on his second turn, not having Forests to play green spells. The third turn gave [Springleaf Drum](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Springleaf+Drum) to the Belgian player, allowing him to get some green mana, but chose to attack with [Fire-Belly Changeling](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fire-Belly+Changeling) instead. That allowed Levy to play [Glimmerdust Nap](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glimmerdust+Nap), as he was aware of the possibility of leaving Fried Meulders color screwed.


Meulders missed a land drop and Levy played [Dreamspoiler Witches](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dreamspoiler+Witches). However, on the next turn Meulders got a Forest and played [Changeling Berserker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Changeling+Berserker), which replaced the Changeling creature and attacked. Levy chumpblocked with his flying creature and got it back on the next turn with [Warren Pilferers](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Warren+Pilferers). That ended up trading with Changeling Berseker, but two [Bog-Strider Ash](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bog-Strider+Ash) gave the edge on the table to Fried Meulders. [Incendiary Command](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Incendiary+Command) finished his job of making Top 8 at GP Stuttgart.

December 16th, 4:45 p.m.: The Final Round
-----------------------------------------


*by Jörn Martin Hajek*

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gpstu07/boehmler.jpg)*Aaron Boehmler, local hero, did not manage to be the third German in the Top 8.*Going into the final round, four players were guaranteed to play in the Top 8: Jonathan Bergström, Robert van Medevoort, Raul Porojan, and Marc Vogt all had 37 points. As they were paired amongst each other, they could draw to reach the magic number of 38. Behind them, eleven players were fighting for the last four spots. Italy's Patrizia Golia would face veteran Menno Dolstra of the Netherlands; Joel Calafell from Spain was up against Belgium's Jan Doise; and local hero Aaron Boehmler would have to defeat another Belgian player, Fried Meulders. These six all had 36 points before the last round, which meant that with a win they would be in, and a loss would eliminate them from the tournament. Provided that all games would come to a conclusion, these three would account for three of the last four seats in the play-offs.


Martin Vasicek from Slovakia also had 36 points, and if he would win his game against Shuuhei Nakamura, he would take the last spot. However, if Nakamura, who had 34 points going into this round, would win, he would give a chance to him and three other players on 34 points to make it, so Roman Steinert, Tomoharu Saitou, and Kenny Öberg would be rooting for him.


Patrizio Golia had drafted a red-green deck with a splash of white for [Brion Stoutarm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brion+Stoutarm). His deck also featured [Chandra Nalaar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chandra+Nalaar). One of these two spoilers in each of the games was all he needed to defeat Menno Dolstra's white-green Kithkin deck.


Jan Doise also had Chandra on his team, but his black-red-green deck would have a much harder time against Joel Calafell's unlikely alliance of blue faeries and red giants. Doise was already down one game, had to take a mulligan, and then saw himself forced to keep a hand with forests and red cards. He was behind from the start, but fought his way back, and when Chandra made her appearance, it seemed like he could turn the tide. But a [Fathom Trawl](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fathom+Trawl) gave Calafell [Wings of Velis Vel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wings+of+Velis+Vel), which was enough to push the last points through.


Fried Meulders was playing a red-green giants deck, splashing for [Changeling Hero](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Changeling+Hero). In the end, his creatures proved too big for Aaron Boehmlers Kithkin, already decimated after an [Incendiary Command](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Incendiary+Command).


Shuuhei Nakamura had drafted mono-white Kithkin as well, but he proved to be much more successful than Aaron Boehmler. He was the first one to finish his match, beating amateur Martin Vasicek in two quick games. He had the best opponent's score of the players on 34 points, and could claim the last place in the top 8.


  


December 16th, 6:10 p.m.: Drafting with Robert van Medevoort
------------------------------------------------------------


*by Jörn Martin Hajek*

Robert van Medevoort had an easy 15th round. He could just draw with his opponent and then prepare for the top 8 draft. He would be facing Patrizio Golia from Italy in the quarterfinals.


Before the draft, podcasting colleague Ben Coleman had announced that he was sure that Medevoort would be drafting Merfolk. Some people like to read the signals before committing to a deck, but Medevoort seemed to like Merfolk enough to force them.


 



![Shapesharer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Shapesharer)

His first pick reflected that: His choices were [Moonglove Extract](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Moonglove+Extract), [Dreamspoiler Witches](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dreamspoiler+Witches), [Fallowsage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fallowsage), [Shapesharer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shapesharer), and [Sentinels of Glen Elendra](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sentinels+of+Glen+Elendra). He went with the [Shapesharer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shapesharer) – a Merfolk, and potentially the biggest one he would get. For his next pack, he would again have a choice between [Fallowsage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fallowsage) and [Moonglove Extract](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Moonglove+Extract), and went with the Merfolk.

Somebody less set on a certain strategy might have just taken the two Extracts, keeping all options open. But on the other hand, the advantage of choosing your path right away is the possibility to take the stronger picks.


But there are disadvantages as well. Take the next booster: It had [Marsh Flitter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Marsh+Flitter) and [Weed Strangle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Weed+Strangle), but he had to consider actually taking the much less powerful [Broken Ambitions](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Broken+Ambitions) or [Springleaf Drum](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Springleaf+Drum). In the end, he took the [Weed Strangle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Weed+Strangle) anyway. Next up was a [Judge of Currents](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Judge+of+Currents), which he picked up happily. But then he had to go black again, when no quality blue or white cards showed up: [Thieving Sprite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thieving+Sprite) and [Peppersmoke](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Peppersmoke) were his next picks.


The rest of the first pack was uneventful. Medevoort's deck was leaning more towards Faeries then towards the Merfolk he had wanted in the first place.


Pack two saw him go back and forth between Merfolk and Faeries. It seemed like he would always get a good white card which would really draw him back to Merfolk, just to get passed a pick that only contained black cards. He started with [Cloudgoat Ranger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloudgoat+Ranger), but had to take [Dreamspoiler Witches](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dreamspoiler+Witches) as second pick. Then it was [Sygg, River Guide](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sygg%2C+River+Guide), followed by [Footbottom Feast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Footbottom+Feast). He managed two pick up two more Merfolk, [Amoeboid Changeling](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Amoeboid+Changeling) and [Judge of Currents](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Judge+of+Currents), but at the end of pack two he only had around 15 playables, spread over the three colors.


The last round gave him some much needed power, but had him dip into a fourth color as well: [Brion Stoutarm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brion+Stoutarm) joined the team, picked over [Merrow Harbinger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Merrow+Harbinger) and [Pestermite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pestermite). [Profane Command](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Profane+Command) then made sure he could abandon neither white nor black. Medevoort spent the rest of the time picking up some essential mana-fixing.


In the end, he played a base-black deck, with five or six cards in both blue and white, and a tiny red splash for Brion. At this point, it was hard to say whether deciding on a strategy beforehand actually paid off. We will have to see how he does. As he said himself, he could easily win this if he drew only from the good half of the deck. But he could just as easily die horribly to mana problems.


  


December 16th, 6:20 p.m.: Draft report Joel Calafell
----------------------------------------------------


*by André Coimbra*

Joel Calafell might be playing his first Grand Prix Top8, but he used to be one of the play testing partners of his countryman Javier Dominguez and one of the designers responsible for the popular Cephalid Breakfast. For this draft he wasn't planning to draft any specific archetype, instead, he was looking to see what was underdrafted and try to draft that.


 



![Galepowder Mage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Galepowder+Mage)

He started his draft by opening a booster with [Galepowder Mage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Galepowder+Mage), followed by a [Mulldrifter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mulldrifter) that came directly from his right. While his next picks were not hot, somehow he managed to get a 5th pick [Pestermite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pestermite), which is usually considered by the Pros a first pick quality card. Getting mostly white and blue cards in this booster left him with a hard choice when he had to choose between [Hillcomber Giant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hillcomber+Giant) and [Vivid Meadow](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vivid+Meadow). Mana fixing might be an important issue in Lorwyn drafts, but, as he was only with two colors at the moment and didn't have any plans for splashing, he opted to pick the Giant, as it provided a tool to fight the red decks and a way to improve his [Kithkin Greatheart](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kithkin+Greatheart).

If Joel was happy to get to fifth pick [Pestermite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pestermite) on the first booster, he wasn't less happy to first pick it in the second booster, taking it over [Neck Snap](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Neck+Snap). For his second pick he had a hard time deciding between [Kithkin Greatheart](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kithkin+Greatheart) and [Lash Out](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lash+Out). [Lash Out](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lash+Out) is better than [Kithkin Greatheart](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kithkin+Greatheart), but he already had one and a giant he was going to play. He ended up taking [Lash Out](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lash+Out). The third pick gave him an another interesting choice, as he took [Neck Snap](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Neck+Snap) over [Sentinels of Glen Elendra](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sentinels+of+Glen+Elendra), demonstrated that [Pestermite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pestermite) is higher on his picklist than the Sentinels. His colors dried out after that, but he still was able to get some mana fixing in order to splash his [Lash Out](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lash+Out).


In the third booster he opened [Kithkin Harbinger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kithkin+Harbinger), [Profane Command](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Profane+Command), [Sentinels of Glen Elendra](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sentinels+of+Glen+Elendra) and [Kinsbaile Balloonist](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kinsbaile+Balloonist). He took the [Kithkin Harbinger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kithkin+Harbinger), as it allowed him to tutor for his best card so far: Glenpowder Mage. For his second pick of the third booster, he was lucky enough to be passed a [Purity](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Purity), which he took quite fast. After that he got so more fixers, some more playable cards for his deck, but nothing really interesting.


Joel Calafell was happy with his deck and he needed to be, as he was going to face the player at the table with the most achievements in his Quarterfinal match: Shuuhei Nakamura.


  


December 16th, 10:50 p.m.: Tying up the lose ends
-------------------------------------------------


*by Hanno Terbuyken*

Another GP has gone by, the last one of the year, and the first one of the new season. And again, I did not have enough time during the day to bring you all the stories. For example, I did not tell you anything about the two artists on site, Wayne England and Mark Tedin. Especially Mark Tedin had endless lines of people queuing up, to get their old classics signed. [Sol Ring](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sol+Ring), [Mana Drain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Drain), [City of Brass](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=City+of+Brass), [Mana Vault](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Vault), the list is impressive.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gpstu07/tedin_england.jpg)*Mark Tedin and Wayne England*
Also, you didn’t read anything about the numerous side events that happened. The side event team ran 93 8-man draft queues on Saturday, and 109 8-man drafts on Sunday. The second day of the GP also saw a Grand Prix Trial happen, with 48 players grabbing their Extended decks. A 2HG event with 93 teams. A Legacy tournament with 86 players. A Vintage tourney with 28 players. And a special draft event: Germany’s biggest Magic website,  [www.planetmtg.de](http://www.planetmtg.de), had given away 16 seats in a draft event extraordinaire. Wizards Germany had sponsored 16 draft sets made of 10th Edition cards, each with one booster of Commons only, one booster of Uncommons only, and one booster pack consisting of Rares only. Yes, that’s right: Each player had the guarantee of 15 rares, and the decks were pretty ridiculous.


I think that pretty much covers it. Join the magicthegathering.com coverage team next year, when the 2008 season gets into full swing, and merry christmas and a happy new year to all of you!
