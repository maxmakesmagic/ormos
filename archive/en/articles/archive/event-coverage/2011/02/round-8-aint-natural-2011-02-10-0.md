### Patrick Chapin vs. Ben Stark (Draft)

"Congrats, man."

"Thanks, you too. It's a pretty good start to a Pro Tour right? I'd probably take 7-1 if someone offered it to me at the start of the day."

"I wouldn't. If I were playing for 7-1 Day 1, I would have a job!"

Patrick Chapin was uncompromising in his search for a perfect record, while his opponent, Ben Stark, was perhaps a little more philosophical about the happy situation the two American pros had found themselves in.

"There's a list of ten drafters that when they tell me the opposite of what I think is true, I find that I was wrong and learn something new," said Chapin. "Ben is definitely on it, along with Gabe Walls, William Jensen, Eric Froehlich, Richie Hoaen, and Kenji Tsumura amongst others."

Chapin continued with the high praise, stating that before about 2007, he really didn't see himself as much of a Limited player. This would be an interesting match.




### Game 1


Both players kept, and Stark led with a [Signal Pest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Signal+Pest). He followed up with [Ichorclaw Myr](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ichorclaw+Myr), threatening a slightly faster poison clock. When he followed with [Vector Asp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vector+Asp) and [Infiltration Lens](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Infiltration+Lens) before Chapin had even played a third land, it seemed that the preamble could end up longer than the game. Chapin's red-blue deck had a plan against green-black infect, though. He cast a [Blisterstick Shaman](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blisterstick+Shaman) to off [Ichorclaw Myr](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ichorclaw+Myr), and the next turn had an [Oxidda Scrapmelter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oxidda+Scrapmelter) for [Infiltration Lens](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Infiltration+Lens), leaving Stark's board suddenly unimpressive.

Ben played a [Tumble Magnet](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tumble+Magnet) and passed, now unwilling to attack. The [Tumble Magnet](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tumble+Magnet) held off [Scrap](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scrap)melter, leading Chapin to get stuck in for just 2 points, before playing [Ferrovore](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ferrovore) and [Oculus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oculus). Having taken four poison early, Chapin appeared to be right back in the game.

Stark swung in with [Vector Asp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vector+Asp) and [Signal Pest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Signal+Pest), and when [Oculus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oculus) stood in the way, he unleashed first [Unnatural Predation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Unnatural+Predation) and then [Mirran Mettle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mirran+Mettle), to get in for exactly the 6 points of infect damage he needed.

**Stark 1, Chapin 0**

"I'll draw."

"I hate playing against smart people. It's so much easier when I play against people who mindlessly choose to play every single time."

Stark and Chapin are among the players most apt to question the conventional wisdom of always playing first when given the option. Even in Constructed at events like Pro Tour Hawaii, Stark identified that being on the draw was correct for his deck, and wished that he'd done so even more.




### Game 2


The second game, on the play, Stark had a slightly ropier draw. With only [Forest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest)s for the first four turns, his [Moriok Replica](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Moriok+Replica) and [Vector Asp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vector+Asp) seemed a little ineffective. A [Trigon of Infestation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Trigon+of+Infestation) looked good while it was briefly in play, but [Oxidda Scrapmelter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oxidda+Scrapmelter) from Chapin was quick to off the token generator.

Chapin had a [Neurok Replica](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Neurok+Replica) alongside his [Scrap](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scrap)melter, which quickly fell to [Sylvok Replica](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sylvok+Replica) while Chapin was tapped out. Chapin replaced it with [Ferrovore](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ferrovore) and passed. Stark was now up to six lands, but each was [Forest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest), and he could only nod as he saw an [Argent Sphinx](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Argent+Sphinx) from Chapin. At end of turn, Stark played [Carrion Call](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Carrion+Call). He'd already shown some combat tricks, but it seemed unlikely that Chapin was in immediate danger. When Stark tried for a [Corpse Cur](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Corpse+Cur), it was stopped by [Steel Sabotage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Steel+Sabotage), and Chapin's Game 2 victory seemed all but complete. While it would take a few turns for the Sphinx to end the game, Stark's deck seemed to lack the power it had shown in Game 1.

"Better lucky than good," remarked Patrick, of his good fortune in Game 2.

"Well, I had a nuts draw in Game 1, which means it probably balances out."

Chapin cast an end of turn [Galvanic Blast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Galvanic+Blast) after Stark played [Flesh-Eater Imp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flesh-Eater+Imp).

"This can't be good," remarked Stark sagely. When Chapin cast [Volition Reins](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Volition+Reins) on Stark's only flyer, it seemed that Ben was correct in his assertion. He scooped up his cards.

**Stark 1, Chapin 1**

With the option for the game that would decide which of the pair would be undefeated on Friday morning, Stark elected to draw.

"I hate playing against smart players," smiled Chapin.




### Game 3


The first play of the game was a turn-three [Oculus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oculus) from Chapin, before he used [Steel Sabotage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Steel+Sabotage) to stop a [Phyrexian Digester](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phyrexian+Digester). The little 1/1 got stuck in, and Chapin again had the counter, this time a [Stoic Rebuttal](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stoic+Rebuttal), to stop [Carrion Call](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Carrion+Call). Stark cycled a [Tel-Jilad Defiance](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tel-Jilad+Defiance), but had no more plays. He wasn't under a quick clock, but equally he wasn't presenting one.

After a little thought, Stark cast a [Liquimetal Coating](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Liquimetal+Coating), and used it targeting Chapin's only [Mountain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mountain). He then cast a [Viridian Corrupter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Viridian+Corrupter) to off the land. The [Corrupt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Corrupt)er fell to [Burn the Impure](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Burn+the+Impure) in response, but Stark didn't seem to mind. He cast a [Flesh-Eater Imp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flesh-Eater+Imp) the following turn, and looked to get back in the game.

A [Halt Order](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Halt+Order) from Chapin stopped [Sylvok Replica](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sylvok+Replica), but it seemed that this game the [Liquimetal Coating](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Liquimetal+Coating) could prove decisive, as Chapin, with all his card drawing, could not find another [Mountain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mountain). Stark's Imp attacked for two poison, then another two before Chapin finally drew some sort of an answer in [Argent Sphinx](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Argent+Sphinx).

Stark went deep into thought, then proclaimed that in point of fact, he really didn't need to be thinking so hard. He attacked, and [Unnatural Predation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Unnatural+Predation) followed by [Untamed Might](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Untamed+Might) sealed things in decisive fashion.
