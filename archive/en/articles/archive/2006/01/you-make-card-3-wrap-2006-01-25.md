We're done!


Starting almost a year ago (and yes, we're making plans to ensure **You Make the Card #4** has a much tighter schedule), we've had nine steps and six votes. The last one was on the card's flavor text and here's how it went:




| **Which should be the flavor text for Vanish Into Memory?**  |
| *Out of sight, into mind.* | 5458 | 24.0% |
| *Its absence brings wealth, and sadness;
 Its return, both joy and madness.* | 3115 | 13.7% |
| *"Death is a hero's first step to immortality." - Boros Drill Master* | 2766 | 12.2% |
| *A dream is just a reality vanished into memory. A reality is a dream come true.* | 2689 | 11.8% |
| *"Knowledge manifested from power, memory vanished from weakness...."* | 2641 | 11.6% |
| *A memory is what is left when something happens and doesn't completely unhappen.* | 1485 | 6.5% |
| *"Shut eyes memorize; open eyes mesmerize." - Wizard's incantation* | 1457 | 6.4% |
| *Which do you choose; fleeting valor or wisdom soon unremembered?* | 1418 | 6.2% |
| *...and emerge as possibility.* | 961 | 4.2% |
| *The trick is not to find treasure in the mind, but to keep it with open eyes.* | 723 | 3.2% |
| **Total** | **22713** | **100.0%** |

And that means that *Out of sight, into mind* is our winner.


The winning flavor text was submitted by Thomas Lefler. And Mike Lose. And also Tim Ebert, as well as Robinson Mead and somebody who goes by just "Chris." Congratulations to all five of them.


As a special treat for finishing this incarnation of **You Make the Card**, I thought I'd treat you with the first preview card from the *Coldsnap* expansion coming out. Click here to see it.

Yes, Vanish Into Memory has been slotted for *Coldsnap*. And just between you and me, the fact that the entire readership of **magicthegathering.com** came up word for word (and art for art) with a card the *Ice Age* designers made over a decade ago only to be misplaced in Richard Garfield's file cabinet for ten years is staggering. Staggering! (You all seem okay with the brain in the jar running R&D so work with me here.)


I think you guys did an excellent job and I'm excited to see what happens when Vanish Into Memory finally sees print. Once again, good job!
