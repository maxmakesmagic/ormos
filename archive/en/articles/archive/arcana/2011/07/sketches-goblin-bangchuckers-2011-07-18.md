Welcome back to another edition of Sketches! Today we're looking at some explosion-happy goons: Wayne Reynolds's [Goblin Bangchuckers](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Bangchuckers)!

### Artist Portfolio

Artist [Wayne Reynolds](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?action=advanced&artist=%5B%22Wayne+Reynolds%22%5D) has illustrated eighty-eight **Magic** cards along with an untold amount of [Dungeons & Dragons](/en/articles/archive/event-coverage/2006-champs-limited-2006-06-27-15) pieces. He's great!

### Art Description

The first step of the creation of a card's art is its art description. The art description tells the artist what the card will do, what its flavor is, and what the mood of the illustration should be. Here were the instructions Wayne was given for the card that was named "Goblin Explosioneers" at the time:


> 
> Color: Red creature
> 
> 
> Location: Battlefield or mountain setting
> 
> 
> Action: Show two goblin soldiers who are in charge of the "bang-chucker," an explosive-hurling contraption that you are free to make up. Perhaps it's a wide device that yolks across both of their shoulders with the flinging structure between their heads. maybe one of the goblins peers into an aiming-glass on the device, waiting expectantly with his hand out for the ammunition, and the other goblin fumbles with a spiky metal ball (or a wad of explosive wrapped in butcher's paper held together with twine with a wick coming out of it) that looks like it's about to explode at any moment. (It's a cartoony situation, but keep the style relatively straight.)

> 
> Focus: The two goblin "explosioneers"
> 
> 
> Mood: Incompetence mixed with high explosives -- a goblin specialty.

### Sketches

With that art description to work with, Wayne submitted a sketch to the **Magic** creative team:

The creative team liked it, although they wanted to make sure that the final version wasn't too cartoony. Aside from that, the tone was perfect. Let's go!
