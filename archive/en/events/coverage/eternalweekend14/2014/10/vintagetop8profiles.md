### Dario Moreno


**Age:** 34  
**Occupation:** Architect  
  

**Previous *Magic* Accomplishments:** 
  
I lost every game at SCG Worcester last weekend!
 



**What did you play this weekend? Why?**
  
I played Blue/Red Delver because I started playing the deck months ago and now with [Treasure Cruise](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treasure+Cruise) it's insane.
 



**What would you change about your deck if you played it next weekend?**
  
Nothing. Maybe Fire//Ice.
 



**What has been the most important card in your deck this weekend? Why?**
  
[Mental Misstep](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mental+Misstep) by far.




**What would winning the Vintage Championship mean to you?**
  
It would be my first tournament win. I've never done it before.

### Christian Griffin


**Age:** 32  
**Occupation:** ES Technician  
  

**Previous *Magic* Accomplishments:** 
  
Once beat Michael Rooks at FNM
 



**What did you play this weekend? Why?**
  
Temur Delver. I've been playing Delver in Legacy since I saw the first Blue/Red Delver list.
 



**What would you change about your deck if you played it next weekend?**
  
I might try [Izzet Staticaster](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Izzet+Staticaster) in the sideboard.
 



**What has been the most important card in your deck this weekend? Why?**
  
[Trygon Predator](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Trygon+Predator). I played it against Mishra's Workshop decks all day!

I would never let Richard Johnson live it down.

### Harry Corvese


**Age:** 26  
**Occupation:** Professional Vintager  
  

**Previous *Magic* Accomplishments:** 
  
Four Grand Prix Top 8s, 32,171 lifetime planeswalker points.
 



**What did you play this weekend? Why?**
  
[Oath of Druids](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oath+of+Druids) because it seemed like Blue/Red Delver would be very popular. So said Kurt Speiss.




**What would you change about your deck if you played it next weekend?**
  
My sleeves.
 



**What has been the most important card in your deck this weekend? Why?**
  
All the broken cards have been spectacular, but [Dig Through Time](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dig+Through+Time) really shined in round nine.
 



**What would winning the Vintage Championship mean to you?**
  
I have always wanted to break into Vintage and this would be a great start! I see that there is an awesome Vintage community and I hope to do them proud!

### Ryan Glackin


**Age:** 34  
**Occupation:** Online Store Manager, Alternate Universes  
  

**Previous *Magic* Accomplishments:** 
  
Top 4 2011 Vintage Champs, Top 8 2010 Vintage Champs, Top 9 2012 Legacy Champs, A few NYSE Vintage tournament wins, A random PTQ Top 8.
 



**What did you play this weekend? Why?**
  
Blue/Red Delver. I took Rich Shay's Vintage Super League list and made a couple adjustments to suit my style. (More bolts!) I honestly didn't know what I was playing until last night after running well in Legacy Champs with a similar deck.
 



**What would you change about your deck if you played it next weekend?**
  
I might try to find room for one more [Gush](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gush). Switch out the [Izzet Staticaster](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Izzet+Staticaster) for either [Electrickery](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Electrickery) or CIRCLE OF FLAME.
 



**What has been the most important card in your deck this weekend? Why?**
  
[Time Walk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Time+Walk), not close. Watch my feature match against Joel. It's way more than a Blue [Explore](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Explore). Sometimes, I cast it twice in a single game.




**What would winning the Vintage Championship mean to you?**
  
Keeping this beautiful painting in the state of Pennsylvania. Promotion to "full member" on TMD. (Maybe "Vintage Adept" if I'm lucky)

### Ryan Eberhart


**Age:** 28  
**Occupation:** Mathematician  
  

**Previous *Magic* Accomplishments:** 
  
Won an FNM
 



**What did you play this weekend? Why?**
  
Temur Delver. I've been playing it a ton on *Magic Online*, and it has some busted turns.
 



**What would you change about your deck if you played it next weekend?**
  
I'd like to improve the Oath matchup. Maybe [Trygon Predator](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Trygon+Predator)?
 



**What has been the most important card in your deck this weekend? Why?**
  
[Treasure Cruise](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treasure+Cruise). Five [Ancestral Recall](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ancestral+Recall) is better than one.




**What would winning the Vintage Championship mean to you?**
  
It would mean I need someone to help me pick out a good place for the painting. I'm just happy to be in Top 8

Fenton and Mike R built it for me right before the tournament!




**What would you change about your deck if you played it next weekend?**
  
I need custom Greg Fenton tokens.
 



**What has been the most important card in your deck this weekend? Why?**
  
[Maelstrom Pulse](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Maelstrom+Pulse), but no, seriously, it was [Oath of Druids](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oath+of+Druids)




**What would winning the Vintage Championship mean to you?**
  
I don't have to sell my possessions to pay rent. Also Greg Fenton is a wondrous celestial creature.
