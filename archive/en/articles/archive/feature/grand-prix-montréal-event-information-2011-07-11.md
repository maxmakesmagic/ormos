In addition to a spectacular main event, a host of exciting competitive and casual tournaments will be offered at this event. The venue is located in the heart of the city, just a short walk from the some of the most vibrant and lively streets in Montréal, including historic “Old Montréal.” Whether it’s an entire weekend of **Magic**, or some card playing coupled with great food, night life, or anything else you might find in this beautiful city, Grand Prix Montréal has something to offer everyone.


All participants will be given a foil Maelstrom Pulse with entry (while supplies last). In addition, Grand Prix Montréal will be offering a collector’s edition deck box with entry (while supplies last). This deck box is the seventh in a series of eight boxes given out at this year’s North American Grand Prix. Each of them features a segment of artwork by Steve Argyle. When all eight boxes are placed side-by-side, the entire piece can be seen as a mural. 


*The **Magic: The Gathering**  Grand Prix tournament series is a great reason to get out of the house, catch up with old friends, meet some new ones, and play **Magic**. Grand Prix tournaments are world-wide open events that allow all **Magic**  players to participate and experience the thrill of a large-scale competition. In addition to $30,000 in cash prizes, Pro Tour invitations for the top 16 finishers, and exclusive foil promo cards for participants, Grand Prix feature a host of other activities, including public events and artist signings (prizes subject to change).
