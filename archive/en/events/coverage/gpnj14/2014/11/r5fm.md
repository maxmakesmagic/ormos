How does a former member of Wizards R&D match up against a recent Grand Prix Champion? It's actually a tricky question since both are also Pro Tour Top 8 competitors.



 Gerry Thompson was a longtime player, touring the country for Grand Prix and following along the StarCitygames Open Series before making his breakthrough to a Pro Tour Top 8 at Pro Tour *Gatecrash*. It wasn't long thereafter he took up the mantle as an intern at Wizards of the Coast. With a recent return to the competitive scene, Thompson was again on his country-crossing tour to rise to the top of the game.




 Michael Sigrist is another longtime player, though he's having the year of his *Magic* career: With a Grand Prix Top 8 in Richmond, a Grand Prix win in Washington D.C., and a Pro Tour Top 8 at Pro Tour *Khans of Tarkir* just over a month ago, Sigrist's streak stretched over months. Already battling to relative success in an oversized event at Richmond, Sigrist was more than familiar with the tenacity needed at top.




**The Decks**




 Thompson had prepared a straightforward Blue-Red Delver deck for the weekend. When *Khans of Tarkir* joined the Legacy retinue of sets three cards jumped to the forefront. Two of them, [Treasure Cruise](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treasure+Cruise) and [Monastery Swiftspear](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Monastery+Swiftspear), served to push Blue-Red Delver to new heights. A deck filled with cheap spells, ready to pump a Swiftspear or transform a [Delver of Secrets](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Delver+of+Secrets), combines well with the potential to cast a de facto [Ancestral Recall](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ancestral+Recall) multiple times in every game.



It was a battle tested true at several Legacy events coming into the weekend, and it proved popular among the top pros that attended.



 Sigrist, however, elected to bring a deck that used the third *Khans of Tarkir* card to impact the format: [Dig Through Time](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dig+Through+Time). The Jeskai Miracles deck was outfitted with the potent Sensei Divining Top and Counterbalace duo, which played well with cards like [Terminus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Terminus) and [Entreat the Angels](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Entreat+the+Angels). [Dig Through Time](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dig+Through+Time) joins in by sifting seven cards deep and leaving a fresh layer of three on top for Top to tap into.




 Like Blue-Red Delver, Sigrist's deck was another big winner from recent Legacy showdowns. This match was one of the many times the two decks clashed.




**The Games**




 Thompson started, leading with an early [Delver of Secrets](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Delver+of+Secrets) – that flipped before falling to [Swords to Plowshares](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swords+to+Plowshares) – and a second. Sigrist simply brought Sensei's Divining Top online to begin massaging his deck.




 With his second [Delver of Secrets](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Delver+of+Secrets) transformed, Thompson pressed his aggressive advantage with [Chain Lightning](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chain+Lightning) to put Sigrist down to 10 life. [Pyroblast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyroblast) was Sigrist's answer the second time, though he decided to hold back from casting [Counterbalance](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterbalance) to leave mana for [Brainstorm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brainstorm).




 With a stocked graveyard, Thompson had a "one mana" [Treasure Cruise](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treasure+Cruise) which sent Sigrist into a flurry of [Brainstorm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brainstorm) and using his [Flooded Strand](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flooded+Strand).




 "I'm not playing [Blood Moon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Moon)," Thompson offered when Sigrist went for his third dual land.



There was a pause before the game progressed. "Sure," was Sigrist's ultimate response to Thompson's Cruise.



 "Yay!" Thompson said with glee before reloading his board with [Monastery Swiftspear](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Monastery+Swiftspear) and a third [Delver of Secrets](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Delver+of+Secrets). [Terminus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Terminus) off the top was exactly what Sigrist needed (He had left it there with his Sensei's Divining Top.) but Thompson fought back with [Force of Will](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Force+of+Will).




 "Yup." It wasn't was Sigrist wanted to say after his in-response-to-Force [Dig Through Time](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dig+Through+Time) resolved. While Sigrist sat at 8 life, he only fell to 6 on Thompson's attack. [Counterbalance](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterbalance) finally made its appearance on Sigrist's turn, and he set up drawing a second [Terminus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Terminus) next.




 When Thompson flipped [Delver of Secrets](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Delver+of+Secrets) on his next upkeep Sigrist pulled that trigger. Thompson tried [Young Pyromancer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Young+Pyromancer) instead, but Sigrist used [Force of Will](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Force+of+Will) to keep the battlefield clear. A second [Treasure Cruise](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treasure+Cruise) tugged Thompson back into things with his second [Young Pyromancer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Young+Pyromancer), which fell to [Swords to Plowshares](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swords+to+Plowshares) from Sigrist.






*Thompson had his hands filled by Treasure Cruise throughout the match.*
