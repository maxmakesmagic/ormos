With in excess of 20 years of **Magic** sets to pick from, the number of viable decks in Legacy is mind-boggling. Since there are so many, let's just get started, shall we?


**RUG Delver/Canadian Threshold** – This long-time favorite runs 18 lands including four [Wasteland](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wasteland)s which are hardly ever used for mana production, manages to get by with the help of [Brainstorm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brainstorm) and [Ponder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ponder), adds further disruption in [Stifle](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stifle), [Daze](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Daze), and [Force of Will](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Force+of+Will) plus a little firepower in [Lightning Bolt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt), and kills with cheap threats like [Delver of Secrets](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Delver+of+Secrets), [Nimble Mongoose](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nimble+Mongoose), and [Tarmogoyf](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf).


**Stoneblade** – On the control side of the aggro-control spectrum, this deck features [Stoneforge Mystic](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stoneforge+Mystic) for [Batterskull](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Batterskull), [Umezawa's Jitte](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Umezawa%27s+Jitte), and usually one Sword of somethong-or-other along with [Swords to Plowshares](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swords+to+Plowshares) in white, a few counterspells, the ubiquitous [Brainstorm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brainstorm), [Jace, the Mind Sculptor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace%2C+the+Mind+Sculptor), [Snapcaster Mage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snapcaster+Mage), and [True-Name Nemesis](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=True-Name+Nemesis) as an equipment bearer in blue, and mosten often adds black for a bit of discard, sometimes [Lingering Souls](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lingering+Souls), or the odd [Vindicate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vindicate).


**BUG Delver** – Also called "Team America," the deck resembles its red-blue-green counterpart, but uses [Deathrite Shaman](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deathrite+Shaman) instead of [Nimble Mongoose](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nimble+Mongoose) to go a little higher on the mana curve, enabling more potent disruption like [Hymn to Tourach](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hymn+to+Tourach) and [Abrupt Decay](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Abrupt+Decay) as well as stuff like [Tombstalker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tombstalker) and [Liliana of the Veil](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Liliana+of+the+Veil).


**Storm** – This deck's game usually starts with a library manipulation and/or discard spell, next are mana rituals and artifacts like [Lion's Eye Diamond](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lion%27s+Eye+Diamond) and [Lotus Petal](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lotus+Petal), then comes [Infernal Tutor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Infernal+Tutor) or [Burning Wish](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Burning+Wish), [Ad Nauseam](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ad+Nauseam) or [Past in Flames](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Past+in+Flames) to continue chaining spells, and finally there's [Tendrils of Agony](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tendrils+of+Agony) or [Empty the Warrens](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Empty+the+Warrens) for the killing blow, which can be dealt as early as turn one!


**Sneak and Show** – This deck's goal is to get a fast [Griselbrand](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Griselbrand) or [Emrakul, the Aeons Torn](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Emrakul%2C+the+Aeons+Torn) onto the battlefield via [Show and Tell](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Show+and+Tell) and/or [Sneak Attack](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sneak+Attack), and it uses [Brainstorm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brainstorm) and [Ponder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ponder) to find its combo parts, some countermagic to protect them, and some combination of [Ancient Tomb](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ancient+Tomb), [Lotus Petal](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lotus+Petal), and [City of Traitors](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=City+of+Traitors) for additional speed.


**Miracles** – One of the few true control decks of the format, this white-blue build includes a lot of the staples of the format like [Force of Will](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Force+of+Will) and [Swords to Plowshares](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swords+to+Plowshares), but also enlists, together with [Brainstorm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brainstorm) and [Jace, the Mind Sculptor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace%2C+the+Mind+Sculptor), the help of [Sensei's Divining Top](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sensei%27s+Divining+Top) to get full mileage out of [Terminus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Terminus), [Entreat the Angels](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Entreat+the+Angels), and [Counterbalance](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterbalance).


**UWR Stoneblade/Delver** – Rather new to scene, this hybrid retains the low land count and spell focus of other [Delver of Secrets](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Delver+of+Secrets) decks while adding a somewhat smaller Stoneblade package with just two equipments and two copies of [True-Name Nemesis](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=True-Name+Nemesis) along with four [Stoneforge Mystic](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stoneforge+Mystic)s, for a total of ten creatures.


**Jund** – Based on the time-honored strategy of putting all the best green, red, and black cards into one deck, the list here includes [Bloodbraid Elf](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodbraid+Elf), [Dark Confidant](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dark+Confidant), [Deathrite Shaman](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deathrite+Shaman), [Tarmogoyf](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf), [Abrupt Decay](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Abrupt+Decay), [Punishing Fire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Punishing+Fire) plus [Grove of the Burnwillows](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grove+of+the+Burnwillows), [Hymn to Tourach](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hymn+to+Tourach), [Thoughtseize](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtseize), and [Liliana of the Veil](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Liliana+of+the+Veil).


**Elves** – The deck quickly busts out a lot of Elves with particular help of [Gaea's Cradle](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gaea%27s+Cradle) and the [Heritage Druid](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Heritage+Druid)/[Nettle Sentinel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nettle+Sentinel) combination as well as the [Wirewood Symbiote](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wirewood+Symbiote)/[Elvish Visionary](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elvish+Visionary) combination, can draw an insane amount of cards with [Glimpse of Nature](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glimpse+of+Nature) in one big combo turn, and/or kill quickly by searching up [Craterhoof Behemoth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Craterhoof+Behemoth) with [Natural Order](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Natural+Order).


**Goblins** – Here, [Æther Vial](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=%C3%86ther+Vial) or [Goblin Lackey](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Lackey) lead the way for, among others, [Goblin Warchief](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Warchief), [Goblin Piledriver](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Piledriver), [Goblin Matron](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Matron), and [Goblin Ringleader](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Ringleader), while [Wasteland](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wasteland) and [Rishadan Port](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rishadan+Port) disrupt the opponent's mana.


**Merfolk** – The deck basically consists of a few counterspells, a set of [Æther Vial](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=%C3%86ther+Vial)s, and a whole lof of fish like [Lord of Atlantis](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lord+of+Atlantis), [Master of the Pearl Trident](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Master+of+the+Pearl+Trident), and [Merrow Reejerey](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Merrow+Reejerey) which pack quite a punch.


**Death and Taxes** – A white weenie deck with [Wasteland](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wasteland) plus [Rishadan Port](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rishadan+Port), [Thalia, Guardian of Thraben](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thalia%2C+Guardian+of+Thraben), [Phyrexian Revoker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phyrexian+Revoker), and [Aven Mindcensor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aven+Mindcensor) for disruption, [Æther Vial](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=%C3%86ther+Vial), [Flickerwisp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flickerwisp), and [Mother of Runes](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mother+of+Runes) for protection, and [Stoneforge Mystic](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stoneforge+Mystic) and [Mirran Crusader](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mirran+Crusader) for the beats.


**Imperial Painter** – [Ancient Tomb](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ancient+Tomb), [City of Traitors](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=City+of+Traitors), and [Simian Spirit Guide](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Simian+Spirit+Guide) enable an explosive opening, [Blood Moon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Moon), [Magus of the Moon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Magus+of+the+Moon), and [Red Elemental Blast](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Red+Elemental+Blast) offer disruption, [Sensei's Divining Top](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sensei%27s+Divining+Top) and [Imperial Recruiter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Imperial+Recruiter) offer some card selection, and [Grindstone](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grindstone), in combination with [Painter's Servant](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Painter%27s+Servant), dumps the opponent's library for the kill.


**Maverick** – Traditionally a green-white beatdown deck with a creature toolbox searchable via [Green Sun's Zenith](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Green+Sun%27s+Zenith) and a land toolbox searchable via [Knight of the Reliquary](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Knight+of+the+Reliquary), nowadays Maverick almost invariably splashes red for the [Grove of the Burnwillows](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grove+of+the+Burnwillows)/[Punishing Fire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Punishing+Fire) combo.


**Pox** – A mono-black deck that heavily attacks both the opponent's mana as well as hand with [Wasteland](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wasteland), [Sinkhole](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sinkhole), [Smallpox](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Smallpox), [Inquisition of Kozilek](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inquisition+of+Kozilek), [Hymn to Tourach](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hymn+to+Tourach), and [Liliana of the Veil](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Liliana+of+the+Veil), leaving a minimum of slots to provide the actual kill with [Mishra's Factory](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mishra%27s+Factory) and a couple of [Nether Spirit](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nether+Spirit)s and [Cursed Scroll](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cursed+Scroll).


**Nic Fit** – A black-green-blue midrange deck with a lot of variety that combines [Cabal Therapy](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cabal+Therapy) and [Veteran Explorer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Veteran+Explorer) to ramp into creatures larger than what one usually sees cast in Legacy.


**Omni-Tell** – This takes the shell of Sneak and Show (see above) but leaves out most of the creatures and [Sneak Attack](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sneak+Attack) in favor of [Omniscience](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Omniscience), [Dream Halls](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dream+Halls), and [Enter the Infinite](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Enter+the+Infinite).


**Reanimator** – [Careful Study](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Careful+Study) or [Entomb](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Entomb) bins a big creature like [Griselbrand](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Griselbrand) for [Reanimate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reanimate) or [Exhume](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Exhume) to get it onto the battlefield, while [Force of Will](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Force+of+Will), [Thoughtseize](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtseize), and/or [Daze](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Daze) offer disruption/protection.


**Tin Fins** – A reanimator deck with an even faster kill, which reanimates [Griselbrand](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Griselbrand) via [Shallow Grave](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shallow+Grave) or [Goryo's Vengeance](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goryo%27s+Vengeance), draws a bunch of cards, attacks, draws more cards, summons [Children of Korlis](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Children+of+Korlis) to gain yet more life/extra cards, and finishes the opponent with mana artifacts/rituals and [Tendrils of Agony](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tendrils+of+Agony).


**Dredge** – Playing mostly from the graveyard, this deck first needs to dump a dredge card like [Golgari Grave-Troll](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Golgari+Grave-Troll) per [Careful Study](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Careful+Study), [Faithless Looting](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Faithless+Looting), or [Putrid Imp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Putrid+Imp), then dredges and dredges more with [Breakthrough](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Breakthrough) or [Cephalid Coliseum](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cephalid+Coliseum), eventually getting a bunch of [Narcomoeba](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Narcomoeba)s and [Ichorid](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ichorid)s back from the grave, along with free copies of [Cabal Therapy](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cabal+Therapy) and [Dread Return](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dread+Return), creating a Zombie army via [Bridge from Below](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bridge+from+Below).


**Belcher** – Running as little as one [Taiga](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Taiga) as its only land, this deck instead uses [Elvish Spirit Guide](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elvish+Spirit+Guide), [Simian Spirit Guide](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Simian+Spirit+Guide), mana artifacts like [Chrome Mox](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chrome+Mox) or [Lotus Petal](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lotus+Petal), and all kinds of mana rituals, from [Rite of Flame](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rite+of+Flame) to [Pyretic Ritual](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyretic+Ritual), to either cast [Empty the Warrens](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Empty+the+Warrens) or cast and activate the eponymous [Goblin Charbelcher](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Charbelcher), killing on turn one or two.


**Allspells** – Similar to Belcher, here a player only needs four mana to cast/activate either [Balustrade Spy](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Balustrade+Spy) or [Undercity Informer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Undercity+Informer), dumping all of their library, which in turn triggers [Narcomoeba](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Narcomoeba)s, enables the casting of [Cabal Therapy](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cabal+Therapy) and [Dread Return](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dread+Return) to reanimte [Angel of Glory's Rise](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Angel+of+Glory%27s+Rise) and, with it, [Laboratory Maniac](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Laboratory+Maniac) plus [Azami, Lady of Scrolls](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Azami%2C+Lady+of+Scrolls) to win the game.


**High Tide** – This mono-blue engine combo deck generates a lot of mana with the help of its namesake card and untap spells like [Turnabout](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Turnabout) and—in different versions—*Time Spiral* or [Reset](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reset), draws a lot of cards with [Meditate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Meditate), and kills with [Brain Freeze](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brain+Freeze).


**Lands** – There are a couple of different decks running [Life from the Loam](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Life+from+the+Loam) and upwards of 30 lands including [Maze of Ith](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Maze+of+Ith), The Tabernacle of Pendrell Vale, [Wasteland](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wasteland) of course, [Dark Depths](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dark+Depths), and [Thespian's Stage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thespian%27s+Stage), one with [Exploration](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Exploration) and [Manabond](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Manabond), one with [Mox Diamond](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mox+Diamond), [Smallpox](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Smallpox), [Liliana of the Veil](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Liliana+of+the+Veil), and an [Entomb](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Entomb)-powered toolbox for the likes of [Raven's Crime](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Raven%27s+Crime) and [Punishing Fire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Punishing+Fire).


**Shardless BUG** – This black-blue-green aggro-control deck's mana curve runs higher than BUG [Delver](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Delver)'s for planeswalkers [Liliana of the Veil](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Liliana+of+the+Veil) and [Jace, the Mind Sculptor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace%2C+the+Mind+Sculptor), eschewing most countermagic for the eponymous Shardless Agent to cascade into [Ancestral Vision](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ancestral+Vision) set up by [Brainstorm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brainstorm).


**BUG Control** – One step further, then, is this deck which drops all creatures and [Ancestral Vision](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ancestral+Vision) in favor of more counterspells, more planeswalkers, [Pernicious Deed](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pernicious+Deed), [Innocent Blood](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Innocent+Blood), and [Standstill](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Standstill).


**Enchantress** – [Argothian Enchantress](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Argothian+Enchantress) and [Enchantress's Presence](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Enchantress%27s+Presence), along with [Wild Growth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Growth) and [Utopia Sprawl](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Utopia+Sprawl), build the basis for this old-time favorite, which aims to build an impenetrable fort with [Sterling Grove](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sterling+Grove), [Solitary Confinement](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Solitary+Confinement), or [Moat](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Moat), then win via [Sigil of the Empty Throne](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sigil+of+the+Empty+Throne) or [Rest in Peace](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rest+in+Peace)/[Helm of Obedience](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Helm+of+Obedience).


**Burn** – [Goblin Guide](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Guide), [Chain Lightning](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chain+Lightning), [Flame Rift](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flame+Rift), [Fireblast](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fireblast), [Price of Progress](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Price+of+Progress), [Sulfuric Vortex](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sulfuric+Vortex), and its ilk make for one very straightforward strategy.


**UR Delver** – The many flavors of [Delver](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Delver)s also include this two-color version which usually employs [Grim Lavamancer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grim+Lavamancer), sometimes [Young Pyromancer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Young+Pyromancer) and [True-Name Nemesis](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=True-Name+Nemesis) and more burn than its red-blue-green counterpart.


**Affinity** – Normally, [Arcbound Ravager](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arcbound+Ravager) and [Cranial Plating](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cranial+Plating) deliver the beats only in Modern but sometimes the robots rear their heads in Legacy too, and here they can even draw upon the power of [Seat of the Synod](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seat+of+the+Synod) and Co.


**Infect** – In Legacy, [Glistener Elf](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glistener+Elf), [Inkmoth Nexus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inkmoth+Nexus), and [Blighted Agent](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blighted+Agent) can be boosted not just with the more modern cards [Might of Old Krosa](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Might+of+Old+Krosa) and [Vines of Vastwood](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vines+of+Vastwood) but also, for example, with [Invigorate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Invigorate) and [Berserk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Berserk).


**MUD** – Often completely colorless, the deck starts with [City of Traitors](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=City+of+Traitors) or [Ancient Tomb](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ancient+Tomb), drops [Chalice of the Void](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chalice+of+the+Void) or [Trinisphere](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Trinisphere) for early defense, then ramps into unfair stuff via [Grim Monolith](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grim+Monolith) or [Metalworker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Metalworker), finishing with [Wurmcoil Engine](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wurmcoil+Engine), [Sundering Titan](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sundering+Titan), or [Kuldotha Forgemaster](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kuldotha+Forgemaster) for [Blightsteel Colossus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blightsteel+Colossus).


And that's a wrap. The 32 most likely candidates to be played this weekend are listed above, but still there's more. Some players may choose the combo deck named for its centerpiece [Aluren](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aluren), for example, some may dust off what is considered to be an out-dated archetype in Stax, and some may do weird stuff with [Rest in Peace](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rest+in+Peace)/[Energy Field](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Energy+Field)/[Helm of Obedience](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Helm+of+Obedience). Moreover, in Legacy even a shift of a few cards, what elsewhere would be a minor variation, can create a new decktype, and of course there's always the possibility for major innovation as well.


In any case, it's going to be an interesting tournament to watch!
