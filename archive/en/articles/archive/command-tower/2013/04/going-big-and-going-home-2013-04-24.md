Everybody loves [Varolz, the Scar-Striped](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Varolz%2C+the+Scar-Striped), or at least that's [what I gathered from you](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/ct/242). His flourishing body fungus (and likely halitosis) didn't deter a landslide of feedback about cards that work with him, and the palpable excitement about *Dragon's Maze* in general was clear as well.

 We'll get to *Dragon's Maze* proper later (you'll want to jump to the end if Varolz isn't your cup of Commander tea), but it's time to look over what Varolz means to you and which six cards you felt were indispensable for the legendary Troll Warrior. 

Theme Versus Value
 When [we first looked at](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/ct/242) [Varolz, the Scar-Striped](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Varolz%2C+the+Scar-Striped), we ended with a recap of the many angles of cards we could take with him: 

* Creatures you want to scavenge
* Creatures that put themselves into the graveyard while giving us effects
* Creatures you want to sacrifice
* Cards that care about the graveyard and sacrifice
* Cards that care about power or +1/+1 counters
* Cards that care about having lots of creatures
* Cards that are just awesome in black-green
The fact we can easily list this many options for approaching him led to diverse feedback, except for a handful of cards that appears in most of your lists:

* [Phyrexian Dreadnought](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phyrexian+Dreadnought) and [Death's Shadow](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Death%27s+Shadow)
* [Lightning Greaves](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Greaves) and [Swiftfoot Boots](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swiftfoot+Boots)
* [Corpsejack Menace](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Corpsejack+Menace) and [Riftsweeper](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Riftsweeper)
At least one of these six cards appeared in most of the lists you sent in, and they all serve different, valuable purposes.

[Death's Shadow](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Death%27s+Shadow), and its distant relative [Phyrexian Dreadnought](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phyrexian+Dreadnought), are the epitome of getting bang for your granting-scavenge buck. Generally, casting either card will let you move your creature to the graveyard immediately, where spending just one more mana will put a pile of +1/+1 counters on something. Maximizing your counters to mana spent is an easy idea to follow, but it comes at a price.
