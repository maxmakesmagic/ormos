The *Strixhaven* Arena Open Is Nigh!
====================================


It's almost here: the Arena Open will run May 8–9, just two days to catch the Arena Open experience, collect some *Strixhaven* digital swag, and maybe even pocket cash for the top prize by playing Sealed matches with *Strixhaven: School of Mages*.


On Day 1, get sleeves in either—or both—competitions:


* **Best-of-One**: Pick up the Rowan sleeve just for playing; seven wins earns you the Will sleeve.
* **Best-of-Three**: Pick up the Will sleeve just for playing; four wins earns you the Rowan sleeve.

Wins can get you gems, but the big prize is on Day 2. Get seven wins on Day 1, and you're invited to Day 2 where the rewards get really big—up to $2,000 big!


[Prepare yourself for the *Strixhaven* Arena Open](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/news/may-2021-arena-open-strixhaven-sealed-2021-04-22)!


Are You a Master Mage? Prove It in the College Cup
==================================================


Knowledge. Wit. Leadership. These are the qualities of a master mage. But one does not simply claim to have these qualities; they must be exhibited, tested, and proven. This is how a Strixhaven mage is *forged*, and it happens in the crucible of the College Cup!


* **May 13–18**: Test of Knowledge, in the Singleton Emeritus format
* **May 20–25**: Test of Wit, in 100-Card Treasure Standard format
* **May 27–31**: Test of Leadership, in *Strixhaven* Brawl format

This event is not only about spells and strategy—college pride and team effort score points that can change the face of *MTG Arena* for all to see!


Have these essential supplies during the tests to maximize your point-scoring potential:


* **College sleeves**: Get your college sleeves by taking [the Strixhaven Quiz](https://magic.wizards.com/en/products/strixhaven) and entering the code you receive in the emailed acceptance letter at [myaccounts.wizards.com](https://myaccounts.wizards.com/) or in the Store tab in *MTG Arena* on PC or Mac.
* **College avatar**: Each college's avatar is available in the second position in the *Strixhaven* Mastery web.

* **College tome pet:** Each college has a tome pet available within the first ten levels of the *Strixhaven* Mastery Pass rewards levels.

Each event is Best-of-One, and for your first event win each day while sporting your Strixhaven college sleeve, avatar, and pet, you'll earn bonus points for your represented college—or multiple colleges, because at Strixhaven, you can double or triple major by splitting points!


David McDarby gives you [everything you need to know to join the College Cup](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/magic-digital/college-cup-here-strixhaven-2021-05-05)!
