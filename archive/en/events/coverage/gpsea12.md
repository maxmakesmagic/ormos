Robert Smith's Cackling Counterpart Wins GP Seattle
===================================================




March 3-4, 2012












Grand Prix Seattle 2012
-----------------------


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/gpsea12/Champ.JPG)Early reports were mistaken, and it was not, in fact, the legendary front man of The Cure who Top 8'd Grand Prix Seattle. He may have entered the final draft eclipsed by the star power of Pro Tour Amsterdam Champion Paul Rietzl and reigning Player of the Year Owen Turtenwald, but quiet amateur Robert Smith acquitted himself like a pro and walked away a Champion.


Smith posted an 8-1 record during Day 1's sealed deck play, then followed it up with a 5-1 performance at draft. At a table marked by a wealth of powerful decks, Smith assembled a blue-black control deck with an awful lot going for it. The quarterfinals were a massacre, with all four matches ending in quick 2-0 results, and both Turtenwald and Rietzl fell in combat. Smith and his semifinal oppponent Jason Huang both earned qualifications for Pro Tour Avacyn Restored in Barcelona, but Smith's sights were set higher. After splitting the first two games, Huang gambled on a risky seven for the deciding game and paid the price.


Meanwhile in the other bracket, Californian semi-pro Iain Bartolomei was locked up with James Nguyen, whose red-black aggro deck was a favourite to win the event. Bartolomei's blue-white tempo build won the third game on the back of [Dearly Departed](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dearly+Departed) . He was forced into a third game against Smith, as well. Smith resolved a [Geistcatcher's Rig](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Geistcatcher%27s+Rig) to kill [Dungeon Geists](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dungeon+Geists) , and though it got sidelined by [Bonds of Faith](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bonds+of+Faith) , a backbreaking [Cackling Counterpart](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cackling+Counterpart) made sure he'd have two more two-for-ones against Bartolomei's many fliers, and the trophy was his.


Congratulations to Robert Smith, Grand Prix Seattle Champion!
