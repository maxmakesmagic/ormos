Esper Dragons because it's good against Abzan and because [Silumgar, the Drifting Death](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Silumgar%2C+the+Drifting+Death) was good for this tournament.



**What changes would you make to your deck and why?**



Some sideboard changes. Main deck was good, could also probably play two to three [Jace, Vryn's Prodigy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace%2C+Vryn%27s+Prodigy) main.



**What's the most important card in your deck?**

**Occupation:** Teacher




**Hometown:** Toulouse, France




**Previous Magic accomplishments:**



Finals of Grand Prix Utrecht 2014, Top 8 at Grand Prix Prague 2013.



**What deck did you play and why?**



Red-Black Dragons, because it's strong against Abzan Control and fights well against [Hangarback Walker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hangarback+Walker) and aggro.



**What changes would you make to your deck and why?**



Right now more [Bile Blight](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bile+Blight), because Goblin tokens are coming back. (Also Thopter tokens from [Hangarback Walker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hangarback+Walker).)

### Hannes Kerem

**Age:** 27




**Occupation:** World Magic Cup Player (employed again!)




**Hometown:** Keila, Estonia




**Previous Magic accomplishments:**



Almost World Champion a long, long time ago.



**What deck did you play and why?**



A fast Abzan deck, but I don't have much of an idea why.



**What changes would you make to your deck and why?**



Maybe move [Tasigur, the Golden Fang](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tasigur%2C+the+Golden+Fang) to the main deck and Ajani to the sideboard. My sideboard turned out to be quite pointless anyway.



**What's the most important card in your deck?**



Maybe [Dromoka's Command](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dromoka%27s+Command). Or [Fleecemane Lion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fleecemane+Lion), or [Hangarback Walker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hangarback+Walker).

**Age:** 32




**Occupation:** Civil servant

[Jace, Vryn's Prodigy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace%2C+Vryn%27s+Prodigy).

**Age:** 29

One Grand Prix Top 8.



**What deck did you play and why?**



Blue-Black Control. Because it's still well positioned against the current field.



**What changes would you make to your deck and why?**



I would figure out sideboard plans. There are some cards, like the third copy of [Jace, Vryn's Prodigy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace%2C+Vryn%27s+Prodigy) and the second [Tasigur, the Golden Fang](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tasigur%2C+the+Golden+Fang) that I never used.



**What's the most important card in your deck?**



The four copies of [Jace's Ingenuity](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace%27s+Ingenuity). The sideboard MVP is [Psychic Rebuttal](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psychic+Rebuttal).
