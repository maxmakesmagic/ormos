Effective immediately, we are making some changes to our reimbursement system and process. Based largely on player feedback, we are simplifying the claim filing as well as easing the requirements to receive reimbursement.


Making it easier to request and receive compensation when needed is an important part of our dedication to better serve our players.


**New Issue Report Form**


It is always our goal in supporting *Magic Online* to provide players with the best possible experience. Unfortunately, there are times when *Magic Online* may encounter issues or bugs. If this happens, we hope that you will [submit an issue report](http://wizards.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/668/~/magic-online%3A-reimbursement-requests-and-bug-reporting) and let us know what occurred. We’ve tried to narrow this form down to the essentials so players can get back to playing while still providing us with all the information we need to prevent similar problems in the future.


We’ve listed the answers to some common existing and potential questions below, in order to better explain the changes.


**Why does it have to be a form?**


Currently, the best way for us to address these issues is to gather the data we need to help you, and the best way to do that is through this form. However, if you need help with anything, from recovering your password to help with an order, you can reach us through any of the avenues [on our contact page](http://company.wizards.com/contact-us#company).


**What do we get from your reports?**


Our internal teams tag and log these reports so we have the best possible intelligence about what problems our customers are having. This helps us prioritize what we’re working on.


**What can we offer you?**


If you were in an event, we can return the entry option you used to enter the event. This is subject to the [terms and conditions you can view here](http://wizards.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/668/~/magic-online%3A-reimbursement-requests-and-bug-reporting).


**Will I get less reimbursement if I won prizes in my event?**


No. If Game Support determines you are eligible for reimbursement when you report an issue, we’ll grant your entire entry option back to your account, regardless of prizes won.


**Do you just give the same response to all emails?** 


We have staff members working around the clock to read each and every report that comes in. However, due to the volume of contacts that our Game Support team receives, we cannot provide a custom answer for each one of them and still get to everyone in a timely manner. Because we value you as a customer, we’ve updated all of these texts to be more succinct, and to let you know how to get further help if you need it.


**Won’t some players abuse this system?**


Reimbursement is only possible through the continued cooperation of our *Magic Online* community. To combat the less honest reports, we have staff members that are constantly on the watch for fraudulent activity. Filing false or fraudulent issue reports is a violation of the [Code of Conduct](http://company.wizards.com/policies/web/conduct). If you know or suspect that someone is abusing our issue report system, please [file a conduct report here](https://accounts.wizards.com/amlogin.aspx?p_next_page=ask%2fp%2f1713%2c525%2c529).


**Thank You!**


We want to thank you for playing *Magic Online* and for the part you play in helping us make it better. We'd love to hear from you! If you have feedback you'd like to share, please contact us via any of the avenues [on our contact page](http://company.wizards.com/contact-us#company). You can even find us on twitter [@Wizards\_Help](https://twitter.com/MagicOnline)!
