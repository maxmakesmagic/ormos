![Ninth Edition card image](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/mtgcom/fcpics/features/9e_cardTwo_7918276.jpg) The [Goblin King](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+King) has been in every core set since Alpha, but this time, he's got a new wrinkle: he's a Goblin! That's right, for the first time, if you have two [Goblin King](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+King)s out, they pump each other up. [Goblin Matron](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Matron) can now fetch the king. Finally, the Lord works well with his minions . . . and Lackeys.


![Ninth Edition card image](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/mtgcom/fcpics/features/9e_cardOne_9389272.jpg) Though this Johnny-friendly fellow from *Mercadian Masques* showed up in several different kinds of decks when he was in print, he’s never really found his niche. Will *Ninth Edition*  be [Groundskeeper](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Groundskeeper)'s chance to shine, particularly with *Saviors’* “hand-size matters” theme?


![Ninth Edition card image](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/mtgcom/fcpics/features/9e_cardThree_3960977.jpg)[Form of the Dragon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Form+of+the+Dragon) (from *Scourge*) is just neat. Who doesn't want to become a Dragon, looking down at opposing forces that can't attack on the ground, breathing fire in the face of other planeswalkers, and generally just dragonning it up?
