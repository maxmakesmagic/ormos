### Jarvis Yu


**Hometown:** Rockville, MD


**Profession:** Analyst


**What deck did you play this weekend? Why?**  

Red-Green Lands. It’s still great against non-[Lotus Petal](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lotus+Petal)/non-Miracles decks.


**What was the coolest deck you played against this weekend?**  

Abzan [Veteran Explorer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Veteran+Explorer) Ramp

### Christopher Walton


**Hometown:** Sort of Detroit (Milford, MI)


**Profession:**


**What deck did you play this weekend? Why?**  

White-Blue Miracles, it has reasonable matches and allowed me to play maindeck [Back to Basics](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Back+to+Basics) as a haymaker that allows me game in some tight matches.


**What was the coolest deck you played against this weekend?**  

Green-Blue Twelve Post. Easily my worst Matchup. I won, somehow without seeing a copy of [Back to Basics](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Back+to+Basics). Deck is powerful and interesting.


**What’s the most underrated card in Legacy right now?**  

Likely [Stoneforge Mystic](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stoneforge+Mystic). I should have tested a Blade deck for this event.

### Aaron Kasprzak


**Hometown:** Toronto, ON


**Profession:** Investments


**What deck did you play this weekend? Why?**  
[Ponder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ponder) Miracles because I’ve had a serious amount of practice with it in the last year and even in a [Chalice of the Void](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chalice+of+the+Void) meta the deck is still extremely powerful and consistent.


**What was the coolest deck you played against this weekend?**  

Goblins on Day 1. I like that people are still playing that deck.


**What’s the most underrated card in Legacy right now?**  
[Counterbalance](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterbalance).

### Joe Lossett


**Hometown:** Newport Beach, CA


**Profession:** Streamer/Investor


**What deck did you play this weekend? Why?**  

Legend Miracles, because the Year of Cavern never ends and I’m kind of in love with Venser.


**What was the coolest deck you played against this weekend?**  

Bryant Cook shot me for a ton with [Grapeshot](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grapeshot) while simultaneously clearing my creatures. So I guess his TES deck was the coolest.


**What’s the most underrated card in Legacy right now?**  
[Null Rod](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Null+Rod). It is good against several totally different decks so it can be used often as a very high impact card.

### Wilson Hunter


**Hometown:** Johnson City, TN


**Profession:** Sales Representative


**What deck did you play this weekend? Why?**  

Mentor Miracles. The [Brainstorm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brainstorm) show cast helped brew a list that we thought would be great in the current metagame.


**What was the coolest deck you played against this weekend?**  

Storm. It’s the coolest deck in Legacy.


**What’s the most underrated card in Legacy right now?**  
[Monastery Mentor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Monastery+Mentor). People know the card is pretty good
