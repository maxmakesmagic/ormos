And we're back! Another week of **Magic**, another week of **Magic** deck lists! First on the docket is Grand Prix-Bangkok, which Shingou Kurihara managed to take down through some tough competition. Fellow pros Ruud Warmenhoven, Martin Juza, Koutarou Ootsuka, and Yuuya Watanabe all gave him a run for his money, but Shingou was able to hold on! Of course, we've also got the latest Pro Tour Qualifier decklists for the Austin season, more Game Day lists, and don't forget, the latest from the digital realm of **Magic** on **Magic Online**.


Enjoy!
