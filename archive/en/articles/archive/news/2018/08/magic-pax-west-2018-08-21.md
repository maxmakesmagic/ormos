*Magic* will once again be taking part in PAX West this year. And it just so happens we're heading toward another *Ravnica* set. Weird.


PAX West takes place August 31 through September 3 in Seattle, WA. If you plan to come, there are three main ways you can interact with *Magic* over the weekend, and they're a bit different than previous years.


First, we'll have a panel Saturday, September 1, at 6:30 p.m. in the Sasquatch Theater at the Sheraton Seattle Hotel. We'll have product previews, worldbuilding highlights, and, if you're lucky, some card previews. These panels are always big draws, so come early, ask questions, and meet the people who make *Magic* happen. Hosted by Josh Lee Kwai.


Second, we'll have a learn-to-play booth on the Skybridge all weekend. Swing by and bring a friend to show them how to play the best game in the world. The cosplayer known as TappyToeClaws will be on hand (dressed as several characters throughout the weekend, including one from *Guilds of Ravnica*!) to help teach players how to play, and maybe to take a photo or twelve.


If you want to play, we're running play events with Mox Boarding House on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday evenings. If you've never been to the famous Mox Boarding House in Ballard, this is your opportunity! We'll have special guests and a different play experience each night.Â Space is limited, so be sure to stop by the learn-to-play booth for more information if you want to participate.


Until then, we'll see you at PAX West!
