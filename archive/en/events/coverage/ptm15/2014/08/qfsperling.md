It's been an emotional weekend for Matthew Sperling. This is Sperling's first Pro Tour Top 8 after playing for the better part of twenty years. His best friend, No. 11 Ranked Player Paul Rietzl, was elected to be a part of the 2014 Hall of Fame Class this weekend. Usually, Sperling does testing with the Team ChannelFireball Pantheon, but work commitments prevented him from being able to take part in their testing process for this event. Instead, Sperling went to social media and asked his friends for input. This was the perfect Pro Tour to test by yourself," he said. *Magic 2015* Limited and a relatively established Standard format meant that the majority of leg work had already been done.


This is also Ivan Floch's first Pro Tour Top 8. With over 150 lifetime Pro Points, this Top 8 almost seems inevitable. Floch's performance this weekend secured his place as the captain of the Slovakian team for the World *Magic* Cup.


These two met once already in the swiss, where Sperling won a very tight match. Would the results repeat?

*Both Ivan Floch and Matthew Sperling broke through the swiss rounds into their first Pro Tour Top 8. Now, both are hungry for a win.*

**The Games**



Floch started the first game on six cards, while Sperling was content with his opening seven. [Young Pyromancer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Young+Pyromancer) came down for Sperling on the second turn, and the Chandra's Phoenix that followed was met with [Dissolve](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dissolve). Sperling was already attacking for two and a single burn spell would allow him to recoup his losses, but Floch needed to aggressively protect his life total if he wanted to take over the game with late game bombs like [Sphinx's Revelation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sphinx%27s+Revelation).


Floch's [Supreme Verdict](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Supreme+Verdict) cleaned up the board and Sperling shocked him to reclaim Chandra's Phoenix and keep the pressure going. Another [Supreme Verdict](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Supreme+Verdict) dealt with the Phoenix and Sperling had [Young Pyromancer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Young+Pyromancer) for the following turn. Floch had the third [Supreme Verdict](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Supreme+Verdict), but his life total was dwindling.


The next turn, Floch tried to turn the tables with [Sphinx's Revelation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sphinx%27s+Revelation) for four extra cards, but Sperling's [Skullcrack](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skullcrack) prevented him from gaining any life. Sperling started firing off burn spells, but Floch had a seemingly endless stream of countermagic. [Last Breath](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Last+Breath) permanently dealt with Chandra's Phoenix when Sperling tried to replay it.

*Sperling sits on a grip of burn spells, hoping to find a window of opportunity.*

Floch firmly established control with [Sphinx's Revelation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sphinx%27s+Revelation) for another four cards and four life. The pressure kept coming, but Floch had enough cards to contain the American's offense. On a key turn, Floch activated his [Mutavault](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mutavault) to block Sperling's. This gave Sperling an opportunity to cast [Searing Blood](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Searing+Blood), but Floch used [Syncopate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Syncopate) to make sure Sperling needed to tap all of his mana. Floch took advantage by resolving [Sphinx's Revelation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sphinx%27s+Revelation) for seven without fear of [Skullcrack](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skullcrack).



From here, Floch had answers for everything. No threat went unanswered and the following [Sphinx's Revelation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sphinx%27s+Revelation), this time for seven, was enough to force a concession.


After sideboarding, the match-up improves for Floch. [Dispel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dispel) and Nyx Fleece Ram are particularly powerful effects.


Both players kept their opening hands. [Young Pyromancer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Young+Pyromancer) came down on turn two for Matt Sperling and he started applying early pressure on Floch with [Lightning Strike](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Strike) in response to [Azorius Charm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Azorius+Charm), making an elemental token. Playing around [Syncopate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Syncopate), Sperling recast [Young Pyromancer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Young+Pyromancer) on the following turn and pecked away at Floch's life total with his elemental token. [Mutavault](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mutavault) dealt with Sperling's Elemental after being protected from [Lightning Strike](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Strike) by [Syncopate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Syncopate).

*Floch's sideboard is well equipped for dealing with burn spells.*

The sideboarding advantage became apparent when Nyx Fleece Ram came down for Floch and Sperling had to make it a race. Sphinx's [Revelation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Revelation) brought Floch back to 16 while drawing him four additional cards and things began to look very good for the Slovakian. A second Nyx Fleece Ram further cemented Floch's lead. Sperling tried to use [Glare of Heresy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glare+of+Heresy) to deal with one of the Nyx Fleece Rams, but [Dissolve](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dissolve) saved the valuable life-gain engine. Sperling was able to deal with one of the rams by getting Floch to block and using Warleader's Helix, but the other remained in play, gaining Floch additional life every turn.



Sperling had a lot of Elemental tokens, but Floch pulled further into the lead with another Sphinx's [Revelation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Revelation), this time for six.


Sperling mounted an offense of elemental tokens with [Young Pyromancer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Young+Pyromancer), but Floch, with a wealth of potential options, used [Planar Cleansing](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Planar+Cleansing) to clear the table. Another Nyx Fleece Ram came down and it seemed that it would only be a matter of time before Floch secured his spot in the semifinals. All threats from Sperling were immediately answered while Floch resolved multiple huge [Sphinx's Revelation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sphinx%27s+Revelation)s while ticking up [Jace, Architect of Thought](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace%2C+Architect+of+Thought). More Nyx Fleece Rams came down and Floch's lifetotal swelled above thirty as Sperling could only smile as he watched despondently. "You didn't board the angels in?"


Confident that the game had already been won. An honest Floch answered. "No. You have plenty to deal with them and it's a five mana sorcery."


Floch used [Jace, Architect of Thought](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace%2C+Architect+of+Thought)'s ultimate ability and put one of Sperling's [Young Pyromancer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Young+Pyromancer)s into play. Sperling couldn't push an answer through Floch's wall of countermagic and Floch began building an impressive army of elementals.


"Are you having fun?" asked Sperling.


Floch nodded, "Actually, yes, I am."


The elemental tokens piled up and Floch, with an embarrassment of riches, whittled Sperling down to nothing over the course of the coming turns.


**Ivan Floch defeats Matt Sperling 2-0 and advances to the Semifinals!**
