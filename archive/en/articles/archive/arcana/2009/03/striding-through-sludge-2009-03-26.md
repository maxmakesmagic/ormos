When *Conflux* was concepted, the idea was that cards would show the results of planes overlapping, so there would be cards that combined the feel of Bant and Naya, for example.


So when Franz Vohwinkel's initial sketch for [Sludge Strider](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sludge+Strider) came back, there was a little concern that it looked too purely Grixis-y:

Luckily, Franz had some ideas for slipping in some filigree and Esper-ing up the background:
