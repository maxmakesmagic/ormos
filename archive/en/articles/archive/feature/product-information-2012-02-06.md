### Set Information


The *Avacyn Restored* TCG set features 244 black-bordered cards, including randomly inserted premium versions of all cards in the set. The *Avacyn Restored* set is available in booster packs, intro packs, and fat packs. Although it's the third set of the *Innistrad* block, the *Avacyn Restored* set will be a large set. This means that *Innistrad* Block Constructed will be composed of all three sets, but *Avacyn Restored* will be drafted by itself. Sealed events will use six *Avacyn Restored* booster packs.


**Set Name**: *Avacyn Restored*  
**Block**: Set 3 of 3 in the *Innistrad* block  
**Number of Cards**: 244
