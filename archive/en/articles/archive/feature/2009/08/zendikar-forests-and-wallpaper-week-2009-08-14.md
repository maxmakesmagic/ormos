If you're just getting here, you should know that we've been showing off some of the *Zendikar* basic lands this week. We showed [Plains](/en/articles/archive/zendikar-plains-2009-08-10) on Monday, [Islands](/en/articles/archive/zendikar-islands-2009-08-11) on Tuesday, [Swamps](/en/articles/archive/zendikar-swamps-2009-08-12) on Wednesday, and [Mountains](/en/articles/archive/zendikar-mountains-2009-08-13) on Thursday. Today, of course, is Forests.


But it's *also* time for the Wallpaper of the Week! So be sure and scroll down past the forests to get to your **five *Zendikar* Basic Land wallpapers**.


First, let's look at two of the four Forests that come in Intro Packs.

Not bad. But, frankly, not as cool as the Forests from booster packs and fat packs, which will look like this!

Now, let's look at those a little larger. And then we'll get to the wallpapers!
