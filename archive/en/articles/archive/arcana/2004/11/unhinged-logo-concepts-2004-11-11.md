There's more to the artistic development of a **Magic** set than the art of all the individual cards. There's also the logo, expansion symbol and packaging art for the set -- important stuff, since it's art that has to express the tone for the entire set.

We've [already seen](/en/articles/archive/unhinged-logo-and-symbol-2004-08-24) the final logo and expansion symbol for *Unhinged*, but those were not the only ideas, by any means.

Here are some of the other ideas proposed for the logo design (thanks to **Magic** art director Jeremy Cranford for providing these):

This last logo was pretty close in spirit to the final. For comparison, here's that final logo again in full color. (Note that you can win an eight-ball life counter at an [*Unhinged* release tournament](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=events/magic/prereleases) near you.)
