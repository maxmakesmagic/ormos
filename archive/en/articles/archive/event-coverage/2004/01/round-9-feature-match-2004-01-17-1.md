"Herzog got this look and just slammed down an [Awe Strike](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Awe+Strike) and stared at Kamiel. Kamiel had this look on his face like he was five and had just stolen cookies from the cookie jar." - Osyp Lebedowicz

### Game 1

Once the match started, though, Osyp was all business. His first two plays were [Leonin Scimitar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leonin+Scimitar) and [Loxodon Warhammer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Loxodon+Warhammer). He had a hand of removal, but when Jonsson paired his [Mask of Memory](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mask+of+Memory) with [Troll Ascetic](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Troll+Ascetic) his face fell. Sure, he had the [Electrostatic Bolt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Electrostatic+Bolt) for [Leonin Skyhunter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leonin+Skyhunter), but the 3/2 regenerating untargettable was something of a problem.

Then came [Fangren Hunter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fangren+Hunter). Lebedowicz had his Hammer in the hands of an [Auriok Transfixer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Auriok+Transfixer) and hoped to save the day with [Awe Strike](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Awe+Strike), but Jonsson just chuckled and showed him a [Razor Barrier](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Razor+Barrier) for protection from white, bringing home the many-for-one. Lebedowicz's last hope was a [Titanium Golem](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Titanium+Golem) to hide behind, once it got the Hammer. He even had [Arrest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arrest) for the troublesome Hunter. However, Jonsson showed him [Living Hive](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Living+Hive), and that was enough.

Jonsson 1 - Lebedowicz 0

### Game 2

Jonsson's first play was a [Leonin Skyhunter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leonin+Skyhunter), to which Lebedowicz responded with [Raise the Alarm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Raise+the+Alarm). Next he played a [Wizard Replica](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wizard+Replica) and passed it back. Jonsson simply played a Myr. Lebedowicz punched through with an [Electrostatic Bolt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Electrostatic+Bolt), then dropped the mighty [Loxodon Warhammer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Loxodon+Warhammer). Jonsson frowned. He played a [Skyhunter Patrol](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skyhunter+Patrol) and passed it back.

![Arc-Slogger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Arc-Slogger)Lebedowicz gave the hammer to his lowly [Wizard Replica](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wizard+Replica) and started draining Jonsson. Jonsson made a [Wizard Replica](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wizard+Replica) of his own but refused to block. Next came [Gilded Lotus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gilded+Lotus) to enable a [Wurmskin Forger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wurmskin+Forger), and finally his defenses were solidified. A 3/3 Forger and a 4/5 Patrol were enough to keep the big nasties away.

Lebedowicz had meantime made a [Goblin War Wagon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+War+Wagon) and moved the hammer over. He bashed in and Jonsson put the Forger in the way. Again, Lebedowicz had the [Awe Strike](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Awe+Strike). Jonsson finally drew the [Rustspore Ram](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rustspore+Ram) to remove the Warhammer, but Lebedowicz was on the offensive and [Vulshok Gauntlets](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vulshok+Gauntlets) would do just as nicely. 

He put them on the [Wizard Replica](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wizard+Replica) and dropped Jonsson to one. Jonsson entwined [One Dozen Eyes](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=One+Dozen+Eyes), but needed to stop the flier. When he finally double-blocked, Lebedowicz had the [Electrostatic Bolt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Electrostatic+Bolt) to save his creature, and a turn later they were on to the final game. 

Jonsson 1 - Lebedowicz 1

### Game 3

"I don't play Team Pro Tours any more. I hate them. If I get 50 Pro Points, I'm teaming with a shoe and a goose. I've already bought the goose." - Osyp Lebedowicz

Jonsson kicked off with Leonine Scimitar, and Lebedowicz countered with Transfixer. Jonsson got out an [Elf Replica](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elf+Replica). Lebedowicz developed his own board with [Wizard Replica](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wizard+Replica), accepting three if Jonsson picked up the sword and swung. However, he also had [Mask of Memory](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mask+of+Memory), making that one swing particularly painful.

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/ptams04/fm19_2.jpg)Lebedowicz was tight on mana, just four lands and then an [Iron Myr](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Iron+Myr). The Transfixer locked the Replica down. Jonsson dropped [Fangren Hunter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fangren+Hunter). Lebedowicz struck. [Shatter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shatter) on the Replica, [Arrest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arrest) on the Hunter. It looked good. That is, until Jonsson showed him a [Razor Barrier](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Razor+Barrier).

He put both his equipment on his Hunter, and then for good measure added [Bonesplitter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bonesplitter). Lebedowicz made an [Arc-Slogger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arc-Slogger) and took some more pain. By the time he could trade, Jonsson had made five insect tokens and was swarming his life total. Another turn and Jonsson was the winner.
