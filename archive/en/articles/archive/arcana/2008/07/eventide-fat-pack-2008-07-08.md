![Eventide Fat Pack Contents](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/mtgcom/arcana1000/1678_Contents.jpg)* **Eight** *Eventide* boosters,
* A player's guide with a complete visual encyclopedia of the set,
* A pack of 40 basic lands (from *Shadowmoor*),
* An *Eventide* spindown life counter (that's the twenty-sided life counter, only available in this fat pack)
* The *Eventide* novel by Scott McGough and Cory J. Herndon (more information [here](http://ww2.wizards.com/books/Wizards/Products/?doc=216377400)),
* One random Pro Tour Player card, and
