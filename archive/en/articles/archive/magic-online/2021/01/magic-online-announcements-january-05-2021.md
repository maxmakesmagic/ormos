*Commander Legends*: *Magic Online* Edition
-------------------------------------------


*Commander Legends* has arrived! You can read more about *Commander Legends* on MTGO in Alli's release article [here](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/magic-online/commander-legends-magic-online-edition-2020-11-11-0), and you can check out the updated Treasure Chest contents [here](https://magic.wizards.com/en/MTGO/articles/archive/magic-online/treasure-chest-card-list-info).




---

All-Access Tokens Returning Next Week
-------------------------------------


The popular tokens from Eternal Weekend (you know the ones: they grant access to playing with most cards even if they're not in your account) will be returning next Wednesday for two weeks! Next week's blog will cover all the details about when and why, but in the meantime . . . what will you play when you have access to (almost) every card in *Magic Online*?




---

*Vintage Cube* December 23–January 13
-------------------------------------


Another update in, this time with *Commander Legends* cards in the mix. This is easily the most common request we get, so . . . we hear you. More *Vintage Cube*. That's why we're running it for a few weeks until January 13!


For a full list of the latest changes to *Vintage Cube*, click [here](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/vintage-cube-cardlist).

Updated Alternative Play Schedule
---------------------------------


The alternative play schedule that was announced in the *Zendikar Rising* set article has changed! Check out the latest schedule below.


* January 13–20: **A brand-new addition to the Spotlight Cube Series**. As usual, more details will come later, but this one promises to be a wheel of a good time.
* January 20–28: ***Vintage Masters* Flashback**. One of the most popular Draft formats of all time is back to round out *Zendikar Rising* season. We'll have a little more than a week of that, and then . . . well, it's not quite time to talk about *Kaldheim* just yet.
