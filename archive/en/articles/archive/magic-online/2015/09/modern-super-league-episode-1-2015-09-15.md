Modern Super League makes its debut tonight! You've seen the slate of players, now here is the bracket that will determine a champion over the course of the next three weeks:

All eight players have already submitted their decklists, and you can check those out [here](http://magic.wizards.com/en/MTGO/articles/archive/magic-online/modern-super-league-decklists).


Several players are running their signature Modern decks; Willy is on Abzan, of course, and Patrick is on Tarmo Twin. Several others, however, have taken this opportunity to take a walk on the spicy side. Lee Shi Tian is running Elves, for example, and Luis is trying out a Jeskai Ascendancy Combo deck.


It's a double-elimination league format, so everyone gets to keep playing until they lose twice. Meanwhile, the last three players left standing will also join the top finishers from the Vintage Super League and the Standard Super League in the Super League Championship, starting in October.

Note that the last two spots in the SLC will be determined by a Last Chance Qualifier tournament, and the last few spots in that LCQ are actually going to be determined by a fan vote, so keep your eye on this space for instructions on how you can help choose those players in a few weeks.


Speaking of players who have qualified for the SLC, last week saw Gaby Spartz win the Standard Super League! She didn't even drop a game as she used a [Mardu Dragons deck](http://magic.wizards.com/en/MTGO/articles/archive/magic-online/standard-super-league-season-2-decklists#Spartzplayoff) to first dispatch Josh Utter-Leyton and then Hall of Fame pro Paul Rietzl.


Rietzl's deck from last week's SSL playoffs was pretty sweet; he took the opportunity to give [Blue Devotion](http://magic.wizards.com/en/MTGO/articles/archive/magic-online/standard-super-league-season-2-decklists#Rietzlplayoff) one last spin before *Theros* block rotates out of Standard, and splashed green for [Collected Company](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Collected+Company).


I also want to call attention to one super sweet match of *Magic*. Lots of last week's games were good, but Josh Utter-Leyton put on a truly world-class performance in his quarterfinal against Owen Turtenwald. I still have no idea how he managed to win Game 2 in particular:
