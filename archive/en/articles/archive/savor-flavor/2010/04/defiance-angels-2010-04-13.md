As a reminder, you can now get your unspeakable tendrils on the official tale of Zendikar and the Eldrazi—*Zendikar: In the Teeth of Akoum* by Robert B. Wintermute. The struggles of planeswalkers [Nissa Revane](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nissa+Revane) and [Sorin Markov](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sorin+Markov), the mysteries of the [Eye of Ugin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eye+of+Ugin), the plane-wide rampage of the Eldrazi and their nightmarish brood lineages, the fate of the plane of Zendikar—it's all packed in between its covers.

Maybe you can even pick up the book at the same store (or regional event) where you attend a [*Rise of the Eldrazi* Prerelease](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/tcg/events.aspx?x=mtgcom/events/prerelease-facts) this weekend! Hope you get to do some annihilating, some leveling up, and maybe even some silencing!
