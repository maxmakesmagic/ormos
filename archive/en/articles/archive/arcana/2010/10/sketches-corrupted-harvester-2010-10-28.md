Welcome back to once again to Sketches! It's Autumn (in the Northern Hemisphere, anyway), which is a time of hayrides. And it's almost Halloween, which is a time of scaaaary monsters. Combine those two themes, and today's card is *Scars of Mirrodin*'s [Corrupted Harvester](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Corrupted+Harvester)!

### Artist Portfolio

Artist [Nils Hamm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?action=advanced&artist=%5B%22Nils%20Hamm%22%5D) has illustrated 42 **Magic** cards, going back to *Future Sight*. Can you go back to the future set? Never mind. Anyway, he's got five cards in *Scars of Mirrodin*, and this is one of them.

### Art Description

The first step of the creation of a card's art is its art description. The art description tells the artist what the card will do, what its flavor is, and what the mood of the illustration should be. Here were the instructions Nils was given for [Corrupted Harvester](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Corrupted+Harvester):


> 
> Color: Black creature
> 
> 
> Location: Mephidross
> 
> 
> Action: A harvester is a large, horrifying creature that slithers through the Mephidross using its huge scythe to scoop living creatures into the cavity in its back. Show a harvester that has been corrupted by Phyrexia in ways of your choosing -- parts of it have been reduced to bone-and-metal skeleton.
> 
> 
> Focus: the harvester
> 
> 
> Mood: The terrifying 'custodians' of the Mephidross
> 
> 
> 

The art description also included references to a pair of cards from *Mirrodin* Block which show what the harvesters looked like before the Phyrexians got to work on them:

### Sketch

Armed with that art description, Nils submitted a sketch to **Magic**'s creative team:

Note that Nils included a couple of tiny humanoids being speared. You know, for scale. Let's see the final version!

### Final Art

And just in time for Halloween, we have the perfect Haunted Hayride!

### Finished Card

Here's what the abomination in question looks like in *Scars of Mirrodin* packs:
