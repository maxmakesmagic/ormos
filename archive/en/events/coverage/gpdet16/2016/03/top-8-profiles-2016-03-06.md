### Ralph Betesh


**Age:** 30


**Occupation:** Wi-Fi Tech


**Hometown:** Philadelphia, PA


**Previous Magic accomplishments:** Top 8 Grand Prix Miami


**What deck did you play and why?** Abzan Company. I didn't lose a match to White-Blue Eldrazi on MTGO in the past week of testing.


**What changes would you make to your deck and why?** Nothing as of now - if Eldrazi get banned you don't need [Intrepid Hero](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Intrepid+Hero), and possibly the [Orzhov Pontiff](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Orzhov+Pontiff) in the main.


**Are the Eldrazi inherently evil? Would that mean Eldrazi players are inherently evil too?** 100%.


**What's your favorite *Shadows over Innistrad* preview so far, or, what's your favorite *Innistrad* memory?** I haven't looked at any previews, but I liked [Charmbreaker Devils](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Charmbreaker+Devils) and [Into the Maw of Hell](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Into+the+Maw+of+Hell) in Limited in *Innistrad.*

### James Zornes


**Age:** 33


**Occupation:** Ebay


**Hometown:** Benton, AR.


**Previous Magic accomplishments:** Grand Prix Denver Top 8; 2001 Arkansas State Championship, 7th place.


**What deck did you play and why?** GiftStorm


**What changes would you make to your deck and why?** None.


**Are the Eldrazi inherently evil? Would that mean Eldrazi players are inherently evil too?** Yes and yes.


**What's your favorite *Shadows Over Innistrad* preview so far, or, what's your favorite *Innistrad* memory?** Playing *Innistrad* block at the Pro Tour in Spain.

### Eric English


**Age:** 27


**Occupation:** Lab Technician


**Hometown:** Rochester, NY.


**Previous Magic accomplishments:** Won a StarCityGames.com Open and have one Pro Tour appearance.


**What deck did you play and why?** Red-Green Eldrazi. The lands are busted and [Kozilek's Return](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kozilek%27s+Return) plus [World Breaker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=World+Breaker) is incredible.


**What changes would you make to your deck and why?** Nothing unless I could figure out a better plan against White-Blue Eldrazi.


**Are the Eldrazi inherently evil? Would that mean Eldrazi players are inherently evil too?** Of course not, squiggly monsters are great!


**What's your favorite *Shadows Over Innistrad* preview so far, or, what's your favorite *Innistrad* memory?** [Spider Spawning](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spider+Spawning) was easily one of my most favorite Limited archetypes ever.

### Gerry Thompson


**Age:** 31


**Occupation:** Writer for StarCityGames.com.


**Hometown:** Roanoke, VA


**Previous Magic accomplishments:** I'm making a run for the Player's Championship.


**What deck did you play and why?** White-Blue Eldrazi. It's the best deck and I'm trying to win more.


**What changes would you make to your deck and why?** [Shriekmaw](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shriekmaw), [Calciform Pools](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Calciform+Pools) and [Training Grounds](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Training+Grounds) all seemed sweet.


**Are the Eldrazi inherently evil? Would that mean Eldrazi players are inherently evil too?** No, we're the good guys who are cleaning up Modern.


**What's your favorite *Shadows Over Innistrad* preview so far, or, what's your favorite *Innistrad* memory?** Archangel Avacyn, Relentless Dead, Heir of Falkenrath and Incorrigible Youths. They all look great, and this set should be fun.

### Ronald Ritner


**Age:** 25


**Occupation:** Degenerate


**Hometown:** Cleveland, OH


**Previous Magic accomplishments:** A couple of Pro Tours I was queued for and didn't go to!


**What deck did you play and why?** Red-Green Eldrazi because that's the deck my friend let me borrow (I had never played a match with it!)


**What changes would you make to your deck and why?** Nothing because I will probably never play Modern again unless there is a close Grand Prix.


**Are the Eldrazi inherently evil? Would that mean Eldrazi players are inherently evil too?** No.


**What's your favorite *Shadows Over Innistrad* preview so far, or, what's your favorite *Innistrad* memory?** I haven't looked through them yet.

### Hao-Shan Huang


**Age:** 33


**Occupation:** MTGMintCard Pro Player


**Hometown:** Chinese Taipei


**Previous Magic accomplishments:** Five Grand Prix Top 8s, including a win at Grand Prix Taipei in 2014. Two Nationals Top 8 appearances, two World *Magic* Cup appearances, and the 2015 Taiwan national champion.


**What deck did you play and why?** White-Blue Eldrazi. I had worked on several decks I didn't want to regret not playing a broken deck when it's available do so. I played the same 75 as Kelvin Chew who lost his win-and-in in Melbourne.


**What changes would you make to your deck and why?** None for now but definitely need to tune a bit to adapt to the upcoming metagame.


**Are the Eldrazi inherently evil? Would that mean Eldrazi players are inherently evil too?** They are. But I believe the justice will come in two months. I feel a little bit guilty about being on the guilty side for once.


**What's your favorite *Shadows Over Innistrad* preview so far, or, what's your favorite *Innistrad* memory?** Archangel Avacyn. I believe the common answer, and I am not special and I like whatever people like.

### Eduardo Sajgalik


**Age:** 28


**Occupation:** Searching for tomorrow


**Hometown:** [Unknown Shores](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Unknown+Shores)


**Previous Magic accomplishments:** Three Grand Prix Top 8s, Top 8 at Pro Tour *Return to Ravnica* in 2012, four Nationals Top 8s, and three National Team appearances.


**What deck did you play and why?** White-Blue Eldrazi; it's the best deck by far.


**What changes would you make to your deck and why?** Find another deck, it's unlikely it sticks. I liked the list. [Cyclonic Rift](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cyclonic+Rift) is the flex, and one more [Grafdigger's Cage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grafdigger%27s+Cage) would be nice.


**Are the Eldrazi inherently evil? Would that mean Eldrazi players are inherently evil too?** What is evil? What is good? You cannot reason with it; you cannot comprehend it. You just need to destroy them.


**What's your favorite *Shadows Over Innistrad* preview so far, or, what's your favorite *Innistrad* memory?** Archangel Avacyn is sweet. I like that Avacyn, the Purifier is red (passionate), not black (selfish). In original *Innistrad* I liked the [Altar of the Lost](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Altar+of+the+Lost)/[Burning Vengeance](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Burning+Vengeance)/[Secrets of the Dead](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Secrets+of+the+Dead) deck. Also turn 2 [Geist of Saint Traft](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Geist+of+Saint+Traft), turn 3 [Increasing Savagery](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Increasing+Savagery).

### Evan Buchholz


**Age:** 23


**Occupation:** Salon supervisor/streamer (JustevSopriv)


**Hometown:** Lawrenceville, NJ.


**Previous Magic accomplishments:** None.


**What deck did you play and why?** White-Blue Eldrazi. it's the best deck and has a shot against everything.


**What changes would you make to your deck and why?** I would cut one [Hurkyl's Recall](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hurkyl%27s+Recall) for a [Meddling Mage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Meddling+Mage) and have a better plan for the mirror.


**Are the Eldrazi inherently evil? Would that mean Eldrazi players are inherently evil too?** No. They just eat and everything is in the way. No comment on the second.


**What's your favorite *Shadows Over Innistrad* preview so far, or, what's your favorite *Innistrad* memory?** Heir of Falkenrath. It looks like a sweet enabler.
