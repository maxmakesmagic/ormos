![Baku Altar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Baku+Altar)The art description for that *Betrayers of Kamigawa* spirit-generating artifact, **[Baku Altar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Baku+Altar)**, calls for a "*mikoshi*" or "palanquin shrine" shaped like a *baku*. 

The *baku* are composite creatures from Japanese mythology: sometimes they sport the head of an elephant and the body of a lion. As you know, the [baku in *Betrayers of Kamigawa*](http://gatherer.wizards.com/default.asp?first=1&last=100&term=baku&Field_Name=on&Field_Rules=on&Field_Type=on&setfilter=Allsets&colorfilter=creature&output=summary&sort=name&x=31&y=26) ([Blademane Baku](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blademane+Baku), [Petalmane Baku](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Petalmane+Baku), [Quillmane Baku](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Quillmane+Baku), [Skullmane Baku](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skullmane+Baku), [Waxmane Baku](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Waxmane+Baku)) are a cycle of spirits that gain abilities as you use Arcane magic. 

But what is a "mikoshi," or a "palanquin"?


> *A mikoshi is a portable Shinto shrine that serves as the vehicle of a divine spirit in Japan at the time of a parade of deities. Often, the mikoshi resembles a miniature building, with pillars, walls, a roof, a veranda and a railing. Typical shapes are rectangles, hexagons, and octagons. The body, which stands on two poles (for carrying), is usually lavishly decorated, and the roof might hold a carving of a phoenix.*

> *A palanquin is a covered conveyance, usually for one person consisting of a large box with wooden shutters like Venetian blinds, carried by four or six (rarely two) men by means of poles projecting before and behind.*

So intead of having a miniature building or wooden box, [Baku Altar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Baku+Altar) has a statue of a baku. Now you know.
