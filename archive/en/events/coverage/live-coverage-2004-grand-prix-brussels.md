Live Coverage of 2004 Grand Prix Brussels
=========================================

734 players came to Hall 5 of the Expo Heyzel and once the dust settled it looked like the format might have been turned over on its head. The expected field was Affinity and Goblins and although those decks turned out in force it looked like the hate might be starting to make an impact. Affinity decks were in for a rocky ride on day one with cards like [March of the Machines](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=March+of+the+Machines) and the vicious bouncing [Viridian Shaman](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Viridian+Shaman)/[Wirewood Symbiote](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wirewood+Symbiote) combo of Elf and Nail causing real headaches.


Perhaps the biggest surprise was the success of Johannes Mitsios' unusual blue-white control deck running four Pristine Angels. The German amateur was one of four decks to run out day one with perfect records. Doubts it might have been a fluke were swiftly answered on day two as he continued with the perfect record, only finally picking up a loss in round 13 when it was largely irrelevant.


With most of the fancied names falling by the wayside it seemed Brussels might not go to script although the end was almost predictability in itself. Amongst the host of relative unknowns a very familiar name snuck into the top 8 in eighth place.


Kai Budde wrecked Mitsios's dreams in the quarters and then went on to dispatch up-and-coming young Dutch hopeful Julien Nuijten. In the other bracket Tobias Henke, of Germany, overcame Xuan-phi Nguyen's Goblin deck in the quarters and then beat the Goblin deck of Vasilis Fatouros in the semi's to set up an all-German clash.

Day one was unexpected but now reality had returned. For all the talk of other decks it was two Affinity decks beating two Goblin decks to set up a mirror-match final. One of them was in the hands of the best player in the world but GP Brussels wasn't about to end without a final twist in the tail.


In a blink-and-you'll-miss-it final (and I mean literally, you needed slow-motion replays for this one) Henke's draw in the third game was simply savage. It's not often you see the German Juggernaut on the receiving end of a real kicking but even he couldn't pull back from Henke's second turn Ravager, third turn Skullclamp and triple [Frogmite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Frogmite) draw.


Congratulations to Tobias Henke, winner of Grand Prix Brussels.
