We've got something special for you today. Mark Rosewater was rummaging through his hard drive, and he turned up something incredible: the original design file for the **Magic** set codenamed "Bogavhati", which ended up as *Tempest*. This file is full of cards that were eventually printed in *Tempest* and later sets. There's even one card that was printed in *Weatherlight*, the set **before** *Tempest*!


These cards were created by the Bogavhati Design Team: Mark Rosewater, Richard Garfield, Mike Elliott, and Charlie Catino.


So what we're going to do today is show you a few of the Boghavati cards, then show you what they turned into. Ready? Let's go!
