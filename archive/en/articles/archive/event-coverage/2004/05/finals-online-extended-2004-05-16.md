Online Extended is an interesting format without a real analog in the world of "paper" Magic. It encompasses all the sets in Magic Online (Invasion - Darksteel, plus the last two Core Sets), and [Entomb](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Entomb) is banned, just as it is in regular Extended. Because the pros don't have much time to dedicate to the format, so you might expect it to simply be a hodgepodge of old Standard decks retrofitted with a couple random cards. That's partly true. Goblin-Bidding and Ravager Affinity are both good, as are old standbys [Psychatog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psychatog) and Blue-Green Madness. But there is also room for innovation, such as Brian Kibler's "Red Rock" (which includes the particularly vicious anti-Affinity sideboard card, [Destructive Flow](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Destructive+Flow)).


Alas, such creativity is not on display here in the Invitational finals. Both Bob Maher and Mattias Jorstedt are playing Ravager Affinity. Bob added a single [Cabal Therapy](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cabal+Therapy) to an otherwise Standard-legal list, while Mattias squeezed in four [Artifact Mutation](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Artifact+Mutation)s, good for turning [Myr Enforcer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Myr+Enforcer)s into armies of 1/1 Saprolings.


As Bob won the Auction of the People and Mattias won *Mirrodin* Block Constructed, this event will decide who wins the Invitational and gets his face on a future card of his own design.


### Game 1


Bob was the first player to get [Arcbound Ravager](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arcbound+Ravager) in play, but that didn't mean much as Mattias was the first to get a [Skullclamp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skullclamp) into play and the only player to get a [Disciple of the Vault](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Disciple+of+the+Vault) in play.


The Disciple meant that Bob lost life anytime he sacrificed one of his own artifacts, and that handicap was too much to overcome. At one point Mattias sacrificed a Clamped Enforcer and drew into a second Disciple, and was able to take Bob from 11 to 0 without hitting him with a creature in combat.


Mattias 1 - Bob 0


Mattias sideboarded in three [Naturalize](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Naturalize)s and Bob brought in [Furnace Dragon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Furnace+Dragon)s and [Seething Song](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seething+Song)s.


Bob's turn 2 Ravager was [Naturalize](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Naturalize)d, but his turn 3 Ravager stuck around. He added one Disciple to the table, then an [Ornithopter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ornithopter) and a second Disciple.


Mattias responded to the second Disciple by playing [Artifact Mutation](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Artifact+Mutation) on the Ravager. Bob simply sacrificed every other artifact he had to it, then sacrificed it to put 7 counters on his [Ornithopter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ornithopter). The 'Thopter then attacked Mattias down to 1.


With two Disciples in play, Mattias needed a way to stop the [Ornithopter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ornithopter) that didn't involve sending an artifact to the graveyard. Such a way didn't really exist, so Mattias scooped with Bob still at 20 life.


Mattias 1 - Bob 1


This is it--the final game for all the marbles.


Mattias may have sealed his own fate by not maligning. His opening hand was not very explosive: Ravager, double Disciple, double Mutation, [Frogmite](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Frogmite), [Vault of Whispers](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vault+of+Whispers). He was going to live or die based on if he could draw a second artifact land by turn 2.


He did not. Bob ended it mercifully fast, however with the following sequence:


Turn 1: Citadel, Clamp, Thopter.  
 Turn 2: [Seat of the Synod](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seat+of+the+Synod), [Frogmite](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Frogmite), [Somber Hoverguard](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Somber+Hoverguard), Clamp the Thopter and attack for 1.  
 Turn 3: Attack for 6, [Glimmervoid](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glimmervoid), [Seething Song](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seething+Song), [Furnace Dragon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Furnace+Dragon).


Mattias had a lowly Disciple, and Bob had 8 power of fliers. That was that.


Maher 2 - Jorstedt 1


Bob Maher wins the 2004 Magic Invitational lightning quick!
