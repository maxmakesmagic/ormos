As the World Championship stepped into Day Three, it moved into the Modern portion. Luis Scott-Vargas and Thiago Saporito are both at 6-4 and would likely need to win out for a shot at the Top 4. Both players are piloting Abzan midrange decks with exciting *Eldritch Moon* additions [Collective Brutality](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Collective+Brutality) and [Grim Flayer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grim+Flayer).


In Scott-Vargas's case, he had the full playset of both as opposed to his opponent's three copies, and he also brought a pair of [Mishra's Bauble](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mishra%27s+Bauble)s to more easily enable delirium. The main distinction between both builds was Scott-Vargas's inclusion of triple [Noble Hierarch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Noble+Hierarch). While that affects threat density a little, it does makes his deck faster and helps in situations where [Grim Flayer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grim+Flayer)s and [Tarmogoyf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf)s face off against each other.


However, one potential focal point of the matchup was the cards that cost more than three mana. Since both players are running [Abrupt Decay](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Abrupt+Decay) and [Inquisition of Kozilek](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inquisition+of+Kozilek), that might result in someone stumbling as a result of being unable to answer any card that costs four mana or more. For instance, Scott-Vargas will need to heavily rely on [Thoughtseize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtseize) or the singleton [Maelstrom Pulse](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Maelstrom+Pulse) to answer Saporito's [Gideon, Ally of Zendikar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gideon%2C+Ally+of+Zendikar) and [Elspeth, Sun's Champion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elspeth%2C+Sun%27s+Champion). The same is true for Scott-Vargas's two Gideons. Saporito also has [Tasigur, the Golden Fang](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tasigur%2C+the+Golden+Fang), which could come in handy in this grindy matchup.


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Lingering+Souls)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lingering+Souls)[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Gideon%2C+Ally+of+Zendikar)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gideon%2C+Ally+of+Zendikar)
Alternatively, it could simply boil down to a contest between [Lingering Souls](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lingering+Souls), the main reason why both players opted for Abzan over Jund. One small edge Saporito has was swapping out the fourth copy of [Liliana of the Veil](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Liliana+of+the+Veil) for a single copy of [Liliana, the Last Hope](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Liliana%2C+the+Last+Hope), in addition to putting a second copy in the sideboard. Should the game state head in that direction, Saporito definitely has the edge with a different version of Liliana that ticks *up* while killing Spirit tokens. Oh, he's got [Gavony Township](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gavony+Township) whereas Scott-Vargas doesn't, but after sideboarding, the Hall of Famer has the single [Zealous Persecution](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Zealous+Persecution) that could make a huge difference!


The Games
=========


"Everyone who has mulliganed against me this tournament has beaten me, so I guess you're off to a good start," Scott-Vargas chuckled as Saporito sent back his opening seven. The Brazilian pro was happy with his replacement six and both players were ready to go.


Scott-Vargas led off with [Inquisition of Kozilek](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inquisition+of+Kozilek) to get rid of [Path to Exile](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Path+to+Exile), ensuring that the coast was clear for his 3/4 [Tarmogoyf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf). However, the creature was short-lived since Saporito drew into a second Path immediately. [Thoughtseize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtseize) and [Collective Brutality](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Collective+Brutality) from Scott-Vargas binned [Liliana, the Last Hope](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Liliana%2C+the+Last+Hope) and [Lingering Souls](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lingering+Souls) respectively, cleaning out Saporito's hand entirely.

However, hand-disruption spells don't do a very good job at preventing topdecks. Saporito ripped a second copy of [Lingering Souls](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lingering+Souls), which meant that things spiraled out of control *very* quickly when Saporito found a fifth land with which to activate [Gavony Township](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gavony+Township).


Scott-Vargas could only cast whatever the top of his deck offered him ([Grim Flayer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grim+Flayer) and [Scavenging Ooze](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scavenging+Ooze)) and Saporito duly deflected those with [Maelstrom Pulse](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Maelstrom+Pulse) and [Abrupt Decay](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Abrupt+Decay). Two [Gavony Township](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gavony+Township) activations and two attacks later, Scott-Vargas scooped up his cards, unable to deal with a horde of oversized Spirit tokens.


In Game Two, it was Scott-Vargas's turn to go down to six cards, and the first play of the game was his [Grim Flayer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grim+Flayer). Saporito used [Collective Brutality](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Collective+Brutality) (escalated by discarding an excess land) to kill the Flayer while taking [Path to Exile](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Path+to+Exile) away.


Both players dropped [Tarmogoyf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf)s but met with each other's removal spells. Saporito summoned [Scavenging Ooze](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scavenging+Ooze), which Scott-Vargas sent on a [Path to Exile](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Path+to+Exile). On his next turn, Scott-Vargas then cast [Lingering Souls](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lingering+Souls) and immediately flashed it back. The board was four Spirit tokens for Scott-Vargas against Saporito's empty side. For Saporito to get out of his plight, he would need [Engineered Explosives](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Engineered+Explosives) or [Lingering Souls](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lingering+Souls) of his own. [Liliana, the Last Hope](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Liliana%2C+the+Last+Hope) wasn't good enough despite taking one Spirit down, because Scott-Vargas did have [Shambling Vent](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shambling+Vent) to finish her off.


The tokens continued to chip away at Saporito's life total, and when Scott-Vargas successfully connected with [Grim Flayer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grim+Flayer), it ensured that he would be drawing much better than his opponent from that point onward. Scrying is pretty powerful in this matchup, I hear.


Funnily, the player who mulliganed won their respective game. With the first two games predominantly decided by [Lingering Souls](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lingering+Souls) and the ability to deal with tokens, the third game did not deviate by much.


In Game 3, it was Saporito's turn to open with [Grim Flayer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grim+Flayer), forcing Scott-Vargas to kill it with [Path to Exile](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Path+to+Exile). This was a telltale sign that Scott-Vargas not have [Abrupt Decay](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Abrupt+Decay), meaning that Saporito's [Liliana, the Last Hope](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Liliana%2C+the+Last+Hope) went uncontested. [Lingering Souls](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lingering+Souls) from Saporito meant that he was ahead, but Scott-Vargas ate up the sorcery with [Scavenging Ooze](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scavenging+Ooze) before it could be flashed back. Saporito had another copy, and was soon up to six tokens.

Patiently lying in wait until the perfect time, Scott-Vargas finally pulled the trigger on [Zealous Persecution](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Zealous+Persecution). This was huge because it cleared away six Spirit tokens to allow Scott-Vargas to attack with [Grim Flayer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grim+Flayer) and [Scavenging Ooze](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scavenging+Ooze). Saporito's [Damnation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Damnation) restored peace to the board, aside from the fact that Scott-Vargas still had to deal with [Liliana, the Last Hope](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Liliana%2C+the+Last+Hope). He had [Abrupt Decay](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Abrupt+Decay) for it, but Saporito replaced the planeswalker with the other version of Liliana.


However, it was Scott-Vargas who trumped with the "better" planeswalker: [Gideon, Ally of Zendikar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gideon%2C+Ally+of+Zendikar). After Gideon churned out a couple of Knight Allies, Saporito found himself hanging by a thread. He tried to fight back with [Lingering Souls](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lingering+Souls) to kill Gideon and drew his own copy to flip the tables. A second copy of [Lingering Souls](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lingering+Souls) pretty much sealed the deal in favor of the Brazilian player.


"I'm so good at drawing [Lingering Souls](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lingering+Souls)! I got really lucky there by topdecking [Lingering Souls](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lingering+Souls), [Gideon, Ally of Zendikar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gideon%2C+Ally+of+Zendikar), and then [Lingering Souls](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lingering+Souls) again. Otherwise, I would be dead to Luis's Gideon in just one or two more turns," said Saporito as he advanced to 7-4.


With three more rounds to go, Saporito's shot at the Top 4 was still alive. On the other hand, the dream was likely dead for Scott-Vargas. "I have terrible tiebreakers since I started out 1-3. I don't think I will be able to make it even if I win out, but I'm still going to try! Good luck Thiago!"
