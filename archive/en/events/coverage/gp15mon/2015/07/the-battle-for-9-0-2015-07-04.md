With one round left to play eight players remained with unblemished records. A win here would mean the difference between pole position on the field and being mired in the scrum with only a single loss to give.



Table 1 saw Pro Tour Khans of Tarkir Semi-finalist Mike Sigrist square off against Jason Ellis. Sigrist had been surprised to make it to 8-0 as his deck featured more than a couple duds. It certainly wasn’t up to the task of taking on Ellis, who overwhelmed him in two quick games interrupted by a deck check. It was Ellis’s first perfect Day 1, and he hopes to improve on what has been a strong year for him, having put up a 12-3 record at GP Baltimore and 11-4 at Atlantic City.

At Table 2, the 20th-Ranked Andrew Cuneo was battling Jean-Francois Betit. Their first game was a drawn-out affair. Though Betit was able to get rid of [Tasigur, the Golden Fang](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tasigur%2C+the+Golden+Fang) before he could take over the game, he was under fire from an [Ojutai Interceptor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ojutai+Interceptor) on a stalled board. He ripped [Descent of the Dragons](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Descent+of+the+Dragons), but Cuneo was ready with [Contradict](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Contradict). In their second, Betit got the upper hand with [Qal Sisma Behemoth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Qal+Sisma+Behemoth), forcing Cuneo to a low life total and finishing things with a [Goblin Heelcutter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Heelcutter). In the decider, Cuneo had a key removal spell in response to [Descent of the Dragons](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Descent+of+the+Dragons), meaning Betit would only get a pair of 4/4 fliers. That was enough to tilt the balance in Cuneo’s favor. Cuneo refused to get excited about his strong start. “This is the third GP this year I’ve started out 9-0. In both the previous ones, I 0-3’d the first draft.”

Next door at Table 3 Newfoundland’s Stephen Whelan was up against local ringer Philip Asselin-Nguyen. Whelan strolled to victory in game one with a textbook curve of creatures and removal, but stumbled in the second when Asselin-Nguyen held the ground and closed things with [Silumgar, the Drifting Death](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Silumgar%2C+the+Drifting+Death). Game three went down to the wire, but Whelan edged through, giving the Newfoundland crew one more reason to cheer.

Lastly there was Table 4, where Canadian GP fixture Martin-Eric Gauthier squared off against Alex McKnight. It was a classic battle of McKnight’s aggro against Gauthier’s control, and in both games Gauthier was on the back foot early. His blue-black exploit deck took damage while it set up its defenses, and just when things looked darkest, [Sidisi, Undead Vizier](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sidisi%2C+Undead+Vizier) would hit the table. What did she tutor up? [Dragonlord Silumgar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragonlord+Silumgar). Both games McKnight looked to the top of his deck for answers and came up empty.
