This is [Blood Artist](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Artist) from *Avacyn Restored*.

Naturally, the first thing we're going to do is take a closer look at the art.

When it's that big, we can see the artist's painting pretty clearly. Does it look kind of familiar? Click here to see what's there!

Yes, the pose is flipped, but the [Blood Artist](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Artist) is clearly working on [Curse of Oblivion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Curse+of+Oblivion). Except that it's all done in red because that's what happens when you paint with blood.
