Five potent ingredients have been selected from the Standard card pool to challenge the teams' deckbuilding skills to the utmost. Who has the chops to conquer the format and truly be called an Ironroot Chef?


* The 5 ingredients will be unveiled to the 16 players on Saturday morning.
* For each team, five decks must contain exactly one ingredient each. The other three decks must include exactly two ingredients each.
* Teams will be given a short period of time to strategize and decide which player is taking on each ingredient.
* Players take their seats and will have exactly 30 minutes to construct a Standard-legal deck using their chosen ingredient(s).
* The teams will play three rounds in the format. Each match win is worth three points.
* A judging panel of Graham Stark and James Turner from LoadingReadyRun and the Wizard from Walking the Planes will judge each deck on its creativity, boldness, and adherence to the theme ingredient. Each judge will award 0-3 points per deck.
* The judges' totals will be revealed after the three rounds of play have been completed, and then added to each team's point total.
