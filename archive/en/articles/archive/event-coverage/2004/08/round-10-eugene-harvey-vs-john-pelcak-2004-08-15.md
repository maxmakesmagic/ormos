Eugene Harvey is playing Vial Affinity and started day one out with a 9-0 record. Eugene is a former U.S. National Champion and this TOGIT member has had great success with the winning deck from Grand Prix: Orlando. He is playing against John Pelcak, who is also 9-0 and in second place overall. He is playing a Red/Green deck with a lot of artifact spot removal built to deal with the vast number of Affinity decks played in this format. John is a player from the Minnesota and recently finished seventh at Pro Tour: Seattle with his teammates Tim Aten, and Rookie of the Year competitor Gadiel Szleifer. ### Game 1

Eugene started off slowly with [Blinkmoth Nexus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blinkmoth+Nexus) and [Chromatic Sphere](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chromatic+Sphere). Leading with the Nexus here prevents John from Oxidizing his first land and gaining a tempo advantage. On Eugene's third turn he used [Cranial Plating](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cranial+Plating) to get some early damage in. John could have cast [Oxidize](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oxidize) on the plating, but elected to leave his mana up for his [Wayfarer's Bauble](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wayfarer%27s+Bauble) having missed a land drop. John's fourth turn brought out a Virdian Shaman, destroying the [Cranial Plating](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cranial+Plating), but a Myr Retreiver could bring it back at any time. 

Eugene put pressure on with [Arcbound Ravager](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arcbound+Ravager) and [Atog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Atog) on his turn. The Ravager was met with an [Oxidize](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oxidize), keeping things about even. [Arc-Slogger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arc-Slogger) looked promising for John. Myr Retreiver is sacrificed to return [Cranial Plating](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cranial+Plating) leading to a big attack with a plated [Myr Enforcer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Myr+Enforcer) and an [Atog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Atog), which are both lethal damage if not blocked. John is forced to chump block with his Slogger and [Viridian Shaman](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Viridian+Shaman) and is far to behind with no creatures on the board to come back this game. The last turn [Atog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Atog) comes in for lethal damage. 

Harvey 1 - Pelcak 0

### Game 2

Pelcak double mulliganed playing this game and fell far behind. Affinity's speed greatly punishes poor draws like this and after John failed to play a second land it was essentially over. 

Harvey 2-0

Eugene attributed his win to his strong draw Game 1 and John's poor draw Game 2. John had previously gone 4-0 versus Affinity largely on the strength of [Isochron Scepter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Isochron+Scepter) and was a favorite but his deck failed to show up this match.
