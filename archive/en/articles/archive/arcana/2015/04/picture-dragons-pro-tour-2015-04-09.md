Michael Flores is the author of Deckade and The Official Miser's Guide; the designer of numerous State, Regional, Grand Prix, National, and Pro Tour–winning decks; and the onetime editor-in-chief of The Magic Dojo. He'd claim allegiance to Dimir (if such a Guild existed)… but instead will just shrug "Simic."

* That one red mana symbol was from one [Ryusei, the Falling Star](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ryusei%2C+the+Falling+Star) in Osyp's sideboard from the first Pro Tour Hawaii.
* Shuhei Nakamura got 9th at Pro Tour Philadelphia 2005, on tiebreakers. Shuhei played 3 copies of [Jugan, the Rising Star](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jugan%2C+the+Rising+Star); had Shuhei been luckier, there would have been nine green mana symbols up there.
* To add insult to injury, Philly 2005 used the "skins game" elimination format... It was theoretically impossible to miss Top 8 on breakers! poor Shuhei (and poor Jugan)
