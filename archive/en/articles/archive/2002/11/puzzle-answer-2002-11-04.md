Here is the solution to yesterday's [Magic: The Puzzling](/en/articles/archive/magic-puzzling-2002-11-01), "Double Duty." The steps can be performed in a slightly different order, but the general idea is as follows:


1. Tap the plains and two islands to add ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227125855im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/white.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161115194122im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/blue.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161115194122im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/blue.gif) to your mana pool. One island is destroyed by [Blight](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blight), but that doesn't matter.
2. Play [Green Ward](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Green+Ward) on Paul's [Bog Imp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bog+Imp). Both [Web](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Web)s fall off the Imp.
3. Play [Enchantment Alteration](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Enchantment+Alteration) on the [Green Ward](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Green+Ward). Move it to your [War Mammoth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=War+Mammoth).
4. Play [Unstable Mutation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Unstable+Mutation) on the Mammoth.
5. Attack with the 6/6 [War Mammoth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=War+Mammoth). Because it has protection from green, it can not be blocked by the [Grizzly Bears](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grizzly+Bears) or the [Giant Spider](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Giant+Spider). Paul can block with the [Bog Imp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bog+Imp), but even if he does, you can assign five trample damage to Paul, killing him.
