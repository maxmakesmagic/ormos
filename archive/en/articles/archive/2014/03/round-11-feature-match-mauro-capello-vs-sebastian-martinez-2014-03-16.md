With two losses, Mauro Capello and Sebastian Martinez found themselves in a tight spot heading into this Round 11 Feature Match. While a third loss is not a guarantee that they will fall out of Top 8 contention, it is likely that only one or two players at 12-3 will sneak in. In addition, a Top 64 performance will likely cement Sebastian Martinez's spot as the top Uruguayan player, something he will be able to defend at Pro Tour Journey to Nyx in a couple of months.



**The Decks**




 Capello's deck is one of the most common sights around the room and easily the most-played deck in the tournament: Esper Control. Still, there are a few interesting wrinkles in his build that provide him a bit of an advantage over the other Esper decks in the field. First, he has access to [Ashiok, Nightmare Weaver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ashiok%2C+Nightmare+Weaver), which provides a great threat against the mass of [Hallowed Fountain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hallowed+Fountain) decks in the field. Second, he has taken a cue from the WU Control decks that have been popular as of late, adding an [Elixir of Immortality](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elixir+of+Immortality) to his deck, giving his spells a little more life. He also has access to [Fated Retribution](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fated+Retribution), perfect for destroying opposing Planeswalkers.
