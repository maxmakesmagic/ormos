 At the *Dragon's Maze* Prerelease, players will choose their guild to run the Implicit Maze with, then receive a guild pack containing a guild booster pack for the guild they chose, a guild booster pack for an allied guild, and four *Dragon's Maze* booster packs. The two guild packs will be the same as they were in their original Prerelease, but will not have that set's Prerelease promo for those guilds. The guild Prerelease packs will contain the *Dragonâ€™s Maze* Prerelease promo but not a Spindown life counter, sticker, or guild welcome letter. For further information on the *Dragon's Maze* Prerelease, [read this Arcana](/en/node/648156).
