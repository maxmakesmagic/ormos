Remember that time, long ago, when Pro Tour *Eldritch Moon* was coming up? Many people were worried that the old Bant Company deck would dominate the top tables. That didn't happen, and the power of [Emrakul, the Promised End](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Emrakul%2C+the+Promised+End) and [Liliana, the Last Hope](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Liliana%2C+the+Last+Hope) reigned supreme.


This weekend, however, it looks like many of battlers have taken their deck from before the format shift. At least, most of them.


Take a look:

Bant Company—one of the least successful decks at the Pro Tour—has redesigned, rebuilt, and reclaimed the top spot. The most successful new deck from last week, Black-Green Delirium is a distant second place. And the Pedro Carvahlo wild-card, Blue-Red Fevered Burn, close on Delirium's heels in third—especially combined with the one Grixis Fevered Burn. The deck put two people in the Top 8 at Grand Prix Rimini, and has proven a true contender in the new format.


Quick Aside: Yes, there is a lumped in Blue-Red deck with four [Sphinx's Tutelage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sphinx%27s+Tutelage) in the maindeck. It is remarkably similar to Carvahlo's deck; and the discussion amongst the coverage team was whether [Sphinx's Tutelage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sphinx%27s+Tutelage) changes the overall strategy enough to justify a distinguished slot. Though it remains unsegregated, I wanted y'all to know that Tutelage is most definitely a thing.


The Four-Color Amalgam deck—using [Haunted Dead](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Haunted+Dead) and [Prized Amalgam](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Prized+Amalgam) for recursion shenanigans—has a fairly low representation, but it was admitted by many people that it's quite difficult to play. It's possible we won't see that doing more until the format wears on.


Some of the well performing oddballs include Green-Blue Crush, and Grixis Cat Pact. Look for a deck tech or two later on.


We'll see if Bant Company can leverage its clear advantage, as it has in Rimini, or if the pilots of the new decks can master ways to beat the Bant—while the opponents all chant, “Bant Touch This.”


I apologize for that last one. A little bit.
