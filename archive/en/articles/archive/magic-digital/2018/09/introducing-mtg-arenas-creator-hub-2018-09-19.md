 A longtime member of the Pro Tour and Grand Prix coverage staff, Nate Price now works making beautiful words for all of you lovely people as the community manager for organized play. When not covering events, he lords over the @MagicProTour Twitter account, ruling with an iron fist. 






[*Magic: The Gathering Arena's* Open Beta is right around the corner](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/magic-digital/mtg-arena-open-all-starting-september-27-2018-09-19), and we're ready to help our fans show the whole world how great our game is! We have a revamped approach to supporting creators, and it all starts with our brand-new Creator Hub.


Introducing the Creator Hub
===========================


Earlier this year, we experimented with a program designed to support and elevate our creators. We got a lot of excellent feedback from creators interested in the program, and we went back to the drawing board to incorporate it. The result is our [Creator Hub](https://magic.wizards.com/en/mtgarena/creators): your one-stop shop for resources dedicated to creating and sharing your *Magic: The Gathering Arena* content.


Starting in early October, every week we'll be featuring and promoting a selection of creators, and their content will be displayed front and center in our Creator Hub. To help us find new and up-and-coming creators, we have added a way for anyone interested in being featured to point us to their content.


For creators looking to improve their content and grow their audiences, we have links to resources to help level up your game, game assets with which to create content, and we're working with [Streamlabs](https://streamlabs.com/mtg/arena) to create a suite of streaming overlays.


Streamlabs Partnership
======================

Streamlabs makes tools and software allowing live streamers to engage with viewers, monetize their broadcasts, and grow their channels.


The team at Streamlabs has designed a series of custom *Magic: The Gathering Arena* overlay themes for streamers to choose from, including:


* Six custom overlay themes built around the Planeswalkers Ajani, Gideon, Jace, Teferi, Tezzeret, and Vivien;
* Stream notification animations (coming soon); and
* A series of adorable animated Planeswalker widgets designed by the *kawaii*-father himself, [100% Soft](https://100soft.us/) (coming soon).

You can download the Streamlabs overlays today [right here](https://streamlabs.com/mtg/arena).


*Guilds of Ravnica* Early Access on September 26
================================================

We'll be kicking off our new creator support efforts at 8:00 a.m. PT on September 26 with the *Guilds of Ravnica* Early-Access Event. This will be the first look into the Open Beta. During this time, invited streamers will have full access to our Open Beta build and will be free to stream for as much or as little as they want throughout the 24 hours following. Then, beginning at 1:00 p.m. PT on September 27, Open Beta will be available to the public.


This will be the largest streamer event we have ever put on. More than 300 streamers will be tuning in to crack the first packs of *Guilds of Ravnica*, showcase all the newest cards, and do their best to help us show off not only this brand-new set, but our transition to Open Beta.


It has been just shy of six months since we dropped the NDA on our Closed Beta, and we have loved seeing the number of *Magic* streamers and viewers grow over time. For us, this Early Access event serves as yet another thank you to those streamers who have been growing alongside us throughout our Closed Beta. We see all the work you've been putting in, we have loved watching your communities grow, and we can't wait for an opportunity to put your faces front and center on our Creator Hub.
