Blake is the content manager for DailyMTG.com, making him the one you should email if you have thoughts on the website, good or less good (or not good). He's a longtime coverage reporter and hasn't turned down a game of Magic in any format ever. 





In the past few weeks—and especially during the first week of *Magic 2015* previews—the intimidating visage of Garruk tainted by the Chain Veil has loomed large over everything, a shadowy figure shrouded in the mystery that accompanies preview week.



But with today's launch of HuntBiggerGame.com (look for it a bit later, as the site goes live in the middle of the day Pacific time on Monday, June 30), much of that mystery is revealed. Along with showing off the five Prerelease cards, the video that accompanies HuntBiggerGame.com features one character you won't want to miss:



Garruk himself.



Larger than life and practically seeping black mana, Garruk awaits at every turn in the "choose your own adventure"–style video ready to send you to your doom—or at the very least, deny you a sweet, sweet preview card. It's cruel, really.



We aren't nearly so cruel here at DailyMTG.com. Sure, we made you wait a week to see Garruk's newest cardboard iteration. But that wait is over.



Meet the scourge of Planeswalkers everywhere—Garruk, Apex Predator.

Worth the wait, right? We saw a transformation take place between [Garruk Relentless](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Garruk+Relentless) and [Garruk, the Veil-Cursed](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Garruk%2C+the+Veil-Cursed), but it looks like that transformation has taken hold for good. Or at least for the time being.



There are a lot of cool things going on with Garruk, Apex Predator. For one, he's the first Planeswalker with four abilities since [Jace, the Mind Sculptor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace%2C+the+Mind+Sculptor), and that card turned out to be pretty good.



Garruk also happens to be the first truly original multicolor Planeswalker in a core set. [Nicol Bolas, Planeswalker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nicol+Bolas%2C+Planeswalker), loomed large over the core set in *Magic 2013*, but that was a reprint.



But the part that really chills the bones is Garruk's first line of text.



*Destroy another target Planeswalker.*



Few lines of game text tell a story like that one. Garruk is definitely hunting some bigger game these days, and there are few bigger targets in the multiverse than Planeswalkers themselves. And Garruk is coming for them.
