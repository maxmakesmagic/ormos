Day 2 Coverage



Taiga Tsujikawa has won Grand Prix Melbourne 2018! After a stunning 9-0 performance on Day 1, Tsujikawa continued his run, leading the field throughout Day 2 and entering the Top 8 as second seed after a draw will Calvin Liu, who had also 9-0’d Day 1. Tsujikawa dispatched Grand Prix Sydney 2017 Team Champion Ivan Schroder in the Quarterfinals before moving on to take down Shawn Khoo in the Semifinals, and again finding Liu baring his path in the finals.


Both had played Boros on Day 1, and both had again drafted it in the Top 8, beautifully setting the scene for a tournament defined by the aggressive Guild. Liu took Game 1, but Tsujikawa battled back to win the Finals and become the Grand Prix Melbourne Champion!


Also joining them in the Top 8 were New Zealand’s Zen Takahashi, picking up his 5th Grand Prix Top 8, Sydney’s Prads Pathirana with his second, Canberra’s Ivan Schroder with his second, Shawn Khoo, who has represented Malaysia in the World Magic Cup twice, as well as Dennis Chan, and Derik Hoh. I’m sure all of which will be eager to try and better their finish in February at Grand Prix Sydney 2019!

Day 1 Coverage



Shawn Khoo, Taiga Tsujikawa, and Calvin Liu finished the day undefeated at 9-0 under the Boros banner, and each cited Aurelia, Exemplar of Justice as the star of their decks. Which makes sense, right? Of course the leader of the Guild would be leading her faithful followers into battle.


Also joining them playing on Day 2 tomorrow are a bunch of names familiar to the Australia and New Zealand Grand Prix scene, like Justin Robb, Cole Swannack, Garry Wong, Ryan Cubit, Anthony Lee, James Zhang, Paul Jackson, Jason Chung, Rei Sato, Zen Takahashi, Joseph Sclauzero, and David Mines.


141 players will be back on Day 2 to draft *Guilds of Ravnica*. Who will win and which Guild will they be representing? We’ll find out tomorrow!
