### Frank Karsten


**Hometown:** Eindhoven, Netherlands  
**Number of times playing on Pro Tour:** +/= 40  
**How many Worlds have you played in?** 9  
**How did you qualify for 2008 Worlds?** Pro Points and Nationals  
**Number of GP/PT Top 8s:** 2 PT Top 8s, 6 GP Top 8s (not counting this one)  
**Other previous Magic accomplishments:**  

-Voted as “The Fanatic” into the Invitational.  

-Wrote the “Online Tech” column for **magicthegathering.com**.


**Standard record:** 4-2  
**What Standard deck did you play, and why?**  

Faeries. I analyzed a lot of Top 8 decklists from State Championships and Magic Online Premier Events and found that Faeries was performing the best. I then aggregated all the Faeries decklists that I found into an “average” decklist.


**Booster Draft record:** 5-1  
**What was your draft strategy?**  

Pick single-colored cards in the beginning rather than triple-color cards, because I prefer not to commit to a shard too early. Flexibility is important. Furthermore, I prefer Jund. It is my favorite shard, because it has lots of playables, removal, and synergy.


**Extended record:** 4-0-2  
**What Extended deck did you play and why?**  

Elf Ball. I played the deck in Pro Tour-Berlin, so I had a lot of experience with it. While I expected a lot of hate versus Elves, I still thought that Elves would be too strong and consistent. With post-sideboard Thoughtseizes, Umezawa’s Jitte, and a couple bigger creatures I felt that I could beat the hate cards. It worked.


**How did you prepare for the event? Who did you prepare with?**  

I did not playtest that much; I just analyzed Top 8 Standard decklists I found online and took my Extended deck from the previous Pro Tour. My preparation was mostly together with the Belgian crew and I did a few drafts with the players from Eindhoven. Thanks go out to the Manamaze shop for my Constructed cards.

Five-Color Control. I wanted to challenge myself for Day 2 and Day 3 :)

I like drafting Red-Black because there is a lot of synergy. Red-Green is a mise too.


**Extended record:** 5-1

Mono-blue Faeries/Control (aka “The Wiz”) by Gabe Nassif. The deck is great because it’s very efficient and doesn’t really have many bad matchups.

I prepared by testing Constructed with my online group which included Mark Herberholz, Gabe Nassif, Steve Sadin, Antonino De Rosa, Tim Landale, Melissa DeTora. If I’m forgetting anyone, they are demanding this sheet now and I can’t write anymore!

**Booster Draft record:** 5-1  
**What was your draft strategy?**  

I like red and especially Jund, but I try not to force it. Being reactive is just better.

**What Extended deck did you play and why did you play it?**  

Zoo, because I didn’t want to play anything else, and Zoo is always the backup plan.


**How did you prepare for this event? Who did you prepare with?**  

I played a bit with some friends, but all my playtesting for Berlin and Hollywood was still relevant.
