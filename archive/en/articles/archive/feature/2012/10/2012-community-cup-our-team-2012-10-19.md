The 2012 Community cup is perilously close! On October 24-26, a team of players will face off against a team from Wizards of the Coast for glory and bragging rights.


[Last month](/en/articles/archive/2012-community-cup-team-2012-09-19), we announced the community team: Jon Loucks, Neale Talbot, Jesse Smith, Heath Newton, Jackie Lee, Conley Woods, Walter Kolczynski, and James Turner.


[Last week](/en/articles/archive/community-cup%E2%80%99s-formats-stakes-2012-10-10), we announced the formats: *Return to Ravnica* Sealed, Cube Draft, *Ravnica* Unified Constructed, and Multiball Wacky Draft. We also posted a poll for what the stakes would be. We'll share the winner at the end of this arcana. (The one you're reading right now!)


Bur first! It's time to meet the home team. Here's the Wizards of the Coast team for the 2012 Community Cup!


### Community Cup Wizards Team



![Braids, Cabal Minion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Braids%2C+Cabal+Minion)

### Shay Hall


**What do you do for Wizards?** I'm one of the managers on the Game Support/Customer Service/ORC team. I started as a Magic Online moderator in 2001, before it went live.


**When did you first start playing Magic?** 1994, during *The Dark*.


**What is your favorite card?** [Braids, Cabal Minion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Braids%2C+Cabal+Minion)


**How will you help defeat the Community Team?** If the Community Team wins, I can have their Magic Online accounts muted forever, so they should probably take that into consideration.



![Howling Mine](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Howling+Mine)

### Bill Stark


**What do you do for Wizards?** I'm the content manager (editor-in-chief) of the [Wizards Play Network website](/en/articles/archive/event-coverage/feature-greeting-wizards-play-network-2008-07-14).


**When did you first start playing Magic?** When my brother Mike introduced me to it in about 1995. *Fallen Empires* was the first expansion I ever played with, and [Hymn to Tourach](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hymn+to+Tourach) is still one of my favorite cards!


**What is your favorite card?** I'm partial to [Howling Mine](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Howling+Mine) but my coworkers tease me for drafting Turbo Fog pretty much every chance I get.


**How will you help defeat the Community Team?** As a former Community Cup champion (alongside teammate Gavin Verhey!) for the Community in 2010 I know what it takes to win. Now I'm using that knowledge for the forces of good instead of the forces of evil...err, I mean, Community!



![Oath of Druids](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Oath+of+Druids)

### Robert Schuster


**What do you do for Wizards? Game Support & Operations for Magic Online.** We create events during the downtime, talk to the MTGO team about issues that we notice or are reported, and try our best to fix issues when they pop up. You can find me in MTGO as WotC\_Robert.


**When did you first start playing Magic?** I started playing in high school during *The Dark*. I still have a couple of the [Maze of Ith](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Maze+of+Ith)s that have almost 20 years later have markings on them that match the pattern of the bleachers in my High School gym.


**What is your favorite card?** This changes a lot but currently it is [Oath of Druids](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oath+of+Druids). It does so many splashy fun things!


**How will you help defeat the Community Team?** Probably by listening to help from the other Wizards team members. This Ryan Spain guy is really good and I'm hoping he'll be able to coach me into a better cube drafter. It was pretty neat to have listened to him on Limited Resources and then get the chance to work with him on **Magic Online**.



![Tribal Flames](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Tribal+Flames)

### Tom LaPille


**What do you do for Wizards?** I'm a **Magic** developer.


**When did you first start playing Magic?** *Tempest*


**What is your favorite card?** [Tribal Flames](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tribal+Flames)


**How will you help defeat the Community Team?** By winning matches.



![Viridian Emissary](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Viridian+Emissary)

### Dave Marsee


**What do you do for Wizards?** I'm the UI designer for the new **Magic Online** client. (now in beta!)

**What is your favorite card?** [Viridian Emissary](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Viridian+Emissary) (gimme land, lotsa land!)


**How will you help defeat the Community Team?** I plan on populating my Selesnya armies and trampling all over the community team. RAWR



![Control Magic](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Control+Magic)

### Dave Humphreys


**What do you do for Wizards?** Manage the R&D development team


**When did you first start playing Magic?** Spring break of 1994


**What is your favorite card?** [Control Magic](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Control+Magic)


**How will you help defeat the Community Team?** Intimidating bling



![Wild Ricochet](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Wild+Ricochet)

### Dan Emmons


**What do you do for Wizards**? I am an associate designer for Magic. This means its my job to help create the new sets and cards that go into each new expansion!


**When did you first start playing Magic?** Briefly during *Tempest* and more heavily during *Prophecy*.


**What is your favorite card?** [Wild Ricochet](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Ricochet). Combines the fun of turning an opponent's spell against them with copying things!


**How will you help defeat the Community Team?** My first act as new designer was to implant all cards with a self destruction function should they ever be turned against us.



![Goblin Guide](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Goblin+Guide)

### Lee Sharpe


**What do you do for Wizards?** I'm the business intelligence analyst for **Magic Online**. I help analyze our programs, event offerings, and other initiatives. I also help out with data-driven initiatives such as the **Magic Online** event coverage, the **Magic Online** newsletter, and data to R&D about popular and successful decks and cards in **Magic Online** events. And I try to help out in any other way I can to try to make **Magic Online** the best **Magic Online** it can be!


**When did you first start to play Magic?** *Revised* was the first set I ever played. It scares me to realize some people reading this will have been born after that.


**What is your favorite card?** [Goblin Guide](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Guide). Nothing feels as exciting, powerful, and awesome, as attacking with a turn 1 [Goblin Guide](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Guide).


**How will you help defeat the Community team?** "Wait, you're saying the Community team won that game? As an analyst, after conducting a rigorous analysis on the game data, my results clearly shows that it was a Wizards team victory. Your claim seems sketchy. Let's just mark that game for the Wizards team..."



![Reveillark](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Reveillark)

### Gavin Verhey


**What do you do for Wizards?** I'm a game designer for **Magic** and **Kaijudo**. I also do a lot of other awesome jobs, with everything from writing articles for Dailymtg.com to creating flavor text and names for **Kaijudo** cards.


**When did you first start playing Magic?** January 2001, when I was 10 years old.


**What is your favorite card?** [Reveillark](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reveillark)! Its power sates my Spike hunger, its combo potential fulfills my Johnny needs, and its splash on the battlefield tickles my Timmyness.


**How will you help defeat the Community Team?** By building all of the Unified *Ravnica* decks! Also, by winning matches.



![Kiki-Jiki, Mirror Breaker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Kiki-Jiki%2C+Mirror+Breaker)

### Trick Jarrett


**What do you do for Wizards?** I am Editor-in-Chief for DailyMTG.com

**How will you help defeat the Community Team?** Through Monty Python-esque taunting!



![Takklemaggot](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Takklemaggot)

### Michael DiPetrillo


**What do you do for Wizards?** I am a senior software test engineer for **Magic Online**. I am responsible for coordinating the MTGO closed beta and quality assurance for future card content.


**When did you first start playing Magic?** *Legends*


**What is your favorite card?** [Takklemaggot](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Takklemaggot). Not close.


**How will you help defeat the Community Team?** I have access to Avatar of Congress which circumvents rules and has functional goodies such as: "{0}: Deploy Bears". Cheating aside, I will contribute to defeat of the Community Team by liberally distributing thunderous high fives.



![Garruk's Companion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Garruk%27s+Companion)

### Jennifer Meyen


**What do you do for Wizards?** I am the Assistant Brand Manager for Magic. I work on the product side, which means I work on packaging and physical advertising, I select and manage marketing art, attend lots of meetings and do many other things for Magic. I'm also a host for the DailyMTG Podcast.


**When did you first start playing Magic?** During M11 while working during tournaments at a game store.


**What is your favorite card?** For nostalgic reasons, [Garruk's Companion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Garruk%27s+Companion) will always be my favorite card.


**How will you help defeat the Community Team?** My team considers me to be the Spikiest member of the Brand Team because I don't back down from a fight and when I fight, I am dedicated to winning. I've already played *Return to Ravnica* religiously, so I know what strategies I win with. Plus, I'm small, cute, and friendly so they won't expect what's coming.



![Necropotence](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Necropotence)

### Erik Lauer

**What is your favorite card?** My favorite card is [Necropotence](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Necropotence).

### Mike Robles


**What do you do for Wizards?** I'm the Community Manager for **Magic: The Gathering**! I tweet, Facebook, and hand out free swag!


**When did you first start playing Magic?** I actually started in *Alpha*. Yup. I'm older than I look.


**What is your favorite card?** ALL OF THEM


**How will you help defeat the Community Team?** Easy. Niv-Mizzet is my co-pilot.



![Riddle of Lightning](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Riddle+of+Lightning)

### Shawn Main


**What do you do for Wizards?** I'm a Magic designer, one of the current generation to emerge from GDS2. I was on the development team for *Return to Ravnica* and you might have seen some of my encounters and challenges in Duels 2013.


**When did you first start playing Magic?** *Revised* / *Fallen Empires*. I had an early love affair with [Lord of Atlantis](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lord+of+Atlantis) and [Merieke ri Berit](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Merieke+ri+Berit).


**What is your favorite card?** [Riddle of Lightning](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Riddle+of+Lightning) for the moments where it makes you hold your breath or [Pestilence](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pestilence) for the multiplayer games where your opponents need to negotiate like you're strapped with dynamite.


**How will you help defeat the Community Team?** Have you seen [Mercurial Chemister](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mercurial+Chemister)? I assume the bombs I've designed will just flock into my packs for RtR Sealed.



![Reveillark](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Reveillark)

### Jason Radabaugh


**What do you do for Wizards?** I am a software developer working on **Magic Online**. I was formerly a member, and later the lead, of the card-coding team, where I worked on every set from *Coldsnap* through *Dark Ascension*. I now work on the back-end servers for maintenance and new projects.


**When did you first start playing Magic?** 4th grade. I remember making some really poor trades for [Sengir Vampire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sengir+Vampire) and [White Knight](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=White+Knight). I played until *Tempest*, stopped due to lack of time, then picked the game back up in college when *Mirrodin* came out.


**What is your favorite card**? [Reveillark](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reveillark).


**How will you help defeat the Community Team?** Mike DiPetrillo will be in charge of high fives, so I will be in charge of chest bumps. Together, we will be unstoppable.



![Cockatrice](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Cockatrice)

![Etched Oracle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Etched+Oracle)

### Dave Guskin


**What do you do for Wizards?** I'm a designer in Magic R&D – I work on Magic cards, of course, but I also help create play experiences (like the "choose your guild" experience for *Return to Ravnica*) you have in-stores and online with Magic product.


**When did you first start playing Magic?** I went into a game store as a young lad in 1994 and saw a display of *Antiquities* on the wall. I was curious and had some money, so I bought some boosters and was hooked instantly. It's been my favorite game ever since!


**What is your favorite card?** [Etched Oracle](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Etched+Oracle) from *Fifth Dawn*. I am pretty greedy when it comes to how many colors I want to play, and I love the combination of efficient creature and open-ended card advantage engine that the Oracle provides. Also, sweet art by Matt Cavotta!


**How will you help defeat the Community Team?** I'll use the one-two punch of lulling them into a false sense of security via compliments, fun experiences and free food. Then I'll FINISH THEM with my master Johnny-ness in our multiball Cube Draft activity!



![Vraska the Unseen](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Vraska+the+Unseen)

### Sean Gibbons


**What do you do for Wizards?** I'm the Community Coordinator for **Magic Online** and **Duels of the Planeswalkers**. I believe I'm also the most qualified Magic card tarot reader in the office.


**When did you first start playing Magic?** Around 1994, I think.


**What is your favorite card?** Oh no, *that* question. I umm... Master Transmu... NO, I like Tezzeret. Vraska is also great. For my favorite card, though, I'll have to go with either *Panoptic Disciple of Bloodgift Wurmcoil Metamorph* or probably *Sharuum the Solemn Worm Harvest Crucible Ruinator*. Unfortunately I think they both just got banned from Commander.


**How will you help defeat the Community Team?** I have the Weirding Way. If that doesn't work then I'll just rely completely on luck and dirty tactics like pulling the fire alarm.



![Tavern Swindler](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Tavern+Swindler)

### Billy Moreno


**What do you do for Wizards?** I'm a developer on the Magic R&D team. *Return to Ravnica* was the second set I worked on.


**When did you first start playing Magic?** In 8th grade, while *Fallen Empires* were on the shelves. Although I didn't really get into the game until years later when I found MTGO during *Odyssey* block.


**What is your favorite card?** [Tavern Swindler](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tavern+Swindler). I'm really lucky.


**How will you help defeat the Community Team?** In ways they'll never see coming. Also, by playing as many colors as possible.



![Warp World](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Warp+World)

### Ryan Spain


**What do you do for Wizards?** I am a Digital Designer in R&D. My primary responsibility is the ongoing design of **Magic Online** features and the digital implementation of new card sets, but like everyone in R&D, I also contribute to the design and playtesting of new Magic sets.


**When did you first start playing Magic?** In 1995, I played my first game of **Magic** against future coverage commentator Marshall Sutcliffe!


**What is your favorite card?** [Warp World](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Warp+World) remains at the top of my list. My favorite spellslinging deck is a Modern brew that involves recurring [Warp World](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Warp+World) with [Eternal Witness](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eternal+Witness) until I have a [Spawnsire of Ulamog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spawnsire+of+Ulamog) on the battlefield and 20 mana in my pool, at which point I cast 120 Eldrazi creatures. That usually earns a concession, but I will give a booster box to the first person who manages to beat me after my Eldrazi army hits the table.


**How will you help defeat the Community Team?** Nothing we've tried has worked so far, and this might be the most talented Community team yet. I'm thinking we should just have Erik Lauer, Mike Turian, and Dave Humphreys pace the area behind the Wizards computers, making every decision for every turn of every game. That seems like our best shot.



![Maro](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Maro)

### Mark Rosewater


**What do you do for Wizards?** I am the Head Designer for **Magic**.


**When did you first start playing Magic?** I started playing with *Alpha*. I had heard about it but wasn't able to find any for sale until I went to a local game convention. I've been playing ever since.


**What is your favorite card?** [Maro](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Maro). I liked him so much I named myself after him. : )


**How will you help defeat the Community Team?** Through inspiring gross overconfidence.



![Fallen Angel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Fallen+Angel)

### Scott Larabee


**What do you do for Wizards?** I am the Organized Play Programs Manager. I am also the Pro Tour Tournament Manager and was on the Commander design team.


**When did you first start playing Magic?** January 1994 (shortly before *Antiquities* was released)


**What is your favorite card?** [Fallen Angel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fallen+Angel)


**How will you help defeat the Community Team?** Draft the best deck I can and not play too badly.



![Wasteland](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Wasteland)

### Mike Turian


**What do you do for Wizards?** I'm the Technology Customer Engagement Services Manager. I work on projects such as [Planeswalker Points](http://www.planeswalkerpoints.com/), [Wizards Event Reporter](/en/articles/archive/event-coverage/draft-viewer-1-2013-05-17) and the new [Store & Event Locator](http://locator.wizards.com/). Before coming to the Technology team I have been in Organized Play and **Magic** R&D.


**When did you first start playing Magic?** I started playing **Magic** during my sophomore year of high school. That was the fall of 1994, 18 years ago!


**What is your favorite card?** [Wasteland](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wasteland). I love all non-blue **Magic** cards but I have a special place in my heart for [Wasteland](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wasteland)!


**How will you help defeat the Community Team?** I'm pretty good at drafting.



![Wildfire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Wildfire)

### Sam Stoddard


**What do you do for Wizards?** Development Intern. I work on **Magic** sets, FFL, and draft.


**When did you first start playing Magic?** September 1994.


**What is your favorite card?** [Wildfire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wildfire).


**How will you help defeat the Community Team?** I've been drafting bad cube decks for half a decade, the Multiball Wacky-Draft is right up my alley.



![Library of Alexandria](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Library+of+Alexandria)

### Jon Hickey


**What do you do for Wizards?** Social Media and Community Manager

### Chris Kiritz


**What do you do for Wizards?** I am currently the Business Manager for **Magic Online**.


**When did you first start playing Magic?** Started in 1994 and played super casually. Started playing for real with *Tempest* and *Urza's Block* and stopped again after *Invasion* block. Started again with *Lorwyn* and haven't looked back.


**What is your favorite card?** I really have a soft spot for [Serra Angel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Serra+Angel), but I still get a kick out of playing ridiculous beaters with [Sneak Attack](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sneak+Attack).


**How will you help defeat the Community Team?** By playing **Magic** digitally. Also, by helping ensure that they are so dazzled by their experience here that they cannot concentrate on the game. Failing all else, I will have the dev team "fix" the shuffler.



![LIfe From the Loam](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Life+from+the+Loam)

**How will you help defeat the Community Team?** I'll be training day and night at the Seattle Pinball to perfect my MULTIBALL! skills.


That's a lot of people! Here's how they break down across the formats:

And now, the stakes. If the plucky upstarts on the community team defeats the Wizards of the Coast team, everyone who logs into **Magic Online** during the Cup will get one enter into a draft queue. And, based on your vote, the winning format is...


*Return to Ravnica*! If the community team wins, roughly a month later, there will be a Phantom single-elimination draft queue open for a week. And everyone who logged in during the Community Cup gets a free entry! And everyone who *plays* gets a promo [Mwonvuli Beast Tracker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mwonvuli+Beast+Tracker). The winner of each queue will get a *Return to Ravnica* booster pack!


But what happens if the community team falls to the might of the Wizards of the Coast team? Well, then everyone who logged in during the Community Cup gets a special 2012 Community Cup version of [Sorrow's Path](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sorrow%27s+Path) in a modern frame. Enjoy!
