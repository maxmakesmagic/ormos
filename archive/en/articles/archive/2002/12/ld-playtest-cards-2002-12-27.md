*This Arcana first appeared on April 5, 2002.*
There's not a lot of guesswork involved with this batch of playtest cards, since Richard Garfield had most of the names and mechanics ironed out at the time these were made. (These cards are from the third -- or "Gamma" -- round of playtest cards for the first printing of **Magic**.)


But in any event, it's always fun to look at some of the relics from the game's past. Here are four cards from that early batch, all of which keep with our Land Destruction theme.


Using the original "casting cost" system (in which the number represents the entire cost), Flashfires was unchanged at ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227130050im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless3.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227130159im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/red.gif).
