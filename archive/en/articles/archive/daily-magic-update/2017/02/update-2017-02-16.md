The February 16, 2017 Update
============================

The Daily *Magic* Update is a roundup of everything *Magic* you should know on February 16, 2017. Today's Update is brought to you by half-priced Valentine's Day candy. It's everywhere, and it's just as delicious as it was on February 14.


What People Are Talking About
=============================

This actually comes out of a conversation where a number of people were complaining about the formats of Pro Tour Qualifiers at Grand Prix and Hélène Bergeot, our very responsive director of organized play, said that (and I'm paraphrasing here) it was difficult to discern feedback trends sometimes because people tend to say something when they don't like something but not say anything when they do.


It's not a new concept—the "silent majority" is well-known—but it especially holds true for a company and for people like us who try to listen as much as possible and take feedback seriously. Positive feedback helps guide future decisions just as much as negative feedback does. Seriously, it really does. No decision is easier than "Hey, a lot of people liked that—we should try to do it again."


Plus, it's just so much nicer.

This was just really cool, hanging out on the internet, being all informative. It shows groupings and relationships among all the known Planeswalkers, including a few who haven't even been shown on a card. You'll need to open the image in a new tab and zoom in to read it, but it's worth it.


After Those, Read, Watch, or Listen to These
============================================


1. [Chandra's Story: Diraden](http://www.gatheringmagic.com/samkeeper-02162017-chandras-story-diraden/) | Gathering Magic | Sam Keeper

Delve deeper into Chandra's backstory as Keeper shines a light on *The Purifying Fire*, a Chandra-centric *Magic* novel from before we moved all the story online. This article is a lore-lover's dream, as Keeper gets into all the minute details—good and bad—in a story you can't find online.


1. [*Aether Revolt* Listener Questions Answered](http://lrcast.com/limited-resources-376-aether-revolt-listener-questions-answered/) | Limited Resources | Marshall Sutcliffe and Luis Scott-Vargas

You asked, they answered. Well, maybe not you specifically, but people like you with questions much like you might have about *Aether Revolt* Limited. From the technical to the tactical, they've got listener questions covered.


1. [The Four Big Problems with Standard](http://www.channelfireball.com/articles/the-4-big-problems-with-standard/) | ChannelFireball | Mike Sigrist

Siggy sees four issues with Standard right now—and offers four solutions.


1. [Lose Yourself in the Optimistic Art of *Magic: The Gathering*'s *Kaladesh* Plane](http://www.forbes.com/sites/laurenorsini/2017/02/15/lose-yourself-in-the-optimistic-art-of-magic-the-gatherings-kaladesh-plane/#46338b67cf16) | Forbes | Lauren Orsini

Orsini reviews the latest *Magic* art book all about *Kaladesh*. Oh! And what a coincidence—*Plane Shift: Kaladesh* happens to have come out today!


(It actually is a coincidence. I am not this good at planning.)


1. [What You Are Sacrificing to Beat Copycat](http://www.mtgmintcard.com/articles/writers/chapman-sim/what-you-are-sacrificing-to-beat-copycat) | MTGMintCard | Chapman Sim

The title would more be more accurate as "Top 9 Ways to Beat Copycat," as it mostly discusses solutions to the combo. From the obvious and widely played—like [Grasp of Darkness](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grasp+of+Darkness)—to the sneaky and weird—like [Implement of Combustion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Implement+of+Combustion)—Sim has all the ways to beat the combo.


Community Spotlight
===================


1. [Defend Your Picks: Patty Robertson—NLG Preston](http://www.draftaholicsanonymous.com/defend-your-picks-patty-robertson-nlg-preston/) | Draftaholics Anonymous | Richard Spriggs

This is an interesting concept. Much like we all watch drafters at the Pro Tour, Draftaholics Anonymous (the same ones with the cool [Pack 1, Pick 1 feature](http://www.draftaholicsanonymous.com/p1p1-aether-revolt/)) is traveling to local game stores, recording drafts, and then having the player drafting—in this case Patty Robertson at Next Level Games Preston—explain their picks. The video and audio are both very clean, which makes it easy to follow along and see what was going on in the player's head at the time.


Deck of the Day
===============


1. [Temur Tower](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/mtgo-standings/competitive-standard-constructed-league-2017-02-15)

*Magic Online* user Yaya3 (which just so happens to match [the Twitter handle](https://twitter.com/yaya3_) of this Hall of Fame Pro. Hmm . . . ) recently went 5-0 in a *Magic Online* Competitive Standard League with this unique [Dynavolt Tower](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dynavolt+Tower) brew. While most people pair their [Dynavolt Tower](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dynavolt+Tower) to Izzet builds, Yaya3 not only added green for a bit of extra energy kick in the form of [Rogue Refiner](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rogue+Refiner) and [Attune with Aether](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Attune+with+Aether), but also brought [Shielded Aether Thief](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shielded+Aether+Thief) into the light as a card-drawing, creature-blocking engine for a dedicated energy deck.


Green also offers the deck some strong artifact destruction with [Natural Obsolescence](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Natural+Obsolescence) making both a main deck and sideboard appearance.


Is this the future of control in Standard? Maybe the Consulate had it right—whoever controls the energy controls everything.
