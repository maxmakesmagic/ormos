So you've no doubt seen Baneslayer Angel by now. If you haven't, feast your eyes on this:


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/tcg/products/magic2010/e15bu3ip4z_EN.jpg)Nice art by Greg Staples, eh? Here's what it looked like as a sketch.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/arcana/229_sketch1.jpg)When he finished it, it looked like this.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/arcana/229_final.jpg)Now, here's the rest of the story. Let's go back in time all the way to 2005 and the Player's Guide for *Ninth Edition*. On pages 12-14, there's an interview with Greg Staples, and it includes this fascinating tidbit.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/arcana/229_9EPlayersGuide.jpg)Yes, Greg drew a great angel, but it just didn't look like [Serra Angel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Serra+Angel). So we bided our time until we had just the right angel for the art. And now we do!


  
  
**Core Set Survivor!**There are exactly sixteen cards that have been in every core set from *Alpha* to *Tenth Edition*. When ***Magic** 2010* comes out, only *eight* cards will have been in every core set. Over the weeks before the ***Magic** 2010* prerelease, we'll be counting them down in this special Arcana sub-feature, giving you an "IN" or "OUT" on one card a day. Step forward, [Air Elemental](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Air+Elemental).
