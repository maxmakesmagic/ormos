Grand Prix New Jersey is set to be one of the largest Grand Prix of all time, and is already a lock for the largest Legacy tournament ever. That's a lot of [Show and Tell](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Show+and+Tell)s, [Brainstorm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brainstorm)s, [Fireblast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fireblast)s, [Mother of Runes](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mother+of+Runes)es, [Stoneforge Mystic](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stoneforge+Mystic)s, [Underground Sea](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Underground+Sea)s, [Dark Ritual](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dark+Ritual)s, [High Tide](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=High+Tide)s, [Karakas](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Karakas)es, [Exploration](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Exploration)s, [Æther Vial](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=%C3%86ther+Vial)s, [Wasteland](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wasteland)s, and a whole lot more.


If you're not one of the expected 3,000+ players who will be playing in the main event, then you can still be part of the action by tuning in to the live broadcast this weekend. Video for Grand Prix New Jersey is brought to you by the SCGLive crew, and is hosted by Cedric Phillips, Patrick Sullivan, and Matthias Hunt.


Coverage begins on the [SCGLive Twitch channel](http://www.twitch.tv/scglive) Saturday at 10:30 a.m. local time/7:30 a.m./2:30 p.m. GMT. Coverage resumes on Sunday at 9 a.m. local time/6 a.m. PT/1 p.m. GMT.

While players in North America battle each other in one of *Magic*'s Eternal formats, the competitors in Europe will be settling in for two days with a format that's a little bit more Modern. Grand Prix Madrid will be Modern's first time in the spotlight since the release of *Khans of Tarkir*, and that the set has shaken up the Eternal formats, the impact it is expected to have on Modern is huge. Will the hype for the new cards be proven correct, or will the impact of the new set be regulated merely to tweaks to everyone's mana, thanks to the ally-colored fetch lands?


Join Rich Hagon, Marijn Lybaert, Hall of Famer Raphaël Lévy, Simon Görtzen, and Steven Leeming as they bring you live video coverage from Madrid all weekend! Coverage can be found on the [*Magic* Twitch](http://www.twitch.tv/magic) channel starting Saturday at 1 p.m. local time/4 a.m. PT/7 a.m. ET/12 p.m. GMT. Coverage resumes on Sunday at 9 a.m. local time/12 a.m. PT/3 a.m. ET/8 a.m. GMT.

The finale to the first season of the [Vintage Super League](http://vintagesuperleague.com/) is fast approaching! After an absolutely brutal semifinal victory over Eric Froehlich, Hall of Famer Luis Scott-Vargas will be heading into the finals against former Vintage Champion Steve Menendian in a best of five *matches* bout between two polarizing archetypes: a Sultai [Fastbond](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fastbond) deck against Blue-Red Delver.


Will the "creature" deck of Vintage reign supreme, or will the good ol' combo deck outmaneuver the Delver menace to take it down? Join host Randy Buehler and a supporting cast of Vintage Super League competitors as they bring you the finals!


The Vintage Super League season one finale will air on the [*Magic* Twitch channel](http://www.twitch.tv/magic) on Tuesday, November 18 at 7 p.m. PT/10 p.m. ET/2 a.m. GMT.
