One of the fun things about a core set, from the point of view of the person who does the Arcanas (that's me!) is that reprints provide an excuse to look back at interesting things we didn't have time or space to talk about when they actually happened.


Such is the case with [Vedalken Entrancer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vedalken+Entrancer), which is making a triumphant return in ***Magic** 2013* after not having been seen since its original appearance in *Ravnica: City of Guilds*.



[![89028](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&multiverseid=89028)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=89028)

Here's the original art description that was given to Dan Scott:



> 
> Color: Blue  
> 
> Location: Your choice in the city  
> 
> Action: Show a hooded Vedalken adviser pointing something out of frame.  
> 
> Focus: The Vedalken advisor  
> 
> Mood: Alert, watchful  
> 
> Notes: he commands things to "untap" at will
> 
> 
> 


This was years ago (*Ravnica* came out in October 2005), so art descriptions were different then. The art director is now less likely to include a description of what the card does, for example. Anyway, here's what Dan's first sketch looked like.

The creative team asked for another version of the entrancer's hood, and Dan gave them this:

This was close to what they asked for, but they needed further changes. The final sketch was even more different, featuring a left-right swap and the hood's removal altogether.

That was the final version, which can be seen in *Ravnica* packs and, soon, in ***Magic** 2013* booster packs.

Seven years later, it's normally hard to tell why the hood needed all that work. That first version looks just like a Vedalken wizard, right? See why they needed Dan to revamp it below.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/arcana/1008_vedalkendismisser.jpg)[Vedalken Dismisser](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vedalken+Dismisser) | Art by [Dan Scott](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&artist=%5B%22Dan+Scott%22%5D)


[Vedalken Entrancer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vedalken+Entrancer) wasn't the only Vedalken wizard in *Ravnica*! Dan Scott also illustrated [Vedalken Dismisser](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vedalken+Dismisser), which had to be distinguished from the entrancer somehow. It would be confusing if these two cards showed characters who were dressed the same, right? That's also why [Vedalken Entrancer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vedalken+Entrancer) got flipped horizontally; the glowing hand had to be moved to a different part of the card.
