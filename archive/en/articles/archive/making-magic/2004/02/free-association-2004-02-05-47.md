I'm a huge fan of the philosophy of the five colors. If you are too, here's a [fun](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/mr110.asp?origin=fun) activity to try next time you and some **Magic** friends have nothing better to do: Pick a topic. Animals, cartoon characters, countries, vegetables, etc. Then for each color try and find an example for each color.

Let me take a shot. The topic is household appliances.

**White**: Vacuum Cleaner. Its role is to keep things neat and tidy.  
**Blue**: Computer. It's all about the collection and use of knowledge.  
**Black**: Garbage Disposal. It lives in a damp and dark place and is used to eliminate the existence of things.  
**Red**: Toaster. It exists to burn things. Only human intervention keeps it from doing so.  
**Green**: Air filter. It just wants to maintain the room.

The funniest part of me doing this little exercise is that I know I'm going to get mail.

> The air filter is green? I don't think so. First off, it manipulates the air. Air? That's blue. And it's trying to prevent the natural build-up of dust. It's stopping the natural way. That's not green. I believe the air filter is half blue/half white. The white part is because it's keeping the room orderly.

You all laugh, but I will.
