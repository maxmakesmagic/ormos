Three blistering matches make up our second set of audio feature matches. On 10 points, World Champion Antti Malin of Finland goes up against Jan Ruess, the German runner-up from Pro Tour-Hollywood. On 13 points, the undefeated Japanese duo of Shouta Yasooka and Yuuya Watanabe–the former the 2006 Player of the Year and the latter aspiring to the 2009 crown–go toe to toe in a match that featured one of the more astonishing five-mana spells seen in recent times. And finally, in the pinnacle matchup, Hall of Famer Ben Rubin puts his 100% record on the line against the fastest man in **Magic**, Paulo Vitor Damo Da Rosa of Brazil. Breathless, breathtaking, catch-your-breath **Magic**, this is as it happens top of the range fare. Ears into overdrive!
