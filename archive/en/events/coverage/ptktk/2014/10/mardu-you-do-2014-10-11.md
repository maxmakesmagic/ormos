Mardu is my kind of clan. Singing (bellowing), dancing (doing the Ankle-Shank), and feasting on roasted meats (likely the charred remains of a neighboring tribe)—these guys know how to throw a party. A raiding party.



 Mardu is usually the clan of all-out aggression, and their stand-out cards reflect that. You can overwhelm with tokens in Limited with cards like [Ponyback Brigade](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ponyback+Brigade), [Hordeling Outburst](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hordeling+Outburst), and [Mardu Ascendancy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mardu+Ascendancy)—all waiting to hear the [Trumpet Blast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Trumpet+Blast), or feel the [Rush of Battle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rush+of+Battle) to attack for 1,000,000 damage. And in Constructed, though it's the big control versions that are doing the best right now, the [Butcher of the Horde](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Butcher+of+the+Horde) is right at home at the top of an aggressive curve, the middle of a midrange curve, and the party-starter in a control deck. These guys are all about changing the board state as largely as possible.




 In Limited, Mardu plays spoiler to every greedy drafter at the table. There has been talk about the five-color, infinite-morph, [Trail of Mystery](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Trail+of+Mystery) draft deck. For them, Mardu is the nightmare match-up. Decks with lots of enter-the-battlefield-tapped lands need time to set up. And Mardu has no interest in such things. Though Ari Lax did eventually defeat (11) Yuuya Watanabe's Mardu deck during the last draft pod, he had said that he wished to have lost his previous round just so he wouldn't have to face a deck with multiple [Arrow Storm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arrow+Storm)s, three Ponyback Riders, and two [Threaten](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Threaten) effects ([Act of Treason](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Act+of+Treason) and [Jeering Instigator](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jeering+Instigator)).




 Mardu is also the only clan that wants to play [Valley Dasher](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Valley+Dasher). And often, it actively wants it. Though the card is a bit divisive in the community, both Christian Calcano and Miguel Gatica are members of the elite "Five-Dasher" Club. [Valley Dasher](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Valley+Dasher)s start pressuring the second turn, and when your opponent opens slowly with a morph, you just play a second one and attack with both 2/2s. They lose the morph and take two more damage. And really, what do you care? You were just going to attack again and cast [Timely Hordemate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Timely+Hordemate) next turn anyway.





*Christian Calcano is a proud supporter of the elite Five Dasher Club.*
