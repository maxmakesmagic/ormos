"This would have been a monster Grand Prix back in the day." Ben Friedman said to his opponent, Jadine Klomparens. While 1,235 players certainly wasn't tiny by any stretch, compared to the blockbuster events that have taken off across the world it felt atypical to be as cozy as it was.


Both were also part of the rising crew of newcomers, finding success at Premier-level play in recent events. For Friendman, he's chained several Pro Tour qualifications from successes at said Pro Tours as well as at Grand Prix. His first Grand Prix Top 8 was at Orlando in 2012, and Friedman flirted with success along the circuit ever since with his most recent Top 8 appearance at the massive Modern melee of Grand Prix Richmand earlier this year. Gregarious and sometimes flamboyant, with cowboy hats and cutoff shirts among his wide range of attire, Friedman was rarely without a smile on his face.


Conversely, Klomparens was a quiet contender. She had her breakout performance as the finalist of Grand Prix Chicago earlier this year, after missing two back-to-back win-and-in rounds at Grand Prix Cincinatti the weekend prior. Finding her way to the top tables ever since, Klomparens was well on her way to far more success down the road.





*Jadine Klomparens liked her deck, and was one the hunt for another qualification to the Pro Tour.*
