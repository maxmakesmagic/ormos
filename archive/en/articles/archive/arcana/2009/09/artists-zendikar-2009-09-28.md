Today, we hand over Arcana to **Magic** art director Jeremy Jarvis. Take it away, JJ!

It's fairly well known that I vary the group of illustrators working on a new setting from the last to help visually set the tone for the new plane. Here are some names new to **Magic** with *Zendikar* to keep an eye out for:

**Adi Granov**: Two words. *Iron. Man.* I actually contacted Adi in hopes that he would paint a [webcomic](/en/node/638086) for us. He couldn't, but he was game to paint cards.

**Goran Josic**: A video game guru.

**Igor Kieryluk**: Igor is a fun story .... He posted four of his new paintings in our **Magic** Art and Artists forum, and they were really good! I offered to buy three of them as "slush" (art that we will find a home for as soon as we can) and then continued to commission him as a **Magic** artist!

**James Paick**: Another video game guru. You've seen some of James's work by now in *Planechase*, but *Zendikar* was still his first (*Planechase* simply had an earlier release date).

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/arcana/286_paick.jpg)*[Carnage Altar](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Carnage+Altar) by James Paick*
  
  
**Jason Felix**: Jason and I have known each other from conventions for a while now. He was a great choice for helping us concept *Zendikar* ... as well as some ... other ... upcoming ... things .... and has contributed greatly to the setting!

**Jung Park**: Video game guru.

**Kekai Kotaki**: Another super-talented artist from digital gaming.

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/arcana/286_kotaki.jpg)*[Shepherd of the Lost](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shepherd+of+the+Lost) by Kekai Kotaki*
  
  
**Kieran Yanner**: I stole Kieran from **D&D** :)

No, but seriously, it was keeping up with the work he was doing for **Dungeons & Dragons** that caught my eye.

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/arcana/286_yanner.jpg)*[Valakut, the Molten Pinnacle](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Valakut%2C+the+Molten+Pinnacle) by Kieran Yanner*
  
  
**Mike Bierek**: Okay, I'm fudging again, Mike has cards in M10, but he's new enough. I met Mike at Massive Blacks workshop here in Seattle. I offered him cards on the spot.

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/arcana/286_bierek.jpg)*[Quest for Ancient Secrets](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Quest+for+Ancient+Secrets) by Mike Bierek*
  
  
**Nic Klein**: Nic's first card was actually [The Rack](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=The+Rack) in [**Duels of the Planeswalkers**](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=Magic/Digital/DuelsOfThePlaneswalkers.aspx) for Xbox. *Zendikar* will feature his first cards in physical print.

**Ryan Pancoast**: Ryan submitted samples through our open-submission email address, mostly Western imagery if I remember correctly. The talent under the subject matter was clear, and he's been a **Magic** artist since M10.

**Scott Chou and Austin Hsu**: James Zhang, who's name you make recognize from D&D products, introduced me to these guys. Austin actually started in M10, and Scott painted the incredible [Demonic Tutor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Demonic+Tutor) featuring Liliana and Kothophed that printed in *Duel Decks: Divine vs. Demonic.*

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/arcana/286_chou.jpg)*[Marsh Casualties](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Marsh+Casualties) by Scott Chou*
  
  
![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/arcana/286_hsu.jpg)*[Baloth Cage Trap](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Baloth+Cage+Trap) by Austin Hsu*
  
  
**Veronique Meignaud**: I started to communicate with Veronique more than a year ago. I saw samples somehow; I think someone referred her my way.

Her first card was actually the *Divine vs. Demonic* Thrull token, which is awesome. *Zendikar* is a new level of exposure for her, with her cycle of extended-art basic lands.

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/arcana/286_meignaud.jpg)*Zendikar [Plains](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plains) by Veronique Meignaud*
  
  
**Vincent Proce**: Yet another artist/art director from video games. Vince was part of our in-house concept push for *Zendikar* and continued to paint cards for us, among them his striking cycle of extended-art basic lands.

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/arcana/286_proce.jpg)*Zendikar [Island](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island) by Vincent Proce*
  
  
Look for these names in *Worldwake* and beyond:   
 Johann Bodin   
 Tomasz Jedruszek   
 Svetlin Velinov   
 Erica Yang

So long story short, your trusty **Magic** senior art director and illustrator of ill repute is always keeping his eye open for new talent. For that matter, so is Jon Schindehette (he's kinda Bizzaro-JJ for **D&D**). Everywhere from artdrop to conventions to our own forums, if you've got the chops, we'll find a project.

Have what it takes? Send a few small jpegs or a web link to your site to: artdrop@wizards.com

See you there,   
 JJ
