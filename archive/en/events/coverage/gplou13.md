Grand Prix Louisville 2013
--------------------------


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/gplou13/Trophy%20%28450x640%29.jpg)Congratulations to Brian Braun-Duin, Grand Prix Louisville champion! Set on disrupting everyone he came across, Braun-Duin's devotion to a darker cause was rewarded with a shiny new trophy after a tense, three-game final match against Jon Stern's Gruul Monsters. [Erebos, God of the Dead](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Erebos%2C+God+of+the+Dead) , was well represented in the Top 8, with Braun-Duin's teammates Todd Anderson and Brad Nelson also making it through to the elimination rounds with Monoblack Devotion, ushering in the era of *Theros*'s newest favored deity.


One of the biggest cards to aid Braun-Duin on his path to the title was [Pack Rat](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pack+Rat) . Renowned for its power in *Return to Ravnica* Limited, Braun-Duin showed that [Pack Rat](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pack+Rat) is still a thing using it to overrun opponents in both the quarterfinals and finals. [Underworld Connections](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Underworld+Connections) provided the engine behind the deck, allowing Braun-Duin to maintain a constant stream of cards to feed his ever-growing army of Rats.


Standard isn't just about worshiping Gods and controlling opponents. Jon Stern's off-the-radar Gruul Beats deck brought powerful creatures and planeswalkers to battle, and he profited through to the finals. Both [Polukranos, World Eater](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Polukranos%2C+World+Eater) and Xenagos, The Reveler also appeared in the more popular Colossal Gruul deck, but Stern's version of Gruul eschewed devotion and [Nykthos, Shrine to Nyx](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nykthos%2C+Shrine+to+Nyx) for a more direct attack path. By including [Mistcutter Hydra](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mistcutter+Hydra) and [Stormbreath Dragon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stormbreath+Dragon) , Stern consistently cut through all of the more popular decks.


With the results of Pro Tour *Theros* played out here at Grand Prix Louisville, Standard is anything but settled. With time until Grand Prix Santiago its up to the players to decide where the format goes next.
