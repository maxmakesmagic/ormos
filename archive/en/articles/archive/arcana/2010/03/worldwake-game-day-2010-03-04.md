W*orldwake* Game Day is this Saturday!

That, of course, raises some questions. Like "What's *Worldwake* Game Day?" and "What's Saturday?" We're going to tackle the first one. If you're in doubt about the meaning of "Saturday," consult your local calendar.

*Worldwake* Game Day is a Standard Constructed tournament at a store near you. And it's also a worldwide **Magic** experience! Your first step is to find a Game Day near you, which you can do via the handy widget to the right. Your next step is to show up, play, and receive this (while supples last):

Then, the most important step: play and have fun! If you reach the Top 8, you'll get this:

Two [Kalastria Highborn](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kalastria+Highborn)s will also be awarded as door prizes at each location.

Finally, if you win, you'll receive the coveted title of ***Worldwake* Champion** and receive a handsome winners certificate, suitable for framing.
