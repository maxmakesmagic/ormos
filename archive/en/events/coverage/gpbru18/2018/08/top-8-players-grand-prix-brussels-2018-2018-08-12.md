[Goblin Chainwhirler](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Chainwhirler) because it's good in the mirror match; [Rekindling Phoenix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rekindling+Phoenix) because it's good against Grixis and in the mirror.

[Glorybringer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glorybringer) helped in every match I played, except for Turbo Fog.

[Teferi, Hero of Dominaria](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Teferi%2C+Hero+of+Dominaria). Pretty solid *Magic* card.

[Chromium, the Mutable](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chromium%2C+the+Mutable). It's an Esper Dragon, what more do you want. (I actually never boarded it in.) Thanks to Oliver Tiu and to my partner in crime Sascha Schwarz for helping tune the deck.

**What was the best card in your main deck, and why?**


[Nexus of Fate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nexus+of+Fate)! What else?


**What was the best card out of your sideboard, and why?**


[Negate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Negate)! Because it's the best answer to the vast majority of sideboard cards!

Esper. Deck looked great but needed some improvements to be able to beat Fog.


**What was the best card in your main deck, and why?**


[Teferi, Hero of Dominaria](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Teferi%2C+Hero+of+Dominaria). Should be banned.

**What was the best card in your main deck, and why?**


[Rekindling Phoenix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rekindling+Phoenix) won most of my games when I cast it. This card is insane.


**What was the best card out of your sideboard, and why?**


The fourth Phoenix. If it is good preboard why not have one extra in the side?

**Name:** Alexander Gordon-Brown


**Age:** 27


**Occupation:** Stay-at-home dad, former trader


**Hometown:** London, United Kingdom


**Previous *Magic* accomplishments:**


PPTQ win in Standard in May, PPTQ win in Modern in July, 5-3 at GP Birmingham 2018. This is my second GP ever.


**What deck did you play this weekend, and why did you choose it?**


Sultai Midrange—I like the red matchup a lot, and I expected a ton of it. In the tournament so far, I played against R/x eleven times. Also, [The Scarab God](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=The+Scarab+God) is a busted card, which I will be sad to see go.


**What was the best card in your main deck, and why?**


[The Scarab God](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=The+Scarab+God), by far. Best turn four play, best turn five play, best play on an empty board. The card really does do it all.


**What was the best card out of your sideboard, and why?**


[Wildgrowth Walker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wildgrowth+Walker). Gives you a much needed plan B against the red decks, and allows you to gain life via Scarab God to avoid sudden [Glorybringer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glorybringer) death.
