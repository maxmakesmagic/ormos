Due to the high number of attendees anticipated at this weekend's event and in order to ensure a quality experience for all players, on-site registration for [Grand Prix Las Vegas](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/TCG/Events.aspx?x=mtg/event/grandprix/lasvegas13) will close on Friday night at 8 p.m. **There will be no registration for Grand Prix Las Vegas on the morning of Saturday, June 22, as previously announced.**


 Online preregistration for Grand Prix Las Vegas will remain open until 9 p.m. PT on Thursday, June 20, at the [Cascade Games website](http://www.cascadegames.com/events/933). Players are highly encouraged to take advantage of online preregistration.
