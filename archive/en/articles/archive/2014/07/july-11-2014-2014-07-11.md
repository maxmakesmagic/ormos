While the Grand Prix schedule takes a break until July 26-27, the Pro Tour *Khans of Tarkir* Qualifier season is in full swing. Every week, players bring their best Modern decks and put their skills to the test in an effort to earn the coveted invitation—as well as airfare—to Pro Tour *Khans of Tarkir*, taking place October 10-12 in Honolulu, Hawaii.


Modern is a wide-open field featuring a large spread of decks across all five colors. You can take a look at what Pro Tour Qualifier competitors have been playing in their Top 8 decklists below. If you want to compete on the Pro Tour stage yourself, then get your Modern deck ready and find a [Pro Tour Qualifier](http://magic.wizards.com/en/protour/qualifierlist ) near you.


And if you want even more decklists to look at across multiple formats, you can always take a look at what's been winning this week's *Magic Online* Daily Events and Premiere Events.
