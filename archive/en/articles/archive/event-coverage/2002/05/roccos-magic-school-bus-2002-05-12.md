One of them suggested a charter coach bus, but that looked to be too expensive. Eventually, Christopher Rocco, one of the store's regulars, came to the rescue.

Rocco, a bus driver by trade, suggested that they just take one of his school buses to the event. He'd get a discount on renting it, and it would hold everyone, no problem. So 24 gamers piled onto Rocco's Magic School Bus and made the trek from the Twin Cities to here.

There was no real fairy tale ending; of the lot of them, only Rocco himself made Day 2, eventually finishing 56th, out of the money. But the whole gang was having a great time in the side events, the PTQ, and everything else here at the venue.
