### January 19, 2003: Kai Budde wins his sixth Pro Tour


[![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/ptchi03/a642.jpg)](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=sideboard/events/ptchi03)The format for [2003 Pro Tour–Chicago](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=sideboard/events/ptchi03) was *Onslaught* Rochester draft, and the Top 8 was stacked. Kai had to personally defeat William Jensen, Jon Finkel and Nicolai Herzog for the win, while standouts Eugene Harvey and Bram Snepvangers were taken care of on the other side of the bracket.


Going in to the event, Kai felt that *Onslaught* Rochester was too random, saying "If you are at a table with 7 other competent players, it just comes down to choosing of colors and then distributing the cards. Nobody hate-drafts until they have enough cards for their own deck, and that's it." The talent at the top of the Pro Tour suggested otherwise!
