The November 10, 2017 Update
============================

The Daily *Magic* Update is a roundup of everything *Magic* you should know on November 10, 2017. Today's Update is brought to you by pieces of a puzzle.


What to Watch This Weekend
==========================


1. [Grand Prix Warsaw](https://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/gpwar17) and [Grand Prix Atlanta](https://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/gpatl17) | [twitch.tv/magic](https://go.twitch.tv/magic) | Warsaw coverage begins at 9 a.m. local time (CET), 12 a.m. PT/3 a.m. ET/7 a.m. UTC. Coverage of Atlanta will follow immediately after.

Standard gameplay is currently complex, interesting, and coming to your screen for many, many hours this weekend as you get two Grand Prix viewing experiences for the price of one (that is, still free). So don't worry about the weekend—your plans have already been made for you.


Also, Read, Watch, or Listen to These
=====================================


1. [\*2nd\* at Pro Tour *Ixalan*](https://www.massdrop.com/talk/2664/2nd-at-pro-tour-ixalan) | Massdrop | Pascal Maynard

Some Pro Tour competitors get by with only writing one tournament report. Pascal Maynard wrote *two*. This is the more extensive of them, so dive right in to learn more about the most interesting deck that made the Top 8 (with apologies to Jeskai Approach).


1. [Writing for Wizards FAQ](http://www.gatheringmagic.com/anttessitore-11102017-writing-for-wizards-faq/) | Gathering Magic | Ant Tessitore

Tessitore gives you behind-the-scenes look on what it's like to write card names and flavor text for *Magic*. There are a lot more people involved in writing our game than you might realize, so if you've ever wanted to do so, Tessitore's guide is a good way to find our more on how to get started.


1. [Energizing River's Rebuke](http://www.toplevelpodcast.com/rivers-rebuke/) | Top Level Podcast | Mike Flores and Patrick Chapin

If you don't think Chapin and Flores could do an entire podcast about a sideboard card to break a mirror match, well, then you haven't been paying attention.


That said, it's not *entirely* about [River's Rebuke](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=River%27s+Rebuke). Just close. They cover much of the PT Top 8, particularly the energy decks.


1. [Green-Blue Simic Philosophy, Strengths, and Weaknesses: A *Magic: The Gathering* Color Pie Study!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9_bVZk7XnY) | The Mana Source | Wedge

It's like Wedge is using his return to revisit all the greatest hits. Worst cards first, and now, color pie study. See what makes Simic tick like a fish-dog grafted onto a clock.

1. [Burning Questions for *Rivals of Ixalan*](https://www.hipstersofthecoast.com/2017/11/burning-questions-rivals-ixalan/) | Hipsters of the Coast | Beck Holden

Holden raises questions he hopes will be answered in *Rivals of Ixalan*. I think it was a miss not to include "What is Angrath going to bring his children if he finally does escape the plane?"


1. [Drafting *Iconic Masters*: The Best Commons and Uncommons](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yh0hfaZ7Z5E) | Nizzahon Magic

Did you know that *Iconic Masters* comes out *next week*?! It seems like so long ago that it debuted at HASCON, but it's really almost here. Nizzahon goes over what cards you should be drafting if you get a chance to crack some of these beautiful boosters.


<https://www.youtube.com/embed/Yh0hfaZ7Z5E>


1. [The GAM Podcast: Episode 52 – Pro Tour *Ixalan* and Six Undervalued Standard Decks!](http://www.starcitygames.com/article/36156_The-GAM-Podcast-Episode-52-Pro-Tour-Ixalan-And-Six-Undervalued-Standard-Decks.html) | StarCityGames.com | Brian Gottlieb and Gerry Thompson

Six?! That's so many undervalued decks! Also, probably pretty accurate.


What People Are Talking About
=============================

> Oh my gosh, you're right! I just checked with [@blakepr](https://twitter.com/blakepr?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) and he told me that I'm allowed to share half of my preview card prior to preview day. [pic.twitter.com/xMkkHcQGLc](https://t.co/xMkkHcQGLc)

There are content creators fervently working on *Unstable* previews right this very minute. April King has a preview. They start Monday and run till the full set is revealed on Nov. 22. But keep an eye on social media this weekend (maybe even today . . . ) for the first hints of what's to come.


Deck of the Day
===============


1. [Standard Temur Tyrant](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/mtgo-standings/competitive-standard-constructed-league-2017-11-09)

At first glance, this looks like any other Temur Energy deck. Yawn, right? We've been there before, bought a hat, and own the soundtrack. But then you look closer. [Carnage Tyrant](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Carnage+Tyrant)? Well, all right, that's a powerful card. Seems fine. And then—[Onward // Victory](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Onward+%2F%2F+Victory)? What in the who now?


Those two cards together pretty much instantly kill anyone, even through blockers. [Carnage Tyrant](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Carnage+Tyrant)'s hexproof means it's difficult to disrupt, and the energy color fixing package means the Victory half is quite splashable. The result is that, at some point, you might be facing a 14/6 hexproof, trampling, double-striking Dinosaur coming your way for 28 points of damage.
