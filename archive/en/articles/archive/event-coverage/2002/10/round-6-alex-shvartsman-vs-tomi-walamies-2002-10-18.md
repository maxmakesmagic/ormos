The familiar face behind Sideboard Online's Week in Review, Alex Shvartsman has cruised through the Invitation thusfar, remaining undefeated. He's certainly doing YMG's red & black prouder than Dave Humpherys, who tanked to 2-3. His opponent is Punisher's Tomi "Jelly" Walamies, who is mired at 3-2. Shvartsman is playing his blue-green deck from Worlds, since it served him a 5-1 finish. Walamies is with a strange new green-black control deck.


Shvartsman's start of Rootwalla, [Wild Mongrel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Mongrel) was stunted by [Smother](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Smother), delaying his [Arrogant Wurm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arrogant+Wurm) a turn while he set up with [Aquamoeba](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aquamoeba). Walamies readied a [Pernicious Deed](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pernicious+Deed). He ate a bunch of pain to make sure he'd kill the Wurm as well. With his board reset, Shvartsman bounced back with [Basking Rootwalla](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Basking+Rootwalla), sitting on [Counterspell](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterspell) and [Circular Logic](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Circular+Logic). Walamies meanwhile drew every land in his deck, and eventually succumbed when Shvartsman hard-cast a [Roar of the Wurm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Roar+of+the+Wurm).


Shvartsman 1 - Walamies 0

*(click to open full-size in a new window)*Walamies was all over Shvarstman in the second game. [Mesmeric Fiend](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mesmeric+Fiend) stole [Counterspell](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterspell) while [Phantom Centaur](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phantom+Centaur) made with the clubbing. Shvartsman had a pair of [Wild Mongrel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Mongrel)s, but [Naturalize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Naturalize) and a hand of land was not much good against another Fiend and a Butcher.


The state of the game became abundantly clear when Walamies was ready to [Smother](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Smother) Shvartsman's Roar token, only to topdeck the superior [Slay](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Slay).


Shvartsman 1 - Walamies 1


Despite a Walmies mulligan in the deciding game, he was soon in the driver's seat. Shvartsman had Careful Studied a [Wonder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wonder) into his yard and a Logic into his hand, but the rest of it was all land. Walamies had [Mesmeric Fiend](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mesmeric+Fiend) to make it downright embarassing.

*(click to open full-size in a new window)*When he did draw a [Basking Rootwalla](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Basking+Rootwalla) to beat down, Walamies was already working his [Phyrexian Arena](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phyrexian+Arena). He made a [Phantom Centaur](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phantom+Centaur), ready to race. Shvartsman truped with [Wild Mongrel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Mongrel) and a counter for the second Centaur. Walamies set him back with [Pernicious Deed](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pernicious+Deed).


At eight life to Shvartsman's six he bashed with the Centaur. Shvartsman fell to one. Then he Wished up [Faceless Butcher](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Faceless+Butcher) and Echoesed Shvartsman. He stopped the lethal attack by Lootering out [Arrogant Wurm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arrogant+Wurm) in response to a Deed clearing the way. It didn't matter. He was playing with half a deck, and a turn later it was over.


**Final Result:** Tomi Walamies defeats Alex Shvartsman 2-1
