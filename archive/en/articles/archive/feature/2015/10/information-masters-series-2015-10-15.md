The Masters Series is a program designed to highlight the best Magic players in the world and bring them together in a single tournament with a large cash prize. The total prize for each Masters Series event is $150,000. ESPN plans to televise the finals from each Masters tournament.


The first Masters Series tournament will be held in conjunction with Pro Tour New York (September 28 - October 1, 2000). The format for this Masters tournament will be Extended Constructed.


Thirty of the thirty-two invitees are listed at the bottom of this announcement. The final two invitees will be determined through a single-elimination Extended-format **Gateway Tournament**, which will start at 9 am on Thursday, September 28, 2000.


The Gateway Tournament is open to any players with six or more Pro Points in the New York Pro Standings. To see if you are eligible to compete, please check the [Pro Tour New York '99/'00 Pro Standings](http://archive.wizards.com/sideboard/article.asp?x=protour/PTNY2000_standings.asp).


The format for the Gateway tournament is Extended Constructed. There is no admission fee. The final two players remaining in the Gateway tournament will be invited to play in the Masters tournament, which begins later that day. There are no prizes for the Gateway tournament except for the two invitations to the Masters Series.


The Gateway Tournament and the first two rounds of the Masters Series will be held at Neutral Ground New York on Thursday, September 28th.
