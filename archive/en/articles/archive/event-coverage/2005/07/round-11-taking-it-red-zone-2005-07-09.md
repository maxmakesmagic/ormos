Geoffrey Siron has burst onto the scene recently with a Top 8 at Pro Tour-Columbus and an appearance in the team finals at the World Championships as a member of the Belgian National Team. He's currently 9-1 and would be on top of the standings if it weren't for the undefeated status of his opponent, Arnost Zidek. Zidek is a relative newcomer who put in a lot of preparation for this event on **Magic Online**. Before the match, his wife leaned over from the railing and gave him a kiss for good luck.


There was some discussion of her coming down into the feature match area, which prompted the following conversation:


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/ptlon05/fm11_zidek.jpg)*Zidek started Pro Tour-London 10-0.*
"Is she your friend?"


"She's my wife."


"Does she play?"


"No. Actually she takes photos for a Czech **Magic** site."


"Does she know cards?"


"Noâ€¦do you have a problem with her watching?"


"No, it's okay. No problem."


In the end she decided to stay in the stands and cheer from there anyway.


After a couple more words and a mulligan from Siron, they started the match.


### Game 1


So, I'm going to be trying a little experiment here. We're going to be watching this match from the perspective of the red zone. I have no idea if it'll be interesting or not, but I figure it's worth a try.


Rows in blue are attacks from Zidek and white rows are attacks from Siron.




|  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Attacks** | **Blocks** | **Result** | **SL** | **ZL** |
| Shapestealer | None | Siron takes the one. | 19 | 20 |
| [Secretkeeper](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Secretkeeper), [Waxmane Baku](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Waxmane+Baku), and Shapestealer | None | With his [Gnarled Mass](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gnarled+Mass) tapped by the Waxmane, Siron takes five and falls to 14. | 14 | 20 |
| [Moonwing Moth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Moonwing+Moth) | None | Siron takes two in the air. | 12 | 20 |
| [Moonwing Moth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Moonwing+Moth) | None | Siron takes another two. | 10 | 20 |
| [Moonwing Moth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Moonwing+Moth) | None | And another two. | 8 | 20 |
| [Gnarled Mass](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gnarled+Mass) and [Feral Deceiver](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Feral+Deceiver) | [River Kaijin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=River+Kaijin) on [Gnarled Mass](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gnarled+Mass) | [Unchecked Growth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Unchecked+Growth) takes down the Kaijin and deals six to Zidek. | 8 | 14 |
| [Moonwing Moth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Moonwing+Moth) | None | Yet another two in the air. | 6 | 14 |
| [Feral Deceiver](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Feral+Deceiver), [Nezumi Ronin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nezumi+Ronin) and [Gnarled Mass](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gnarled+Mass) | [Secretkeeper](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Secretkeeper) on [Nezumi Ronin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nezumi+Ronin) | Siron concedes the game at the conclusion of the attack, as he's facing a lethal counterattack. | 0 | 8 |

The missing details are a [Honden of Night's Reach](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Honden+of+Night%27s+Reach) that emptied Zidek's hand early and kept it that way throughout the game, effectively nullifying the [Secretkeeper](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Secretkeeper). That is, until Zidek topdecked and played a Moonbow illusionist, which forced Siron to make the final alpha strike. He seemed frustrated with Zidek's choice of blocks, asking, "Why would you block like this?"


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/ptlon05/fm11_siron.jpg)*Siron was in a hole after Game 1.*
Zidek paused and shrugged, "Because I win this way." After the attack he was left with [Waxmane Baku](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Waxmane+Baku), [Moonwing Moth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Moonwing+Moth), and [Moonbow Illusionist](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Moonbow+Illusionist), which was enough to kill Siron, but only if he didn't have any blockers in his hand.


Pointing at [Secretkeeper](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Secretkeeper), Siron responded, "You could win with that guy."


"Could I?"


"You can pick up lands. It'd be a 4/4 flying."

| **Attacks** | **Blocks** | **Result** | **SL** | **ZL** |
| [Kagemaro, First to Suffer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kagemaro%2C+First+to+Suffer) | None | Zidek takes five from the unblocked Maro. | 20 | 15 |
| [Secretkeeper](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Secretkeeper) | None | [Secretkeeper](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Secretkeeper) through the air. | 16 | 15 |
| [Kagemaro, First to Suffer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kagemaro%2C+First+to+Suffer) | None | Zidek takes another five. | 16 | 10 |
| [Secretkeeper](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Secretkeeper) | [Gibbering Kami](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gibbering+Kami) and [Venerable Kumo](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Venerable+Kumo) double block | Zidek looks surprised and shakes his head. [Secretkeeper](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Secretkeeper) and the Kumo trade. | 16 | 10 |
| [Island](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island) | [Gibbering Kami](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gibbering+Kami) | A Genju gives Zidek another flier. The creatures trade. | 16 | 10 |
| [Kagemaro, First to Suffer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kagemaro%2C+First+to+Suffer) | [River Kaijin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=River+Kaijin) | [River Kaijin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=River+Kaijin) chump blocks. | 16 | 10 |
| [Island](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island) and [Waxmane Baku](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Waxmane+Baku) | [Traproot Kami](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Traproot+Kami) blocks [Island](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island) | [Ninja of the Deep Hours](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ninja+of+the+Deep+Hours) sneaks in for Waxmane. Zidek draws. | 14 | 10 |
| [Kagemaro, First to Suffer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kagemaro%2C+First+to+Suffer) | None | Kagemaro hits for another five. | 14 | 5 |
| [Island](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island), [Waxmane Baku](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Waxmane+Baku), and [Ninja of the Deep Hours](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ninja+of+the+Deep+Hours) | None | Siron activates Kagemaro to clear the board. | 14 | 5 |
|  |  | Zidek concedes. | 14 | 0 |

Zidek may still have been rattled from the end of last game, because he made a couple of mistakes this game. He forgot a counter on his [Waxmane Baku](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Waxmane+Baku) early, and then later neglected to use a counter before returning it to his hand for the Ninjutsu of [Ninja of the Deep Hours](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ninja+of+the+Deep+Hours). He could have forced through an extra three damage, although I doubt it would have ended up mattering. Kagemaro plus [Death Denied](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Death+Denied) gave Siron far more card advantage than he could handle. He conceded shortly thereafter.

| [Nezumi Cutthroat](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nezumi+Cutthroat) | None | Two more to Zidek. | 12 | 12 |
| [Forked-Branch Garami](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forked-Branch+Garami) | None | Garami gets through for four. | 12 | 8 |
| [Waxmane Baku](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Waxmane+Baku) and [Kitsune Blademaster](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kitsune+Blademaster) | None | Four damage on the counterattack. | 8 | 8 |
| [Forked-Branch Garami](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forked-Branch+Garami) | None | Siron activated Kagemaro before attacking and cleared the board of all but a 2/2 Garami. | 8 | 6 |
| [Forked-Branch Garami](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forked-Branch+Garami) and [Gnarled Mass](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gnarled+Mass) | [Shinen of Stars' Light](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shinen+of+Stars%27+Light) blocks the Garami | The Shinen chump blocks to keep Zidek alive. | 8 | 3 |

Zidek had a turn-two [Eye of Nowhere](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eye+of+Nowhere) on Siron's land, but Siron threatened to come back with a turn-three [Kiku, Night's Flower](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kiku%2C+Night%27s+Flower). When he also had Kagemaro, it went downhill quickly for the Czech player, although he managed to make it close. The final nail in the coffin was a [Death Denied](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Death+Denied), recovering both Kagemaro and Kiku from Siron's graveyard. The second Kagemaro activation cleared the board again and Zidek couldn't stop the large green men that Siron had waiting in the wings.


**Final Score**  

Geoffrey Siron 2, Arnost Zidek 1
