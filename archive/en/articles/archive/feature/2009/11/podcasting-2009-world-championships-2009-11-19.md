* [**Worlds Recap and Highlights**](http://webcast2.wizards.com/podcasts/09worlds/worlds09_highlights.mp3) (13.0 MB)
Rich Hagon walks you through all four days of Worlds, recapping the daily angles as well as the big-picture storylines such as the Player of the Year and Rookie of the Year races. 


* [**Saturday, 7:05 p.m: Penultimate**](http://webcast2.wizards.com/podcasts/09worlds/worlds09_6.mp3) (16.2 MB)
Round 17 arrives with three matches in the feature arena, and all three winners will believe that Top 8 is theirs for the taking. After a difficult season, Manuel Bucher is back with a vengeance, and takes on Italian hope Patrizio Golia. Also from Italy, William Cavaglieri goes into battle against the highest-placed Brazilian here, Rafael Coqueiro. No doubt where the marquee matchup is though, and that's the amazing battle between Marijn Lybaert of Belgium and Tomoharu Saito of Japan. At 37 points, the winner here will feel they've done enough for sure. Join us for some great **Magic**  as we close in on the final day of the 2009 season. 


* [**Saturday, 12:15 p.m: I Love This Game**](http://webcast2.wizards.com/podcasts/09worlds/worlds09_5.mp3) (14.6 MB)
And, judging by the record-breaking numbers of you that are flocking to join us, you do too. I'd like to congratulate you on your fine decision this Saturday morning (or whenever you're reading this) for selecting an absolute killer hour of **Magic**. Who leads Player of the Year? Yuuya Watanabe. Who does he play for? Japan. Who's trying to catch him? Paulo Vitor Damo da Rosa. Who does he play for? Brazil. Using your skill and judgment, guess which National Team match you'll be listening to when you click on our lovely media player. Yes, Costa Rica versus Denmark. Kidding. 


* [**Friday, 5:37 p.m: 0.61111111111**](http://webcast2.wizards.com/podcasts/09worlds/worlds09_4.mp3)  (12.5 MB)
By the end of this show, 11 of the 18 rounds of Worlds 2009 will be done, and we'll be just that little bit closer to knowing which talented individuals and teams will be joining us for a fourth day of gaming heaven on Championship Sunday. Tomaharu Saitou of Japan will have high hopes of being among that number, and we follow him in feature match action against South African standout Seraj Haroun. Joining them are Terry Soh of Malaysia, Sebastian Thaler of Germany, and home teamers Patrizio Golia and Gennaro Mango. Want the other 38.89999999999 percent? You know where to come. 


* [**Friday, 1:45 p.m: Unlimited Fun-Limited**](http://webcast2.wizards.com/podcasts/09worlds/worlds09_3.mp3)  (18.9 MB)
One amazing format departs the scene, at least until Sunday, and another takes its place. Day Two of Worlds showcases the speed and reflexes of *Zendikar*  draft, and we opened with a tremendous first table. We interview a stack of players about their day one, take you inside the draft as they build for their opening matches, and then head for the feature match area, where a hugely significant Round 8 encounter between David Reitbauer of Austria and Tomaharu Saito of Japan highlights our trio of warp-speed matchups. 


* [**Thursday, 7:27 p.m: No I in Team**](http://webcast2.wizards.com/podcasts/09worlds/worlds09_2.mp3) (12.3 MB)
I get to travel the world and watch the best players in action round after round. Want to know my favorite hour of the **Magic**  year? Well, you can listen to it as it happens, because round one of the team competition is upon us. After six hard-fought rounds of Standard **Magic**, there's a party atmosphere as the national teams assemble to take on their three opponents across Standard, Extended, and Legacy. Yes, it's 'Stax' of fun, as Canada takes on Germany, both placed handily as Day One heads for a great conclusion. 


* [**Thursday, 2:11 p.m: Three out of Three**](http://webcast2.wizards.com/podcasts/09worlds/worlds09_1.mp3) (13.7 MB)
Whoever first coined the expression "it's a marathon not a sprint" has a point, and they certainly have a point when it comes to Worlds. Eighteen rounds is even longer than a regular Pro Tour, and so even a 0-2 start is no disaster. That's just as well for Tsuyoshi Ikeda, who faced Italian champion Luca Ravigli on that score here in Round Three. Slightly better off were Naoki Umesaki of Japan and Gabriel Nassif of France, while Matej Zatlkaj would take his 2-0 start into battle against the ultimate Pro, Mr. Kai Budde. All three feature matches are right here, including a truly memorable conclusion.
