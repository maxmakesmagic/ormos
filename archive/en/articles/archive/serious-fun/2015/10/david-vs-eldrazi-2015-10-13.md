David vs. Eldrazi

 Bruce's games invariably involve several friends, crazy plays, and many laughs. Bruce believes that if anyone at your table isn't having fun, then you are doing it wrong. 





Zendikari vs. Eldrazi inspires images of David and Goliath battles. The overmatched player. The underdog. The million-to-one shot. The 1980 US Olympic hockey team. The Zendikari are fighting a nigh-unbeatable foe. The Eldrazi are world-eaters who are practically unstoppable.


These battles make for great stories. They show us that the little guy can win. They encourage us to fight against the odds, because the result is not predetermined. We want to see someone fight hard enough to overcome the odds and win. The favored side is always cast as the bully, or a juggernaut, or some sort of unstoppable evil. That triumph is satisfying. When George McFly finds his courage and punches Biff Tannen, you just want to pump your fist.


The reason these stories are inspirational, however, is because they almost never happen. Roger Federer doesn't lose to the No.100-ranked player in the world. The underdog is the underdog because they have already lost so often. The million-to-one shot by definition misses 999,999 times. An unstoppable evil is rarely stopped.


We see this around the kitchen table as well. The better player, with a better deck, wins more often than they lose. *Magic* has a certain amount of luck, so even the best player with the best deck still loses, but there are many groups where the best player wins most of the time. When Rudy wins, it feels like a David vs. Goliath moment, just because the odds of it happening are so slim.


Groups with widely diverse levels of talent and experience tend to have a tough time of it. We all understand you can't win every time, but everyone wants to win some time. Even the most casual player wants to win every once in a while. Most of my friends who find themselves on a longer losing streak have "that deck." It tends to be a deck that is a little overpowered, but improves their chances of winning the game. I tend to choose a deck at random from the decks I have available for each game. When I find myself on an extended losing streak, I tend to stop and look for my decks that have given me the most success, or at least will be plenty of fun to play and keep me in the game.

Suffice it to say that everybody wants to win at least some of the time.


I want to look at these imbalances and offer up suggestions to these groups. There is no need to for them to suffer the despair that can come with a lopsided Zendikari vs. Eldrazi balance.


The Powerhouse
==============


These are the groups where one player is the dominant force. I've written several articles involving threat analysis, but for groups with a Powerhouse player, threat analysis is reduced to "Is [Powerhouse Player] playing this game?" The situation on the playing field is irrelevant, since the Powerhouse seems to always find a way. Powerhouse players tend to have played for a long time and built up a formidable collection of cards. They only run the best cards in their decks, and also tend to be the most experienced players in their groups.


Games involving the Powerhouse tend to devolve into everyone against the Powerhouse, or the Powerhouse will win. It takes the might of the rest of the group to take down the Powerhouse, and most groups tend to learn this fairly fast. Some groups have made this their default play style and embrace it. Players tend to see games as "Us against the Powerhouse," so if anyone other than the Powerhouse wins, they treat that as a win for them.


If you find your group is going this way, one option is to embrace it. Run Archenemy-style formats. There are plenty of alternative formats (I'm sure each of you can devise an interesting variant) that involve one player getting an advantage and battling every other player there. This makes for some interesting gameplay, encouraging table talk among the challengers. This style of play also reduces the options for winning into just two: the Powerhouse or everyone else.


Another option is to make the Powerhouse into the Teacher. With a player as skilled as the Powerhouse, the rest of the group would be remiss not to tap into his/her skill. The Teacher should try to relay better gameplay decisions to the players. The Teacher can look at decks and suggest better options from each players' card pool. The point of the Teacher is to bring the other players close enough to the Powerhouse's level, so that not every game has to be everyone against one.


Another option to leveling the disparity is shifting decks. The players each choose a deck, then pass that deck to the left, or across, or whatever method you choose, so the Powerhouse is now using a less powerful deck. Since Renee is still the strongest player, she will continue to carry the target, but with a weaker deck, she may not need constant attention. This will also give every player an opportunity to play with a deck put together by the Powerhouse. Players may not have the card pool to build the deck, but if they see the card interactions and how the deck works, they can apply that to their card pools and build better decks.


![](https://media.wizards.com/2015/images/daily/cardart_DTK_Avatar-of-the-Resolute.jpg)


[Avatar of the Resolute](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Avatar+of+the+Resolute) | Art by [Jeff Simpson](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&artist=+[%22Jeff+Simpson%22])


The Split Personality
=====================


These play groups tend to see their games diverge into two battles: the haves and have-nots. Picture the Powerhouse, but now picture a group where half the players are Powerhouses. The players on the lower end simply get beat again and again. And in this group, they don't even get the occasional win, since the Powerhouse players tend to split the victories. Whether they can convince the less experienced players to work with one of them against the other Powerhouse, or if the Powerhouse players work together to eliminate the weaker players, or if they simply batter each other and the last one standing wipes up the other players as an afterthought, the players on the bottom half of the group just never get a chance.


These groups can find themselves in a lot of trouble, since half the group often doesn't even realize there is a problem. No one player is winning all the games, but the victories still aren't spread at all evenly throughout the group.


The joy for these groups lies in the multitude of options they have to fix things once everyone realizes there is a problem. With so many Teachers, Two-Headed Giant games work well. If the Powerhouses are split up and each work with a newer player, the playing field gets leveled. It also means the new player gets a chance to see the strategies the experienced players are employing. Looking turns ahead and setting up plans that last longer than just until the end of the turn are often things that can easily be improved.


With more experienced players, there are more opportunities to help build better decks and teach better lines of play. This sort of effort evens the playing field and makes for better games.


Another alternative that tends to work well in these groups lies in upping the chaos. Adding more levels of randomness reduces how much skill and better decks affect the outcomes of games. *Planechase* is a well-known variant that adds a level of randomness to games, particularly when you are using the cards in a single, shared library. You can choose to increase the randomness in your group even further by adding more ways to bring random change into your games. There are plenty of players who dislike this in their *Magic* games, so this is not something for everyone, but I personally love to embrace the chaos as often as possible!


The One Who Suffers Alone
=========================


This describes groups who are all relatively on the same level, except one player, who trails behind. I'm not talking about the player who is just having fun playing and really doesn't care about winning. I'm talking about the player who is struggling to catch up with the rest of the players in the group but just can't seem to manage it. Whether they don't have the collection the others do or the time to put into the game, this player struggles to be relevant.


Before going further, if you think this is you, ask yourself if you are just on a prolonged dry spell. I've gone very long stretches without winning and begun to doubt myself. Generally building a few new decks or just rehashing the decks I have, along with refocusing my attention during games, is enough to get a few wins back. You can help your situation all on your own, probably fairly quickly. You are not the ones I'm describing here.


![](https://media.wizards.com/2015/images/daily/cardart_BFZ_Sure-Strike.jpg)


[Sure Strike](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sure+Strike) | Art by [Jakub Kasper](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&artist=+[%22Jakub+Kasper%22])


These are the folks who just aren't sure what they can do to be better. Their decks are interesting, but not particularly good. The games in these groups look like most games you see, with a variety of players winning, except the One. There are times when it looks like the One will win, but someone always manages to steal the victory. Unless you look carefully, these groups appear to be fine, but the One is on the verge of packing up the cards and never coming back.


Helping this player is pretty straightforward: Help them improve their deck building and gameplay. Recommending different cards for decks and showing the One how to play better is the easiest way to improve their enjoyment of the game over the long term. This doesn't provide an instant improvement, but it will lead to slow and steady improvement.


Are you the One in your group? Crowd in over here. I'll meet the rest of you at the end of this paragraph. I want a little one-on-one time here. I want to give you a quick and painless way to get a couple of wins in your games. The benefit that you have right now lies in your weaknesses. No one in your group is threatened by you, so if you make it a little painful to come after you, your friends will leave you alone until the end. While they are leaving you alone, amass as many cards in hand as possible. You especially want those good cards in your deck that never seem to be there when you need them. This time, I want you to hold those cards in your hand. Feign frustration with each of your draws, or just do nothing. Whatever you have to do to keep your friends thinking you have nothing. When it is just you and one other player left, go after them with guns blazing. Don't give them a chance to get ready or come at you. Claw at them like a caged wild animal. You won't win all the games, and your wins won't be the stuff of legend, but you'll have a few wins and feel good about yourself. In the meantime, glean everything you can from them. You're getting better and better every game.


Zendikari vs. Eldrazi makes for a great *Magic* set, but a lousy description of a play group. It isn't an accident that the best way to improve things in your group is showing the new players how to improve their game. Getting everyone closer in skill level by bringing everyone to the top together will make your games better and better.
