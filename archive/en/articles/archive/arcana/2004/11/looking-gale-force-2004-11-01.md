The art of the *Champions* card [Gale Force](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gale+Force), illustrated by Lars Grant-West, features a rarely-seen perspective: it's a "shot" with the viewer looking *straight up* into the upper canopy and sky above. The creatures in the art are being blown around the sky by the terrific winds generated by the spell.

What other **Magic**  cards can you think of that feature unusual viewer perspectives in their art?
