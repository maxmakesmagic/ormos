**Magic: The Gathering**  is a game of nearly infinite possibilities and card combinations. One of the most exciting parts of the game is when you discover two or more cards that interact in a way that opens up those possibilities. This page lists a few of those card combinations from the most recent sets.


### [Might of Oaks](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Might+of+Oaks) + [Prized Unicorn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Prized+Unicorn)


Any creature that can block an attacking [Prized Unicorn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Prized+Unicorn) must do so. Use [Might of Oaks](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Might+of+Oaks) to give [Prized Unicorn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Prized+Unicorn) +7/+7 for a turn, and it can take out all of your opponent's creatures at once.


### [Goblin Artillery](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Artillery) + [Lifelink](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lifelink)


[Goblin Artillery](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Artillery) deals 2 damage to anyone or anything—as long as you don't mind taking 3 damage yourself. With a [Lifelink](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lifelink) enchanting [Goblin Artillery](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Artillery), however, you'll gain a total of 2 life instead! 




![Howl of the Night Pack](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Howl+of+the+Night+Pack)![Overrun](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Overrun)

### [Howl of the Night Pack](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Howl+of+the+Night+Pack) + [Overrun](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Overrun)


[Overrun](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Overrun) often ends the game by making your creatures bigger and giving them trample, but you need creatures first. [Howl of the Night Pack](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Howl+of+the+Night+Pack) gives you a 2/2 Wolf creature for each [Forest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest) you control, and [Overrun](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Overrun) makes them all 5/5 for the one final swing! 


### [Alluring Siren](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Alluring+Siren) + [Royal Assassin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Royal+Assassin)


[Royal Assassin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Royal+Assassin)'s ability to destroy tapped creatures may discourage your opponent from attacking. Use [Alluring Siren](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Alluring+Siren) to force those creatures to attack anyway, and then pick them off with [Royal Assassin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Royal+Assassin) when they do. 


### [Burning Inquiry](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Burning+Inquiry) + [Megrim](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Megrim)


[Megrim](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Megrim) makes your opponents take 2 damage every time they discard a card. Use [Burning Inquiry](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Burning+Inquiry) to give everyone three more cards—and then immediately discard three. This combo is at its best in games with more than two players: all of your opponents take 6 damage.


### [Indestructibility](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Indestructibility) + [Platinum Angel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Platinum+Angel)


[Platinum Angel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Platinum+Angel) makes sure that your opponents can't win the game. Enchant it with [Indestructibility](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Indestructibility), and your opponents won't be able to destroy it! You'll be invincible until your opponents find a way out of the lock. 


### [Traumatize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Traumatize) + [Haunting Echoes](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Haunting+Echoes)


[Traumatize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Traumatize) puts the top half of your opponent's deck into the graveyard, and then [Haunting Echoes](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Haunting+Echoes) removes all copies of those cards from the player's library. After that one-two punch, your opponent won't have many threats left to defeat you.


### [Act of Treason](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Act+of+Treason) + [Vampire Aristocrat](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vampire+Aristocrat)


[Act of Treason](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Act+of+Treason) lets you borrow an opponent's creature, but normally you have to give it back as the turn ends. But if you sacrifice the borrowed creature to a hungry [Vampire Aristocrat](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vampire+Aristocrat+) after you attack, you'll never have to give it back!  



### [Deus of Calamity](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deus+of+Calamity) and [Runes of the Deus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Runes+of+the+Deus)




![Runes of the Deus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Runes+of+the+Deus)![Deus of Calamity](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Deus+of+Calamity)

 This combo is so awesome that the cards' names hint at the combo! When [Deus of Calamity](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deus+of+Calamity) hits for 6 damage you can destroy one of your opponent's lands. With [Runes of the Deus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Runes+of+the+Deus) giving it double strike, you can be hitting for 16 and destroying two lands every turn.

 ### [Flourishing Defenses](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flourishing+Defenses) and [Witherscale Wurm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Witherscale+Wurm) and [Fate Transfer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fate+Transfer)


Swing away with the [Witherscale Wurm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Witherscale+Wurm) and put your opponents in a bind. Blocking your Wurm causes [Flourishing Defenses](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flourishing+Defenses) to spit out an army of 1/1 Elves. Then you can use [Fate Transfer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fate+Transfer) to kill another of their creatures—and get even more 1/1 Elves!—by moving the Wurm's -1/-1 counters onto their best creature. Of course your opponent can always decide to let [Witherscale Wurm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Witherscale+Wurm) through and take 9 damage. It's a win-win situation!


### [Murderous Redcap](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Murderous+Redcap) and [Torrent of Souls](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Torrent+of+Souls)


[Murderous Redcap](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Murderous+Redcap) can come out and kill a 2-toughness creature on its own. Then when its persist ability brings it back, it will do another 1 damage. Just when your opponent thinks the pain has stopped and [Murderous Redcap](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Murderous+Redcap) is truly gone, cast [Torrent of Souls](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Torrent+of+Souls). Since the Redcap has 4 power when it comes into play, it will deal 4 damage and start the carnage all over again!


### [Primalcrux](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Primalcrux) and [Spitting Image](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spitting+Image)


Why settle for a 6/6 when you could have two 12/12s? But when settle for two 12/12s when you could have three 18/18s? Or four 24/24s? Or five 30/30s? Every time you cast [Spitting Image](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spitting+Image) on a [Primalcrux](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Primalcrux), every [Primalcrux](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Primalcrux) gets 6 more power and toughness! As long as you can keep drawing lands to pay [Spitting Image'](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spitting+Image%27)s additional retrace cost, you can grow your forces to 60,000 power! (well, if you made 99 copies plus the original.)


### [Soul Snuffers](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soul+Snuffers) and [Crumbling Ashes](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crumbling+Ashes) and [Quillspike](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Quillspike)


These three cards combine to wipe out your opponent's army of creatures while leaving yours unscathed! First, play out [Crumbling Ashes](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crumbling+Ashes). Next drop [Soul Snuffers](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soul+Snuffers) to give every creature (including [Soul Snuffers](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soul+Snuffers)) a -1/-1 counter. During your next upkeep, and every upkeep for the rest of the game, [Crumbling Ashes](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crumbling+Ashes) destroys a creature with a -1/-1 counter on it. Before your opponent runs out of creatures, bring out [Quillspike](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Quillspike) to eat any -1/-1 counters on your side of the table and make your creatures immune to [Crumbling Ashes](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crumbling+Ashes).


### [Doomgape](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Doomgape) and [Creakwood Liege](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Creakwood+Liege)




![Creakwood Liege](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Creakwood+Liege)![Doomgape](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Doomgape)

[Doomgape](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Doomgape) hungry. [Doomgape](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Doomgape) eat Worms. Just in case a 10/10 trampler isn't big enough! When [Creakwood Liege](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Creakwood+Liege) comes out, [Doomgape](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Doomgape) grows to a 12/12! Sacrificing a creature every turn isn't such a burden with [Creakwood Liege](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Creakwood+Liege) making a 3/3 Worm every turn. As a finishing touch, the eaten Worms boost your life.

 ### [Indomitable Ancients](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Indomitable+Ancients) and [Doran, the Siege Tower](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Doran%2C+the+Siege+Tower)


They're both Treefolk. One costs three mana and one costs four mana. They share a color. And Doran (which acts like a 5/5) will make [Indomitable Ancients](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Indomitable+Ancients) act like a 10/10. So sure, this might be the most obvious combo of all time. But that doesn't mean it's not smashtacular!


### [Graceful Reprieve](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Graceful+Reprieve) and [Kinsbaile Borderguard](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kinsbaile+Borderguard)


The Borderguard is a great creature to save with [Graceful Reprieve](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Graceful+Reprieve). When it leaves play, you'll put a number of Kithkin Soldier tokens into play equal to the number of +1/+1 counters it had on it. Then it'll come right back into play with a number of +1/+1 counters on it equal to the number of Kithkin you have in play! Not only did you save your Borderguard, but it's at least as big as it used to be and you got some token creatures in the process!


### [Shields of Velis Vel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shields+of+Velis+Vel) and [Borderland Behemoth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Borderland+Behemoth)


[Borderland Behemoth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Borderland+Behemoth) is a big fellow who loves to play with other Giants. You can put together the biggest Giant party on the block thanks to [Shields of Velis Vel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shields+of+Velis+Vel). How does giving your Behemoth +4/+4 for each creature you control sound? Thanks to trample, it'll take a lot of blockers for your opponent to slow down this attack.
