*We're taking a two-week holiday break and will be back with new stuff on Monday, January 2, 2012. Until then, please enjoy our favorite Arcanas of 2011. This article originally ran October 10, 2011.*


Here's the art description for [Army of the Damned](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Army+of+the+Damned).


> Color: Black spell
> 
> 
> Action: We're inside a ramshackle cottage in the country, under attack by zombies. The point of view is from the hapless humans trapped inside. We’re at the moment when the zombies are breaking through – their arms and horrifying faces are coming through the boarded-up windows, through the door blockaded with dressers and trunks, and so on. Maybe they're even climbing up through a hole they've ripped in the floor. 
> 
> 
> Focus: The giant horde of zombies 
> 
> 
> Mood: You can't run. You can't hide. They’re everywhere! 
>

![Army of the Damned](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Army+of+the+Damned)The art description doesn't mention how many zombies should be included, but the card makes thirteen at a shot. So, just how many of them *are* coming to get you, Barbara?

Well, there are a lot of zombies in there, so they're kind of hard to count. Let's just count the zombies whose faces (or eyes) we can see.

Hey, there's a coincidence! There appear to be exactly thirteen zombie faces in the art for [Army of the Damned](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Army+of+the+Damned)!
