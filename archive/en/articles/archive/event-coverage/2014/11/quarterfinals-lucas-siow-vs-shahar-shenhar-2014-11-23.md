Shahar Shenhar is the reigning world champion. Currently ranked 16th in the world, Shenhar already has two Grand Prix victories and another Top 8 to his name. Shenhar enters this Top 8 as the highest ranked seed.


His opponent, Lucas Siow, has a pair of Grand Prix Top 8s and also once beat me in the finals of a PTQ. Siow entered this tournament without much knowledge of the *Khans of Tarkir* Limited format, but he's proven his *Magic* instincts and card evaluation skills are worthy of greatness with a Top 8 in this event.


Siow and Shenhar debated Siow's picks in an earlier draft while they waited for the match to start.


Shenhar got off to a quick start with [Disowned Ancestor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Disowned+Ancestor) into [Mardu Skullhunter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mardu+Skullhunter), but Siow had [Highland Game](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Highland+Game) to stave off the early pressure.

*Lucas Siow*

Siow had an army of morphs, but Shenhar was applying pressure in the air with [Alabaster Kirin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Alabaster+Kirin). Shahar's air aggression was quickly negated by Siow's [Abzan Guide](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Abzan+Guide)



Siow gummed things up again when he surprised Shenhar with a main deck [Windstorm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Windstorm).


The game continued as a stalemate, but Siow eventually drew [Duneblast](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duneblast) to sweep Shenhar's side of the table and he was able to ride that advantage to victory.


**Siow 1 - 0 Shenhar**


Both players established boards quickly in the early turns of the second game.


Neither player wanted to play the trading game.


Shenhar seemed to have the advantage early with a few attackers repeatedly getting in without much resistance from Siow.


Siow made a risky play by going down to a precarious life total to cast [Bitter Revelation](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bitter+Revelation). The card choices were tight and Siow eventually decided to take Rakshasa's Secret over a better spell in fear that the remaining cards in Shenhar's hand were particularly powerful.

*Shahar Shenhar*

The next turn, Siow's intuition paid off when he got [Duneblast](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duneblast) and [Smite the Monstrous](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Smite+the+Monstrous) out of Shenhar's hand with Rakshasa's Secret and had [Kill Shot](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kill+Shot) to deal with Shenhar's freshly cast [Bellowing Saddlebrute](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bellowing+Saddlebrute).



From there Siow continued turning the screws on Shenhar. Continuously pulling further ahead with [Abzan Guide](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Abzan+Guide), [Woolly Loxodon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Woolly+Loxodon), and [Death Frenzy](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Death+Frenzy) to close out the game.


Siow breathed a sigh of relief, "I knew I'd either look like a genius or an idiot taking that Rakshasa's Secret, I'm glad it turned out how it did."
