At the top tables at the beginning of Day 2, the most popular options were Green-White Tokens and Naya Midrange. This would imply that [Sylvan Advocate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sylvan+Advocate) and [Gideon, Ally of Zendikar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gideon%2C+Ally+of+Zendikar) are the key cards to beat in the current Standard format.


You can find the full breakdown of the archetypes of the Top 100 players going into Day 2 (i.e., the Top 100 players on the Round 9 standings) below.




| Archetype | # |
| --- | --- |
| Green-White Tokens | 20 |
| Naya Midrange | 18 |
| Bant Company | 11 |
| White-Black Control | 9 |
| Bant Humans | 7 |
| Grixis Control | 7 |
| Four-Color Rites | 4 |
| Red-Green Ramp | 4 |
| Bant Rites | 3 |
| White Eldrazi | 3 |
| Sultai Midrange | 2 |
| Sultai Seasons Past | 2 |
| Abzan Midrange | 1 |
| Abzan Rites | 1 |
| Abzan Seasons Past | 1 |
| Black-Green Aurora | 1 |
| Blulamog | 1 |
| Green-White Eldrazi | 1 |
| Esper Control | 1 |
| Esper Dragons | 1 |
| Black-Green Rites | 1 |
| White Weenie Humans | 1 |

So Green-White Tokens and Naya Midrange are the most popular decks, followed by a variety of other archetypes. Looking a bit more closely, we can find a number of commonalities among those other decks.


First, [Collected Company](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Collected+Company) and [Eldrazi Displacer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eldrazi+Displacer) had big followings, and they were often seen in the same deck. Both are key pieces of most [Cryptolith Rite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cryptolith+Rite) decks, and [Eldrazi Displacer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eldrazi+Displacer) has become a frequent inclusion in Bant Company decks as well.


Second, [Languish](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Languish) is the go-to card for control players. It doesn't matter whether it's white-black, Sultai, Abzan, black-green, or Esperâ€”[Languish](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Languish) appears to be the sweeper of choice, frequently flanked by [Transgress the Mind](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Transgress+the+Mind) and [Ultimate Price](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ultimate+Price).


Finally, [Thalia's Lieutenant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thalia%27s+Lieutenant) is the card that aggro players flock to in the current Standard. Bant Humans may not be as hyper-aggressive as White Weenie Humans, but for both decks, [Thalia's Lieutenant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thalia%27s+Lieutenant) enables the fastest starts in Standard.
