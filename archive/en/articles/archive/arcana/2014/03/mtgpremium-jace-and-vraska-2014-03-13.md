Tomorrow, *Duel Deck: Jace vs. Vraska* will be on store shelves, so today I wanted to do something we normally only do for booster set releases: look at the premium white underlayer used when we make the premium foil cards. In Duel Decks, the front card of each deck is the only premium card, so that means today we're looking at the white underlayers of [Jace, Architect of Thought](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace%2C+Architect+of+Thought) and [Vraska the Unseen](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vraska+the+Unseen).
