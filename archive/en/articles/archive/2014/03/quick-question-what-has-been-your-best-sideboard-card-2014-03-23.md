With such a diverse field and with the amount of tweaking being done looking to gain an edge on the field, sideboards take on a greater importance than normal.

Luis Scott-Vargas had [Nightveil Specter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nightveil+Specter) against me as well, and we both had them, but I kept in [Last Breath](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Last+Breath) to get mine through. That's how I won.*
