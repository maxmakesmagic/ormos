Limited Showcase Opens This Weekend
-----------------------------------


The penultimate events of each season, Showcase Opens allow anyone to try their hand at earning an invitation to the Showcase. Players don't need to earn points or another qualification to enter, and because these events are Sealed, players don't even need a deck. The winner of each Open will get an invitation to the Season 1 Showcase, and both the winner and runner-up earn invitations to the New Capenna Championship on *MTG Arena*.


These events are also the last chance to earn enough [Leaderboard](https://magic.wizards.com/en/mtgo/leaderboard) points to grab one of two At-Large invites to the *Magic Online* Champions Showcase.


Showcase Opens are scheduled as follows:





| ***DATE*** | ***TIME*** | ***UTC*** | ***FORMAT*** | ***INVITATION*** |
| Saturday, April 23, 2022 | 7:00 a.m. | 14:00 | NEO Sealed | 2022 Season 1 Champions Showcase (MTGO) and New Capenna Championship (*MTG Arena*) |
| Sunday, April 24, 2022 | 7:00 a.m. | 14:00 | NEO Sealed | 2022 Season 1 Champions Showcase (MTGO) and New Capenna Championship (*MTG Arena*) |
