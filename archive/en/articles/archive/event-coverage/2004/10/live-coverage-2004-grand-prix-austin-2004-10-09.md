![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gpaus04/day1.jpg)Welcome to Austin, Texas - Live Music capital of the world. For this weekend the Austin Convention Center is also home to the second event of Kamigawa Grand Prix Madness. 386 players will be playing eight rounds of sealed deck today - the 64 with the best records and tiebreakers will advance to Sunday to Rochester draft and win a total of $25,000--always an interesting format a week or so after the new block debuts. With a brand new limited format card evaluations, color archetypes, and the best strategies are still unclear. With *Mirrodin* disappearing behind the horizon in the rearview mirror, colors matter more than they have in quite a while. With the preponderance of Legends in the new set--including many in the uncommon slot--it will be exciting to see how the new Legends rule affects tournament play as it makes its high level event debut this weekend.


Keep it here all weekend for all the action. There will be bloggery, abundant feature match coverage, and interviews with your favorite pros about the new cards and impending Standard format.
