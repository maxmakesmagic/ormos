There are ten two-color combinations in *Battle for Zendikar* Limited—well, in any Limited format, really—and I asked some of the pros in attendance here today what their favorite was and whether their preference had changed since the format's debut a few weeks ago.

**No. 13 Ondřej Stráský:** "In Sealed, the best deck is green ramp with Eldrazi—[Ulamog, the Ceaseless Hunger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ulamog%2C+the+Ceaseless+Hunger) is the best card in Sealed. In draft, the blue-black, black-red, and blue-red ingest and/or devoid decks are the best, and green sucks."

**Hall of Famer Olivier Ruel, whose brother Antoine is having his birthday today:** "Before the Pro Tour, I was fixed on playing a blue-green deck splashing whatever I could. I like [Seek the Wilds](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seek+the+Wilds), [Anticipate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Anticipate), [Lifespring Druid](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lifespring+Druid), and other cards that no one seems to pick. Now, my favorite archetype is still the same four-color green deck. I also like the green-black-white deck with Allies, life gain, and tokens, but a lot has to go right for you to assemble it."

**Pro Tour *Battle for Zendikar* 6-0 drafter Don van Ravenzwaaij:** "The blue-red devoid deck is still really good. An archetype that I like a lot better than other players is the green-black sacrifice deck with [Blisterpod](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blisterpod), [Voracious Null](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Voracious+Null), [Rot Shambler](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rot+Shambler), and so on. Because a lot of pros really dislike green, this archetype is still a little under the radar."

**Grand Prix Madison champion Raphaël Lévy:** "Blue-black devoid/ingest with [Swarm Surge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swarm+Surge). It's only about commons, and your deck is built around a common, [Swarm Surge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swarm+Surge), that can change the course of the game."

**Pro Tour *Magic Origins* champion Joel Larsson: "**In Sealed, I like three archetypes: blue-white because fliers and awaken spells are very good in Sealed where the games go longer; blue-black because it's the best deck for the Eldrazi, even if it's difficult to get enough synergistic cards, and any pool with [Ulamog, the Ceaseless Hunger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ulamog%2C+the+Ceaseless+Hunger). If you open that card, you should build around it. In Sealed, it's as absurd as [Gideon, Ally of Zendikar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gideon%2C+Ally+of+Zendikar), [Quarantine Field](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Quarantine+Field), and [Planar Outburst](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Planar+Outburst). In draft, it's tougher. I like blue-white, blue-black, and I think I like green more than others. It's heavily underdrafted, and if you are the only green player at the table, you will get a great deck. I felt that way before the Pro Tour, and I feel more strongly about it now. One thing that may have changed is that a couple of weeks ago, I thought that it was very tough to draft aggro decks, but I learned that if you don't focus on drafting a curve with lots of 2-drops, but focus on synergies such as landfall instead, then aggro decks can work."
