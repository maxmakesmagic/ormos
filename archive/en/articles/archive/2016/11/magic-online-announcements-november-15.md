**Build Notes**


New Player | Updated the experience for new players logging into their collection for the first time.


Leagues | Added support for elimination leagues, including updating league details to display additional information.


Leagues | Fixed some missing or broken tool tips and links in the client.


General | You will now receive a chat notification if your opponent disconnects while you are looking at your sideboard.


Trade | Improved response time for players with large collections when adding a large number of objects to trade binders.


Trade | Fixed an issue where if a user cancels a trade before the trade partner accepts it, both become unable to trade until closing and reloading the game.


Collection | Fixed an issue where importing broken deck files that were missing certain pieces of information caused the program to lock up. Magic Online will now display an error message when this occurs.


Collection | Fixed an issue where the count of a card in your collection would not decrement when adding to a deck by clicking and dragging.


Trade | Added a quantity indicator to the final confirmation window and new product window.


General | Fixed an issue that could cause some settings to be reset after an update.


Play Lobby | Fixed an issue that could cause format filters to not display.


Treasure Chests | [Updated Treasure Chest](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/magic-online/magic-online-event-updates-november-2016-11-09) contents to include select *Conspiracy: Take the Crown* and *Commander (2016 Edition)* cards.
