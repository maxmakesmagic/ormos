"Not the easiest table I have ever sat down to," offered Olivier as I approached him afterwards.


This was the seating plan:




|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | Christophe Haim |  |
|  | David Copete Garcia | Jens Thoren |  |
| Justin West |  | Noah Boeken |
|  | Antoine Ruel | Petr Nahodil |  |
|  | Olivier Ruel |  |

And so fate dictated that the two French brothers should sit down next to each other on their own turf – a situation that is deemed to be a huge advantage should the players know their own draft preferences. In this case of course, they did...


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/ptnice02/a983.jpg)Olivier: " Antoine knew I liked drafting white/blue, so I thought it natural that he might end up black/green to my left.'


S.B.: " What would happen to the red then?"


Olivier: "Well, red is a pretty good colour to splash in a white/blue deck if you have enough ways of discarding. You always pick up things like [Fiery Temper](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fiery+Temper) and Volcanic Eruption in the last set."


Olivier Ruel - The Draft.


(I will boldface the actual picks).


### Set 1


Booster 1: [Whispering Shade](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Whispering+Shade), [Mad Dog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mad+Dog), **[Shelter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shelter)**, [Barbarian Lunatic](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Barbarian+Lunatic), Crypt Keeper, [Childhood Horror](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Childhood+Horror), [Spellbane Centaur](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spellbane+Centaur), [Childhood Horror](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Childhood+Horror).


The [Shelter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shelter) obviously went hand in hand with his U-W strategy. He was expecting Antoine to take the [Spellbane Centaur](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spellbane+Centaur), but the Horror was picked instead.


Booster 2: [Crashing Centaur](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crashing+Centaur), [Elephant Ambush](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elephant+Ambush), [Dreamwinder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dreamwinder), **[Hallowed Healer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hallowed+Healer)**, Scriviner


Booster 3: Nantuku Disciple, **[Flame Burst](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flame+Burst)**, [Patrol Hound](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Patrol+Hound), [Embolden](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Embolden), [Metamorphic Wurm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Metamorphic+Wurm)


Booster 4: [Diabolic Tutor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Diabolic+Tutor), **[Dreamwinder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dreamwinder)**, [Whispering Shade](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Whispering+Shade)


Booster 5: [Aven Archer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aven+Archer), **[Deluge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deluge)**, [Aven Cloudchaser](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aven+Cloudchaser).


Booster 6: **[Shelter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shelter)**, [Scrivener](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scrivener), [Peek](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Peek)


Booster 7: **[Hallowed Healer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hallowed+Healer)**


Booster 8: **[Patrol Hound](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Patrol+Hound)**, [Volcanic Spray](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Volcanic+Spray), [Pardic Firecat](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pardic+Firecat)


Booster 9: **[Animal Boneyard](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Animal+Boneyard)**


Booster 10: **[Nefarious Lich](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nefarious+Lich)** (passing [Moment's Peace](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Moment%27s+Peace) to his brother)


The only card of any value picked up in the last few boosters was a [Mystic Visionary](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mystic+Visionary).


This first set of boosters had worked out ok for Olivier, but Antoine had taken a bit of a beating. The smaller Frenchman had managed the following cards:


[Savage Firecat](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Savage+Firecat), [Childhood Horror](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Childhood+Horror), [Elephant Ambush](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elephant+Ambush), Nantuku Disciple, [Barbarian Lunatic](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Barbarian+Lunatic), [Anarchist](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Anarchist), [Refresh](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Refresh), [Rites of Spring](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rites+of+Spring), [Moment's Peace](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Moment%27s+Peace). Now taking into account the knowledge that red did make his final decklist this selection looks pretty poor.


### Set 2


Booster 1: **[Firebolt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Firebolt)**, [Beast Attack](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Beast+Attack), [Balshan Griffin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Balshan+Griffin), [Mystic Zealot](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mystic+Zealot), [Krosan Avenger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Krosan+Avenger), [Patriarch's Desire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Patriarch%27s+Desire), [Muscle Burst](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Muscle+Burst). Yes, this booster was pretty nuts and Olivier spent quite some time wondering what the right pick was – his hand straying to the Zealot on numerous occasions.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/ptnice02/a985.jpg)Booster 2: [Ember Beast](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ember+Beast), **[Flame Burst](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flame+Burst)**, [Millikin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Millikin), [Repel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Repel).


Booster 3: [Gravedigger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gravedigger), [Recoup](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Recoup), [Angelic Wall](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Angelic+Wall), **[Chainflinger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chainflinger)**. I imagine at this stage Olivier resigned himself to being a three colour mage with slightly dodgy mana, but that has proven to be a typically French thing to do.


Booster 4: **[Cephalid Looter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cephalid+Looter)**, [Angelic Wall](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Angelic+Wall), [Stone-Tongue Basilisk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stone-Tongue+Basilisk), [Fervent Denial](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fervent+Denial). WOW! A fourth pick looter. That is the kind of thing that happens when you have a brother sitting to your left.


Booster 5: [Ashen Firebeast](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ashen+Firebeast), **[Balshan Griffin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Balshan+Griffin)**


Booster 6: [Anarchist](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Anarchist), **[Shelter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shelter)**, [Predict](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Predict)


Booster 7: **[Dreamwinder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dreamwinder)**. At this point Olivier jokingly informed me that he would have taken the [Battle of Wits](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Battle+of+Wits), but there was a [Druid Lyrist](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Druid+Lyrist) in the same pack.


Booster 8: **[Aven Cloudchaser](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aven+Cloudchaser)** (over [Pilgrim of Justice](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pilgrim+of+Justice))


Booster 9: **Stonetongue Basilisk** (over [Thermal Blast](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thermal+Blast))


In the remaining pack he managed to pick up a [Tattoo Ward](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tattoo+Ward), [Words of Wisdom](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Words+of+Wisdom) and a couple of sac. Lands.


In this second set of boosters Antoine had managed to fix his colours as a black/green mage, but he was not happy with what he had.


### Set 3 – *Torment*


Booster 1: **[Ambassador Laquatus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ambassador+Laquatus)**, [Deep Analysis](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deep+Analysis), [Cabal Torturer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cabal+Torturer), [Narcissism](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Narcissism). There was very little else in the booster of relevance.


Booster 2: [Liquify](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Liquify), [Mystic Familiar](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mystic+Familiar), [Deep Analysis](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deep+Analysis), **[Violent Eruption](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Violent+Eruption)**.


Booster 3: **[Fiery Temper](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fiery+Temper)**


Booster 4: [Churning Eddy](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Churning+Eddy), **[Teroh's Faithful](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Teroh%27s+Faithful)**, [Liquify](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Liquify)


Booster 5: [Floating Shield](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Floating+Shield), **Strength Of Isolation**.


Booster 6: [Floating Shield](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Floating+Shield), **[Stern Judge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stern+Judge)**, [Obsessive Search](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Obsessive+Search).


Booster 7: [Stern Judge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stern+Judge), **[Major Teroh](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Major+Teroh)**.


The rest of the boosters did not supply anything of real value, save a few defensive drafts.


So it seemed for Olivier that being a white mage had worked out quite well for him. He is playing 18 lands due to his dodgy mana-base, but his deck contains a whole bunch of good removal and tricks, and some fairly powerful creatures. I would expect him to 3-1 with this set of cards.


Olivier: "I passed Antoine nothing in the draft – it was really awful. I hope he opened up some good packs."


Poor Antoine looked a little dejected as he walked of to construct – "My deck is nothing."
