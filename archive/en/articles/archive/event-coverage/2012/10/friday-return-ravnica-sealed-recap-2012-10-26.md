 A longtime member of the Pro Tour and Grand Prix coverage staff, Nate Price now works making beautiful words for all of you lovely people as the community manager for organized play. When not covering events, he lords over the @MagicProTour Twitter account, ruling with an iron fist. 






One more event and three more rounds: that's all the Wizards team had between themselves and their first victory in the history of the *Magic Online* Community Cup! The final event was RTR Sealed Deck, and things looked good for the Community during the build. They had multiple extremely good decks, including Jackie Lee's [Armada Wurm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Armada+Wurm)/[Supreme Verdict](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Supreme+Verdict)/double [Vitu-Ghazi Guildmage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vitu-Ghazi+Guildmage) deck. Needless to say, she cruised to an easy 2-1 performance. The rest of the team stepped up to the plate and delivered a strong performance, but the evil plague of the format, [Pack Rat](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pack+Rat)s, reared it's ugly head to steal a couple of matches, leaving the Community at 4-4 instead of the advantage they were looking for. Things looked a little better after a 5-3 second round, and the Community pulled within 30 points by virtue of four 2-0 players.


It all came down to the final round. The Community Team needed to go 6-2 to creep back ahead of the Wizards team and snatch victory from the jaws of defeat. Things started out well, with a quick Conley Woods victory putting them down the path to upset. Things got sketchy when Shawn Main, the man behind the Wacky draft, took out Jon Loucks and his powerful [Bant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bant) deck. That left only one win to spare. Things continued to go well, with wrongwaygoback and Heath Newton winning their matches. When Jackie's insane deck lost in the final round, it looked like the end was nigh. Within thirty seconds, Dave Humphreys and his triple [Azorius Arrester](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Azorius+Arrester) deck we nicknamed "Copland" defeated Smi77y, and the event was over. Despite a serious effort to comeback, the Community Team fell, giving the Wizards the first their first Community Cup victory!
