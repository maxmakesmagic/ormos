**Commentary:**  

In response to feedback, I changed my keyword mechanics substantially, removing Swarm and Erupt, and restricting Favored to uncommon and higher. In place of Favored, the common Thamarach have other enchantment-related abilities, while the Graformans have tribal benefits instead of Swarm. Erupt didn't fit the creature and aura focus of Golamo; now instants and sorceries have a tweaked version of Hunger, called Consume. To avoid punishing people for casting an aura rather than Incarnating it, Consume can feed on both creatures and auras. Although sacrificing enchantments is outside the color pie for black, sacrificing an aura seems less problematic, since black was already able to sacrifice the creature the aura was attached to. Necromantic Infusion also stretches the color pie. However, auras in this set are often effectively creatures, and colors often reach a bit to fit a set's themes; consider [Grim Discovery](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grim+Discovery).


Golamo also now has a minor "power matters" theme, to encourage players to make their insects and rats even bigger than they already are, and reward players for enchanting their creatures. The Frenzy keyword from Future Sight fits into this, and appears on the violent red and black barbarian Vax. The Vax also feed upon sacrificed creatures, interacting with both Consume and creatures that sacrifice themselves (such as worker ants). The blue/black Kohmorr prefer to steal things: life, cards, auras.


Removal in Golamo is a bit less effective than usual against auras, and I pushed the power of Desiccate to help auras in constructed.
