Here are Krenko, Mob Boss and Krenko's Command from the upcoming [***Magic** 2013*](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/tcg/Products.aspx?x=mtg/tcg/products/magic2013) set. You can also see them in **Duels of the Planeswalkers** 2013, but that's not what we're talking about today.

There's something interesting about these two cards. Can you spot what it is? What if we blow the art up a bit to get a better look?

How about now? If you haven't gotten it yet, take a look at the alley behind Krenko. See those two goblins way in the background? They're the ones from Krenko's Command! Click here to see them clearly!
