By now you have likely seen the *Aether Revolt* [Card Image Gallery](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/card-image-gallery/aether-revolt) (or are patiently waiting until this weekend's Prereleases to see the cards in person for the first time!). You'll have plenty of opportunities in the coming months to try out *Aether Revolt*, especially if a Grand Prix is headed to a city near you!


With the full set for *Aether Revolt* now unveiled, it's time to compile all the awesome playmats that will be available at upcoming Grand Prix through March!


January
=======


There are two Grand Prix remaining in January—[Prague](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/premierplay/grandprix/fact-sheet-gppra17) and [San Jose](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/premierplay/grandprix/fact-sheet-gpsj17)—each showcasing one art for their playmats. Those playmats feature the art from [Mechanized Production](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mechanized+Production).

The initial tickets into the main event of Grand Prix Prague sold out, but the tournament organizer recently announced that 300 seats opened up thanks to space within their venue becoming free, so check out the [GP website for more info](https://tournamentcenter.eu/en/magic-gathering/tournaments/grand-prix-prague-prague-0) on signing up! Players who compete in the main event will receive the above playmat.


All players who register for the Grand Prix San Jose main event will receive the above playmat, so check out the [GP San Jose website](http://gpsanjose.com/) for information on how to sign up!


February
========


The month of February features three weekends of Grand Prix following the results of [Pro Tour *Aether* *Revolt*](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/premierplay/protour/ptaer), highlighting both the Standard and Modern formats. The action starts with [Grand Prix Pittsburgh](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/premierplay/grandprix/fact-sheet-gppit17), a Standard event that will take place only one week following what emerges at the Pro Tour.


The playmat for this event is available to players through different main event registration packages. For more information, visit the [GP Pittsburgh website](http://www.mtggp.com/). That said, if you're a fan of legendary skyship Pirates, then the playmat art of [Kari Zev's Expertise](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kari+Zev%27s+Expertise) is likely to pique your interest for this one!

One week after that is a double-Grand Prix Modern weekend, featuring main events in [Brisbane](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/premierplay/grandprix/fact-sheet-gpbri17) and [Vancouver](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/premierplay/grandprix/fact-sheet-gpvan17). All players who register for these main events will receive an event-exclusive playmat showcasing the beautiful art for [Pithing Needle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pithing+Needle) from the *Kaladesh Inventions*.
