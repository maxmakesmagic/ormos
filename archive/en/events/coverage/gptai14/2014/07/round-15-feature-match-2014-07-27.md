Kuo Tzu Ching and Huang Hao-Shan are two of the best players in all of Taiwan, superstars in their own right. It seemed befitting that the final round of Grand Prix Taipei would send at least one of them into the Top 8. As soon as pairings were posted and their names announced, both slightly-superstitious players rushed to the Featured Match in a bid to grab the "luckier seat".


Interestingly, both MTG Mint Card players had been practicing together for the past week, churning out almost ten drafts within a span of seven days. It looked like their practice had paid off and both players were 5-0 at the Booster Draft portion today. Both players came to the conclusion that Red White were the best colors to be in, resulting in this epic Boros mirror match that would send the winner into the Top 8.


Game 1



 Huang won the die roll and Kuo had to go down to 6. Huang quickly pointed [Heat Ray](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Heat+Ray) at the opposing [Borderland Marauder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Borderland+Marauder), clearly aware of her huge damage potential.




 Huang presented his first creature, [Juggernaut](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Juggernaut). Kuo had no immediate solution to it, only managing a hasted 2/2 creature by combining [Forge Devil](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forge+Devil) and [Hammerhand](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hammerhand). The reason for quickly sticking a creature on the board was more apparent, when Kuo tapped his [Forge Devil](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forge+Devil) to convoke [Triplicate Spirits](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Triplicate+Spirits) on the next turn.




 "I'll triple block the [Juggernaut](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Juggernaut)," Kuo taunted.




 "I don't think so," replied Huang, as he smiled and summoned a [Forge Devil](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forge+Devil) of his own, clearing one of tokens from the sky.




 Kuo took a second hit from [Juggernaut](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Juggernaut) and Huang cushioned his life total in this hyper-aggressive Red White mirror with [Solemn Offering](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Solemn+Offering) on [Hammerhand](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hammerhand).




 Kuo feigned weakness and held back both of his spirit tokens and [Forge Devil](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forge+Devil). When Huang attacked with [Juggernaut](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Juggernaut) and his own [Forge Devil](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forge+Devil), his side of the board was wiped clean with a timely [Sanctified Charge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sanctified+Charge).




 Huang however had the final trump, in the form of [Boonweaver Giant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Boonweaver+Giant) tutoring out [Spectra Ward](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spectra+Ward). Having no way to outrace the practically indestructible monster, Kuo scooped up his cards and reached for the sideboard.





*Huang wins the first game with [Boonweaver Giant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Boonweaver+Giant), tutoring out [Spectra Ward](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spectra+Ward).*
