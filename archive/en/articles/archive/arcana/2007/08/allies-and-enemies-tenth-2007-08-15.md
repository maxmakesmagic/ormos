Part of the beauty of **Magic**'s five color system is that it naturally creates a network of allies and enemies—factions to create both cooperation and conflict—for each color. *Tenth Edition*, as part of its mission as a teaching tool for new **Magic** players, contains cards that help demonstrate these allied and enemy relationships as clearly as possible.

Each card in the [cycle of five Weavers](/en/articles/archive/five-weavers-weaving-2007-08-01), reprinted from *Invasion,* gives benefits to its color's allies. The demonstration of the colors' enemy relationships is a bit more subtle, but is present in the form of *Coldsnap's* "color hosers": [Luminesce](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Luminesce), [Flashfreeze](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flashfreeze), [Deathmark](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deathmark), [Cryoclasm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cryoclasm), and [Karplusan Strider](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Karplusan+Strider).

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/mtgcom/arcana1000/1398_Weavers-and-Hosers.jpg)Each card of the five "color hosers" mentions two other colors, just like the Weavers; but in this case the cards affect the color's enemies, and do something nasty to them. If you have a friend who's just getting into **Magic**, build him or her a deck that uses one or more of these color hosers, and then play a deck of the enemy colors on the other side of the table. Let your friend counter your [Kird Ape](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kird+Ape) or blow up your [Island](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island). It's a simple puzzle to figure out, but an immensely satisfying one, and a great way to use *Tenth Edition* to bring new players into the community.
