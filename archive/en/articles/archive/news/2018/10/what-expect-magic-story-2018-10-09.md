*Magic*'s story is reaching for new heights with incredible authors, new story expressions, and more ways to experience the stories of *Magic*'s worlds. We've got so much coming (and more yet to be announced) that we wanted to talk about the bigger picture for a moment—what we're doing and why we're doing it.


Over the years, *Magic*'s stories have unfolded in a number of different ways: web fiction, novels, comic books, web comics, on cards and in videos, and even through the occasional blog post from one of our intrepid worldbuilders.


Just one world can fill books and stories for years, and we have dozens of rich worlds to explore. So why not let some of the most creative people in our world play around in them? Why not build a new professional talent pool to open up *Magic*'s worlds even more? That's the philosophy we started with when we joined up with Martha Wells to tell the story of *Dominaria* and with Kate Elliott to introduce the Nicol Bolas origin story.


Opening our story to extremely talented writers also lets us tell stories we might not have in the past. Cassandra Khaw better introduced us to Vivien Reid in a three-part story that probably wouldn't have existed under our previous model of writing fiction. Nicky Drayden's stories, which begin tomorrow, explore corners and personalities of Ravnica that get overlooked by the Big Story that drives the main focus of the set.


*Magic* has a broad audience with broad tastes, so we're finding new ways to meet them where they read, exploring different lengths, different channels, and different tones while focusing on different characters and planes and even mediums.


Similarly, we have plans to tell stories in worlds our card sets aren't visiting. This means that we can revisit fan-favorite worlds in *Magic* Story just because we think people will enjoy it. It also means we can work closer with creative writers to choose and shape these stories without the constraints of what the card set is doing at the moment.


Add in a pair of novels from Greg Weisman bringing the Bolas/Gatewatch battle to its thrilling conclusion and a comic following Chandra written by Vita Ayala with art by Harvey Tolibao starting in November, and you start to get a picture of how *Magic* fiction is shaping up. Oh, and Weisman will also be writing the web fiction for the end of the Bolas arc in addition to the two novels he's crafting. Because we think he's great and hope you will too.


How do we keep everything straight? The Franchise team keeps a steady hand on the wheel, broadly offering story beats and frameworks for creative people to create. We've also started a partnership with Jay Annelli—a fan who just so happens to know *Magic* story inside and out—to help keep an eye on continuity. Jay knows his stuff and loves *Magic* story. It's always helpful to bring in more people who know the terrain.


There's more to come as well. *Magic* has dozens and dozens of worlds to explore, and our goal is to set up frameworks from which creative people can paint larger swaths of those worlds for your enjoyment.


We look forward to showing you around.
