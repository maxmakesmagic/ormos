When I first became head designer many years ago, I decided to take a page from the president of the United States and spend a column each year talking about the state of **Magic** design. I use this column to look back at the previous year's design and talk about what went right and what went wrong. I also talk about what our goals are for the year's design to come. This is my eighth State of Design column. Here are my previous seven: [2005](/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/daily/mr191), [2006](/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/daily/mr242), [2007](/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/daily/mr292), [2008](/magic/magazine/article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/mm/2), [2009](/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/mm/53), [2010](/magic/magazine/article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/mm/110), and [2011](/magic/magazine/article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/mm/157).
