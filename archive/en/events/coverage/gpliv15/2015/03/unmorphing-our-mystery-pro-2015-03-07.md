It's the end of the day and it's time to unmorph a mystery pro. And it's the highly experienced Hall of Famer Raphaël Lévy.

Despite claiming his pool was underpowered, Levy charged to a 7-0 record before being buried in [Wingmate Roc](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wingmate+Roc)s by fellow Hall of Famer Nicolai Herzog. He went on to win the last round to leave him ending day one with a solid 8-1 record.


So about that underpowered...


"Well, I didn't want to say anything, but I think it's good," Levy said afterwards.


He pointed out [Pyrotechnics](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyrotechnics) as being very strong and gave some play examples where he was able to turn around bad board positions with [Supplant Form](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Supplant+Form) (on [Aven Surveyor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aven+Surveyor)) and [Arcbond](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arcbond). He also singled out the [Bathe in Dragonfire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bathe+in+Dragonfire) as being an efficient answer to a lot of creatures.


"You don't mind using it on a morph."


Lévy's pool might not have been bombtastic in the conventional sense, but a consistent two-color mana base, efficient creature curve, and a bucketload of red burn can go a long way.
