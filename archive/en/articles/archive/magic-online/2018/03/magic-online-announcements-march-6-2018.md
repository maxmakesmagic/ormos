2017 *Magic Online* Championship Concludes
------------------------------------------


In case you somehow missed it, a little event called the *Magic Online* Championship happened over the weekend. Twenty-four of the world's best *Magic Online* competitors gathered at Wizards HQ in Renton, Washington, for three days of exciting top-level *Magic*.


If you didn't catch all the action live, we've got you covered! Head on over to [twitch.tv/magic](https://www.twitch.tv/magic) and click "videos" to watch the whole thing whenever you want—or skip ahead to the finals, if that's your thing. We won't judge.

*Masters 25* Coming Soon (Plus Treasure Chest Update)
-----------------------------------------------------


*Masters 25* is coming to *Magic Online* on Friday, March 16! Enjoy highlights from the entire glorious history of *Magic*, collected into one unique Limited environment. Both regular and phantom Draft Leagues will be available, and will run through April 4.


At the same time, we're rolling out some sweet Treasure Chest updates! Read all about those updates and get the full details on *Masters 25* in Chris Kiritz's article [here](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/magic-online/masters-25-plus-treasure-chest-updates-2018-03-06).
