 Stybs has played Magic the world over, writing and drafting as part of the event coverage team and slinging Commander everywhere his decks will fit. 





*Dragons of Tarkir* Limited has had time to mature since it’s Pro Tour debut, and with that maturity came a display of mastery. These are some of the great cards and played from Grand Prix Atlantic City.


 


**#5 Evolving Wilds**

From across the undefeated Day 1 decklists as well as many of the Grand Prix Trial winners coming into the weekend, a surprising facet of *Dragons of Tarkir* Sealed was revealed: Splashing to maximize the power level of the deck worked. No. 19-ranked Andrew Cuneo and fellow Day 1 undefeated player Chris Fennell both used more than two mana to earn perfect records with Evolving Wilds.


 


Of course, [Evolving Wilds](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Evolving+Wilds) also works for two-color decks but it was more creative uses that stood out all weekend.

**#4 Ruthless Deathfang**

How much value can the Blue-Black draft decks find? For Luis Scott-Vargas in his Top 8-placing draft, [Ruthless Deathfang](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ruthless+Deathfang) found enough value to wipe away the entire opposite side of the battlefield and crack open windows for immediate victory. Thanks to controlling triggers from both [Ruthless Deathfang](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ruthless+Deathfang) and anything else that is exploiting, such as Sidisi’s Faithful, it was possible to stack triggers as favorably as possible.


 


Scott-Vargas didn’t miss those opportunities.

**#3 Sabertooth Outriders**

How good is a 4/2 with first strike? It’s a question players kept asking opponents on their way to victory. Finalist Bryan Gottlieb packed a whopping four copies of Sabertooth Outriders in his Top 8 deck, and used them to great effect beating down against Gaudenis Vidugiris in their quarterfinal match. In his semifinal against Christian Calcano, Gottlieb was just a turn away from using their formidable power to take the match-winning game.


 


The Outriders aren’t outlandish in the least.

**#2 Deathmist Raptor**


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Deathmist+Raptor)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deathmist+Raptor)
[Deathmist Raptor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deathmist+Raptor) is one of the many cards in *Dragons of Tarkir* that made waves in Standard, but its effect was limited to there. Day 1 undefeated and No. 19-ranked Andrew Cuneo as well as Tom Martell opened the mythic rare in their sealed pools and added them to their decks for value. With plenty of megamorph to go around, the odds of randomly getting a fallen Raptor back were pretty good, and certainly made itself known in Cuneo’s hand.


 


Not even [Flatten](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flatten) can keep a good Raptor down.

**#1 Mastery of the Unseen**


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Mastery+of+the+Unseen)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mastery+of+the+Unseen)
What is a *Fate Reforged* card doing on this list? While *Dragons of Tarkir* has taken the spotlight in both Draft and Sealed, the set that redefined the history of Tarkir continues to be a crux in Limited. [Citadel Siege](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Citadel+Siege) made its usual appearance in undefeated Sealed decklists for both Grand Prix Trials and Day 1 victors, and [Mastery of the Unseen](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mastery+of+the+Unseen) proved powerful in champion Christian Calcano’s hands. Using it to great advantage in all of his Top 8 matches, Calcano’s aggressive deck proved much more resilient with the millennia old enchantment in play.
