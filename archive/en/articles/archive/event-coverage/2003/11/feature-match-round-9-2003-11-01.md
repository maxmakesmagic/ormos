Gabriel Nassif has come a long way since being the "relatively unknown" player on underdog team Les Plus Class at Pro Tour New York a few years back, where he first made an impact on the tournament scene. Since then, he's had a great run on the Masters, Grand Prix and Pro Tour circuit, and has become one of Europe's most consistent finishers. His opponent, Felix Schneiders, is best known as a member of the German National Team that took down America in Sydney to win the championship.

### Game 1

Nassif mulliganed his opening hand. On turn two, Schneiders played [Damping Matrix](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Damping+Matrix), but Nassif countered it with [Force Spike](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Force+Spike). He then untapped, played [Talisman of Progress](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Talisman+of+Progress), and cast [Mana Severance](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Severance). Schneiders summoned [Metalworker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Metalworker), and Nassif played [Tinker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tinker). With three mana available, he was able to activate [Goblin Charbelcher](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Charbelcher) right away and win.

Jeff Cunningham, in another feature match- "Did you win?"

Nassif- "I got a decent draw."

### Game 2

This time, Schneiders mulliganed down to six. He opened with [Voltaic Key](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Voltaic+Key), and missed his second land drop. Despite casting [Brainstorm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brainstorm), Nassif missed his second land drop as well. Even a second [Brainstorm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brainstorm) didn't provide a land, and Nassif knew he would have to wait at least two turns to get a land. Eventually he found one, and in the meanwhile Schneiders was still stuck with just a [Shivan Reef](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shivan+Reef), and even had to discard [Grim Monolith](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grim+Monolith) on end step with a [Voltaic Key](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Voltaic+Key) out. Nassif cast [Mana Severance](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Severance), and had [Tinker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tinker) on the following turn to win the match.
