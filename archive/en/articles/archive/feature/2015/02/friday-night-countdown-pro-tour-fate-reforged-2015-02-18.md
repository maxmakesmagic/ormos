Take the lessons learned from the Pro Tour to your Friday Night *Magic*!


Rich Hagon and Brian David-Marshall recap the major developments from Pro Tour *Fate Reforged*, including the revamped Modern metagame following the bannings of [Birthing Pod](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Birthing+Pod), [Treasure Cruise](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treasure+Cruise), and [Dig Through Time](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dig+Through+Time). Rich and BDM also explore drafting *Fate Reforged* and how that one pack really changes a player's color choices, and conclude by honoring winner Antonio Del Moral Leon, the first Pro Tour champion from Spain.
