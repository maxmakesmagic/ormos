The Release Notes include information concerning the release of a new *Magic: The Gathering* set, as well as a collection of clarifications and rulings involving that set's cards. It's intended to make playing with the new cards more fun by clearing up the common misconceptions and confusion inevitably caused by new mechanics and interactions. As future sets are released, updates to the *Magic* rules may cause some of this information to become outdated. If you can't find the answer you're looking for here, please contact us at [Wizards.com/CustomerService](http://wizards.custhelp.com/).


The "General Notes" section includes release information and explains the mechanics and concepts in the set.


The "Card-Specific Notes" section contains answers to the most important, most common, and most confusing questions players might ask about cards in the set. Items in the "Card-Specific Notes" section include full card text for your reference. Not all cards in the set are listed.

**Card Face Updates**


The *Magic 2015 Core Set* introduces some improvements and updates to the appearance of cards and tokens.


These changes have no effect on gameplay.



* Some fields, such as the name and type line, feature a new font called Beleren.
* Rares and mythic rares include a holofoil stamp at the bottom of the card.
* The "below the text box" information, such as legal text and collector number, has been reorganized and set against a black background. The collector information now includes the set code and language, separated by a dot (for regular cards) or a star (for premium cards).
* The width of the black border around the card frame has been decreased.

**Guest Designer Cards and Design Credits**


Fourteen cards in the *Magic 2015 Core Set* were based on original designs from notable figures in the gaming industry. A fifteenth card, Waste Not, was the result of [You Make the Card 4,](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/feature/267ymtc) a feature on [DailyMTG.com](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles) that allowed members of the *Magic* community to design a card, one vote at a time. These fifteen cards include design credits at the bottom of their text boxes. These design credits have no effect on gameplay.

**Returning Keyword: Convoke**


The *Magic 2015 Core Set* features the return of convoke, originally seen in the *Ravnica: City of Guilds* set. Convoke is a static ability that lets you tap creatures you control to help pay for spells.


![](https://media.wizards.com/images/magic/tcg/products/m15/sf0JdVsk2/EN_pzk0jg8fdp.png)



Endless Obedience  
![](https://web.archive.org/web/20160830042801im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless4.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227195556im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/black.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227195556im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/black.gif)  

Sorcery  

Convoke **(Your creatures can help cast this spell. Each creature you tap while casting this spell pays for ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20211201201921im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless1.gif) or one mana of that creature's color.)**  

Put target creature card from a graveyard onto the battlefield under your control.



The official rules for convoke are as follows:


702.50. Convoke


702.50a Convoke is a static ability that functions while the spell with convoke is on the stack. "Convoke" means "For each colored mana in this spell's total cost, you may tap an untapped creature of that color you control rather than pay that mana. For each generic mana in this spell's total cost, you may tap an untapped creature you control rather than pay that mana." The convoke ability isn't an additional or alternative cost and applies only after the total cost of the spell with convoke is determined.


702.50b Multiple instances of convoke on the same spell are redundant.




* The rules for convoke have changed slightly since it last appeared in an expansion. Previously, convoke reduced the cost to cast a spell. Under current rules, you tap creatures at the same time you pay the spell's costs. Tapping a creature this way is simply another way to pay.
* Convoke doesn't change a spell's mana cost or converted mana cost. For example, the converted mana cost of Endless Obedience is 6 even if you tapped six creatures to cast it.
* When calculating a spell's total cost, include any alternative costs, additional costs, or anything else that increases or reduces the cost to cast the spell. Convoke applies after the total cost is calculated.
* Because convoke isn't an alternative cost, it can be used in conjunction with alternative costs.
* Tapping a multicolored creature using convoke will pay for ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20211201201921im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless1.gif) or one mana of your choice of any of that creature's colors.
* When using convoke to cast a spell with ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20160829100442im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/x.gif) in its mana cost, first choose the value for X. That choice, plus any cost increases or decreases, will determine the spell's total cost. Then you can tap creatures you control to help pay that cost. For example, if you cast [Chord of Calling](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chord+of+Calling) (a spell with convoke and mana cost ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20160829100442im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/x.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20220123123600im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/green.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20220123123600im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/green.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20220123123600im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/green.gif)) and choose X to be 3, the total cost is ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227130050im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless3.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20220123123600im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/green.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20220123123600im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/green.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20220123123600im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/green.gif). If you tap two green creatures and two red creatures, you'll have to pay ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20211201201921im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless1.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20220123123600im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/green.gif).
* If a creature you control has a mana ability with ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20170424152623im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/tap.gif) in the cost, activating that ability while casting a spell with convoke will result in the creature being tapped when you pay the spell's costs. You won't be able to tap it again for convoke. Similarly, if you sacrifice a creature to activate a mana ability while casting a spell with convoke, that creature won't be on the battlefield when you pay the spell's costs, so you won't be able to tap it for convoke.

**Returning Theme: Slivers**


The *Magic 2015 Core Set* includes several new Slivers, popular creatures that share abilities and power and toughness bonuses with other Slivers.


![](https://media.wizards.com/images/magic/tcg/products/m15/sf0JdVsk2/EN_yzkfbsc92q.png)



Belligerent Sliver  
![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161225105850im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless2.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227130159im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/red.gif)  

Creature — Sliver  

2/2  

Sliver creatures you control have "This creature can't be blocked except by two or more creatures."




* Slivers in this set affect only Sliver creatures you control. They don't grant bonuses to your opponents' Slivers. This is the same way Slivers from the *Magic 2014* core set worked, while Slivers in earlier sets granted bonuses to all Slivers.
* Abilities that Slivers grant, as well as power/toughness boosts, are cumulative. However, for some abilities, like indestructible and the ability granted by Belligerent Sliver, having more than one instance of the ability doesn't provide any additional benefit.
* If you change the creature type of a Sliver you control so it's no longer a Sliver, it will no longer be affected by its own ability. Its ability will continue to affect other Sliver creatures you control.

**Cycle: Souls**


Six creatures in the *Magic 2015 Core Set* represent protectors from different worlds throughout the Multiverse.


![](https://media.wizards.com/images/magic/tcg/products/m15/sf0JdVsk2/EN_ei4ywj6z07.png)



Soul of Zendikar  
![](https://web.archive.org/web/20160830042801im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless4.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20220123123600im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/green.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20220123123600im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/green.gif)  

Creature — Avatar  

6/6  

Reach  
![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227130050im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless3.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20220123123600im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/green.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20220123123600im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/green.gif): Put a 3/3 green Beast creature token onto the battlefield.  
![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227130050im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless3.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20220123123600im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/green.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20220123123600im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/green.gif), Exile Soul of Zendikar from your graveyard: Put a 3/3 green Beast creature token onto the battlefield.




* You can activate the last ability only if the Soul is in your graveyard.
* Exiling the Soul from your graveyard is part of the last ability's activation cost. A player can't remove the Soul in response to prevent you from activating the ability.

**Returning Cycle: Magus Staffs**


This set includes a cycle of artifacts, each aligned to a color, that allow you to gain life for casting spells of the appropriate color or having basic lands of the type associated with that color enter the battlefield.


![](https://media.wizards.com/images/magic/tcg/products/m15/sf0JdVsk2/EN_x2vx9248xo.png)



Staff of the Sun Magus  
![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227130050im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless3.gif)  

Artifact  

Whenever you cast a white spell or a Plains enters the battlefield under your control, you gain 1 life.




* Each of these artifacts cares about any land with the appropriate basic land type. For example, [Staff of the Sun Magus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Staff+of+the+Sun+Magus)'s ability triggers when any land with the subtype Plains enters the battlefield under your control, not just lands named Plains.
* Most nonbasic lands don't have basic land types, even if they produce colored mana. For example, [Caves of Koilos](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Caves+of+Koilos) is neither a Plains nor a Swamp. Having one enter the battlefield under your control won't cause [Staff of the Sun Magus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Staff+of+the+Sun+Magus)'s ability to trigger.
* If you cast a copy of a card that's a certain color, the appropriate Staff's ability will trigger. However, if you copy a spell on the stack without casting that copy, it will not.

**Returning Card Type: Planeswalkers**


A Planeswalker is a powerful ally that fights by your side. The rules for Planeswalkers have not changed with this release.


![](https://media.wizards.com/images/magic/tcg/products/m15/sf0JdVsk2/EN_huddvvv39d.png)



Jace, the Living Guildpact  
![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161225105850im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless2.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161115194122im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/blue.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161115194122im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/blue.gif)  

Planeswalker — Jace  

5  

+1: Look at the top two cards of your library. Put one of them into your graveyard.  

−3: Return another target nonland permanent to its owner's hand.  

−8: Each player shuffles his or her hand and graveyard into his or her library. You draw seven cards.




* Planeswalkers are permanents. You can cast one any time you could cast a sorcery. When your planeswalker spell resolves, it enters the battlefield under your control.
* If, at any time, you control more than one Planeswalker with the same subtype (the word after the dash on the card's type line, such as "Jace"), you choose one to remain on the battlefield and put the rest into their owners' graveyards. This is a state-based action known as the "Planeswalker uniqueness rule."
* Planeswalkers are not creatures. Spells and abilities that affect creatures won't affect them.
* Planeswalkers have loyalty. A Planeswalker enters the battlefield with a number of loyalty counters on it equal to the number printed in its lower right corner. Activating one of its abilities may cause it to gain or lose loyalty counters. Damage dealt to a Planeswalker causes that many loyalty counters to be removed from it. If it has no loyalty counters on it, it's put into its owner's graveyard as a state-based action.
* Planeswalkers each have a number of activated abilities called "loyalty abilities." You can activate a loyalty ability of a Planeswalker you control only at a time you could cast a sorcery and only if you haven't activated one of that Planeswalker's loyalty abilities yet during a given turn.
* The cost to activate a Planeswalker's loyalty ability is represented by a symbol with a number inside. Up-arrows contain positive numbers, such as "+1"; this means "Put one loyalty counter on this Planeswalker." Down-arrows contain negative numbers, such as "–8"; this means "Remove eight loyalty counters from this Planeswalker." A symbol with a "0" means "Put zero loyalty counters on this Planeswalker."
* Activating a loyalty ability with a cost of 0 will leave the number of loyalty counters on the Planeswalker unchanged.
* You can't activate a Planeswalker's ability with a negative loyalty cost unless the Planeswalker has at least that many loyalty counters on it.
* Planeswalkers can't attack (unless an effect turns the Planeswalker into a creature). However, they can be attacked. Each of your attacking creatures can attack your opponent or a Planeswalker that player controls. You specify which as you declare attackers.
* If a Planeswalker you control is being attacked, you can block the attacker(s) as normal.
* If a creature that's attacking a Planeswalker isn't blocked, it will deal its combat damage to that Planeswalker. Damage dealt to a Planeswalker causes that many loyalty counters to be removed from it.
* If a source you control would deal noncombat damage to an opponent, you may have that source deal that damage to a Planeswalker that opponent controls instead. For example, although you can't target a Planeswalker with Lightning Strike, you can target your opponent with Lightning Strike, and then as Lightning Strike resolves, choose to have it deal its 3 damage to one of your opponent's Planeswalkers. (You can't split up that damage between multiple players and/or Planeswalkers.) If you have Lightning Strike deal its damage to a Planeswalker, three loyalty counters will be removed from it.

**New Rules Term: "Base Power and Toughness"**


*Magic 2015 Core Set* introduces a templating change to cards that set a creature's power and toughness to a specific value.


![](https://media.wizards.com/images/magic/tcg/products/m15/sf0JdVsk2/EN_5s51p1ngni.png)



[Turn to Frog](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Turn+to+Frog) (old wording)  
![](https://web.archive.org/web/20211201201921im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless1.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161115194122im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/blue.gif)  

Instant  

Target creature loses all abilities and becomes a 1/1 blue Frog until end of turn.




[Turn to Frog](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Turn+to+Frog)  
![](https://web.archive.org/web/20211201201921im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless1.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161115194122im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/blue.gif)  

Instant  

Until end of turn, target creature loses all abilities and becomes a blue Frog with base power and toughness 1/1.




* The term "base power and toughness" makes it clearer that other continuous effects that modify power and toughness, such as the ones created by [Titanic Growth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Titanic+Growth) or a +1/+1 counter, apply after the creature's power and toughness are changed. Several older cards have received an updated wording in Oracle to reflect this update. This is not a functional change. Note that, with a few rare exceptions, this new template is not used on cards that have abilities that "animate" noncreature permanents, such as [Mutavault](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mutavault) and Nissa, Worldwaker.

CARD-SPECIFIC NOTES


![](https://media.wizards.com/images/magic/tcg/products/m15/sf0JdVsk2/EN_dcyje972ki.png)



Act on Impulse  
![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161225105850im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless2.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227130159im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/red.gif)  

Sorcery  

Exile the top three cards of your library. Until end of turn, you may play cards exiled this way. **(If you cast a spell this way, you still pay its costs. You can play a land this way only if you have an available land play remaining.)**




* The cards are exiled face up.
* Playing a card this way follows the normal rules for playing the card. You must pay its costs, and you must follow all applicable timing rules. For example, if one of the cards is a creature card, you can cast that card only during your main phase while the stack is empty.
* Under normal circumstances, you can play a land card exiled with Act on Impulse only if you haven't played a land yet that turn.
* Any cards you don't play will remain exiled.

Instant  

For each attacking creature, its owner puts it on the top or bottom of his or her library.




* The owner of each attacking creature chooses whether to put it on the top or bottom of his or her library. The active player (the player whose turn it is) makes all of his or her choices first, followed by each other player in turn order.
* If an effect puts two or more cards on the top or bottom of a library at the same time, the owner of those cards may arrange them in any order. That library's owner doesn't reveal the order in which the cards go into his or her library.

Aggressive Mining  
![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227130050im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless3.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227130159im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/red.gif)  

Enchantment  

You can't play lands.  

Sacrifice a land: Draw two cards. Activate this ability only once each turn.




* You can activate the ability once on each player's turn, not just your own.
* Aggressive Mining doesn't stop lands from being put onto the battlefield by a spell or ability. It only stops the special action of playing a land.

Ajani Steadfast  
![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227130050im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless3.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227125855im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/white.gif)  

Planeswalker — Ajani  

4  

+1: Until end of turn, up to one target creature gets +1/+1 and gains first strike, vigilance, and lifelink.  

−2: Put a +1/+1 counter on each creature you control and a loyalty counter on each other planeswalker you control.  

−7: You get an emblem with "If a source would deal damage to you or a planeswalker you control, prevent all but 1 of that damage."




* You may activate the first ability with no targets. If you do, you simply put a loyalty counter on Ajani to pay the cost of the ability.
* If a permanent you control is both a creature and a planeswalker, Ajani's second ability will put both a +1/+1 counter and a loyalty counter on it.
* The emblem's ability doesn't consider who controls the source dealing damage to you or a planeswalker you control.
* Each attacking creature is a separate source of damage. For example, if two 3/3 creatures attack you and are unblocked, the emblem will prevent 2 damage from each creature. You'll be dealt a total of 2 damage.
* If multiple effects modify how damage is dealt, the player being dealt damage or the controller of the permanent being dealt damage chooses the order to apply the effects. For example, [Dictate of the Twin Gods](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dictate+of+the+Twin+Gods) says, "If a source would deal damage to a permanent or player, it deals double that damage to that permanent or player instead." Suppose you would be dealt 3 damage while [Dictate of the Twin Gods](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dictate+of+the+Twin+Gods) is on the battlefield and you control Ajani's emblem. You can either (a) prevent all but 1 damage first and then let [Dictate of the Twin Gods](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dictate+of+the+Twin+Gods)'s effect double that, for a result of being dealt 2 damage, or (b) double the damage to 6 and then prevent all but 1 of that damage.

Ajani's Pridemate

Creature — Cat Soldier  

2/2  

Whenever you gain life, you may put a +1/+1 counter on Ajani's Pridemate.




* The ability triggers just once for each life-gaining event, whether it's 1 life from [Soulmender](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soulmender) or 8 life from Meditation Puzzle.
* A creature with lifelink dealing combat damage is a single life-gaining event. For example, if two creatures you control with lifelink deal combat damage at the same time, [Ajani's Pridemate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ajani%27s+Pridemate)'s ability will trigger twice. However, if a single creature you control with lifelink deals combat damage to multiple creatures, players, and/or planeswalkers at the same time (perhaps because it has trample or was blocked by more than one creature), the ability will trigger only once.

Creature — Human Berserker  

2/1  

Whenever a creature an opponent controls dies, Altac Bloodseeker gets +2/+0 and gains first strike and haste until end of turn. *(It deals combat damage before creatures without first strike, and it can attack and ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20170424152623im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/tap.gif) as soon as it comes under your control.)* 




* If a combat phase has two combat damage steps (because there's an attacker or blocker with first strike or double strike), Altac Bloodseeker may gain first strike during the first one. If this happens, it will assign combat damage in the second combat damage step along with other creatures that haven't assigned combat damage during that combat.
* If the ability triggers multiple times in a single turn, the power bonuses are cumulative, but the additional instances of first strike and haste are redundant.

* The possible color choices are white, blue, black, red, and green. You can't choose artifact, colorless, or any other word.
* For each activated ability, you choose the color as the ability resolves. However, the color of a source that would deal damage to the creature or player is checked only when it would deal that damage, not as Avacyn's ability resolves. For example, if you choose blue, damage a blue creature would deal is prevented, even if that creature wasn't blue (or wasn't on the battlefield) when Avacyn's ability resolved.
* Whether the target creature or player is still a legal target is no longer checked after the appropriate ability resolves. For example, if a creature targeted by the first ability gains protection from white after the ability resolves but before it prevents damage, the effect will still prevent damage.
* The second activated ability doesn't prevent damage that would be dealt to planeswalkers the target player controls. If that player is you, it can still prevent noncombat damage that your opponent would want to redirect from you to one of your planeswalkers. Just apply the ability's prevention effect to that damage first, and there won't be any damage to redirect.
* Both activated abilities prevent all damage of the chosen color, not just combat damage.
* Neither activated ability has any effect on damage that's already been dealt.

* Use the power of the enchanted creature as the activated ability resolves to determine how much damage is dealt. If the creature isn't on the battlefield at that time, use its power as it last existed on the battlefield. Note that this works differently than the fight keyword, which requires both creatures be on the battlefield for any damage to be dealt.
* The enchanted creature is the source of the activated ability, not Burning Anger. For example, if the enchanted creature is green, you could activate the ability choosing a creature with protection from red as the target.

Legendary Artifact  

At the beginning of your end step, if you didn't activate a loyalty ability of a planeswalker this turn, you lose 2 life.

* For the first ability, it doesn't matter whether the planeswalker is still on the battlefield as your end step begins. If you activated one of its loyalty abilities that turn, The Chain Veil's triggered ability won't trigger.
* Because the last ability modifies the rules of the game, it affects not only planeswalkers you control when it resolves, but also planeswalkers that come under your control later in the turn.
* After the last ability resolves, you'll essentially be able to activate a loyalty ability of each planeswalker you control a total of twice during your turn. The timing rules for when you can activate loyalty abilities apply each time; it must be your main phase and the stack must be empty.
* The second loyalty ability you activate doesn't have to be the same as the first ability. For example, you could activate a planeswalker's first ability twice, or you could activate a planeswalker's first ability, then activate its second ability.
* Each additional time The Chain Veil's last ability resolves will allow you to activate a loyalty ability of each planeswalker you control an additional time. For example, if you activate The Chain Veil's last ability, untap it, then activate it again, you can activate a loyalty ability of a planeswalker you control three times that turn.

Planeswalker — Chandra  

4  

+1: Chandra, Pyromaster deals 1 damage to target player and 1 damage to up to one target creature that player controls. That creature can't block this turn.  

0: Exile the top card of your library. You may play it this turn.  

−7: Exile the top ten cards of your library. Choose an instant or sorcery card exiled this way and copy it three times. You may cast the copies without paying their mana costs.




* To activate the first ability, you must target a player but you can choose to not target any creatures.
* If the first ability resolves but the damage is prevented or redirected, the target creature still won't be able to block that turn.
* The card exiled by the second ability is exiled face up. Playing it follows the normal rules for playing that card. You must pay its costs, and you must follow all applicable timing rules. For example, if it's a creature card, you can cast it only during your main phase while the stack is empty.
* If you exile a land card using the second ability, you may play that land only if you have an available land play. Normally, this means you can play the land only if you haven't played a land yet that turn.
* In the third ability, "exiled this way" means the cards you just exiled because of that ability resolving. Cards exiled with the second ability or with previous activations of the third ability don't count.
* While resolving the third ability, you create the copies of the card in exile and cast them from exile. You can cast zero, one, two, or all three copies. The card itself isn't cast. It remains exiled.
* While casting the copies created by the third ability, timing restrictions based on the card's type (such as creature or sorcery) are ignored. Other restrictions, such as "Cast [this spell] only during combat," are not.
* Because you're playing the copies "without paying their mana costs," you can't pay any alternative costs for the copies. You can, however, pay additional costs, such as kicker costs. If the copies have any mandatory additional costs, you must pay those.
* If the copied card has ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20160829100442im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/x.gif) in its mana cost, you must choose 0 as its value when casting the copies.

1/1  

Whenever you draw a card, put a +1/+1 counter on Chasm Skulker.  

When Chasm Skulker dies, put X 1/1 blue Squid creature tokens with islandwalk onto the battlefield, where X is the number of +1/+1 counters on Chasm Skulker. *(They can't be blocked as long as defending player controls an Island.)*




* If you draw multiple cards, the first ability will trigger that many times. Each of these abilities will cause a +1/+1 counter to be put on Chasm Skulker.
* If enough -1/-1 counters are put on Chasm Skulker at the same time to make its toughness 0 or less, the number of +1/+1 counters on it before it got any -1/-1 counters will be used to determine how many Squid tokens you get. For example, if there are two +1/+1 counters on Chasm Skulker and it gets three -1/-1 counters, you'll get two Squid tokens.

* Constricting Sliver gives Slivers you control an ability that causes a zone change with a duration, a newer style of ability that's somewhat reminiscent of older cards like [Oblivion Ring](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oblivion+Ring). However, unlike [Oblivion Ring](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oblivion+Ring)'s abilities, this ability creates two one-shot effects: one that exiles the creature when the ability resolves, and another that returns the exiled card to the battlefield immediately after the Sliver leaves the battlefield.
* When Constricting Sliver enters the battlefield, the ability it gives itself will trigger.
* The Sliver that enters the battlefield is the source of the ability that exiles the creature. For example, if a blue Sliver enters the battlefield under your control, the ability can target and exile a creature with protection from white.
* Auras attached to the exiled creature will be put into their owners' graveyards (unless they're *Theros*-block cards with the bestow ability). Equipment attached to the exiled creature will become unattached and remain on the battlefield. Any counters on the exiled creature will cease to exist.
* If a creature token is exiled, it ceases to exist. It won't be returned to the battlefield.
* If a Sliver leaves the battlefield before its enters-the-battlefield ability resolves, the target creature won't be exiled.
* If a Sliver you control leaves the battlefield, only the card that particular Sliver exiled will return to the battlefield. Each card exiled by another Sliver will remain exiled until that Sliver leaves the battlefield.
* The exiled card returns to the battlefield immediately after the Sliver leaves the battlefield. Nothing happens between the two events, including state-based actions. The two creatures aren't on the battlefield at the same time. For example, if the returning creature is a Mercurial Pretender, it can't enter the battlefield as a copy of the Sliver.
* The exiled card will return to the battlefield under its owner's control.
* The exiled card will return even if the Sliver whose ability exiled it doesn't have that ability at the time (perhaps because Constricting Sliver is no longer on the battlefield).
* In a multiplayer game, if the Sliver's owner leaves the game, the exiled card will return to the battlefield. Because the one-shot effect that returns the card isn't an ability that goes on the stack, it won't cease to exist along with the leaving player's spells and abilities on the stack.

Enchantment — Aura  

Enchant artifact  

Enchanted artifact is a creature with base power and toughness 5/5 in addition to its other types.




* The artifact retains any types, subtypes, or supertypes it has. Notably, if an Equipment becomes an artifact creature, it can't be attached to another creature. If it was attached to a creature, it becomes unattached.
* If the artifact was already a creature, its base power and toughness will each become 5. This overwrites any previous effects that set the creature's base power and toughness to specific values. Any power- or toughness-setting effects that start to apply after Ensoul Artifact becomes attached to the artifact will overwrite this effect.
* Effects that modify a creature's power and/or toughness, such as the ones created by [Titanic Growth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Titanic+Growth) or a +1/+1 counter, will apply to the creature no matter when they started to take effect. The same is true for any counters that change its power and/or toughness and effects that switch power and toughness.
* The resulting artifact creature will be able to attack on your turn if it's been under your control continuously since the turn began. That is, it doesn't matter how long it's been a creature, just how long it's been on the battlefield.

* Feast on the Fallen looks at the entire previous turn to determine whether its ability triggers or not. It doesn't matter whether Feast on the Fallen was on the battlefield when the opponent lost life.
* Feast on the Fallen checks only if an opponent lost life during the turn, not whether that player's life total decreased over the course of the turn. For example, if an opponent lost 2 life and then gained 8 life last turn, Feast on the Fallen's ability will trigger.
* Only one +1/+1 counter will be put on the target creature no matter how much life was lost.

Creature — Elemental Cat  

2/2  

When Frost Lynx enters the battlefield, tap target creature an opponent controls. That creature doesn't untap during its controller's next untap step.




* Frost Lynx's ability can target a creature that's already tapped. That creature still won't untap during its controller's next untap step.
* Frost Lynx's ability tracks the creature, not the creature's controller. That is, if the creature changes controllers before its first controller's next untap step, then it won't untap during its new controller's next untap step.
* If the creature isn't tapped during its controller's next untap step (perhaps because it was untapped by a spell), Frost Lynx's ability has no effect at that time. It won't try to keep the creature tapped on subsequent turns.

5  

+1: Destroy another target planeswalker.  

+1: Put a 3/3 black Beast creature token with deathtouch onto the battlefield.  

−3: Destroy target creature. You gain life equal to its toughness.  

−8: Target opponent gets an emblem with "Whenever a creature attacks you, it gets +5/+5 and gains trample until end of turn."




* The first ability can target and destroy a Garruk planeswalker controlled by another player.
* If you activate the third ability, and the target creature is an illegal target when the ability tries to resolve, it will be countered and none of its effects will happen. You won't gain any life.
* The emblem's ability won't trigger if a creature attacks a planeswalker.
* The emblem is owned and controlled by the target of the ability that created it. In a multiplayer game, if Garruk's owner leaves the game, the emblem does not.

When you cast Genesis Hydra, reveal the top X cards of your library. You may put a nonland permanent card with converted mana cost X or less from among them onto the battlefield. Then shuffle the rest into your library.  

Genesis Hydra enters the battlefield with X +1/+1 counters on it.




* Genesis Hydra's first ability will resolve before Genesis Hydra does. Notably, if you put an Aura card onto the battlefield this way, it can't enchant Genesis Hydra.
* If you put an Aura onto the battlefield this way, you choose what it enchants as it enters the battlefield. This doesn't target any permanent or player. For example, you could put an Aura onto the battlefield enchanting a creature with hexproof controlled by an opponent.

Then flip a coin. If you lose the flip, Goblin Kaboomist deals 2 damage to itself.

Creature — Goblin Warrior  

2/2  

Other Goblin creatures you control attack each turn if able.  

At the beginning of combat on your turn, put a 1/1 red Goblin creature token with haste onto the battlefield.  

Whenever Goblin Rabblemaster attacks, it gets +1/+0 until end of turn for each other attacking Goblin.




* Although Goblin Rabblemaster doesn't force itself to attack, if you control two of them, they'll force each other to attack if able.
* If, during your declare attackers step, a creature that must attack if able is tapped, is affected by a spell or ability that says it can't attack, or hasn't been under your control continuously since the turn began (and doesn't have haste), then it doesn't attack. If there's a cost associated with having a creature attack, you're not forced to pay that cost, so it doesn't have to attack in that case either.
* The number of attacking Goblins is counted as the last ability resolves, and the bonus is locked in at that time.

When Hoarding Dragon enters the battlefield, you may search your library for an artifact card, exile it, then shuffle your library.  

When Hoarding Dragon dies, you may put the exiled card into its owner's hand.




* The artifact card is exiled face up.
* [Hoarding Dragon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hoarding+Dragon)'s two abilities are linked. The second ability refers only to the card exiled by that [Hoarding Dragon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hoarding+Dragon)'s first ability. In other words, each Dragon has its own hoard.
* If [Hoarding Dragon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hoarding+Dragon) dies before its first ability resolves, its second ability will trigger and do nothing. Then its first ability will resolve. If you choose to exile an artifact card from your library, it will be exiled indefinitely.

Creature — Hippogriff  

2/1  

Flash *(You may cast this spell any time you could cast an instant.)*  

Flying  

Creatures entering the battlefield don't cause abilities to trigger.




* Triggered abilities use the word "when," "whenever," or "at." They're often written as "[Trigger condition], [effect]."
* Abilities that create replacement effects, such as a permanent entering the battlefield tapped or with counters on it, are unaffected.
* Abilities that apply "as [this creature] enters the battlefield," such as choosing a creature to copy with Mercurial Pretender, are also unaffected.
* Hushwing Gryff's ability stops a creature's own enters-the-battlefield triggered abilities as well as other triggered abilities that would trigger when a creature enters the battlefield.
* The trigger event doesn't have to specify "creatures" entering the battlefield. For example, [Amulet of Vigor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Amulet+of+Vigor) says "Whenever a permanent enters the battlefield tapped and under your control, untap it." If a creature enters the battlefield tapped and under your control, [Amulet of Vigor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Amulet+of+Vigor)'s ability would not trigger. If a land (that isn't also a creature) enters the battlefield tapped and under your control, [Amulet of Vigor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Amulet+of+Vigor)'s ability would trigger.
* Look at the permanent as it exists on the battlefield, taking into account continuous effects, to determine whether any triggered abilities will trigger. For example, if you control [March of the Machines](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=March+of+the+Machines), which says, in part, "Each noncreature artifact is an artifact creature," each artifact will be a creature at the time it enters the battlefield and will not cause triggered abilities to trigger.
* If Hushwing Gryff and another creature enter the battlefield at the same time, neither creature entering the battlefield will cause triggered abilities to trigger.

At the beginning of your upkeep, draw a card unless target opponent sacrifices a creature or pays 3 life.




* The opponent chooses whether he or she sacrifices a creature, pays 3 life, or allows you to draw a card. That player can't make an impossible choice, such as sacrificing a creature while he or she controls no creatures.
* If there are no legal targets to choose, perhaps because all your opponents have hexproof, the ability is removed from the stack with no effect. You won't draw a card. This is also true if the target opponent becomes an illegal target in response to the ability.

* Activated abilities are written in the form "Cost: Effect." Some keywords are activated abilities and will have colons in their reminder texts.
* A mana ability is an ability that (1) could put mana into a player's mana pool when it resolves, (2) isn't a loyalty ability, and (3) doesn't target.
* The copy will have the same targets as the ability it's copying unless you choose new ones. You may change any number of the targets, including all of them or none of them. If, for one of the targets, you can't choose a new legal target, then it remains unchanged (even if the current target is illegal).
* If the ability is modal (that is, it says "Choose one —" or the like), the copy will have the same mode. You can't choose a different one.
* If the ability has ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20160829100442im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/x.gif) in its cost, the value of X is copied.

Master of Predicaments  
![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227130050im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless3.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161115194122im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/blue.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161115194122im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/blue.gif)  

Creature — Sphinx  

4/4  

Flying  

Whenever Master of Predicaments deals combat damage to a player, choose a card in your hand. That player guesses whether the card's converted mana cost is greater than 4. If the player guessed wrong, you may cast the card without paying its mana cost.




* To choose a card in your hand, clearly separate it from the rest of your hand without revealing it.
* Although you may choose a land card in your hand, you won't be able to play it even if the player guessed wrong.
* If you don't cast the card, either because the player guessed right or because you choose not to cast it, you don't have to reveal it. Your opponent won't know the reason you didn't cast the card.
* If the card has ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20160829100442im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/x.gif) in its mana cost, X is 0.
* You cast the card in your hand as part of the resolution of the triggered ability. Timing restrictions based on the card's type (such as creature or sorcery) are ignored. Other restrictions, such as "Cast [this card] only during combat," are not.
* If you cast a card "without paying its mana cost," you can't pay any alternative costs. Notably, you can't cast a card with bestow as an Aura this way. You can, however, pay additional costs, such as kicker costs. If the card has any mandatory additional costs, you must pay those.
* If the card is a split card, it has two converted mana costs, one for each half. If both converted mana costs are greater than 4 or if both are not, the opponent must guess appropriately to be correct. If one converted mana cost is greater than 4 and one is not, guessing that the card's converted mana cost is greater than 4 is correct, and guessing that the card's converted mana cost isn't greater than 4 is wrong. If the player guesses wrong and you cast a split card this way, you may cast either half (or both halves if the card has fuse), no matter what its converted mana cost is.

Creature — Shapeshifter  

0/0  

You may have Mercurial Pretender enter the battlefield as a copy of any creature you control except it gains "![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161225105850im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless2.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161115194122im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/blue.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161115194122im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/blue.gif): Return this creature to its owner's hand."




* Mercurial Pretender's ability doesn't target the chosen creature.
* The activated ability Mercurial Pretender gives itself becomes part of its copiable values. Unless the ability is overwritten by another copy effect, a creature that's a copy of Mercurial Pretender will have that ability.
* Mercurial Pretender copies exactly what was printed on the original creature and nothing more (unless that creature is copying something else or is a token; see below). It doesn't copy whether that creature is tapped or untapped, whether it has any counters on it or Auras attached to it, or any non-copy effects that have changed its power, toughness, types, color, etc. For example, if Mercurial Pretender enters the battlefield as a copy of a Profane Memento with Ensoul Artifact attached to it, Mercurial Pretender will be a noncreature Profane Memento with Mercurial Pretender's added activated ability.
* If the chosen creature has ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20160829100442im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/x.gif) in its mana cost (such as Genesis Hydra), X is 0.
* If the chosen creature is copying something else (for example, if the chosen creature is another Mercurial Pretender), then Mercurial Pretender enters the battlefield as whatever the chosen creature is copying (plus any abilities it gained as part of the copying process, if applicable).
* If the chosen creature is a token, Mercurial Pretender copies the original characteristics of that token as stated by the effect that put the token onto the battlefield. Mercurial Pretender is not a token, even when copying one.
* Any enters-the-battlefield abilities of the copied creature will trigger when Mercurial Pretender enters the battlefield. Any "as [this creature] enters the battlefield" or "[this creature] enters the battlefield with" abilities of the chosen creature will also work.
* If Mercurial Pretender somehow enters the battlefield at the same time as another creature, Mercurial Pretender can't become a copy of that creature. You may only choose a creature that's already on the battlefield.
* You can choose not to copy anything. In that case, Mercurial Pretender enters the battlefield as a 0/0 Shapeshifter creature, and is probably put into the graveyard immediately.

Enchantment  

At the beginning of combat on your turn, if you control each creature on the battlefield with the greatest power, gain control of target creature an opponent controls until end of turn. Untap that creature. It gains haste until end of turn. *(It can attack and ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20170424152623im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/tap.gif) this turn.)*




* "Each creature on the battlefield with the greatest power" may be a single creature if each other creature has less power.
* The ability will trigger only if you control each creature on the battlefield with the greatest power as the beginning of combat step begins. If another player controls a creature with the greatest power or tied for the greatest power at that time, the ability won't trigger at all.
* The ability will check its condition again as it tries to resolve. If, at that time, another player controls a creature with the greatest power or tied for the greatest power, the ability won't do anything.
* The ability can target any creature an opponent controls, not just one that's tapped.
* Gaining control of a creature doesn't cause you to gain control of any Auras or Equipment attached to it.

+1: Target land you control becomes a 4/4 Elemental creature with trample. It's still a land.  

+1: Untap up to four target Forests.  

−7: Search your library for any number of basic land cards, put them onto the battlefield, then shuffle your library. Those lands become 4/4 Elemental creatures with trample. They're still lands.




* The type-changing effects of the first and third abilities don't have a duration. They last indefinitely.
* If the land targeted by the first ability entered the battlefield this turn, it won't be able to attack and its activated abilities with ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20170424152623im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/tap.gif) in the cost (including its mana ability) can't be activated (unless something gives it haste).

Flying, trample  

Whenever an opponent searches his or her library, that player sacrifices a creature and loses 10 life.  

Whenever another creature dies, put a +1/+1 counter on Ob Nixilis, Unshackled.




* Ob Nixilis's first triggered ability won't trigger if you search an opponent's library or if an opponent searches another player's library.
* If the opponent controls no creatures when the first triggered ability resolves, that player still loses 10 life.
* The first triggered ability won't be put on the stack until after the spell or ability causing the opponent to search his or her library finishes resolving. Notably, if that spell or ability causes any other abilities to trigger (for example, if the opponent searched for a creature card and put it onto the battlefield), those abilities and Ob Nixilis's triggered ability will go on the stack together. The active player puts all of his or her abilities on the stack in any order, then each other player in turn order does the same. The last ability put onto the stack this way will be the first to resolve, and so on.

Instant  

Until end of turn, each creature target player controls loses all abilities and becomes a blue Frog with base power and toughness 1/1.




* Creatures that enter the battlefield or come under the target player's control after Polymorphist's Jest resolves won't be affected.
* The creatures will lose all other colors and creature types, but they will retain any other card types (such as artifact) or supertypes (such as legendary) they may have.
* Polymorphist's Jest overwrites all previous effects that set the creatures' base power and toughness to specific values. Any power- or toughness-setting effects that start to apply after Polymorphist's Jest resolves will overwrite this effect.
* Polymorphist's Jest doesn't counter abilities that have already triggered or been activated. In particular, there is no way to cast this spell to stop a creature's ability that says "At the beginning of your upkeep," "When this creature enters the battlefield," or similar from triggering.
* If one of the affected creatures gains an ability after Polymorphist's Jest resolves, it will keep that ability.
* Effects that modify a creature's power and/or toughness, such as the effect of [Titanic Growth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Titanic+Growth), will apply to the creatures no matter when they started to take effect. The same is true for any counters that change their power and/or toughness and effects that switch power and toughness.
* If one of the *Theros*-block Gods is affected by Polymorphist's Jest, it will be a legendary 1/1 blue Frog enchantment creature with no abilities. If it stops being a creature, perhaps because your devotion to its color(s) decreased, it will be a legendary blue enchantment with no abilities. The way continuous effects work, the God's type-changing ability is applied before the effect that removes that ability is applied.

* Any abilities of the Soldier creature card that trigger "Whenever [this creature] attacks" won't trigger because the creature was never declared as an attacking creature.

Creature — Angel  

4/4  

Flying  

When Resolute Archangel enters the battlefield, if your life total is less than your starting life total, it becomes equal to your starting life total.




* Your starting life total is the life total you began the game with. For most two-player formats, this is 20. For Two-Headed Giant, it's the life total your team started with, usually 30. In Commander games, your starting life total is 40.
* If your life total is less than your starting life total, you actually gain the appropriate amount of life. Other effects that interact with lifegain will interact with Resolute Archangel's ability accordingly.

Artifact — Equipment  

If a source would deal damage to equipped creature, prevent X of that damage, where X is the number of creatures you control.

Equip only as a sorcery.)*




* To determine how much damage to prevent, use the number of creatures you control when damage would be dealt, including the equipped creature. Notably, if damage would be dealt to multiple creatures at the same time, you'll count the number of creatures you control before any of that damage is dealt.
* If multiple effects modify how damage is dealt, the player being dealt damage or the controller of the permanent being dealt damage chooses the order to apply the effects. For example, [Dictate of the Twin Gods](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dictate+of+the+Twin+Gods) says, "If a source would deal damage to a permanent or player, it deals double that damage to that permanent or player instead." Suppose the equipped creature would be dealt 3 damage while [Dictate of the Twin Gods](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dictate+of+the+Twin+Gods) is on the battlefield and you control two creatures. You can either (a) prevent 2 damage first and then let [Dictate of the Twin Gods](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dictate+of+the+Twin+Gods)'s effect apply, for a result of the equipped creature being dealt 2 damage, or (b) double the damage to 6 and then prevent 2 damage, for a result of the creature being dealt 4 damage.

Until end of turn, target creature loses all abilities and becomes a blue Frog with base power and toughness 1/1.

* [Turn to Frog](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Turn+to+Frog) overwrites all previous effects that set the creature's base power and toughness to specific values. Any power- or toughness-setting effects that start to apply after [Turn to Frog](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Turn+to+Frog) resolves will overwrite this effect.
* [Turn to Frog](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Turn+to+Frog) doesn't counter abilities that have already triggered or been activated. In particular, there is no way to cast this spell to stop a creature's ability that says "At the beginning of your upkeep," "When this creature enters the battlefield," or similar from triggering.
* If the affected creature gains an ability after [Turn to Frog](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Turn+to+Frog) resolves, it will keep that ability.
* Effects that modify a creature's power and/or toughness, such as the effect of [Titanic Growth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Titanic+Growth), will apply to the creature no matter when they started to take effect. The same is true for any counters that change its power and/or toughness and effects that switch its power and toughness.
* If one of the *Theros*-block Gods is affected by [Turn to Frog](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Turn+to+Frog), it will be a legendary 1/1 blue Frog enchantment creature with no abilities. If it stops being a creature, perhaps because your devotion to its color(s) decreased, it will be a legendary blue enchantment with no abilities. The way continuous effects work, the God's type-changing ability is applied before the effect that removes that ability is applied.

* If Undergrowth Scavenger enters the battlefield from a graveyard, it will count itself when determining how many +1/+1 counters it enters with.

Urborg, Tomb of Yawgmoth  

Legendary Land  

Each land is a Swamp in addition to its other land types.




* [Urborg, Tomb of Yawgmoth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Urborg%2C+Tomb+of+Yawgmoth) isn't a Swamp while it's not on the battlefield.
* Urborg's ability causes each land on the battlefield to have the land type Swamp. Each land thus has the ability "![](https://web.archive.org/web/20170424152623im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/tap.gif): Add ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227195556im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/black.gif) to your mana pool." Nothing else changes about those lands, including their names, other subtypes, other abilities, and whether they're legendary or basic.
* If Urborg loses its abilities (for example, if it becomes a creature and then [Turn to Frog](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Turn+to+Frog) targets it), all lands on the battlefield, including Urborg, will still be Swamps, but Urborg won't have the ability "Each land is a Swamp in addition to its other land types." Urborg also won't be able to tap to produce ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227195556im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/black.gif), but other lands (including those that enter the battlefield later in the turn) will. The way continuous effects work, Urborg's type-changing ability is applied before the effect that removes both the type-changing ability and its own mana ability.

Verdant Haven

Enchantment — Aura  

Enchant land  

When Verdant Haven enters the battlefield, you gain 2 life.  

Whenever enchanted land is tapped for mana, its controller adds one mana of any color to his or her mana pool *(in addition to the mana the land produces)*.




* If the land targeted by [Verdant Haven](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Verdant+Haven) is an illegal target when [Verdan Haven](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Verdan+Haven) tries to resolve, [Verdant Haven](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Verdant+Haven) will be countered. It won't enter the battlefield and its enters-the-battlefield ability won't trigger.

Creature — Wall  

0/4  

Defender *(This creature can't attack.)*  

Whenever Wall of Essence is dealt combat damage, you gain that much life.




* [Wall of Essence](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wall+of+Essence)'s triggered ability will trigger even if it's dealt lethal damage. For example, if it's dealt 7 combat damage, its ability will trigger and you'll gain 7 life.

Creature — Wall  

0/7  

Defender *(This creature can't attack.)*  

Whenever Wall of Frost blocks a creature, that creature doesn't untap during its controller's next untap step.




* [Wall of Frost](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wall+of+Frost)'s ability tracks the creature, not the creature's controller. That is, if the creature changes controllers before its first controller's next untap step, then it won't untap during its new controller's next untap step.
* If the creature isn't tapped during its controller's next untap step (perhaps because it was untapped by a spell), [Wall of Frost](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wall+of+Frost)'s ability has no effect at that time. It won't try to keep the creature tapped on subsequent turns.

Creature — Zombie Wall  

0/3  

Defender *(This creature can't attack.)*  

Whenever you gain life, put a +1/+1 counter on Wall of Limbs.  
![](https://web.archive.org/web/20170413132456im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless5.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227195556im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/black.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227195556im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/black.gif), Sacrifice Wall of Limbs: Target player loses X life, where X is Wall of Limbs's power.




* The ability triggers just once for each life-gaining event, whether it's 1 life from [Soulmender](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soulmender) or 8 life from Meditation Puzzle.
* Use Wall of Limbs's power as it last existed on the battlefield, including any +1/+1 counters it had, to determine the value of X.
* If you gain life at the same time Wall of Limbs is dealt lethal damage (probably because you control a blocking creature with lifelink), Wall of Limbs's triggered ability will trigger, but Wall of Limbs will be destroyed before the ability resolves.

* Warden of the Beyond can't get more than +2/+2 from its last ability, no matter how many opponents own a card in exile or how many exiled cards they own.

* If Yisan isn't on the battlefield when its ability resolves, use the number of verse counters on it when it left the battlefield to determine which creature cards may be put onto the battlefield. This number will include the counter you put on Yisan to activate the ability.
