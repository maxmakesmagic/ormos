Meet Magic2
===========



Our savviest of Twitch followers may have noticed a small modification to the schedule on our *Magic* Twitch Channel:



![](https://media.wizards.com/2015/images/daily/magic2_twitch_red.jpg)



Frequent viewers of *Magic* on Twitch may recall occasional overlaps between Grand Prix taking place on the same weekend. Typically, this was handled by the first event to start being hosted on the official *Magic* Twitch channel, and then the other event would begin on [GGsLive](http://www.GGsLive.com/), and then move over to the official *Magic* Twitch channel after the first event wrapped up for the day.



This was far from an optimal experience for many reasons:



* It inconveniences the viewers, since they have to switch over to a different channel partway through the day.
* It inconveniences followers of past broadcasts on Twitch, since part of a day of content may be relegated to a less-frequently used Twitch channel rather than on the official *Magic* channel.
* It inconveniences the video crew, since they have to shut the stream down and start up on a new channel in the middle of a day.
* With a packed schedule of events in 2015, the risk of overlapping events is larger than ever.


We saw that a second home for *Magic* on Twitch was necessary, and thus we've created [www.Twitch.TV/Magic2](http://www.twitch.tv/Magic2/)! As *Magic*'s second home for Twitch content, Magic2 will provide multi-event weekends with a permanent home on either the original *Magic* Twitch channel or on Magic2. No more preemptive pausing of a day's stream to shift over. Catch the entire broadcast for an event on one of two channels, along with the entirety of an event's past broadcast all on one channel.



Magic2 is making its premiere this weekend with [Grand Prix Vancouver](http://magic.wizards.com/en/content/fact-sheet-grand-prix-memphis-2015), which starts two hours after video coverage for [Grand Prix Memphis](http://magic.wizards.com/en/content/fact-sheet-grand-prix-vancouver-2015) begins.



Looking to watch some Standard? Tune in to Grand Prix Memphis coverage. What if you want a quick Modern fix between rounds of GP Memphis, or vice versa? Catch every moment of Modern that you can handle from GP Vancouver on Magic2. Coverage of Grand Prix Memphis starts Saturday at 1 p.m. local time (CT)/11 a.m. PT/2 p.m. ET/7 p.m. GMT on [Twitch.TV/Magic](http://www.twitch.tv/magic), while coverage of Grand Prix Vancouver will be on [Twitch.TV/Magic2](http://www.twitch.tv/magic2) starting Saturday at 1 p.m. local time (PT)/4 p.m. ET/9 p.m. GMT.



On that note, we've got two days and two events packed with tons of *Magic* from two different formats. Don't miss a second of *Magic* this weekend by following [Twitch.TV/Magic](http://www.twitch.tv/magic) and [Twitch.TV/Magic2](http://www.twitch.tv/magic2), and we'll see you tuned in this weekend!

Last Call for Pro Tour Prospects!
=================================



The Pro Tour Qualifier (PTQ) season for [Pro Tour *Dragons of Tarkir*](http://magic.wizards.com/en/content/pro-tour-dragons-tarkir-event-information) is nearing its end. For almost everyone, this will be your final chance to qualify for the Pro Tour in Brussels, Belgium, April 10–12, so bring your best Standard deck to a [PTQ near you](http://magic.wizards.com/content/eventsscheduleprotourqualifiers) and show your opponents what you've got!



And if you're looking for a chance to compete at Pro Tour *Magic Origins*, this is also the last weekend for you to win a [Preliminary Pro Tour Qualifier (PPTQ)](http://magic.wizards.com/en/protour/preliminaryqualifiers) that will qualify you for the round of [Regional Pro Tour Qualifiers (RPTQs)](http://magic.wizards.com/en/protour/regionalqualifiers) taking place April 25–26. The top finishers for an RPTQ receive a travel award and an invitation to compete in Pro Tour *Magic Origins*, taking place July 31–August 2 in Vancouver later this year.



Of course, if you miss out on your RPTQ invitation, you'll still have a chance to qualify at one of the Grand Prix taking place between March and the end of May. We'll take a closer look at those opportunities next week, but for now, this weekend is PTQ time for many, so find one near you and best of luck!

The Flashback
=============



Last weekend featured the first Standard Grand Prix since the release of *Fate Reforged*. Grand Prix Seville hosted 799 players who were ready to take on the new world of Standard. And while the Top 8 featured some notable players adding to their already strong reputations, it was Immanuel Gerschenson of Austria who was standing tall at the end of the event, courtesy of his Blue-Black Control deck.



Gerschenson had already earned Grand Prix gold just a few short months ago at Grand Prix Madrid, making this not only the Austrian's second Grand Prix title, but the second one to come from a Spanish Grand Prix.



Full coverage can be found [here](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/gpsev15), but let's check out some highlights:



[Meet Antonio Del Moral León](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/gpsev15/meet-antonio-del-moral-leon-2015-02-15)—Coverage reporter and Hall of Famer Frank Karsten sat down to speak with Pro Tour *Fate Reforged* champion Antonio Del Moral León to learn more about the recent Pro Tour winner, and what being Spain's first PT champion meant to him.



[Single-Card Spotlight: Whisperwood Elemental](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/gpsev15/single-card-spotlight-whisperwood-elemental-2015-02-15)—Frank Karsten also did a little spotlighting on a breakout success story from *Fate Reforged*: [Whisperwood Elemental](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Whisperwood+Elemental). Why was the new Elemental so monumental in the decks that made use of it?



[Decklists: Place 9 to 90](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/gpsev15/decklists-9-90)—While Karsten was story-scouting throughout the weekend, reporter Tobi Henke rolled up his sleeves, worked out a sorting method, and tackled over half of the decklists seen in Day Two of Grand Prix Seville. If you are looking for Standard decklists, then look no further, because the GP Seville coverage team is happy to provide!
