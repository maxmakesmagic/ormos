Blake is the content manager for DailyMTG.com, making him the one you should email if you have thoughts on the website, good or less good (or not good). He's a longtime coverage reporter and hasn't turned down a game of Magic in any format ever. 






So you've been playing at your store, working your way toward the Store Championship. You've battled with Temur Energy, crossed [Approach of the Second Sun](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Approach+of+the+Second+Sun)/[Sunbird's Invocation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sunbird%27s+Invocation) off your bucket list, and even tried that weird Merfolk deck one crazy weekend. You've earned your shot at the title of Store Champion.


But that title—while tantalizing—is only part of the prize. Today, I'm going to show you the rest of it.


First up is a little something you might have already seen—a Champion playmat with the full map of Ixalan on it! This goes only to the big winner.

Next up are deck boxes for the Top 8, featuring new art from *Rivals of Ixalan*:

And, finally, the part you all actually came here to see, is the full-art card from *Rivals of Ixalan* you can receive just for participating—and it's a freakin' Elder Dinosaur. World, meet Ghalta, Primal Hunger.

If you're not sure what's going on with your Store Championship, check with [your local store](http://locator.wizards.com/) for how you can qualify and what day of the final week in December the event will be held.
