- **[Sunday, 5 p.m.](http://webcast2.wizards.com/podcasts/07valencia/PTValencia_Sunday_1.mp3): A Little Bit of R&D (14.8 MB mp3)**
In this bonus Sunday show, we bring you the early news from the front as the remaining 69 players battle for the 8 slots on this afternoon's webcast. Then we bring you exclusive chat with Head Developer Mr. Devin Low, and we talk all good things *Lorwyn*, and scandalously fail to coerce him into revealing the secrets of his bank account, success, or Shadowmoor. Pity.

- **[Saturday, 9:38 p.m.](http://webcast2.wizards.com/podcasts/07valencia/PTValencia_Saturday_4.mp3): Sundering to Sunday (15.8 MB mp3)**
We open our last show of the day with a series of interviews that contain something for everyone, including an absolute masterclass in deckbuilding and testing procedures from Satanic Sligh and Panda Connection designer Oyvind Andersen. Then it's down to the Feature Match area for an all-American clash of the Titans -- not just Zac Hill and Gabriel Schwartz, but Sundering Titans all over the place. And you wondered why Isamaru wasn't doing the business??? 

- **[Saturday, 5:22 p.m.](http://webcast2.wizards.com/podcasts/07valencia/PTValencia_Saturday_3.mp3): Making The Right Choices (12.9 MB mp3)**
When you're a player and you get the call wrong, maybe you lose the game. When you're a judge, you've got backup. This weekend that backup takes the form of not only dozens of colleagues with worldwide experience, but ultimately the head judge himself, Jaap Brouwer. In this exclusive show, we get to follow Jaap every step of the way through Round 5, as he's faced with a mighty mixture of incompetence, dissembling, linguistic contortions, slow play, sloppy play, and a tournament-ending disqualification for two unfortunate competitors. It's all in a round's work, and it's all just a click away! 

- **[Saturday, 2:45 p.m.](http://webcast2.wizards.com/podcasts/07valencia/PTValencia_Saturday_2.mp3): 5 x 3 (21.8 MB mp3)**
We've reached Round 3 here at Pro Tour Valencia, and the metagame is beginning to shape up. We bring you the full story of five outstanding matchups from the top tables. Eugene Harvey, Klaus Joens, David Brucker, Rogier Maaten and Zac Hill attempt to make it three wins from three, and we put you right there at the tables that matter. 

- **[Saturday, 11:58 a.m.](http://webcast2.wizards.com/podcasts/07valencia/PTValencia_Saturday_1.mp3): The Metagame Runaround (12.1 MB mp3)**
On Thursday night, perhaps as many as 100 players were undecided on which deck to play to outsmart the Metagame. Perhaps 100 more changed their minds through the waiting game of Friday. Join us in the Pro Lounge as we find out which 75 cards are coming out to play, and which are deemed too dangerous to see the light of day. The big names, here on magicthegathering.com, as the PT that almost never was gets under way.

- **[Friday, 8:07 p.m.](http://webcast2.wizards.com/podcasts/07valencia/PTValencia_Friday_1.mp3): Thursday Preview, Friday Review (12.7 MB mp3)**
What seemed like a normal Thursday preview show turned into something different once the rain started. Rich Hagon takes you through early metagame speculation and an inside look at the postponement of Day One due to flooding at the event site.
