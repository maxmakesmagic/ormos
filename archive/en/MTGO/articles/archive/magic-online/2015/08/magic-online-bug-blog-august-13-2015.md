**Newly Added Known Issues as of Thursday, August 13** 


**Game Play**



* Duel Scene | Creatures that enter the battlefield with counters based on the number of creatures in the graveyard (for example, [Undergrowth Scavenger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Undergrowth+Scavenger)) do not count themselves if they are put onto the battlefield directly from the graveyard.
* Duel Scene | [Oracle of Mul Daya](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oracle+of+Mul+Daya) reveals one too many cards from the top of the library after casting [Genesis Wave](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Genesis+Wave) or similar spells.
* Duel Scene | Casting [Sylvan Primordeal](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sylvan+Primordeal) causes the game to be locked in a multiplayer game if there are no legal targets for one player.
* Duel Scene | [Knight of the Reliquary](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Knight+of+the+Reliquary) incorrectly allows the player to sacrifice any permanent when activating its ability.


**Client**



* Cardset | The promo version of [Mizzium Meddler](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mizzium+Meddler) made its way to *Magic Online* without a set symbol. The set symbol will be added with the launch of *Battle for Zendikar*.
* Trade | Attempting to add more copies of a card than are in a player's collection directly from the Search Tool can cause a crash.

**Fixes Deployed During the Wednesday, August 5, *Magic Online* Client Update**


**Card Grants**


When Season 9 Promos were granted, it came to our attention that there was a miscommunication regarding which version of the [Path to Exile](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Path+to+Exile) promo was being awarded to players as part of the [*Magic Online* Player Rewards](http://magic.wizards.com/en/content/2015-magic-online-player-rewards) program. We advertised one promo on the website and granted another during the Wednesday, July 29, downtime.


We apologize for this error in communication and would like to make it up to players by giving everyone who qualified for last month's MOPR reward the [Path to Exile](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Path+to+Exile) promo that was advertised on [MTGO.com](http://magic.wizards.com/en/game-info/products/magic-online) in addition to the version they already received during the Wednesday, July 29, downtime. The advertised version of [Path to Exile](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Path+to+Exile) should now be granted to qualified accounts. Thank you for your understanding!

Temporary Workarounds for Known Issues
======================================



We're hard at work whittling down the Known Issues List. In the meantime, we've found temporary solutions that may help alleviate certain problems that players are experiencing. Refer to the table below to see if there is a suggested temporary workaround for an issue that you are experiencing.


**Game Play**




|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Issue Description | Temporary Workaround |
| Duel Scene | [Restore Balance](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Restore+Balance) will sometimes dim your hand and stall *Magic Online*. | If you encounter this issue, pressing F6 will continue the game. |
| Cardset | If a shield effect (examples include from a [Circle of Protection](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Circle+of+Protection) or [Deflecting Palm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deflecting+Palm)) is given to a creature during the declare blockers step, it will crash the game. 
 | Restarting the client will allow you to continue the game. |
| General | [Umezawa's Jitte](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Umezawa%27s+Jitte) counters are obscured by the equipped creature.
  | Players can use card zoom or the preview pane to determine the number of counters.
  |

**Client**




|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Issue Description | Temporary Workaround |
| General | Players can experience memory leaks in some situations.
  | Restarting the client can temporarily resolve these issues. |
| Collection | Dragging or adding a large number of cards to a deck or trade binder causes *Magic Online* to freeze while processing, resulting in a "Main Navigation is Not Responding" error.
  | While the client is not responsive, waiting several minutes will allow the process to complete. Using the error dialog to close the client will cancel the transaction. |
| Collection | Sorting by converted mana cost does not work correctly the first time it is attempted in a new deck or binder. 
 | Attempting to sort by converted mana cost a second time will fix the issue. |
| Duel Scene | Land can visually appear tapped at the start of a turn if a player unmorphs a creature during their opponent's end step.
  | The issue is visual only and clicking the tapped lands will add mana to the mana pool correctly. |
| Sideboard Issues:
 
 Duel Scene | Black game screen after sideboarding.  | These issues seem to be tied to the player's computer going to sleep during deckbuilding. Making it so that your computer does not go into hibernation may alleviate these issues if you're experiencing them.
  |
| Store | Updating billing and shipping information during the checkout process can have inconsistent results.
  | Players who update from the Account Settings page should not have issues.
  |
| Trade | If you open a booster pack that is in your active trade binder, attempting to trade a different booster pack from the same set cancels the trade.
  | Logging out and then back in will correct this issue.
 |

**Server**




|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Issue Description | Temporary Workaround |
| Duel Scene | Both players show as waiting for opponent, one player times out. | If you suspect this is happening to you, logging out and back in may resolve the problem. |

Known Issues List
=================



The following are a list of known issues on *Magic Online*. Our goal with the known issues list is to give players insight into what we're working on, as well as helping players avoid problematic bugs and performance issues.


Please note, this is not a comprehensive list of known issues, simply the ones that we feel players are most likely to encounter. These issues are also not sorted in any particular order, aside from their category. While the list below is not sorted by priority or projected fix date, bugs and performance issues listed as "scheduled" have a scheduled fix in the near future—this status is subject to change.
