The Daily *Magic* Update is a roundup of everything *Magic* you should know on September 6, 2017. Today's Update is brought to you by [*Magic: The Gathering Arena*](https://twitter.com/wizards_magic/status/904826409616539648), which you can get a first look at tomorrow at 1 p.m. PT/4 p.m. ET/8 p.m. UTC.


Today's Previews
================


1. [Professor's Proudest Preview! Exclusive *Ixalan* Preview Cards for *Magic: The Gathering*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYFyfGTvU4g&feature=youtu.be) | Tolarian Community College | The Professor

While that was not actually my voice, that was an accurate representation of most of my interactions with Prof. One of us usually walks away in tears.


The above might not be true, but the fact that I was going to give Prof Kopala was actually true. Best laid plans, and all that.

The turn-two 2/3 Storm Fleet Aerialist is a dream I'm going to chase down many a bad deck.


1. [Exclu : Nouvelle carte *Magic: The Gathering* – Marcheciel Portée par le Crépuscule](http://www.jeuxvideo.com/news/706256/exclu-nouvelle-carte-magic-the-gathering-marcheciel-portee-par-le-crepuscule.htm) | Jeuxvideo

I don't speak French, but [this person clearly does](https://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/6yeoko/dusksomething_skywalker_vampire_white_onedrop/dmmrvin/). Wait, no, not that person. [This person](https://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/6yeoko/dusksomething_skywalker_vampire_white_onedrop/dmmrt35/).


Note that the English name is Duskborne Skymarcher.


1. [Spell Pierce *Ixalan* Preview and Top 8 Perma-Banned Cards](https://collected.company/2017/09/06/spell-pierce-ixalan-preview-top-8-perma-banned-cards-146/) | Masters of Modern | Alex Kessler and Ben Bateman

Everyone loves a reprint, and this one is especially powerful for blue tempo and control decks.


After Those, Read, Watch, or Listen to These
============================================


1. [*Ixalan* Worldbuilding Panel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWDkvRSkF00&feature=youtu.be)

If you missed the PAX West panel on *Ixalan*, you can stop frantically searching the internet! It's right here!

1. [*Ixalan* Commander Review, Part I](https://www.hipstersofthecoast.com/2017/09/ixalan-commander-review-part/) | Hipsters of the Coast | Levi Byrne

With so many legends already previewed, it's not too early to start rubbing your hands together gleefully over some of the commanders you could choose to lead your next deck.


1. [How *Ixalan*'s Tribes Will Impact Standard](http://magic.tcgplayer.com/db/article.asp?ID=14148&writer=Seth+Manfield&articledate=9-6-2017) | TCGplayer | Seth Manfield

Tribe-by-tribe and card-by-card, Manfield covers how *Ixalan*'s four factions are likely to find their way into Standard. But you probably could have figured that out from the title. Sometimes you don't need me all that much.


What People Are Talking About
=============================

Finally, my [Pangosaur](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pangosaur) deck gets the upgrade it so sorely needed! Also, Deathmist Raptor will be a Dinosaur Beast; its bestial nature was left off that chart by mistake.


1. [The Story Spotlights of *Ixalan* (So Far…)](https://vorthosjay.tumblr.com/post/165015262976/the-story-spotlights-of-ixalan-so-far-the) | Archive Trap Mini | Jay Annelli

Today is [the first *Magic* Story of the *Ixalan* block](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/magic-story/jace-alone-2017-09-06), but Jay has already been hard at work compiling the story from cards that have been previewed thus far. Four of five Story Spotlight cards have been revealed, so he's got a bit to work with.


Decks of the Day
================


1. [Updating Standard's Best Decks for *Ixalan*](http://www.starcitygames.com/article/35769_Updating-Standards-Best-Decks-For-Ixalan.html) | StarCityGames.com | Pete Ingram

This one's a bit of a cheat, as it's actually several decks, but finding Standard decks with *Ixalan* incorporated is a bit of a challenge at this point. Ingram has *four* such decks—Blue-Black Control, Black-Green Energy, Ramunap Red, and Mardu Vehicles. All of these decks survive the rotation mostly intact, but Ingram has some ideas on how to make them whole again once *Ixalan* releases.
