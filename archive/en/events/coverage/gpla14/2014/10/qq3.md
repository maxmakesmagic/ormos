**What is the best way to beat Jeskai Wins?**



With [Mantis Rider](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mantis+Rider) as one of the breakout cards at the Pro Tour last weekend, the question of how to beat Jeskai Wins has been on many player’s minds.

***(5) Ivan Floch** - [Prognostic Sphinx](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Prognostic+Sphinx) and a lot of removal and countermagic. So either my U/B Control deck from the Pro Tour or Jeskai Wins with [Prognostic Sphinx](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Prognostic+Sphinx).*

***Alexander Hayne**  - The best way to beat them is to join them. The deck is so customizable that you can build a Jeskai deck that is tuned for the mirror match.*

***Brad Nelson**  - [Hordeling Outburst](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hordeling+Outburst), not even close. During testing, I found that Jeskai has a really hard time to get rid of the tokens because all of their burn spells go one-for-one. Combining [Hordeling Outburst](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hordeling+Outburst) with removal spells for their first four threats is a great path to victory.*

***Matt Sperling**  - [Sorin, Solemn Visitor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sorin%2C+Solemn+Visitor) may be even more important than [Siege Rhino](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Siege+Rhino) because people are moving towards [Nullify](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nullify) and [Hushwing Gryff](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hushwing+Gryff). Sorin, especially in combination with cheap creature like [Fleecemane Lion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fleecemane+Lion), will make sure you won't be burned out.* 









![](https://media.wizards.com/2014/events/gpla14/QQ2%20Martin%20Juza.JPG)

***Martin Juza**  - Curve out with turn-two [Bile Blight](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bile+Blight), turn-three [Courser of Kruphix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Courser+of+Kruphix), turn-four [Siege Rhino](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Siege+Rhino), and turn-five [Wingmate Roc](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wingmate+Roc). That's what you have to do. Expensive Planeswalkers like Elspeth, Ajani, or Nissa are not the answer.* 




![](https://media.wizards.com/2014/events/gpla14/QQ2%20Josh%20Mcclain.JPG)

***Josh Mcclain**  - There is no deck that just wrecks Jeskai because it's a pro-active strategy that is hard to disrupt, but [Siege Rhino](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Siege+Rhino) is very good against them. The fact that people have to play [Hushwing Gryff](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hushwing+Gryff) is a clear indication that Rhino is the best.*
