Topical Blend #2a - Celebrating Larry
=====================================

Mark likes to invent conversations that happened at Wizards, so here goes:


\*\*phone rings\*\*


**JMS**: Hello?


**Scott Johns (*magicthegathering.com's* producer)**: Hey JMS, it's Scott. We're going to do Swap Week as a theme week on the site, where each of the columnists on a day writes the other guy's column.


**JMS**: Okay...


**Scott**: That means you'll need to break off in the middle of [your last preconstructed deck evolution](/en/articles/archive/building-budget/charge-boros-concerted-stubbornness-2006-03-06) to write Making Magic on March 13th. Awesome, huh?


**JMS**: ...


**Scott**: Are you thrilled?


**JMS**: Um. No.


**Scott**: What?!? Why not? You get arguably the sweetest assignment of all ten week-day writers!


**JMS**: But, Scott... *I don't make Magic*.


**Scott**: Oh. Well, you're a creative guy. You'll think of something.


**JMS**: But...


**Scott**: Gotta go! Gottlieb just ran by naked! Oh God, he's coming back! Hide, everyone! Get dow--


\*\*click\*\*


So here I am. As I've said in previous articles, some of the writers on this site are Wizards of the Coast “insiders.” They work in Renton, creating the game we all love. Others won some sort of writing lottery in order to discuss **Magic** on a weekly basis. I'm one of the lottery guys. I've visited WotC's offices three times, and although I do work on [names and flavor text](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/feature/288) as a contractor, my insights into **Magic** Design are few.


Luckily, Mark uses a number of gimmicks in his column that I can borrow for a day. One of my favorites is Topical Blend, where Mark lets you decide what two topics he's going to squish together into a day's worth of tasty reading. The [first time out](/en/articles/archive/making-magic/topical-blend-1-%E2%80%93-err-human-2006-01-02), he talked Design Mistakes and Girls. [Last time](/en/articles/archive/making-magic/topical-blend-2-2005-12-12), he tackled a Sixth Color of **Magic** and the fact that he's crazy. That second article also left me these handy poll results:

Now, if I'm going by sheer number of votes, I should be discussing “What happened to Pestilence?” and relating it to “**Dungeons & Dragons**.” Honestly, I would prefer Mark tackle both of these topics. Given that I have no insights into what happened to Pestilence, I'm pretty sure you would too.


For those of you who read Building On A Budget, you'll remember that last week I discussed my own personal affliction of rogue-itis. This affliction, as I described it, is my strong deckbuilding urge to follow the road less traveled, to become disenchanted with decks everyone is making, and to champion ideas everyone else thinks are junk. After last week's article, I received a ton of e-mails to the effect of, “right on, brother!” It seems that rogue-itis might be somewhat contagious.


In honor of rogue tendencies, then, it's time to pick the two topics I don't think Mark will ever realistically cover. That's right: I'm focusing on the *bottom* of each poll. Does that make me a bottom feeder? Wait. Don't answer that.


Cards that change controller whenever something specific happens (as with, e.g., [Fractured Loyalty](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fractured+Loyalty))” received exactly two votes, and “Snack Foods” pulled in one. If you're the lone person who happened to have voted for Snack Foods, please speak up on the Message Boards. Since I don't know who you are, I'm going to dub you Lawrence, although on second thought I think I'll call you Larry. Today's for you, Larry.


What do you get when Change-Controller Cards meet Snack Foods?
