In the only all-Pro clash of the quarter finals, the talented Tommi Lindgren from Sweden takes on Shuhei Nakamura of Japan. There may not be much left to say that's new about Nakamura, but something that perhaps doesn't get said enough is that he's a BRILLIANT *Magic* player.


Coming into the weekend on 38 Pro Points, only a win here would bring him within realistic range of Brad Nelson in the Player of the Year Race. That win looked almost mythical when there were 1,284 potential opponents.


It doesn't look mythical now.


Nakamura opened with a [Forest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest) , while Lindgren had the first play of the match, a [Sylvok Lifestaff](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sylvok+Lifestaff) off an [Island](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island) . [Flight Spellbomb](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flight+Spellbomb) , [Horizon Spellbomb](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Horizon+Spellbomb) , and [Loxodon Wayfarer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Loxodon+Wayfarer) followed, with Nakamura settling for [Ferrovore](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ferrovore) and [Leaden Myr](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leaden+Myr) , the [Ferrovore](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ferrovore) dealing first damage.


Nakamura's [Molder Beast](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Molder+Beast) was quickly back in his hand, with Lindgren sending it back via [Lumengrid Drake](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lumengrid+Drake) , the flyer commencing the aerial assault the following turn.

Things were progressing steadily until Lindgren unloaded [Venser, the Sojourner](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Venser%2C+the+Sojourner) , blinking out his [Lumengrid Drake](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lumengrid+Drake) to once again send away Nakamura's [Molder Beast](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Molder+Beast) . A Japanese [Oxidda Scrapmelter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oxidda+Scrapmelter) destroyed the [Sylvok Lifestaff](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sylvok+Lifestaff) , Nakamura completing the turn with [Tumble Magnet](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tumble+Magnet) .


Although Nakamura made [Furnace Celebration](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Furnace+Celebration) , there wasn't much to celebrate, as Lindgren continued his Venser/Drake shenanigans, adding a [Neurok Replica](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Neurok+Replica) via a manabase that looked more like Ravnica than


Mirrodin: [Plains](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plains) , [Plains](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plains) , [Island](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island) , [Island](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island) , [Mountain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mountain) , [Razorverge Thicket](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Razorverge+Thicket) .


The [Furnace Celebration](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Furnace+Celebration) eventually combined with [Tumble Magnet](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tumble+Magnet) to kill Lindgren's [Lumengrid Drake](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lumengrid+Drake) , and a second 2/2 flyer fared no better, with Nakamura sacrificing [Clone Shell](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Clone+Shell) to [Ferrovore](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ferrovore) , getting [Molder Beast](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Molder+Beast) in the process. By this time Venser had reached eight loyalty, so Nakamura was forced to send the [Leaden Myr](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leaden+Myr) , via [Furnace Celebration](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Furnace+Celebration) , to the Planeswalker. Nonetheless, the red Enchantment was doing lots of good things for the Japanese standout, and eventually Lindgren had to accept that his Planeswalker had been dealt with, just before it could do dastardly Ultimate things.


A second [Clone Shell](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Clone+Shell) for Nakamura threatened yet more Imprint fun and games, with Lindgren now attempting to sculpt a plan with very limited tools – a [Loxodon Wayfarer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Loxodon+Wayfarer) , and [Auriok Replica](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Auriok+Replica) , which soon died to [Furnace Celebration](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Furnace+Celebration) , the [Clone Shell](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Clone+Shell) this time revealing [Saberclaw Golem](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Saberclaw+Golem) . [Bloodshot Trainee](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodshot+Trainee) and [Tangle Angler](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tangle+Angler) piled on the misery, moments before the end.


**[Furnace Celebration](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Furnace+Celebration) 1 – 0 Tommi Lindgren.**

*Tommi Lindgren* |


[Leaden Myr](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leaden+Myr) appropriately 'lead' off for Nakamura, with further acceleration thanks to [Gold Myr](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gold+Myr) . [Throne of Geth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Throne+of+Geth) was next, and then a turn four [Molder Beast](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Molder+Beast) , which is apparently quite good with a [Throne of Geth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Throne+of+Geth) ...


Lindgren meanwhile had [Neurok Replica](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Neurok+Replica) , [Sylvok Lifestaff](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sylvok+Lifestaff) , and the [Loxodon Wayfarer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Loxodon+Wayfarer) that had spent 97% of game one on the battlefield.


I'm surprised it wasn't exhausted really.


Nakamura Imprinted [Clone Shell](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Clone+Shell) , but elected not to sacrifice it to [Throne of Geth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Throne+of+Geth) , settling on the [Molder Beast](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Molder+Beast) dealing five damage.


Lindgren cast [Auriok Replica](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Auriok+Replica) , equipping it with the Lifestaff.


Nakamura forced the issue the next turn, sacrificing the [Clone Shell](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Clone+Shell) to reveal [Saberclaw Golem](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Saberclaw+Golem) , Lindgren duly obliging by sacrificing his [Auriok Replica](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Auriok+Replica) to blunt a huge [Molder Beast](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Molder+Beast) assault.


That was a temporary reprieve, however, since Nakamura delivered both [Bloodshot Trainee](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodshot+Trainee) and [Furnace Celebration](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Furnace+Celebration) to the battlefield.


Suspecting what was coming, Nakamura held out a [Trigon of Rage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Trigon+of+Rage) , which Lindgren countered with [Stoic Rebuttal](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stoic+Rebuttal) . That allowed Nakamura to cast [Tumble Magnet](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tumble+Magnet) , which wasted no time in tapping down a potential blocker. Already Lindgren was down to eleven, and facing a horrendous position, which his own [Saberclaw Golem](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Saberclaw+Golem) seemed unlikely to help.


[Furnace Celebration](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Furnace+Celebration) killed the Golem with the help of a sacrificed [Leaden Myr](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leaden+Myr) , the [Tumble Magnet](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tumble+Magnet) tapped down [Neurok Replica](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Neurok+Replica) , leaving Nakamura to pile in with [Molder Beast](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Molder+Beast) , [Bloodshot Trainee](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodshot+Trainee) , and [Saberclaw Golem](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Saberclaw+Golem) . Now Lindgren was at two, with Nakamura adding both [Gold Myr](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gold+Myr) and [Vulshok Replica](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vulshok+Replica) to the battlefield. That's [Vulshok Replica](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vulshok+Replica) , that sacrifices to deal damage.


**[Furnace Celebration](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Furnace+Celebration) , sorry, Shuhei Nakamura 2 – 0 Tommi Lindgren**.
