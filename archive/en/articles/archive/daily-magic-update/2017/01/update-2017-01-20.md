The January 20, 2017 Update

The Daily *Magic* Update is a roundup of everything *Magic* you should know on January 20, 2017. Today's Update is brought to you by *Aether Revolt* Release Day! It is easily the most important thing going on anywhere. Or at least it's the most likely to result in cracking packs.


Introducing Team...
===================


A while back we introduced the [Pro Tour Team Series](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/news/pro-tour-team-series-soft-launch-opens-2016-11-16) and promised it would make 2017 a different kind of year on the Pro Tour. We're already starting to see some of the hype these teams are creating as three different teams were announced within the last 24 hours, and two of those included videos that, I'll admit, got me a little excited for this whole team thing.

I'll admit, I got chills a bit.

This one really fired me up.


1. [Announcing MTG Team Massdrop East/West](https://www.massdrop.com/talk/1117/announcing-team-massdrop-east-west)

Fire and ice puns are so much easier than Massdrop puns. Still, this announcement was pretty cool because the team formerly known as East West Bowl has had a lot of success in recent years *and* this is like two teams for the price of one.


What to Watch This Weekend
==========================


1. [StarCityGames.com Columbus Open](http://www.starcitygames.com/events/210117_columbus_fact_sheet.html)

Want more hype? It's the first weekend of a whole new Standard. *Aether Revolt* will be legal, three other cards whose names shall not be uttered will not, and Columbus will be ground zero for what the format might start looking like. Every round could feature something cool and new. Coverage starts tomorrow at 10 a.m. ET/7 a.m. PT on [twitch.tv/scgtour](https://www.twitch.tv/scgtour).


After All That, Read, Watch, or Listen to These
===============================================


1. [Inventor Societies of Kaladesh—Glint-Sleeves, Lifecrafters, and MORE!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=760qz18pFv8) | SeibenLore

Seiben goes deep into Kaladesh, exploring the various inventor societies of the plane. These are the names like Glint-Sleeve and LIfecrafter that you see every which way. Get your Vorthosian fix with a seriously detailed look at Kaladesh.

1. [All the Ways to Play Saheeli Rai](http://www.toplevelpodcast.com/saheeli-rai/) | Top Level Podcast | Patrick Chapin and Mike Flores

And they mean *alllll* the ways. The shell is flexible and powerful, but choosing just how to deploy [Saheeli Rai](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Saheeli+Rai) and [Felidar Guardian](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Felidar+Guardian) is a whole different question entirely.


1. [Just Be Cool](http://www.gatheringmagic.com/thegirlfriendbracket-01202017-the-girlfriend-bracket-87-just-be-cool/) | The Girlfriend Bracket | Erin Campbell, Hallie Santo, Katie Neal, and Kriz Schultz

On tap for this female-powered podcast are stories from the *Aether Revolt* Prereleases, the nerve-wracking moment when you visit a new local store for the first time, and complicated judge calls, among other topics. Listen on your way to pick up your sweet, sweet *Aether Revolt* product, and then while cracking all of it, despite how Marshall Sutcliffe might object.


A Short Organized Play Announcement
===================================


1. [A Quick Update on June's Grand Prix Columbus](http://magicorganizedplay.tumblr.com/post/156094546736/a-quick-update-on-junes-grand-prix-columbus)

The quick update? Grand Prix Columbus is now Grand Prix Cleveland. Check out the link above for the full scoop.

With a name like Sram Dunk, how can you not be excited? And this is just deck number ten (of ten)! You can find the other ten on [@hareruyaEnglish](https://twitter.com/hareruyaEnglish) or in [this helpful Reddit comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/5p3tif/hareruya_aer_standard_brews_are_up/dco57yl/) that has collected all of the Instagram links.


Deck of the Day
===============


1. [White-Blue Inspiring Statuary](https://www.instagram.com/p/BPebBLUDUfa/?hl=en)

I couldn't stop checking out the [#KenjiWayfinder](https://twitter.com/search?f=tweets&vertical=default&q=%23kenjiwayfinder&src=typd) decks, so let's take a look at one of them up close to see what makes it tick. And since [Inspiring Statuary](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inspiring+Statuary) has a lot of pros buzzing about it, let's start there.


The deck is actually an interesting mishmash of three decks: the old Thalia's Lancers–powered legend-based decks featuring Bruna and Gisela, a Servo tokens deck, and an Eldrazi ramp deck. It's just that in this deck Servo tokens essentially *are* the ramp once [Inspiring Statuary](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inspiring+Statuary) is in play, and the Eldrazi also *happen* to be legends you can search for with your Lancers. In that way, the deck has plays all the way up the chain, from some Servos on turn two all the way up to some Eldrazi on turn whatever—but hopefully early. The earliest I figure you can power out a legendary Eldrazi is turn five, though [Conduit of Ruin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Conduit+of+Ruin) can come down on turn four.


The deck has a ton of redundancy, as its key piece, [Inspiring Statuary](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inspiring+Statuary), can be searched up with [Trophy Mage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Trophy+Mage) and it has a whopping twelve cards that produce two or three artifacts ready to improvise. And with the full playset of [Thalia's Lancers](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thalia%27s+Lancers), the deck can afford to go lighter on the Eldrazi but always expect to see one when necessary.
