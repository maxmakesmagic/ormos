The [Wrath of God](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=489712) and [Chord of Calling](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=489831) promos for *Double Masters* have been delayed and will be arriving in stores in some regions after the *Double Masters* release date.


Note that this does *not* affect any other *Double Masters* product.


Regions will likely be affected as follows, noting that shipping delays may increase for unknown reasons while in transit:


* **North America**: Mostly unaffected, though some stores might see delays into next week.
* **Europe**: Delayed until mid- to late August.
* **Asia Pacific**: Delayed until late August.
* **Japan**: Delayed until mid-August.
* **Latin America**: Delayed until late August to early September.

We appreciate everyone's patience and understanding as we work through these shipping delays. Players who purchase boxes or play in events should check with their local stores to see how they're handling distribution of late-arriving promos.
