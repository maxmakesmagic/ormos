Jeremy Dezani inches closer, round by round, to becoming a Player of the Year title, a garnish on a tremendous year of *Magic* accomplishment for the quiet French player.  His opponent, Baltimore's Ben Friedman, looks to break into the Top 25 with a strong Day 2.  As both players entered Day 2 with just a single loss, the dream of taking down the tournament was still vividly alive.

*No. 2 Ranked Player Jeremy Dezani is very close to achieving Player of the Year, but he'll need a few more wins to clinch it. Ben Friedman is looking to stop his big run, with his eyes on a Top 25.*

**The Games**

*Jeremy Dezani has kept cool in all seasons and situations over the last year.*

Then Friedman played [Soul of Innistrad](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soul+of+Innistrad).

*Ben Friedman is well-outfitted for a day under the bright lights of the feature match area.*

When Necromancer's Apprentice milled [Restock](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Restock) and [Endless Obedience](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Endless+Obedience), Friedman saw that it was time to help himself to better creatures than [Child of Night](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Child+of+Night) and [Living Totem](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Living+Totem).  A [Restock](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Restock) in hand fetched back both of the freshly-milled sorcery cards, and [Master of Predicaments](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Master+of+Predicaments) took up a position alongside [Soul of Innistrad](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soul+of+Innistrad) and close to a dozen other creatures.  Dezani was able to push it back into his graveyard with a chump blocker and a [Lightning Strike](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Strike), but on the following turn a swarm of 11 creatures came barreling in at the Player of the Year frontrunner.  After blocks, he found himself on a perilous 3 life, and Friedman quickly slammed a [Covenant of Blood](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Covenant+of+Blood) on the table to end the epic Game 2 and even up the match.  
  

With 15 minutes on the clock at the end of Game 2, both players needed to avoid another massive stall in order to find a win for the round.  Dezani's fliers and big artifacts were well-suited to that goal, but whether Friedman could find a quick win was an open question.  However, the power of the Soul cycle and Friedman's strong black removal certainly left the door open to punish any slow start by the French player.  
  

Both players had to mulligan to six cards, and Dezani led with [Darksteel Citadel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Darksteel+Citadel).  Friedman's second turn [Satyr Wayfinder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Satyr+Wayfinder) found a Swamp, but declined to step in when Dezani played [Ensoul Artifact](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ensoul+Artifact) on the Citadel and attacked for 5.  Friedman dropped a [Necromancer's Assistant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Necromancer%27s+Assistant), milling [Typhoid Rats](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Typhoid+Rats) and [Endless Obedience](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Endless+Obedience), and again chose not to block the indestructible 5/5.  [Living Totem](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Living+Totem) promoted the Assistant to a 4/2 and after attacks by both players, the life totals stood at 14-5 in Dezani's favor.  His [Goblin Roughrider](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Roughrider) hoped to trade the board down while the 5/5 picked off chump blockers, but Friedman was content to continue the race.  He played [Crippling Blight](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crippling+Blight) on the Goblin and charged in for 7.  
  

When Dezani played a fifth land and paused, the swing in mood was evident.  "That's not a [Lava Axe](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lava+Axe)..." quipped the American player, and he was right: it was an attack with the [Goblin Roughrider](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Roughrider) (dropping Friedman to 3) and a [Bronze Sable](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bronze+Sable).  Friedman had a [Satyr Wayfinder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Satyr+Wayfinder) and a [Netcaster Spider](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Netcaster+Spider), and now it was tough to see how Dezani might punch through the last few points of damage any time soon.  He made some motions towards combat, stepped away from the table for some rules questions with a judge, but in the end, could only summon a [Glacial Crasher](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glacial+Crasher) and pass the turn.  
  

With the clock nearly expired, Friedman counted and re-counted the creatures on each side of the board.  Finally, he pushed all of his creatures into the red zone, where most of them would meet their doom at the much bigger creatures on Dezani's board.  But three of them managed to inch past, and Friedman's top-decked [Covenant of Blood](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Covenant+of+Blood) was exactly enough damage to end the match with a couple minutes to spare.  
  
**Jeremy Dezani 1 - Ben Friedman 2**  
  

After the match, I asked Friedman if he'd drafted the same archetype on Friday.  "Of course!" he exclaimed, and immediately pointed me to his teammate Andrea Mengucci, peering in from the edge of the feature match area, as the inspiration for the strategy.  
  

The graveyard strategy, in their opinion, has all the hallmarks of a sideways strategy, capitalizing on an environment where green is under-drafted and where their pick order dodges conventional wisdom on power levels. Over the course of roughly 20 drafts on *Magic Online*, Mengucci established that he could have success picking unloved cards early and often: [Covenant of Blood](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Covenant+of+Blood) over best-uncommon-in-the-set [Cone of Flame](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cone+of+Flame), [Gravedigger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gravedigger) over [Stab Wound](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stab+Wound), and [Satyr Wayfinder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Satyr+Wayfinder) over [Elvish Mystic](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elvish+Mystic).  While the team focused on Constructed testing, Mengucci won draft over draft, and eventually prepared a 45-card pick order list.  Clearly, the list is working, and I expect that the shape of the draft environment will be shifting rapidly to accommodate the new archetype.
