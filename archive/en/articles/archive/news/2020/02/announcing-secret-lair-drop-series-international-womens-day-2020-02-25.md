Wizards of the Coast is proud to celebrate International Women's Day—a day honoring the social, economic, cultural, and political achievements of women around the world!


In doing so, we've selected a few of the most powerful and influential women from the history of *Magic* to receive new, borderless art by some of our finest illustrators: Mila Pesic, Livia Prima, Cynthia Sheppard, Anna Steinbauer, and Magali Villeneuve. ​In fact, everyone who worked on this product—the artists, creative directors, producers, and package designers—were all women.


Wizards will donate $25 per unit sold benefitting [World Association of Girl Guides and Girl Scouts](https://www.wagggs.org/en/), a charity of choice of International Women's Day.


Just like previous *Secret Lair* drops, International Women's Day will be available for 24 hours only at [secretlair.wizards.com](https://secretlair.wizards.com/us). This sale starts at 9 a.m. PST on March 8 (International Women's Day) and you can pick up your copy of International Women's Day for $49.99. Limit of 15 per customer.
