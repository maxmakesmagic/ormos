* There will be four *Planechase* Game Packs released on June 1, 2012: **Chaos Reigns**, **Night of the Ninja**, **Primordial Hunger**, and **Savage Auras**.
* Each game pack contains a sixty-card **Magic** deck, a ten-card planar deck, a planar die, and a *Planechase* strategy insert with multiplayer rules.
* Each deck has eight new plane cards and two new phenomenon cards, and these cards are not shared between decks; there are a total of 32 new planes and 8 new phenomena.
* Each of the cards in the 60-card decks is black-bordered and tournament legal. This means that these cards are legal for use in any tournaments where the original printings are still legal.
* There are a total of 21 new **Magic** cards in the set, spread across the four decks. Each deck has six of the cards (counting by name), although some appear in multiples. These brand new cards are legal in Eternal formats.

### Multiplayer Fun and Mayhem


The new *Planechase* cards introduce many new planes as well as an entirely new oversized card type: phenomena. Phenomena capture the events which transpire as you jump between planes, as immediate events during the change. These phenomena and plane cards add to the exciting and unpredictable events which will unfold during your *Planechase* games.


Play Commander with *Planechase*! These two casual variants go hand in hand, as they allow you to enjoy an unpredictable and high-powered casual format that never stops bringing you new and exciting games.


Cards and decks from *Planechase*'s 2012 Edition are able to be played with decks from the original *Planechase* release without any changes! These decks and their components come with everything you need to use and enjoy a planar **Magic** game.
