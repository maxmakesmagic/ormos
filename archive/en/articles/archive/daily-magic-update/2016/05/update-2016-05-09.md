The Daily *Magic* Update is a roundup of everything *Magic* you should know on May 9, 2016. Today's Update is brought to you by Seth Manfield. Why not? [He can do everything else](#manfield).


What You Might Have Missed This Weekend
=======================================


1. [Top 5 Moments of Grand Prix New York](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/event-coverage/top-5-moments-grand-prix-new-york-2016-05-08) | Wizards of the Coast | Jacob Van Lunen and Marc Calderaro

From Team East West Bowl's domination of another tournament to reigning Player of the Year Mike Sigrist going 15-0 in the Swiss, it was a noteworthy weekend at [Grand Prix New York](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/gpny16). Check out the highlights with this article.


1. [Top 5 Cards of Grand Prix Tokyo](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/gptok16/top-5-cards-grand-prix-tokyo-2016-05-08) | Wizards of the Coast | Chapman Sim

Many of the usual suspects dominated [Grand Prix Tokyo](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/gptok16)—along with one less-than-usual one.


1. [The 136,755 subscriber Q&A! The Professor talks *Magic: The Gathering* and more!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxMVz3ZLIJQ) | Tolarian Community College | The Professor

The Professor answers questions!


Yeah, that's the gist of this video. It's pretty self-explanatory. At this point, I'm just typing words for the sake of typing words.

After Those, Read, Watch, or Listen to These
============================================


1. [Storm Scaling Potential Modern Reprints](http://www.mtggoldfish.com/articles/storm-scaling-potential-modern-reprints) | MTGGoldfish | SaffronOlive

After a conversation about reprints in Standard last week, SaffronOlive set up his own "Storm Scale" to see which reprints would be bad for Standard and which he believes would be okay. The article only considers power level, not things like flavor, mechanics, or story (reprinting [Elspeth, Knight-Errant](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elspeth%2C+Knight-Errant), for example, would be a little awkward given her, ya know, death), but it's an interesting exercise on contextual power and what it means to be "format warping."


1. [The Best 5 Decks I've Ever Played](http://magic.tcgplayer.com/db/article.asp?ID=13260&writer=Melissa+DeTora&articledate=5-9-2016) | TCGPlayer | Melissa DeTora

Melissa DeTora revisits the five decks that not only were the best, but that she learned the most from. Depressingly, there are more red cards than [Mulldrifter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mulldrifter)s.


1. [MTG Quiz: Flavor Text Cycles](http://www.gatheringmagic.com/nickvigabool-050916-mtg-quiz-flavor-text-cycles/) | Gathering Magic | Nick Vigabool

Did you know flavor text cycles were a thing? They're totally a thing, and Gathering Magic's resident quiz guru, Nick Vigabool, has an exceedingly difficult one today. But if you know your Phyrexian illness progress notes, your Goblin nursery rhymes, and your myths of reality, then, well, one—we love you. And two, go ace this quiz!


What People Are Talking About
=============================


1. > 
> 3400 people for [#gptokyo](https://twitter.com/hashtag/gptokyo?src=hash)? Way to easily beat the record for the largest standard GP of all time.

Very much worth highlighting this. We've had larger Grand Prix, but they've primarily been Limited and primarily been special for some reason ([Grand Prix Las Vegas 2013](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/gplv13) with *Modern Masters*, [and again for *Modern Masters (2015 Edition)*](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/gpveg15-1), or Team Limited and the like), but Grand Prix Tokyo was a massive hit just by virtue of being a Standard Grand Prix in Japan. I guess people are still celebrating the death of [Siege Rhino](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Siege+Rhino).


1. > 
> Had a rough [#GPNY](https://twitter.com/hashtag/GPNY?src=hash) and won't be on the ballot this year. Don't feel too bad for me, everything with me still pretty great.

>  — Chris Pikula (@meddlingmage) [May 8, 2016](https://twitter.com/meddlingmage/status/729321404454309888)

Over the weekend, the top comment on the Grand Prix New York and Tokyo Discussion Megathread on Reddit was the [community getting behind Chris Pikula](https://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/4i5mfe/grand_prix_new_york_tokyo_discussion_megathread/d2vf43d) trying to finish 11-4 or better to snag the Pro Points he needs to get back on the Hall of Fame ballot this year. As his tweet stated, he didn't make it, but he's definitely got a cheering section in the community rooting for him to make that last bit toward eligibility.


1. >

Blinking a [Dragonlord Atarka](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragonlord+Atarka) with [Eldrazi Displacer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eldrazi+Displacer) seems like one of the feel-good moments of this format. For you. Not for your opponent. Either way, this wildly popular tweet is sure to spawn a bunch of people not only playing this list from Luis Scott-Vargas, but also seeing how far they can push [Cryptolith Rite](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cryptolith+Rite)s.


Deck of the Day
===============


1. [Grand Prix New York Champion—White-Black Control](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/gpny16/top-decklists-2016-05-08)

If the stories are to be believed, Seth Manfield—your current leader in the Player of the Year race and the reigning World Champion—brewed up his deck at 1 a.m. the morning of the Grand Prix. The first game he played with the deck? His first round at [Grand Prix New York](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/gpny16). The last game he played with it?


The finals of that same Grand Prix.


If that sounds ridiculous, that's just because it is. Do not adjust your television set, and all that. He broke from his team deck—which, by the way, put a different teammate in the Top 8 as well, thank you very much—and was rewarded.


The deck is White-Black Control, a deck we've seen a bit of lately, but this definitely has that Manfield twist on it. It's reminiscent of the Esper Control list Manfield took to the Top 8 of [Pro Tour *Shadows over Innistrad*](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/ptsoi), full of planeswalkers, removal, and sweepers. It even has the one-of [Planar Outburst](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Planar+Outburst).


But Manfield read that you needed to be a bit more proactive now, and [Secure the Wastes](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Secure+the+Wastes) and [Westvale Abbey](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Westvale+Abbey) allowed him to turn the corner quickly and efficiently. Plus, [Gideon, Ally of Zendikar](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gideon%2C+Ally+of+Zendikar) can play defense as well as some pretty fast offense. He essentially ditched the iffy mana base and inefficient threats for a more streamlined version of the same idea.


Also, check out the two [Hallowed Moonlight](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hallowed+Moonlight)s. When Green-White Tokens is the name of the game, those seem like an absurdly great metagame call.
