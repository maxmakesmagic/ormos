Whenever we visit a new plane, the creative team does reams and reams of work building a world that is unique, but at the same time familiar in key ways. *Lorwyn* was a fantasy world with elves, goblins, and faeries, but each with its own *Lorwyn* twist. *Innistrad* played on the tropes of Gothic horror, but had its own spin on zombies, vampires, and ghosts.


Likewise, *Khans of Tarkir* has its own touches when it comes to transporting classic *Magic* and fantasy creatures into a new world. One particular Tarkir touch was the way [Goblins](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/arcana/monster-menagerie-goblins-2014-09-24) were depicted. They still feel like goblins, but they certainly look different.


Here, see for yourself.


Goblinslide
===========

Hordeling Outburst
==================


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Hordeling Outburst)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hordeling Outburst)
Setting: TARKIR  

Clan: Mardu  

Color: Red creature  

Location: Snowy mountainous tundra  

Action: Show three Mardu-style goblins (with a variety of fur colors). They have popped up out of a hide-covered tent or yurt. They come out armed to the teeth, viciously brandishing their weapons, ready to fight.  

Focus: The three Mardu goblins  

Mood: What they lack in size, they make up for in viciousness.  

Notes: It is essential that three goblins be shown to support the card mechanic

Jeering Instigator
==================


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Jeering Instigator)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jeering Instigator)
Setting: TARKIR  

Clan: Mardu  

Color: Red creature  

Location: Any Mardu location  

Action: Show a goblin raider of the Mardu clan. He's squatting on the saddle of a horse with a sly, impish look on his face. He has stolen a treasure of one of the other clans: the headdress/crown of Queen Sidisi of Sultai clan. Maybe he has the headdress slung under his arm, looking at the viewer as if to say, "You want it back? Come and take it.  

Focus: The goblin thief  

Mood: Humorous, but should be illustrated realistically (not cartoonish). This guy is a real thorn in the side of the other clans.

Ponyback Brigade
================


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Ponyback Brigade)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ponyback Brigade)
Setting: TARKIR  

Clan: Mardu  

Color: Black/red/white creatures  

Location: Any Mardu location  

Action: This is a group of four Mardu Clan goblins who are all riding a horse. What we mean is, they're all riding the SAME horse. One of the goblins is clearly the leaderâ€”maybe he wears an oversized helmet, facing forward. The other three goblins are hanging on however they can, dangling from a stirrup, climbing up the reins, etc.  

Focus: The four goblins  

Mood: This is a funny scene, but it'll work best if you play it straight (illustrate them realistically). These gobbos believe they're fierce, proud warriors of the Mardu Horde.
