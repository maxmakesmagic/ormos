 Stybs has played Magic the world over, writing and drafting as part of the event coverage team and slinging Commander everywhere his decks will fit. 





*Battle for Zendikar* has been churning for just two weeks. With several large tournament weekends and *Magic Online* sharing the set this past week, there's been a flurry of activity in the new Standard world. The Pro Tour is where the bits and pieces enter a crucible of the world's best deck builders, testers, and players.


This is what they came up with:

If it feels like there's a lot going on, it's because there is. The combination of *Khans of Tarkir* fetch lands—[Polluted Delta](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Polluted+Delta) and friends—with the new cycle of battle lands from the new set—[Cinder Glade](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cinder+Glade) and company—mean it's possible to play three, four, and even five colors with relative ease.


This split the field into a few directions, but rolling things up a bit makes the lay of the land make more sense.




| Archetype | Count | % Field |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Jeskai (All Types) | 69 | 18.80% |
| Red Aggro (All Types) | 67 | 18.30% |
| Megamorph (All Types) | 64 | 17.40% |
| Esper (All Types) | 44 | 12.00% |
| Abzan (All Types) | 34 | 9.30% |
| Four/Five-Color (All Types) | 31 | 8.40% |
| All Other Archetypes | 58 | 15.80% |
| TOTAL | 367 | 100.00% |

Pulling together the core of different angles of similar decks reveals a much simpler affair. Jeskai—in "Dark" versions with black or more Token or Dragon-laden ways—all shared red removal and countermagic with a [Mantis Rider](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mantis+Rider) or four. Red aggressive decks were mostly Atarka Red—the natural descendant of Martin Dang's Pro Tour *Dragons of Tarkir*-winning list—and a handful of [Snapping Gnarlid](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snapping+Gnarlid)-led landfall.


Green-White Megamorph was the broadest section of the reliable [Den Protector](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Den+Protector)-[Deathmist Raptor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deathmist+Raptor) duo, but some decks splashed in [Radiant Flames](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Radiant+Flames), [Dig Through Time](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dig+Through+Time), or other colorful cards to enhance their position. Esper variants were all control decks of some sort—Dragons, Planeswalkers, or [Planar Outburst](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Planar+Outburst)/[End Hostilities](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=End+Hostilities) battlefield cleaners—and the count above doesn't include the one-of Warrior tribal deck in the colors.


Abzan, the once mightiest of Standard's decks, has fallen in favor with *Battle for Zendikar*. While [Siege Rhino](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Siege+Rhino) remains an impressive threat, even the opportunity to splash in blue ([Treasure Cruise](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treasure+Cruise) another ways to reload) or red ([Radiant Flames](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Radiant+Flames) as a board sweeper) had kept the deck at the top.


While there's a considerable swath of decks beyond the Four- and Five-Color lump ending the summary table, it's the fact there is such a lump that's meaningful: The mana means anything is possible. Four-Color and Five-Color Bring to Light are ostensibly "the eight copies of [Siege Rhino](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Siege+Rhino) decks" but it can also tutor out so much more. Others jammed every awesome Planeswalker the colors could fit, or packed in powerful interactions such as [Zulaport Cutthroat](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Zulaport+Cutthroat) and [Liliana, Heretical Healer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Liliana%2C+Heretical+Healer) and [Rally the Ancestors](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rally+the+Ancestors) and [Jace, Vyrn's Prodigy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace%2C+Vyrn%27s+Prodigy) and [Catacomb Sifter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Catacomb+Sifter) and, well, pretty much anything else you wanted.


As always the remaining decks not covered by the major groups are where the most curious of curiosities exist. [Hardened Scales](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hardened+Scales)? [Sphinx's Tutelage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sphinx%27s+Tutelage)? [Demonic Pact](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Demonic+Pact) and [Dark Petition](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dark+Petition)? [Sigil of the Throne](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sigil+of+the+Throne)? They're all there, in the hands of players looking to surprise opponents expecting something very different.


Somewhere in those 367 decks is a Pro Tour winner's choice, but that's a story for Sunday.
