 We kick off our second Quick Questions with a look at six pro player's favorite *Magic 2015* Booster Draft "pet cards." These are the cards that may be good, but not the best, that a player can't help but play when able.




**Do you have any pet cards in *Magic 2015*?**

***Bob Maher, Hall of Famer**  - [Ensoul Artifact](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ensoul+Artifact). The Blue-Red artifact deck is insanely powerful, but almost impossible to draft because you need a very specific set of cards. I chickened out of drafting it here, and I would've wound up with an unbeatable deck if I'd pulled the trigger.*
