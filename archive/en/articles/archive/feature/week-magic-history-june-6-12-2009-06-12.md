### June 7-8, 2003: A Star-Studded Grand Prix Finals

![Rankko Bongo Wheshiwheshi](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gpams03/a885.jpg)In June 2003, 198 teams showed up to the RAI in Amsterdam to play the *Onslaught* Sealed Format at [2003 Grand Prix–Amsterdam](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=sideboard/events/gpams03). Shock leaders after day one, Boys of Summer, failed to capitalize on early promise and just missed out on the top 4. Phoenix Foundation also failed to make it, despite going unbeaten through the draft portion again. They finished 5th as no team with two losses made it into the Top 4.

In the end the multinational trio of Carlos Romao (Brazil), Jose Barberos (Argentina) and Wilfried Ranque defeated the equally multinational trio of Kamiel Cornelissen (Netherlands), Jon Finkel and Eric Froehlich (USA) in a final that saw the Wheshiwheshi boys overcome unfavorable matchups.
