**Pro Tour San Diego 2007 Finalist, Yuuta Takahashi:** I expected a lot of creature and combo decks and that's why I'm playing cards like [Terminus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Terminus) and [Ethersworn Canonist](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ethersworn+Canonist).

**Two-Time Pro Tour Top 8 Competitor, Chikara Nakajima:** I expected a lot of Blue Red Delver and my sideboard is filled with cards to beat it.

**Two-Time Top 8 Competitor and Platinum Pro, Kentarou Yamamoto:** Delver is probably the most popular, especially Temur.
