Blake is the content manager for DailyMTG.com, making him the one you should email if you have thoughts on the website, good or less good (or not good). He's a longtime coverage reporter and hasn't turned down a game of Magic in any format ever. 






Starting with *War of the Spark* and moving forward, Wizards of the Coast will no longer be giving *Magic* products manufacturer's suggested retail prices, or MSRPs.


We're making this change to streamline our communications around new products. MSRPs are not favored in many parts of the world, which led to some confusion among our global player base. As *Magic* becomes more and more global, it makes less and less sense to suggest a retail price.


Don't worryâ€”this isn't some big disruption to our products or the company. We believe the elimination of MSRP will simply help us communicate better to our players and the places where those players shop.


You'll see this change go into effect immediately with *War of the Spark*, which you can [view a teaser trailer for now](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn_0ZjpjntE)!
