There are many, many steps along the road to creating a new **Magic** set. One of the final, and most enjoyable, steps is the R&D slideshow. It serves as a last chance to catch any editing errors or necessary fixes on new cards. All parties involved in creating the new set join each other for a slideshow of each individual card in the set, complete with artwork. It’s a great chance to say hello to something new and see the set fully for the first time. Consider it a staff screening, if you will.

Now, for the first time ever, we’re bringing you a sneak peek into the slideshow with *Alara Reborn*. Enjoy!

And here are some quotes from various slideshow participants.


* "Wait... that only costs four?"
* "Awwwww…it’s a baby one!"
* "I defer that answer to Mark Gottlieb, because I’m chewing." (The slideshow generally happens shortly after lunch.)
* "It’s funny how awesome that is!"
* "Nice card."  
 "Thanks, I made it."  
 "I rescind my comment…"
* "Make it…heavier sounding."
