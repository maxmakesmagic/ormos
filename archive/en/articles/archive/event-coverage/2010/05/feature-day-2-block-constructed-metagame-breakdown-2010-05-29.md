The dust had settled after five rounds of *Zendikar* Block Constructed and three rounds of *Rise of the Eldrazi* Booster Draft; 141 players emerged with at least five wins. When we looked at the decklists of the continuing players, we found that the top five archetypes had held their positions.


**Blue-White Control - 38**


Ninety-five players were cut to 38, yet the power of [Jace, the Mind Sculptor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace%2C+the+Mind+Sculptor) and [Gideon Jura](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gideon+Jura) still looms throughout over one quarter of the room. 


**Devastating Red – 21**


Twenty-one of the original 57 red decks were still winning. 


**Monument Green – 20**


This was the breakout deck of this weekend. The combination of token generators, [Eldrazi Monument](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eldrazi+Monument) and [Beastmaster Ascension](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Beastmaster+Ascension) had carried almost half of the players who chose to play it onward to Day Two.


**Green Eldrazi – 9**


We were still seeing [Emrakul, the Aeons Torn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Emrakul%2C+the+Aeons+Torn) and his crew of Eldrazi monstrosities, fueled by Eldrazi Spawn, annihilating most things in their paths as nine of the original thirty-four players battled Day Two.


**Koros - 9**


Coming in as the third aggro-deck in this metagame, Koros rounded out our top five archetypes with nine of the 28 Day One players continuing on.


With five more rounds of *Zendikar* Block Constructed still to come, we would soon see which decks would come forth as the ones to beat. The complete Day Two metagame percentages are here for your leisure. You can also check out the Day One archetype breakdown [here](/en/articles/archive/event-coverage/feature-block-constructed-metagame-breakdown-2010-05-28).
