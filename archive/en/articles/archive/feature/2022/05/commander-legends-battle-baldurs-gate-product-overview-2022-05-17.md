Well-met, traveler!


After a long day of dungeon delving, you head into the nearest town to get some much-needed rest. Although the day started unseasonably warm, about an hour ago the sky darkened to a deep gray and began pouring rain. Once wet, the treaded dirt road became a sticky mud that threatens to pull your boots right off your feet, making every step labored. Dog-tired and freezing, an involuntary smile pulls your face into a hopeful expression as you finally see it: a sign for the local inn.


As you approach The Roving Ram Inn & Restaurant, the wind picks up from a low moan to a high-pitched howl and the rain beats out a syncopated rhythm on the tin roof of a local shop. You quicken your pace to a run and even jump the three steps leading up to the tavern's porch before you pull the handle of a heavy oak door until it opens to reveal a cozy but spacious firelit room.


As you enter the bottom floor of the Roving Ram, you are greeted by a young man with a thick accent who stands polishing a wooden mug at the bar. "C'mon in outta the rain then, I just brewed up some 'arvest tea." The man pours a steaming liquid that smells like cinnamon, cloves and apples into the clean mug and sets it on the bar in front of you. Before even removing your dripping cloak, you wrap your fingers, which are nearly chilled numb, around the mug and sigh contentedly.


While you sip the hot tea, you secure a room at the inn for the night and order some dinner. Hearing a loud tut, you turn to see an elderly woman with stunning silver hair braided into a crown that wraps around her head multiple times. She approaches the bartender, asks, "Why is a paying customer sitting out here sopping wet?" and holds her hands out for your wet cloak and your gear, which she takes up to your room to dry.


With a steaming hot bowl of stew in front of you and the feeling beginning to return to your toes, you feel relaxed enough to look around. The entire lower floor is visible from your seat at the square-shaped bar in the center of the open room.


As your eyes move over the many tables, you notice that you aren't the inn's only customer. In the farthest corner at a table shrouded in shadows, you see a cloaked figure deftly shuffling a deck of cards that look nothing like the playing cards you're used to.


You squint your eyes trying to make out what sort of cards these are, and the figure catches you staring. They pull their hood back to reveal a pretty, pointed face and a sly smile.


"You ever played *Magic: The Gathering*?" they ask excitedly.


Perhaps you're a talented *Magic* player, or a total novice with nothing else to do on a rainy afternoon in a town where you're just passing through, but either way, if you're going to play, you're going to need the right cards. The tavern owner has everything you could need behind the bar, so here's some information to help you make your next move.

Prerelease Packs
================


If you want to get a head start on your opponent, your quickest path toward obtaining the cards needed to play a game of *Magic* with the stranger is a Prerelease Pack. The *Commander Legends: Battle for Baldur's Gate* Prerelease is a Draft event—everyone will draft their own Commander decks! Prerelease for *Commander Legends: Battle for Baldur's Gate* will take place on June 3, 2022, so sign up now to get your hands on these cards as early as possible.


![CLB Prerelease Pack](https://media.wizards.com/2022/images/daily/en_JJO62BYV5h_prerelease_pack.png)


Each Prerelease Pack contains:


* 3 *Commander Legends: Battle for Baldur's Gate* Draft Boosters
* 1 Traditional foil rare or mythic rare from *Commander Legends: Battle for Baldur's Gate* with a foil year stamp
* 1 D20
* 1 Reusable deck box with divider
* 1 *MTG Arena* code card (where available)

Draft Boosters
==============


If you're familiar with card games already (we see you rogues!), you can obtain a display box of 24 Draft Boosters. These boosters, which are also available as single boosters, are optimized both for drafting and playing Commander.


![CLB Draft Booster Display](https://media.wizards.com/2022/images/daily/en_JJO62BYV5h_draft_display.png)


Every *Commander Legends: Battle for Baldur's Gate* Draft Booster contains at least one legendary creature or planeswalker and at least one legendary Background card. Each Booster contains a total of 20 cards:

When you're drafting *Commander Legends: Battle for Baldur's Gate*, you'll take two cards at a time and build a Commander deck containing a minimum of 60 cards. You can add Faceless One to use as your Commander if you can't find a Commander that fits the color you drafted. And, because you're drafting your deck, you don't have to obey the Singleton rule!

Collector Boosters
==================


**Question**: What does every good dungeon have in common?


**Answer**: Great loot!


Imagine that you've just fought your way through a particularly difficult dungeon. As the last enemy falls, a passage appears where the illusion of a wall once stood. Stepping through the door, you find a room filled with gold, jewels, and treasure chests bursting with magically enchanted weapons and armor. Collector Boosters are kind of like that—but with the shiniest, coolest *Magic* cards.


![CLB Collector Booster Display](https://media.wizards.com/2022/images/daily/en_JJO62BYV5h_collector_display.png)

Commander Decks
===============


No Commander deck? No problem! *Commander Legends: Battle for Baldur's Gate* features four Commander Decks to choose from. Each Commander Deck includes a legendary face Commander as well as an alternate legend plus a Background to use as Commanders. In total, each deck contains ten new-to-*Magic* cards.


![CLB Commander Deck 1](https://media.wizards.com/2022/images/daily/en_01_7nweywebte.png)![CLB Commander Deck 2](https://media.wizards.com/2022/images/daily/en_02_7nweywebte.png)

Each *Commander Legends: Battle for Baldur's Gate* Commander Deck also contains a Collector Booster Sample Pack. Each Sample Pack contains two cards:


* 1 Booster Fun rare or mythic rare that you can also find in *Commander Legends: Battle for Baldur's Gate* Collector Boosters (In 20% of Sample Packs, this card is traditional foil.)

Most *Commander Legends: Battle for Baldur's Gate* Commander decks contain a Collector Booster Sample Pack in the same language as the deck. However, if your Commander deck is in Chinese, Italian, Portuguese, or Spanish, your Collector Booster Sample Pack will be in English.


Bundle
======


Some things are universal, like how useful casting Lightning Bolt can be at just the right moment. Or like the tingle of fear a Mind Flayer can send up and then back down your spine with one look at its face. Oh, the joy of coming across a particularly useful magical artifact during a game. The shock when a Dragon appears on the battlefield out of nowhere. The importance of accessorizing your gameplay!


![CLB Bundle](https://media.wizards.com/2022/images/daily/en_JJO62BYV5h_bundle.png)


A Bundle is the perfect gift for a current *Magic* player or someone who is just starting their *Magic* journey. Each Bundle contains eight Set Boosters and a great box to store your cards in, plus more loot:


* 1 Traditional foil alternate-art Wand of Wonder
* 1 Oversized dungeon card featuring the new Undercity Dungeon
* 20 Traditional foil basic lands
* 20 Non-foil basic lands
* 1 Oversized red and pink d20
