**5. Zhengdong Shan Busts the Game Wide Open**

Zhengdong Shan went undefeated on Day One with an exciting new Black-Red Modern strategy that included [Goblin Dark-Dwellers](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Dark-Dwellers) and [Boom & Bust](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Boom+%2F%2F+Bust). On more than one occasion, Shan was able to use the [Goblin Dark-Dwellers](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Dark-Dwellers) trigger to flashback [Boom & Bust](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Boom+%2F%2F+Bust) to establish board control with a 4/4 menace while destroying all the lands in play.

Sam Black regaled us with a tale of perfection from the Swiss. Black’s [Death's Shadow](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Death%27s+Shadow) deck is capable of some crazy things. Perhaps the most exciting of those things this weekend was a game where Black cast turn one [Thoughtseize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtseize), turn two [Thoughtseize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtseize) and [Death's Shadow](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Death%27s+Shadow), and turn three [Temur Battle Rage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Temur+Battle+Rage) for 20 damage. Imagine having your hand shredded to pieces while also being killed on the third turn in Modern! That’s just crazy!

**3. Jon Bolding Rips [Blood Moon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Moon) on the Perfect Turn!**

Things looked pretty good for reigning Player of the Year (16) Mike Sigrist in the third game of the semifinals. [Thoughtseize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtseize) and [Tarmogoyf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf) gave Sigrist a strong start while his opponent, Jon Bolding, had yet to make a play. Bolding drew for his third turn and slammed [Blood Moon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Moon) on the table. From that point forward, Sigrist could do little more than watch as Bolding’s board slowly grew larger until it was big enough to crash sideways and earn Bolding a spot in the finals.

**2. Sigrist Goes Back to Back**

Last weekend, (16) Mike Sigrist went undefeated in the Swiss rounds of Grand Prix New York to enter the Top 8 as the top seed. This weekend, after another fifteen rounds of Swiss, Sigrist was, once again, in the elimination rounds. It’s absolutely absurd to Top 8 two tournaments with over 2,000 people in as many weekends. Sigrist continues to shock and amaze his adoring fans. #DadsRule

**1. Andreas Ganz Spoils His Win Conditions**

Andreas Ganz expected to win the first game of his semifinal match when he used [Spoils of the Vault](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spoils+of+the+Vault) to find his missing combo piece against Robert Graves. Ganz flipped cards from the top of his library and managed to hit all of his win conditions before finding the requisite Ad Nauseam to win the game. It put his back against the wall, but the Swiss doyen of Ad Nauseam rattled off four games in a row to become the Grand Prix Charlotte Champion!
