![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/GPFLO00/179.jpg)**Name:** Bram Snepvangers  
**Age:** 24  
**Location:** Utrecht, The Netherlands  
**Occupation:** Editor for the Union of Education  
**Played Magic since:** 1994, Antiquities  
**Best accomplishments:** 18th PT LA 1999, 26th PT Chicago 1999, 38th PT London 1999, 5th GP Amsterdam 1999, 2nd GP Cannes 2000



**Q: What made you decide to come to Grand Prix Florence?**  

A: Try to earn some PT points.



**Q: What were your expectations going into this tournament, and why?**  

A: Top 32, I thought I'd be able to beat combo but I had problems with fast, green decks.



**Q: Briefly describe your tournament play-wise so far, both day one and day two.**  

A: The first day I had two byes, then I played four combo-decks and went 8-0. I think it was a good deck for the metagame. And I didn't run into too many Survival decks or fast green decks - none at all actually in day one. Day two started quite badly, I played against Survival in the first three rounds and got one draw and two losses. But I managed to win the rest.



**Q: What do you think about the Extended metagame, and why did you choose to play the deck you did?**  

A: I think Trix is still too powerful. There's just too many of them in the top 8, and I don't think there were too many Trix decks in day one. I chose Oath because it has a very good chance against Trix and other combo decks, and it still has a chance against creature decks because of the Oath.



**Q: What do you think is the main reason for you making top 8 in this tournament, and why?**  

A: I chose the right deck, I think that's the most important thing.



**Q: What does this top 8 performance mean to you?**  

A: I think the most important thing for me is to be qualified for Tokyo. I had a good chance of qualifying on PT points, but I wasn't sure. I think I needed six points from Chicago and LA. Now I don't have to worry about that.



**Q: What are your predictions for the top 8?**  

A: I think I'll be able to win if I can win the quarterfinals.
