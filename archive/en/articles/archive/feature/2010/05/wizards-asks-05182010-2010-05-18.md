*What was the first deck you ever built?*

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/mtgcom/authorpics/authorpic_zachill.jpg)**Zac Hill:** The first deck I ever built was a red-green flying deck. The fact that red and green were the "worst" colors for flying creatures was totally unknown to me. While I had played **Magic** starting with *Revised*, I always just played other people's decks. The deck I built contained many, many [Kyscu Drake](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Kyscu%2BDrake) and [Spitting Drake](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spitting+Drake)s, and I think a [Whippoorwill](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Whippoorwill) because I thought it flew even though it didn't. One copy of [Viashivan Dragon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Viashivan+Dragon), baby!
