The June 8, 2016 update

The Daily *Magic* Update is a roundup of everything *Magic* you should know on June 8, 2016. Today's Update is brought to you by Gatherer, [which now contains all of the *Eternal Masters* cards](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&set=%5b%22Eternal+Masters%22%5d).


Today's Must
============


1. [Why Words Matter](https://motherofdragonsmtg.wordpress.com/author/megrickman/) | MotherOfDragonsMTG | Meg Rickman

On one hand, it's unfortunate that we're still in a place where articles about inclusivity in our game still have to be written. On the other hand, it's wonderful—given that need—to have well-articulated articles like this one to discuss and digest a better way. Here, a judge explains the ways in which words dissuade women from staying in a community and playing the game we all love.


After That, Read, Watch, or Listen to These
===========================================


1. [The Boogeyman Is Green](http://magic.tcgplayer.com/db/article.asp?ID=13323&writer=Seth+Manfield&articledate=6-8-2016) | TCGPlayer | Seth Manfield

At this point, I'm on a strict regimen of "do whatever Seth Manfield says or does." He wrote an article. Thus, I recommend it. It's that simple. Inside, you'll find more than just "Green-White Tokens is the best," as Seth walks through the pillars of Standard and even introduces some new lists to attack the metagame.


1. [Constructed Resources 49—Jace's What?](http://www.crcast.com/podcasts/constructed-resources-49-jaces-what/) | Constructed Resources | Marshall Sutcliffe and Eric Froehlich

Topics of the day include the dominance of Green-White Tokens and the puzzle of Mono-Blue Prison/[Engulf the Shore](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Engulf+the+Shore)s/[Jace's Sanctum](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace%27s+Sanctum)/[Day's Undoing](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Day%27s+Undoing)/Turbo Fog/whatever we're calling this deck. Plus, they talk about the [Looter problem](http://www.channelfireball.com/articles/luis-scott-vargas/whats-the-play-the-looter-problem/), because at this point, it's legally required for them to do so.


1. [Mono-Blue Prison Deck Guide](http://www.channelfireball.com/articles/mono-blue-prison-deck-guide/) | ChannelFireball | Frank Karsten

Well, I guess we're calling it Mono-Blue Prison, then. The [Engulf the Shore](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Engulf+the+Shore)s/[Jace's Sanctum](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace%27s+Sanctum)–based deck is all the rage for players looking for something new (including myself) and something weird, and Frank Karsten recently shook up Martin Müller's list a touch to finish 15th at [Grand Prix Costa Rica](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/gpcos16) last weekend. If you want analysis of a weird deck, Frank is the right place to look.


1. [Commander VS: Season 3 Finale!](http://www.starcitygames.com/article/33059_Commander-VS-Season-3-Finale.html) | StarCityGames.com | Justin Parnell and Stephen Green

No messing around on the season finale. It's [Kiki-Jiki](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=397698) vs. [Nekusar, the Mindrazer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nekusar%2C+the+Mindrazer) vs. [Xenagos, God of Revels](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Xenagos%2C+God+of+Revels) vs. [Karona, False God](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Karona%2C+False+God) in the last knock-down, drag-out fight of the season. You've been warned.


1. [*Eternal Masters*: New to Pauper Countdown](http://www.mtggoldfish.com/articles/eternal-masters-new-to-pauper-countdown) | MTGGoldfish | SaffronOlive and Jake Stiles

Check out the full rankings from the crew at MTGGoldfish for every card that will be newly introduced to the Pauper world with the release of *Eternal Masters*.


The rankings look great, just as long as we all understand they're all worse than [Mulldrifter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mulldrifter).


1. [Sequencing in Limited](http://www.channelfireball.com/articles/sequencing-in-limited/) | ChannelFireball | Neal Oliver

Neal puts into words something a lot of players have a difficult time articulating, let alone executing: how to properly sequence plays in Limited. It may seem like an in-the-weeds type of subject, but, as Neal demonstrates, it's paramount for finding the small advantages needed to win.


Top 25
======


1. Just about everyone moves on up

So there wasn't a ton of jostling in the Top 25 this week, as the rich just kept on getting richer. Specifically one particularly points-rich player. No. 1-ranked Seth Manfield racked up yet another Grand Prix win to further his already ridiculous point total. What was a 7-point lead over Owen Turtenwald is now 12, while his lead over the rest of the field is—well, it doesn't really matter. They're just not catching him.


So why so many up arrows this week? That would be because newly banned Fabrizio Anteri has been removed from the rankings. So everyone moves up, and some players move up just a bit more.


That also created one more open spot in the Top 25, welcoming Kentaro Yamamoto to the elite rankings. He'll need to have some strong finishes coming up to stay out of the trap door, but for now, enjoy yourself, Kentaro. You are among the best.

What to Watch Tonight
=====================


1. [Magic Mics](http://twitch.tv/magicmics)

The three-headed commentary monster that is Magic Mics is on tonight to slay you with thoughts, opinions, and sarcastic comments about the latest happenings in *Magic*. Reuben Bresler, Evan Erwin, and Erin Campbell will come straight to your computer 'round about 11 p.m. ET/8 p.m. PT tonight on [twitch.tv/magicmics](https://www.twitch.tv/magicmics).

> Who's fired up to wear an [#MasterChef](https://twitter.com/hashtag/MasterChef?src=hash) apron? It's time to find out: <https://t.co/WrXs7aNfnY> [pic.twitter.com/vWPDsqZcEL](https://t.co/vWPDsqZcEL)
> 
> 
>  — MasterChef (@MASTERCHEFonFOX) [June 8, 2016](https://twitter.com/MASTERCHEFonFOX/status/740464666313383936)

It's a little weird for me to suggest watching *Master Chef* on a *Magic* website, but here we are. David Williams (the one on the right in the gif above) is a longtime *Magic* pro currently competing on the show. Williams might be on the show for his fame in another competitive arena, but [we all saw that Grand Prix San Jose finalist plaque](http://i.imgur.com/RNpP110h.jpg) on his mantle the other week. We know where his heart lies.


Deck of the Day
===============


1. [Maddening Mongoose](http://puremtgo.com/articles/maddening-mongoose)

Eager for the release of *Eternal Masters*, Anthony Davis at [PureMTGO](http://puremtgo.com/) is already brewing with one of the newest additions to Pauper: [Nimble Mongoose](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nimble+Mongoose).


In the article linked above, Davis takes a Red-Green Madness list from Pauper-aficionado Alex Ullman and tunes it to set the 'goose loose. It's actually kind of amazing how closely it parallels a Standard deck from that era. [Werebear](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Werebear), [Nimble Mongoose](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nimble+Mongoose), [Wild Mongrel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Mongrel), [Basking Rootwalla](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Basking+Rootwalla), and [Arrogant Wurm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arrogant+Wurm) have been friends for a long, long time, and this deck gets to play all of them. In Pauper.


Honestly, it's getting to the point, especially with *Eternal Masters*, where a strong Pauper list could probably take down any number of fully-powered Standard decks. What Standard deck could stand against an opening of [Nimble Mongoose](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nimble+Mongoose) into [Wild Mongrel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Mongrel) discarding [Basking Rootwalla](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Basking+Rootwalla) into discard to cast [Arrogant Wurm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arrogant+Wurm)?


The starts won't all be that fast and brutal, but the fact that this deck is regularly capable of it and similar starts should be a touch scary for Pauper players. The combination of madness and threshold is a pairing made in mechanics heaven, and the synergy between the two—plus the discounts received for discarding or paying madness costs—drives the deck.
