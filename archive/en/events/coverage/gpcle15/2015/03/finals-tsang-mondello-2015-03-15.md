Jacob Van Lunen began playing Magic in 1995. He has participated in organized play at every level of competition and was a member of the winning team at Pro Tour San Diego in 2007, thanks to an innovative draft strategy. As a writer, Van Lunen has had more than three hundred Magic strategy pieces published 





Bill Tsang has been burning his way through the second day of competition. After an impressive 6-0 run through the first two drafts of the day, Tsang put together an aggressive Blue Red draft deck that has quickly dispatched of his first two opponents in Top 8. Eric Blanchet barely sat down before having his life total reduced to zero in two quarterfinal games and (21) Andrew Cuneo found himself on the losing end of a race thanks to Tsang’s [Act of Treason](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Act+of+Treason) and [Collateral Damage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Collateral+Damage) in the semifinals.



Jake Mondello managed to put together a consistently strong Temur deck with good mana and solid cards in this Top 8. Mondello managed to overcome both Ross Merriam and Gerard Fabiano’s Sultai decks on his way to the finals. Mondello has proven that his deck is capable of beating the most controlling opponents, but his next challenge is a much different animal.



In the first game, Tsang got off to a blisteringly fast start with [Valley Dasher](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Valley+Dasher) and [Mardu Scout](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mardu+Scout).



[Tuskguard Captain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tuskguard+Captain) from Mondello forced Tsang to use [Collateral Damage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Collateral+Damage) with his [Valley Dasher](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Valley+Dasher) to continue applying pressure.



Tsang only had Red mana, but it didn’t stop him from being the aggressor.

Mondello had a removal spell for seemingly every threat Tsang could muster, but Tsang was playing threats at such an accelerated rate that Mondello’s life total continued to dwindle.



Finally, Mondello managed to stabilize the game. It looked like he might have been out of the woods, but it didn’t take long for Tsang to find [Arrow Storm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arrow+Storm) and secure the first game of the finals in under four minutes.



**Tsang 1 - 0 Mondello**



Again, in the second game, Tsang got off to an aggressive start with [Humble Defector](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Humble+Defector) and [Mardu Scout](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mardu+Scout). Mondello had [Monastery Flock](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Monastery+Flock) and used [Hunt the Weak](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hunt+the+Weak) to make it a 1/6 blocking force.



It looked as if Mondello had stabilized with his 1/6 flyer. [Feral Krushok](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Feral+Krushok) and [Tuskguard Captain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tuskguard+Captain) followed close behind.



Tsang played threat after threat and his side of the board was growing with each passing turn. Mondello’s large bodies were still too much, though, and the game had become a stalemate.



It was a precarious situation for both players, even if they didn’t know it. Both players had [Icy Blast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Icy+Blast) somewhere in their deck and it seemed the game would likely be a race to find the powerful rare.



Mondello found it first, and was able tap down Tsang’s team and start applying pressure. Tsang had a removal spell and was able to survive at just one life before getting to untap his team.



Tsang’s [Humble Defector](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Humble+Defector) was passed back and forth as each player’s board continued to grow. On one particularly interesting turn, Tsang activated [Humble Defector](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Humble+Defector), then cast [Act of Treason](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Act+of+Treason) and activated it again.



Mondello had some [Humble Defector](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Humble+Defector) tricks of his own. He activated it, held priority, and used [Temur Charm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Temur+Charm) to fight the [Humble Defector](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Humble+Defector) with Tsang’s [Bloodfire Expert](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodfire+Expert) before drawing two cards.

Mondello found the requisite flyer, [Mistfire Weaver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mistfire+Weaver), to end the game in a single attack after countless stressful turns where either player could win or lose with the draw of a single card.



**Tsang 1 - 1 Mondello**



In the third game, Tsang curved [Valley Dasher](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Valley+Dasher) into [Bloodfire Expert](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodfire+Expert) into [Summit Prowler](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Summit+Prowler) over his first four turns.



Mondello was doing a good job of keeping up with [Wetland Sambar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wetland+Sambar) and Winterflame, but Tsang had [Shu Yun, the Silent Tempest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shu+Yun%2C+the+Silent+Tempest) for the follow-up and things were looking grim for Mondello.



Mondello managed to reset the board with [Waterwhirl](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Waterwhirl) when Tsang went for a removal spell. It looked like the bigger Temur deck might be able to overcome the Blue Red deck despite its excellent start.



Mondello had [Avalanche Tusker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Avalanche+Tusker) and [Highland Game](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Highland+Game) to stabilize the board and Tsang could only cast [Hordeling Outburst](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hordeling+Outburst). A seemingly timely [Dragonscale Boon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragonscale+Boon) untapped [Highland Game](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Highland+Game) to eat one of Tsang’s goblin tokens. This presumably strong play would prove to be a game breaking mistake, however.



Tsang cast [Act of Treason](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Act+of+Treason) targeting [Avalanche Tusker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Avalanche+Tusker) and forced the 4/3 [Highland Game](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Highland+Game) to block, thus killing both of Mondello’s creatures and leaving him without any relevant action.



[Hewed Stone Retainers](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hewed+Stone+Retainers) and [Shu Yun, the Silent Tempest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shu+Yun%2C+the+Silent+Tempest) were enough to win the game on the following turn when coupled with [Collateral Damage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Collateral+Damage).



**Tsang 2 - 1 Mondello**
