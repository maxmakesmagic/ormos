### SEPTEMBER EPISODE


* **Magic** art director and *Time Spiral* concept illustrator Jeremy Jarvis discusses crafting the visual style of the post-apocalyptic *Time Spiral*  world. **Magic**  hasn't been back to Dominaria for quite some time, and it's a very different place now. Included in the enhanced iTunes version of this podcast are several exclusive images from the style guide, along with more than a dozen final art pieces from the set.
* Who better to talk about making *Time Spiral* than head designer Mark Rosewater? Mark brings to light the philosophy behind a nostalgia block, what challenges design and development faced by bringing back elements of **Magic**'s past, previews Magus of the Scroll (viewable in the enhanced iTunes version), and much more, all in Mark's unique style.
* This Month in **Magic** showcases the upcoming events, focusing on when and where *Time Spiral* will see action. That all starts with the [Prerelease Events on September 23-24](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/prerelease/timespiral), and continues with the Release Tournaments, two upcoming Grand Prix and then Pro Tour-Kobe.

### WHAT IS PODCASTING?


Podcasting is delivering audio and video content on demand so that it can be enjoyed at the user's convenience. The main benefit of podcasting is that listeners can sync content to their media player and take it with them to listen whenever they want to. But they're not just for iPodsâ€¦the files are ready to watch or listen to on just about any computer.


1. Go to <http://www.apple.com/podcasting/>
2. Download iTunes version 7
3. Launch iTunes.
4. From the dropdown menus, select Advanced -- Subscribe to Podcast
5. When prompted for a URL, enter **<http://www.wizards.com/magic/rsspodcast.xml>** and click OK.

Once you subscribe to the podcast, iTunes will automatically check for new files and download them to your computer. To ensure that you get timely updates, set your Podcast Settings to check for new episodes every hour (the Settings button is in the lower-right corner of the iTunes window, or you can find it under Edit -- Preferences -- Podcast).
