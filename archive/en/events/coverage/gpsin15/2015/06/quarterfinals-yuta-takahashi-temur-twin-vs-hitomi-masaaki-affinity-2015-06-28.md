Yuta Takahashi's having quite a nice quarter. Having just won Grand Prix Kyoto, he followed that up with a Top 8 here in Singapore to lock up Silver. He is piloting Temur Twin, a deck that he chose to battle the rise of combo decks.


His opponent is a relative unknown compared to himself and should also be rejoicing in the fact that he was now qualified for Pro Tour *Battle for Zendikar*. His Affinity deck has served him well all weekend, especially the full set of [Etched Champion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Etched+Champion) which he was running.

Game One
========


Masaaki had a slow start, putting up only [Inkmoth Nexus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inkmoth+Nexus) and [Springleaf Drum](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Springleaf+Drum) on his first turn. Takahashi countered [Mox Opal](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mox+Opal) with [Spell Pierce](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spell+Pierce), but had no solution to [Etched Champion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Etched+Champion).


Takahashi tried to buy some time with Deceiver's Exarch, but he wasn't about to win. Masaaki had already successfully resolved [Spellskite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spellskite) and [Arcbound Ravager](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arcbound+Ravager) with success.


Takahashi's back was already against the wall but Masaaki was relentless and added a second [Etched Champion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Etched+Champion).

Takashi killed [Spellskite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spellskite) using a combination of [Snapcaster Mage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snapcaster+Mage) and [Lightning Bolt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt) but Masaki responded with [Galvanic Blast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Galvanic+Blast) on [Deceiver Exarch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deceiver+Exarch), ensuring that [Splinter Twin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Splinter+Twin) would not cost him the match.


Seeing no way out, Takahashi reached for his sideboard and they were on the the second game.


**Yuta Takahashi 0 – Hitomi Masaaki 1**


Game Two
========


Masaaki once again resolved [Etched Champion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Etched+Champion), this time with the help of [Mox Opal](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mox+Opal). [Cranial Plating](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cranial+Plating) turned the “lowly” 2/2 into a formidable clock.


Takahashi had the combo and tried to wrap things up by casting Deceiver's Exarch (and hopefully untap for [Splinter Twin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Splinter+Twin)).

However, Masaaki had the [Galvanic Blast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Galvanic+Blast) once again, prompting Takahashi to scoop up his cards. There was no way for him to beat a 10/2 [Etched Champion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Etched+Champion) at this point.


**Yuta Takahashi 0 – Hitomi Masaaki 2**
