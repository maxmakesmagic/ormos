Below is one of the sketches from the *Onslaught*  Style Guide, which is a document given to artists that worked on the set for reference. This sketch shows a "refugee" Wizard, meaning one that is not involved in the Pit-Fights. This Wizard is very "human" looking, unlike the Wizards in *Legions*. The Wizards in this block's later sets have started "liquifiying" as part of the Mirari's influence over the races of Otaria.

*Onslaught* cards showing such Wizards include [Ghosthelm Courier](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ghosthelm+Courier), [Aphetto Alchemist](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aphetto+Alchemist), and [Reminisce](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reminisce).
