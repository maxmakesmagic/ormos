March 15th, 9:30 a.m. – Top of the Trades
-----------------------------------------


*By Tim Willoughby*

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gpvie08/Top-of-Trades.jpg)At constructed Grand Prixs there can be only one winner, except for the other winners, the traders. Both on registration day, and this morning, there was more or less constant traffic at the trade stand. Good for them, and good for us too, as it gives us the first idea of cards and archetypes to be looking out for this weekend.


Cards for the new Spirit Stompy deck (the deck which abuses [Tallowisp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tallowisp) in new and naughty fashion to live the dream and [Armadillo Cloak](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Armadillo+Cloak) up fat monsters) were gone early on Friday, perhaps unsurprisingly, as the traders didn't have as many [Tallowisp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tallowisp) s on them as, for example, [Mutavault](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mutavault) s.


Components of [Enduring Ideal](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Enduring+Ideal) and Next Level Blue were popular, and with minutes to go before registration closed, there was but a lone foil [Spell Snare](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spell+Snare) left for anyone looking to stop [Tarmogoyf](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf) from the get-go. [Tarmogoyf](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf) itself, in spite of skyrocketing prices, remains a popular one, but that doesn't really feel like news any more.


More interesting was the rush on burn here in Vienna. [Spark Elemental](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spark+Elemental) s sold out fast, as did [Blistering Firecat](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blistering+Firecat) s. 60 [Shard Volley](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shard+Volley) s, 70 [Keldon Marauders](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Keldon+Marauders) and 40 [Barbarian Ring](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Barbarian+Ring) s were snapped up from one trader, who had packed extras, only to find that demand outstripped supply. Given this trend, it is unsurprising that [Sphere of Law](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sphere+of+Law) was also a popular choice for many.


Rounding things out, [Earwig Squad](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Earwig+Squad) was the big  *[Morningtide](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Morningtide)*  card in demand before the tournament began. While Goblins had a quiet season for much of Extended, the addition of the squad gives Goblins yet another line of attack that has seen a resurgence of little red (and now black) monsters in the Pro Tour Hollywood qualifying season, and now at the Grand Prix.


Will those last minute purchases turn out to be worth it? This is the weekend to find out.




March 15th, 9:30 a.m. – Welcome To Vienna
-----------------------------------------


*by Rich Hagon*

1150 players have made it to the fabulous Austrian city of Vienna, and that means 9 Rounds of Extended action lie ahead, before the lucky and good make it back on Day Two for 6 more slices of Swiss. Then it's single elimination for the surviving octet, and by the time Day Two of GP Philly is kicking into high gear, we should be well on the way to naming the first Grand Prix champion of the weekend. Join Rich Hagon and Ben Coleman as we bring you all the news and views from this ever-changing format.

March 15th, 9:50 a.m. – Friday Latenight Magic
----------------------------------------------


*By Tobias Henke*

Yesterday's last-chance GP trial saw 86 players fighting over those byes that would today allow them to catch up on the sleep they've been missing last night. Starting at 6 p.m. Friday evening and after seven rounds of Swiss, one can just imagine how happy everyone involved must have been, that there was only one more round to play. The quarterfinals saw *four* lucky winners walking away each with three byes – presumably directly to the tournament venue for the GP itself.


One of them, Florian Kirchbacher, didn't want to spoil his free 3-0 start by letting everyone in on his tech, so here are three:

March 15th, 10:50 a.m. – Checking out Vienna
--------------------------------------------


*By Tim Willoughby*

Last weekend I was in Shizuoka, Japan. Now I find myself in Vienna, Austria. Never have my chances for tourism been better catered for. Vienna is a city characterized by its history. One need only stroll around the city centre for a short while to be overawed by the incredible architecture. Alas, the town planners didn't make streets wide enough that I could fit some of the landmarks into a single photo. Part of this is that some buildings, such as the cathedral, are of a huge scale. The people in the photo below are not ewoks or child actors, placed there for scale. It is just that big, much like this weekend's event.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gpvie08/Cathedral.jpg)On a lighter note, Vienna is also home to GoodGames bear. GG bear is thus far undefeated at Magic, but he is kind enough to offer the handshake at the end of each and every game. Work commitments in his shop window means that he won't be playing this weekend. Probably just as well for everyone else.

Feature Match Round 3 – Stan van der Velden vs. Lubos Koudelka
--------------------------------------------------------------


*By Tobias Henke*

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gpvie08/StanV.jpg)*Stan van der Velden* Stan van der Velden can be considered a seasoned veteran of both the Pro Tour and the Grand Prix circuit, but in fact, he never made the gravy train. It seems, he is indeed the player with the most pro points lifetime never to reach the threshold of twenty within one season. Today, he as well as his opponent are sporting blue decks, Lubos a very nearly mono-colored version featuring [Spire Golem](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spire+Golem) s and [Trinket Mage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Trinket+Mage) s, while Stan is with Previous Level Blue.


Neither player mulliganed and the game began with both players playing land after land, and not doing much else. Both had early [Sensei's Divining Top](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sensei%27s+Divining+Top) s and a series of [Flooded Strand](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flooded+Strand) , [Polluted Delta](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Polluted+Delta) and Top activations ensued. Despite Stan Stifling one [Flooded Strand](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flooded+Strand) , in the end everyone got their lands and finally the real action could start...


First was Lubos with a [Spire Golem](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spire+Golem) , which brought Stan down to 15 with its first attack. After some more shuffling and topping, Stan suspended [Ancestral Vision](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ancestral+Vision) and went for [Tarmogoyf](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf) . Lubos countered – not by playing actual countermagic, but rather by playing yet another [Spire Golem](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spire+Golem) (which was met with [Counterspell](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterspell) ) and [Vedalken Shackles](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vedalken+Shackles) (which wasn't), even further speeding up his clock.


The next swing (with the now stolen [Tarmogoyf](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf) ) already left Stan sitting at precarious seven points of life. Frowning at the cards his Top revealed, he tried [Cryptic Command](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cryptic+Command) , which itself fell victim to Lubos' Command; his [Pernicious Deed](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pernicious+Deed) was then returned to his hand without ever hitting play by means of [Venser, Shaper Savant](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Venser%2C+Shaper+Savant) , and finally his second [Tarmogoyf](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf) stuck – even to his side of the board.


For the time being, only [Spire Golem](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spire+Golem) attacked, but [Trinket Mage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Trinket+Mage) threatened a lethal attack next turn and [Pithing Needle](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pithing+Needle) took care of the [Pernicious Deed](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pernicious+Deed) . Stan looked at the top of his library, frowned, looked at his hand, sighed, and then passed the turn right back to Lubos, who dutifully attacked with four all of his creatures. Nevertheless Stan was still hanging on. This time his [Cryptic Command](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cryptic+Command) hit [Vedalken Shackles](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vedalken+Shackles) and his [Tarmogoyf](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf) took down Venser.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gpvie08/Lubos-Koudelka.jpg)*Lubos Koudelka* Still, he went down to one life and, even worse Lubos played [Engineered Explosives](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Engineered+Explosives) that got rid off both [Tarmogoyf](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf) s. When his next draw didn't offer any answers Stan basically conceded, but still played [Haunting Echoes](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Haunting+Echoes) to get a sneak preview of what was awaiting him in Game 2. In fact, he only got to see one more [Force Spike](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Force+Spike) and that was the end.


The second game was a quick and clean affair. No mulligans once again, but this time Stan started off with a good first turn, suspending [Ancestral Vision](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ancestral+Vision) , while his opponent only had lands for the first couple of turns. But just when the Vision was about to unsuspend, Lubos played [Meddling Mage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Meddling+Mage) , making Stan's Vision stick to dreamland instead. The mage subsequently began his work on Stan's lifetotal and was later on joined by two [Spire Golem](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spire+Golem) s.


Stan... well, he never played another spell for the rest of the whole game. That turned out to be not quite as long as one might expect when two blue control-decks face-off. He conceded with a grip (nearly exclusively) full of lands.

Feature Match Round 4 – Countering Obliterate
---------------------------------------------


*by Tim Willoughby*

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gpvie08/Shuhei-is-ready-to-play.jpg)*Shuhei is ready to play*  With all the byes out of the way, Shuhei Nakamura bounced into the feature match area ready to play. Having spent his time between GP Shizuoka and this weekend skiing, Shuhei was sporting an unseasonable bit of sunburn, while the glow from his opponent, Stewart Shinkins of Ireland, was largely a reflection from the lurid pink hoody he was wearing. Shuhei is one of three Japanese players to make the trip out to Vienna, chasing Pro Points and more. Stewart didn't have quite so far to travel, and had something a little techy to show off in this varied Extended format, developed from what he played in Valencia.


The deck had been dubbed 'The St Patrick's Day Solution'. With Easter so early this year, St Patrick's Day had been moved to this very day, and Stewart had spent his byes celebrating. His deck was in green sleeves and he was ready to battle for his country.


Going first, Stewart lead with a [Breeding Pool](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Breeding+Pool) and [Sylvan Safekeeper](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sylvan+Safekeeper) (who apparently looks like St Patrick, and is being played by a lot of the Irish, and Raph Levy), while Shuhei had an [Irrigation Ditch](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Irrigation+Ditch) , which got hit by Ice from Stewart to effectively allow him to [Time Walk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Time+Walk) for a turn. A [Pithing Needle](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pithing+Needle) named [Carrion Feeder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Carrion+Feeder) , with Stewart proudly declaring that the card wasn't very good against TEPS anyway. He followed up soon after with a [Trinket Mage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Trinket+Mage) for [Sensei's Divining Top](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sensei%27s+Divining+Top) .


Shuhei was not actually playing TEPS though. His preferred extended deck remained Balancing Tings for this tournament. His first plays of the game were a pair of [Terrarion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Terrarion) s, He had a little think, before suspending [Lotus Bloom](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lotus+Bloom) , playing [Orim's Chant](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Orim%27s+Chant) , and sacrificing each of his permanents to set up a big [Balancing Act](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Balancing+Act) , to clear the board. He had land to follow up, but appeared to have been trumped by land and [Sensei's Divining Top](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sensei%27s+Divining+Top) from Stewart. Soon it was joined by [Vexing Sphinx](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vexing+Sphinx) .


Shuhei had all the right answers to this problem though, in the form of one card. [Insidious Dreams](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Insidious+Dreams) found him his side combo of [Erratic Explosion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Erratic+Explosion) and [Draco](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Draco) . Thanks to a few fetch lands and Ravnica duals on his opponent's side of the board, he was able to steal Game 1.


Shuhei Nakamura 1 – 0 Stewart Shinkins


Shuhei looked intently at his sideboard between games. He had seen 4 colours of control from Stewart's deck, so the only think he knew for sure was that there were a lot of options open to Stewart for the remaining games.


A turn one [Sensei's Divining Top](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sensei%27s+Divining+Top) was followed up by a turn two [Gaddock Teeg](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gaddock+Teeg) from Stewart, who was eager to avoid the big spells of Game 1 that had given him a hard time. He had a [Vendilion Clique](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vendilion+Clique) , which was responded to with Fire on [Gaddock Teeg](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gaddock+Teeg) , but that did clear out an [Insidious Dreams](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Insidious+Dreams) from Shuhei's hand.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gpvie08/Stewart-Shinkins-celebrates.jpg)*Stewart Shinkins celebrates St. Paddy's*  For much of the game, the action was on Stewart, and he played [Vexing Sphinx](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vexing+Sphinx) as a follow-up flyer. Shuhei was suddenly facing 7 in the air, and played a [Terravore](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Terravore) , perhaps signaling a [Balancing Act](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Balancing+Act) the following turn. His one [Terravore](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Terravore) could race quite effectively against any of Stewart's creatures. Shuhei went to 8 on attacks, before playing [Insidious Dreams](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Insidious+Dreams) for one card in his upkeep. Shuhei was down to just two lands, and Stewart jumped on the chance to let Ice act as a [Time Walk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Time+Walk) for him, by stopping any big plays using the card that Shuhei was about to draw.


On the back foot, Shuhei simply played an Archeological Dig and passed. He had Ice to tap down Stewart's Sphicnx, keeping him alive, but looked in grim shape when [Meddling Mage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Meddling+Mage) was played by Stewart, naming [Balancing Act](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Balancing+Act) .


Stewart's [Vexing Sphinx](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vexing+Sphinx) went away, allowing the Irishman to draw 3 cards, but he would not be doing a great deal else for the turn, as Shuhei had an [Orim's Chant](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Orim%27s+Chant) with kicker, to keep the turn quiet. On just 4 life, this was for the best for him. An Ice on a land from Stewart in Shuhei's turn was enough to finally finish of Shuhei though, his combo deck broken up.


Shuhei Nakamura 1 – 1 Stewart Shinkins


On the play, Shuhei had a mulligan, but his start of [Lotus Bloom](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lotus+Bloom) and a [Geothermal Crevice](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Geothermal+Crevice) was still threatening. Stewart, whose deck continued to surprise, led with a [Mogg Fanatic](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mogg+Fanatic) . He had a [Stifle](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stifle) for [Lotus Bloom](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lotus+Bloom) , keeping it out of play when its final suspend counter came off. Shuhei, suddenly without as much mana as he had hoped for, cracked one of his lands to play a 2/2 [Terravore](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Terravore) and passed the turn, blocker at ready.


While [Terravore](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Terravore) might block [Mogg Fanatic](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mogg+Fanatic) perfectly well, it can do little about [Lightning Angel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Angel) , who came in and immediately swung. Shuhei had a [Deathmark](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deathmark) for it the following turn, but by that point he had already taken 3 from the flyer. Stuart cracked a fetchland, making [Terravore](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Terravore) a 3/3, and played [Trinket Mage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Trinket+Mage) , fetching a [Meekstone](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Meekstone) that he then played. [Meekstone](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Meekstone) being out would virtually force a [Balancing Act](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Balancing+Act) from Shuhei, whose main offense – huge monsters, would be stymied by the 1 mana card that has been in the game for as long as the game has been around.


With [Terravore](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Terravore) locked down, Stewart got in with his team, and followed up with [Meddling Mage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Meddling+Mage) , naming Deathtouch. Shuhei's turn was quiet, but the following turn very busy. In the attack step, Shuhei had a [Quicken](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Quicken) , followed by [Obliterate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Obliterate) . This looked like a pretty good reset, but Stewart's response was better. With Shuhei on just 4 life, [Mogg Fanatic](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mogg+Fanatic) made it 3, and [Lightning Helix](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Helix) finished it.


[Obliterate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Obliterate) can't resolve if the match is already over.


Stewart Shinkins wins 2 - 1




Feature Match Round 5 – Jelger Wiegersma vs. Nico Bohny
-------------------------------------------------------


*by Tobias Henke*

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gpvie08/R5-Steady-Hands-Jelger.jpg)*Steady Hands Jelger* Jelger Wiegersma is today playing his own specialized version of Previous Level Blue, including [Pernicious Deed](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pernicious+Deed) and [Smother](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Smother) instead of the more usual [Vedalken Shackles](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vedalken+Shackles) and [Threads of Disloyalty](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Threads+of+Disloyalty) . Nico Bohny is here with a preatty straightforward AggroLOam.


Jelger took a long, hard look at his opening seven, before deciding to keep. Nico didn't need long and, likewise, didn't keep. He was fine with his six, however.


Although playing control Jelger got off to a really aggressive start with [Sensei's Divining Top](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sensei%27s+Divining+Top) and then [Stifle](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stifle) on Nico's first land-drop, followed by a turn 3 [Tarmogoyf](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf) . Three lands, Top and Goyf against one lonely basic mountain – looks like quite the board advantage.


[Tarmogoyf](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf) began his dirty work of applying large amounts of damage, while Nico played first [Life from the Loam](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Life+from+the+Loam) , then [Seismic Assault](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seismic+Assault) . The assault resolved – later it would be destroyed by [Pernicious Deed](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pernicious+Deed) , but until then it had already killed [Tarmogoyf](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf) . [Life from the Loam](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Life+from+the+Loam) got going, while Jelger got his own cardadvantage by suspending a chain of [Ancestral Vision](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ancestral+Vision) s.


At one point Nico decided it was time for [Devastating Dreams](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Devastating+Dreams) , leaving him with just enough mana to recast Life. Afterwards Jelger tried to keep Nico from his lands by repeatedly countering [Life from the Loam](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Life+from+the+Loam) with multiple [Spell Snare](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spell+Snare) s. In the end he couldn't keep up with the self-returning [Life from the Loam](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Life+from+the+Loam) , but the dredging took its toll, eating away large parts of Nico's library. By now, he was in the risk of running out of winning options... His [Terravore](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Terravore) was killed with the help of a timely [Smother](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Smother) , his [Countryside Crusher](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Countryside+Crusher) countered with [Cryptic Command](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cryptic+Command) . Even when [Cabal Therapy](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cabal+Therapy) revealed there was no counter in Jelger's hand, he still had [Sensei's Divining Top](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sensei%27s+Divining+Top) and a pair of [Flooded Strand](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flooded+Strand) s to ensure nothing really bad was going to happen.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gpvie08/Nico-Bohny.jpg)*Nico Bohny*  Finally another [Countryside Crusher](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Countryside+Crusher) came down and with about ten cards left in his deck, Nico apparently hit a gold vein. When his Crusher ate the opposing [Tarmogoyf](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf) with ease and apparent hunger, Nico was lured into over-extension. He played two more Goyfs, just to see all three of his creatures – each one of them capable of winning a game all by itself – whisked away by another [Pernicious Deed](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pernicious+Deed) . Now, Nico really was running out of cards. Two more [Smother](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Smother) s took care of the last two creatures in Nico's library and that was it.


Time was running low as well. With only ten minutes left on the clock when they finally shuffled up for game 2, both players speeded up quite a bit. That didn't help much, though, as both had to take mulligans. *Seven minutes*. Apart from cycling and fetching lands (which is rather time-consuming as well) the first real action took place on turn 2. [Cabal Therapy](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cabal+Therapy) from Bohny went for [Counterspell](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterspell) . *Six minutes*. Jelger played [Tarmogoyf](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf) , Nico [Putrefy](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Putrefy) . *Five minutes*. Jelger laid [Pernicious Deed](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pernicious+Deed) , which had to be killed before Nico could make any attempts at Jelger's life. He did so with [Engineered Explosives](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Engineered+Explosives) – *four minutes* – and then tore through Jelger's hand with yet another Therapy and [Birds of Paradise](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Birds+of+Paradise) to flashback it right away. This made the way clear for more Goyf. *Three minutes.* But with the aid of [Sensei's Divining Top](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sensei%27s+Divining+Top) Jelger first found [Smother](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Smother) and then [Cryptic Command](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cryptic+Command) for the [Terravore](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Terravore) following it. *Two minutes.* 


Now it was time for Jelger to get his own [Tarmogoyf](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf) into play. While being on the defense is fine when you're leading in games and time is running out anyway, simply attacking for the win is even better. While Nico drew a couple of lands in a row, Jelger's [Tarmogoyf](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf) did just that.

By now, we're already used to unusual hair or hat-styles at Grand Prixs. Here we see some fine celebration of St. Patrick's Day:


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gpvie08/st-patricks.jpg)


Others are trying to achieve a similar effect with their very own hair:


 


But first prize certainly goes to Ingo Muhs, Wizards' Organized Play Manager for Germany and Austria. He didn't believe that more than a thousand players would show up to compete in this years GP Vienna and actually agreed to the following bet: If registration closes with more than 1,000 competitors, he will have to dye his hair green or blue.


Fast forward to the present. As we know, GP Vienna is not only in the 4-digit area, but even the largest Extended GP ever!


Here you see the result:

Kids, don't ever bet against an European GP getting big.


Ingo is really happy anyway. In his own words: *"With this bet – I could only win."*




Feature Match Round 6 – Never Concede
-------------------------------------


*by Tim Willoughby*

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gpvie08/R6-Andre-Coimbra.jpg)*Andre Coimbra means business.*Rich Hagon, the voice of the event coverage, recently suggested in an article that a slightly ropey performance at Kuala Lumpur might signal a drop from form for Portuguese pro Andre Coimbra. He was quick to email, stating that he had something special for this very tournament. Currently undefeated, he sat down against German player Tobias Bosselmann, looking to continue his streak, while Bosselmann, in his first ever feature match, was hoping to make the most of the limelight by taking down a pro.


He started things off with a bang, playing a turn one [Isochron Scepter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Isochron+Scepter) , imprinting [Orim's Chant](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Orim%27s+Chant) , off a [Sacred Foundry](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sacred+Foundry) and a [Chrome Mox](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chrome+Mox) . Against a selection of Invasion block sacrifice lands, this looked pretty scary. Andre's deck was far from being a ponderous Scepter Chant deck that grinds out wins. A [Mogg Fanatic](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mogg+Fanatic) and [Mutavault](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mutavault) were soon hitting the red zone, while cards were going to the graveyard on the other side of the board, as Tobias' hand filled to overflowing.


Tobias had a [Magma Jet](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Magma+Jet) to kill [Mutavault](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mutavault) , but was still in rough shape. He had an Ice at the end of turn on [Isochron Scepter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Isochron+Scepter) , in the attempt to break through. He sacrificed his lands to get enough mana for [Seething Song](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seething+Song) , which was followed by [Enduring Ideal](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Enduring+Ideal) , to fetch [Dovescape](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dovescape) . This would mean that [Isochron Scepter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Isochron+Scepter) now tapped to produce a bird tokens, rather than the desired effect.


At the end of turn, Andre created four birds by casting [Insidious Dreams](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Insidious+Dreams) , without discarding any cards. He beat in with his team, and created another creature using [Sensei's Divining Top](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sensei%27s+Divining+Top) , before making two more with [Lightning Helix](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Helix) . Andre was playing for the out that the combo parts Tobias needed to find were in his opponent's hand. With more than 5 birds on Coimbra's side of the board, [Form of the Dragon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Form+of+the+Dragon) wouldn't be an out for Bosselmann, who really needed [Solitary Confinement](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Solitary+Confinement) .


As it turned out, this was a very good call. Tobias, on his turn, conceded. All the combo parts that he needed to find in his deck were sat in his hand, rendering him unable to deal with the threats on the board.


"Wow. I feel so smart for not conceding now." remarked Andre, who knew just how lucky he had been.


Andre Coimbra 1 – 0 Tobias Bosselmann


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gpvie08/R6-Tobias-Bosselmann.jpg)*So I can't play any spells - that could make things tough* Tobias was on the play for game 2, and had a [Lotus Bloom](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lotus+Bloom) to suspend. When he saw only [Sensei's Divining Top](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sensei%27s+Divining+Top) on turn two, he breathed a sigh of relief, compared with game 1. There was another sign for him soon thereafter though, as [Isochron Scepter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Isochron+Scepter) , imprinting [Orim's Chant](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Orim%27s+Chant) , came out again, though this time delayed by a single turn.


The lock was on... it was just a question of if Tobias could break it. This time Andre wasn't as quick to have follow-up beaters, but his Scepter was buying him plenty of time. Andre dug with his Top, seeing all sorts of goodness, including [Gaddock Teeg](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gaddock+Teeg) and fetchlands to allow reshuffles as necessary. Gaddock was not necessary in this game, and indeed the reshuffles were not needed with the top. The fetchlands simply ensured that [Insidious Dreams](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Insidious+Dreams) could be played. This fetched [Draco](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Draco) , allowing for a big [Erratic Explosion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Erratic+Explosion) , to drop Bosselmann to 2. A [Shrapnel Blast](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shrapnel+Blast) finished it.


Andre Coimbra wins 2 - 0

Feature Match Round 7 – Turning in one's Grave
----------------------------------------------


*by Tobias Henke*

Last year's Player of the Year is here today with Dredge, while Dinko Sulicic is playing [Death Cloud](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Death+Cloud) , which – in this match-up – is really just another Rock deck. Both were 5-1 at this point.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gpvie08/TheSaitouStaredown.jpg)Sulicic won the die-roll, but only had [Windswept Heath](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Windswept+Heath) on his first turn, while Saitou had [Cephalid Coliseum](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cephalid+Coliseum) and [Careful Study](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Careful+Study) , discarding [Golgari Grave-Troll](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Golgari+Grave-Troll) and [Narcomoeba](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Narcomoeba) . Sulicic fetched [Overgrown Tomb](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Overgrown+Tomb) , played another land and tapped out for [Tarmogoyf](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf) .


Saitou dredged in his draw step, hitting two [Narcomoeba](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Narcomoeba) s, a [Bridge from Below](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bridge+from+Below) and a [Cabal Therapy](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cabal+Therapy) , but no additional dredge card. Another [Careful Study](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Careful+Study) , however, found a second Troll and put both of them back where they belong. [Breakthrough](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Breakthrough) followed, dredging a total of sixteen cards but *not* the fourth [Narcomoeba](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Narcomoeba) . This only proved to be a minor inconvenience, as Saitou used his [Cabal Therapy](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cabal+Therapy) , not so much for the discard, but to turn one of his two Moebas into two Zombies to then be able to flashback [Dread Return](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dread+Return) . While Saitou was still contemplating what to name for the Therapy, Sulicic packed his cards for Game 2. A classic turn two kill.


Saitou 1 – 0 Sulicic


No wonder Sulicic was eager to get to on: Multiple [Extirpate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Extirpate) s and [Tormod's Crypt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tormod%27s+Crypt) s found their way out of his sideboard, while Saitou sideboarded [Pithing Needle](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pithing+Needle) and [Chain of Vapor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chain+of+Vapor) .


Dinko, once again, started with a fetchland and passed his turn, while Tomoharu was busy cracking his own to play [Careful Study](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Careful+Study) ... not discarding a single dredge card! One turn later he still had none, but [Pithing Needle](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pithing+Needle) as well as [Chain of Vapor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chain+of+Vapor) , both not the correct answer to [Extirpate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Extirpate) . The Needle came down anyway and in response Sulicic activated his [Sensei's Divining Top](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sensei%27s+Divining+Top) , but didn't activate his [Polluted Delta](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Polluted+Delta) , Saitou aptly named the land – a one turn set-back for Sulicic. In a match-up that sometimes doesn't get any further than turn two that's pretty dangerous.


On his next turn, however, Saitou tried to activate his own Delta and received a warning, while apologizing about a hundred times to his opponent. Also, he played [Putrid Imp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Putrid+Imp) and then a [Breakthrough](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Breakthrough) , keeping one card in hand, and finally managing to at least get one [Stinkweed Imp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stinkweed+Imp) into his graveyard. Not for long, it turned out. All [Stinkweed Imp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stinkweed+Imp) s were removed by [Extirpate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Extirpate) , further decreasing his chances of finding a much needed dredge card.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gpvie08/DinkoSulicic.jpg)Meanwhile Sulicic played lands, activated his Divining Top a couple of times, but was still trying to come up with anything like an actual clock. Eventually he found [Tarmogoyf](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf) and Saitou's Putrip Imp beatdown was instantly out-classed. A [Cabal Therapy](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cabal+Therapy) revealed [Ravenous Baloth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ravenous+Baloth) and [Damnation](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Damnation) and things weren't looking too good for the Japanese. Looking at his next card, he conceded.


Saitou 1 – 1 Sulicic


Some massive resideboarding (in fact, mostly de-sideboarding) took place on Saitou's part, while Sulicic only adjusted one card.


Saitou played first for Game 3 (which is good), but had to mulligan a hand without any dredge cards (which is bad). He was fine with his six – [Golgari Thug](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Golgari+Thug) , [Cabal Therapy](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cabal+Therapy) , [Cephalid Sage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cephalid+Sage) and some lands, among them two [Cephalid Coliseum](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cephalid+Coliseum) s. He applied some advanced therapy on the Thug, but before he could even dredge it once, it fell victim to [Extirpate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Extirpate) . With nothing better to do, Saitou played his topdecked [Narcomoeba](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Narcomoeba) and flashbacked [Cabal Therapy](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cabal+Therapy) , this time on his opponent, naming (and hitting) [Sakura-Tribe Elder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sakura-Tribe+Elder) .


Saitou topdecked yet another blank, laid his second [Cephalid Coliseum](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cephalid+Coliseum) and passed right back to Sulicic. With two cards in his graveyard as well as in his hand, those Coliseums weren't going anywhere...


It all started to look different though, when Saitou ripped [Breakthrough](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Breakthrough) from the top, easily the best card in this situation. He found a Grave-Troll, placed it in his graveyard, and kept another [Breakthrough](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Breakthrough) in his hand. If *he* didn't discard the [Breakthrough](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Breakthrough) , then Sulicic had to do it by means of [Duress](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress) . Saitou activated one of his [Cephalid Coliseum](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cephalid+Coliseum) s instead, but still couldn't find another dredge card, or a fourth land to activate the other Coliseum.


While Sulicic couldn't muster any more offense – or defense, for that matter –, Saitou's next turn saw him dredging up one more Troll and two [Stinkweed Imp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stinkweed+Imp) s. He then went on to activate his Coliseum, basically winning the match right there in classic Dredge fashion out of nowhere.


Tomoharu Saitou wins 2 - 1




Deck Tech – The St. Patrick's Day Solution
------------------------------------------


*by Tim Willoughby*

As a coverage reporter, one of the perks is having the opportunity to look through decklists as the tournament goes on. This post is one you will want to check back on tomorrow, when you will see a decklist that leaves me fractured in my thoughts. I am both confused, and profoundly impressed.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gpvie08/HappyStPatricksDay.jpg)Stewart Shinkins, and the Irish contingent that are here in Vienna, are celebrating the (moved) St. Patrick's day in special style. Stewarts deck is an intricate concoction that makes full use of the colour fixing in Extended right now to play a different brand of control. It turns out that it's not just Domain Zoo that can make the most of the synergy between Ravnica duals and Onslaught fetch-lands.


With access to every colour but black, Shinkin's deck is a rather clever control deck, that is more pro-active than many of the more blue-centric control decks in the room today. Designed by Steve Rouane, and tweaked by Stewart, it is full of creatures that feel like spells. With either [Meddling Mage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Meddling+Mage) or [Gaddock Teeg](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gaddock+Teeg) it can hit at the weak points of the various decks in the metagame while committing a threat to the board. There are some unusual cards in it, but they all work rather well together. Against combo, resolving [Sylvan Safekeeper](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sylvan+Safekeeper) and either [Meddling Mage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Meddling+Mage) or [Gaddock Teeg](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gaddock+Teeg) can make life very difficult for opponents, while in control matchups the eventual payoff in cards from [Vexing Sphinx](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vexing+Sphinx) is just as welcome as the 4/4 flying body. [Stifle](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stifle) is a strong answer to many of the more powerful cards in the format (not least fetchlands), but does double duty on keeping the Sphinx around.


Finally there is a slender [Trinket Mage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Trinket+Mage) toolbox package. It doesn't matter how many times I see it, I always love how [Trinket Mage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Trinket+Mage) slims down decklists while giving them more options, and a threat on top. Being able to fetch [Sensei's Divining Top](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sensei%27s+Divining+Top) or [Tormod's Crypt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tormod%27s+Crypt) is a little old hat by now, but there are still players unprepared for that [Meekstone](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Meekstone) , to hold off their entire team. A [Meekstone](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Meekstone) , that is, which does not hold off Shinkins' own [Lightning Angel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Angel) s.


This deck is an evolution of the deck that Shinkins played in Valencia, with some improvements, that has been doing very well on the Irish PTQ circuit, while not generating a lot of buzz. Well, the cat is out of the bag now. If you find yourself playing against a cheery Irishman in extended – expect the unexpected.

Feature Match Round 8 – Antoine Ruel vs Ivan Floch
--------------------------------------------------


*by Tim Willoughby*

At the start of the tournament, Olivier Ruel came up to me and said that I had to feature Antoine's deck early on in the tournament.


"It's really cool, but I'm not sure that he'll be playing later on"


Well, it's round 8, and thus far, Antoine has only picked up a single loss, putting him in good shape for the event so far. Against blue/green Tron in round eight, piloted by Ivan Floch of Sweden, it would be time to see what it could do.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gpvie08/Antoine8.jpg)Antoine had a mulligan for on the play, and led with Sakura Tribe Elder, off a [Plains](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plains) and a [Temple Garden](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Temple+Garden) . His opponent had acceleration of his own, in both [Chrome Mox](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chrome+Mox) and [Simic Signet](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Simic+Signet) .


Tron parts were a little slow showing up for Floch, who could only muster a wistful nod when he saw [Isochron Scepter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Isochron+Scepter) , imprinting [Orim's Chant](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Orim%27s+Chant) . He had an end of turn [Repeal](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Repeal) for it, leading to a similarly pained expression from Antoine. [Tarmogoyf](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf) was Antoine's next threat, which was hit by [Remand](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Remand) before making it to the table on the return visit.


At the end of turn, Floch reloaded with [Thirst for Knowledge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thirst+for+Knowledge) , discarding [Tormod's Crypt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tormod%27s+Crypt) . He transmured [Tolaria West](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tolaria+West) for [Urza's Tower](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Urza%27s+Tower) to complete his Urzatron, and passed, all of a sudden with a lot of mana up.


For a second time, Antoine played [Isochron Scepter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Isochron+Scepter) , but this time did not get as far as imprinting, with [Condescend](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Condescend) being Floch's response. While Antoine did resolve a top, he was well down on lands, as well as cards in hand following a second [Thirst for Knowledge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thirst+for+Knowledge) from Floch.


A [Sundering Titan](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sundering+Titan) from Floch was a huge threat, considering Antoine's land base of [Plains](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plains) , Mountian, [Forest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest) and [Temple Garden](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Temple+Garden) . When the massive monster hit play, it left Antoine with just a [Forest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest) . This was, unfortunately for Ruel, the only land he had in hand as well.


When a [Gifts Ungiven](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gifts+Ungiven) came from Floch, that was enough for Antoine to scoop up his cards.


Antoine Ruel 0 – 1 Ivan Floch


Antoine's deck had not been able to fire on all cylinders in Game 1, following its mulligan, and the countermagic of Floch, and a turn one [Chrome Mox](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chrome+Mox) threatened more countermagic for the second game also. Could Antoine get his Scepter going for game 2?


An [Orim's Chant](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Orim%27s+Chant) was imprinted in the second game, but this was on a [Chrome Mox](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chrome+Mox) . Antoine had no big plays before Floch could go for an end of turn [Gifts Ungiven](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gifts+Ungiven) , revealing [Tolaria West](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tolaria+West) , Life From the Loam, and the two remaining Urzatron pieces he required. Floch got one Tron piece and Life From the Loam, but lost his only green source, a [Breeding Pool](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Breeding+Pool) , to a [Boil](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Boil) from Antoine.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gpvie08/IvanFloch8.jpg)Now Ivan was digging, to get his engine going. He had an end of turn [Thirst for Knowledge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thirst+for+Knowledge) , discarding Moments Peace and [Flooded Strand](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flooded+Strand) . Antoine wasn't happy to see that he had naturally completed his Urzatron, and had a [Simic Signet](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Simic+Signet) to get him back on blue mana.


Ruel responded to the signet with a cycled [Decree of Justice](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Decree+of+Justice) for three tokens. While he could start beating, he would be facing a Life From the Loam engine that would be hard to fight. Floch had a [Triskelavus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Triskelavus) , while Antoine pumped the fist at having drawn a [Sensei's Divining Top](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sensei%27s+Divining+Top) . The Top did draw him [Destructive Flow](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Destructive+Flow) (a million turns too late), but the enchantment was hit by [Remand](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Remand) , to make sure that it would be even later.


Having seen the [Destructive Flow](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Destructive+Flow) , Floch started fetching basic lands with his fetchlands. Antoine had drawn virtually nothing but lands, and just scooped up his cards.


At this point Olivier Ruel came over to commiserate with his brother, with each of them now needing to win out for day 2. He also took the time to get a message in to the folks.


"I love my mum. I love my dad. I know it isn't my feature match, but they are his mum and dad too."


"You weren't even playing!"


"We have the same mum and dad though... I guess."


Ivan Floch wins 2 – 0




March 15th, 7:14 p.m. - Two Sides of the Coin
---------------------------------------------


*by Tim Willoughby*

We are now at round 9 for day one of GP Vienna; the moment at which for some the tournament is definitely over, and when others retire to prepare for a second days play. Given the size of this tournament, it has actually been two events all day, and it is interesting to see what has risen to the top in each.


As I walked the top 8 tables of each event, there were a couple of differences in the 'Vienna metagame' which may clash when the two tournaments merge for 128 players on Sunday.


On the 'Blue' side of the event (and as I'm blue/green colourblind that has been causing me trouble all day), Tron was the best represented in what can only be described as a wide open selection of decks. Two blue/green Tron decks, and a blue white were looking to do things with big mana. On the control side of things, there were one each of Previous Level and Next Level Blue, a pair of [Death Cloud](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Death+Cloud) decks, and an intriguing black/white control deck sporting both [Braids, Cabal Minion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Braids%2C+Cabal+Minion) and [Smallpox](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Smallpox) . For the beats, a pair of 5 colour beatdown decks, Affinity, Goblins and Doran were all up there. Finally, [Enduring Ideal](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Enduring+Ideal) and a pair of Dredge decks were riding high.


Over on the 'Green' side of things, a full *five* Dredge decks sat in the top 16, with TEPS being the only combo deck near the top. A pair of blue/green Tron decks, and one Next Level Blue were joined by two Doran decks, Aggro Loam and Red Deck Wins (with [Tarmogoyf](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf) ).


On either side of the bracket, there are some big names. Jelger Wiegersma has been reveling in all the quality counterspells available in today's extended, as has Remi Fortier on the other side of the room. Even more excitingly, there is the possibility that GP Vienna 2008 could have a repeat champion, as Nicolaus Eigner, the Vienna local who won here in 2004 has been high in the standings all day with Dredge.




March 15th, 8:00 p.m. – 21 or Bust
----------------------------------


*by Rich Hagon*

So, there you are, sitting at 6-2, almost 11 hours after you started playing Magic, knowing that you have to win this last crucial match of the day. And you do. And you finish 65th. Or 66th. And go home. 4 players saw their worst tiebreak nightmares come true as Day One came to a close here in Vienna. Now 128 will battle it out over six more Swiss rounds before the Top 8 is known. And of course, tiebreaks or not, we'll be here to cover it, so join us bright and early for the conclusion of this Extended Epic. Or is that Epic Extended?! Whichever, this is the Ideal place to find out.

Feature Match Round 9 – Helmut Summersberger vs. Sebastian Thaler
-----------------------------------------------------------------


*by Tobias Henke*

The two friends, Austria's top pro Helmut Summersberger, and the 2006 Rookie of the Year Sebastian Thaler from Germany are both 7-1 and will be making day two even with a loss in the last round. Nevertheless they were discussing the possibility of an intentional draw, instead of playing, but luckily decided against it, and now we're actually *having* a match to cover.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gpvie08/Thaler9.jpg)Thaler lost the die-roll and kept his opening...– six. After all the first thing he did was putting a free [Leyline of the Void](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leyline+of+the+Void) into play. Consequently, Summersberger's turn one [Mogg Fanatic](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mogg+Fanatic) seemed a little bit less exciting. [Careful Study](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Careful+Study) discarded [Stinkweed Imp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stinkweed+Imp) and [Golgari Grave-Troll](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Golgari+Grave-Troll) and as we have seen before, Thaler's [Breakthrough](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Breakthrough) scheduled for his second turn might really be enough to win the game. Summersberger was not to be defeated that easily however, and played [Meddling Mage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Meddling+Mage) naming [Dread Return](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dread+Return) . To make matters worse, his [Breakthrough](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Breakthrough) netted him one [Narcomoeba](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Narcomoeba) only and not even enough dredge cards to avoid drawing actual cards... *into his hand!*


Instead he flashbacked [Cabal Therapy](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cabal+Therapy) (missing) but getting one zombie token in the process. Summersberger played [Tarmogoyf](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf) , another land and passed right back to Thaler, who in his upkeep returned one [Ichorid](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ichorid) to play. In his draw he dredged into more [Bridge from Below](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bridge+from+Below) and more [Cabal Therapy](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cabal+Therapy) ... He then played the [Breakthrough](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Breakthrough) he was holding on to after the first one: All of his [Narcomoeba](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Narcomoeba) s and the remaining Bridges entered play and graveyard respectively. Next up, the [Cabal Therapy](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cabal+Therapy) was flashbacked, this time hitting [Lightning Helix](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Helix) , all the while producing four zombie tokens. With the impending departure of [Ichorid](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ichorid) about to issue another four complimentary zombies (for a total of eight) Sumersberger just shrugged and shuffled up for Game 2.


Thaler 1 – 0 Summersberger


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gpvie08/Summersburger9.jpg)Summersberger started with a mulligan, while Thaler again had the Leyline on turn zero.


[Bloodstained Mire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodstained+Mire) from Summersberger fetched [Steam Vents](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Steam+Vents) into [Mogg Fanatic](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mogg+Fanatic) yet again. This time though, [Cabal Therapy](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cabal+Therapy) on [Meddling Mage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Meddling+Mage) , revealed a hand that was lacking pressure, defense, and also [Meddling Mage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Meddling+Mage) . Summersberger just attacked and passed his turn without any play. Thaler played [Pithing Needle](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pithing+Needle) (naming [Tormod's Crypt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tormod%27s+Crypt) ), but couldn't expand on his graveyard plans.


Next turn however saw him play [Tolarian Winds](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tolarian+Winds) . Unfortunately, he didn't have any dredge cards and even worse had to discard two [Narcomoeba](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Narcomoeba) s., while Summersberger first hit with a [Lightning Helix](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Helix) and then increased his beatdown by one [Goblin Legionnaire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Legionnaire) .


The damage he took from his lands so far had brought Thaler down to low life, and [Tribal Flames](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tribal+Flames) basically took him down to four. With Legionnaire and [Mogg Fanatic](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mogg+Fanatic) this was actually more like *one* life and that's pretty bad when your lands are [City of Brass](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=City+of+Brass) , [Cephalid Coliseum](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cephalid+Coliseum) , and [Polluted Delta](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Polluted+Delta) ...


Thaler 1 – 1 Summersberger


Thaler mulliganed down to five, and still didn't have a very good draw. He just led with [Watery Grave](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Watery+Grave) – *tapped*. On the other side there was yet another [Steam Vents](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Steam+Vents) and yet another [Mogg Fanatic](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mogg+Fanatic) – only this time no Leyline would be interfering with the Fanatic's work.


Without the Leyline to hide behind, Thaler's deck had to play fair... Suddenly creatures were trading against each other or being killed by burn, without any zombies popping up to replace them. Something like a real fight developed – a rare feature, seeing as the Dredge deck usually either runs over the opponent or succumbs to hate or really bad draws.


In the end, though, they ran out of time. Both of them claimed one more turn would have surely won them the game and match, but as of the end of extra-turn number five, there was no winner.


So, Helmut Summersberger draws unintentionally with Sebastian Thaler – both enter day 2 with 22 points, in 19th and 21st place, respectively.
