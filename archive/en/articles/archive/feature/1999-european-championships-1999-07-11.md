**Sturla Bingen** will be pleased to know that his European Champions 
title of last year remains in Norway as **Nicolai Herzog** emerged as the 
winner today in Berlin after some exciting final matches. Nicolai is fairly 
unknown outside of Norway, although he competed in several tournaments abroad. 
His newly won trophee won't lack company though as he became the 1999 National 
Champion of Norway a couple of weeks ago. 




**Final top 8:**





1. Nicolai Herzog - Norway
2. Dirk Baberowski - Germany
3. Pierre Malherbaud - France
4. RaphaÃ«l Levy - France
5. Mattias Jorstedt - Sweden
6. Tommi Hovi - Finland
7. Arto Hiltunen - Finland
8. Holger Meinecke - Germany
