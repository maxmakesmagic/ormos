What is the best trade you've ever made in which you traded away a **Magic** card (or cards) for a non-**Magic** item?


Â 


![Mark Rosewater](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration//magic/images/mtgcom/authorpics/authorpic_MarkRosewater.jpg)**Mark Rosewater:** I think the best I've ever done is to trade a [Shivan Dragon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shivan+Dragon) for a large pizza. I was at a convention late night (this is before I worked for Wizards) and I was hungry. A friend who had been bugging me for my Shivan walks by with a fresh pizza that had just been delivered. I say, "So, do you really want the Shivan?"


The best trade I ever made is technically ineligible (since it's also partly a sale as opposed to just trading) but it's a good story. When *Legends* came out I bought a whole bunch of boxes, one of which I kept stashed away. When *Revised* (aka *Third Edition*) was going away, I managed to trade my *Legends* box for a case of *Revised*. Years later when I wanted to buy a very expensive television set ($2500 at the time and this was many years ago), I was able to cash out my case of *Revised* and use the money directly to buy the television which I still have to this day. That *Legends* box has provided hours and hours of entertainment.
