The Walking the Planes crew visits a local store to find out what players brought to battle with at the first post-rotation Friday Night *Magic* after the release of *Kaladesh*. Gearhulks smashed, Vehicles were crewed, and inventions were forged as players got creative with *Kaladesh*.


What will you create at your next Friday Night *Magic*?
