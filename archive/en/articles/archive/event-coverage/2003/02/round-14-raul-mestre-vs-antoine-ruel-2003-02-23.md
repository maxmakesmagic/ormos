Winner goes to the Top 8, loser gets his money and moves on to the side events. Raul Mestre was already denied a Grand Prix Top 8 (Valencia) by a Ruel brother (Olivier).

### Game 1

Raul thought long and hard before keeping a very risky one-land hand (One [Swamp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swamp), [Weathered Wayfarer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Weathered+Wayfarer) and [Swat](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swat), going second against Blue-White). His deck didn't help at all. Silently Antoine Ruel pounced on the opportunity, basically the same as taking three Time Walks. Finally Mestre found a second land, but he was at thirteen facing three creatures. 

He thought a few moments about it, shoke is head and scooped the too lands.

Raul: "My fault. I shouldn't have kept that hand." 

Antoine 1-0 Raul.

### Game 2

Things weren't any better on the second game. Mestre had to take a mulligan. His second hard had some fire to it. He started with [Wretched Anurid](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wretched+Anurid) and laughed when Ruel dropped [Disciple of Grace](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Disciple+of+Grace). Things surey weren't going his way in this match. As the French accumulated creatures Raul Mestre tried to find a way out of this mess.

A Redeemer made attacking a bad idea, while Antoine's flyers went to work through the air. Unmorphing Skithinner solve the Redeemer problem. Antoine just show him a bigger one: [Jareth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jareth). Mester's jaw dropped. He looked at the table, recheck his dwiddling life total and extended his hand with a smile.

**Final Result:** Antoine 2-0 Raul.
