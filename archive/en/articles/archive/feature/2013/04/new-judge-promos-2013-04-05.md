The judge program is an important part of **Magic**. Thousands of individuals participate in events not by shuffling the cards, but by answering rules questions, cutting match slips, and making sure events run as smoothly as possible.


In recognition of being a cornerstone of **Magic** communities around the world, we give judges special promo cards.


Today I get to show you the two newest promos for our judge community: [Crucible of Worlds](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crucible+of+Worlds) and [Bribery](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bribery)!
