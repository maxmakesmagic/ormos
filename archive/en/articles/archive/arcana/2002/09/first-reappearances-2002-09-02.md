At this point in **Magic**'s history, most players are used to the fact that some cards are taken out of the base set only to return later. For example, [Serra Angel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Serra+Angel), [Unholy Strength](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Unholy+Strength), and [Mahamoti Djinn](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mahamoti+Djinn) were all not in *Classic (Sixth Edition),* but appear in *Seventh Edition.* But what cards started this trend? What two cards were the first to be left out of a base set, only to reappear later? Answer below.


  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
Both [Twiddle](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Twiddle) and [Ironclaw Orcs](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ironclaw+Orcs) were in the base set through Unlimited, taken out for *Revised*, and reintroduced in *Fourth Edition.*
