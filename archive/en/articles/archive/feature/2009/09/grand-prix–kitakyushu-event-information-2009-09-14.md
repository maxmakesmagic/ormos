The city center dates back centuries to when it was a castle town known as Kokura, which guarded the Straits of Shimonoseki between Honshu and Kyushu. Although known to gourmets as the city where yakiudon was created, Kitakyushu is perhaps best known to fans of history due to its proximity to Ganryu-jima, the locale of the famous sword battle between the legendary Miyamoto Musashi and Sasaki Kojiro. This is the third Grand Prix to be held in Kitakyushu and the fifth in Kyushu. 


*The **Magic: The Gathering**  Grand Prix tournament series is a great reason to get out of the house, catch up with old friends, meet some new ones, and play **Magic**. Grand Prix tournaments are world-wide open events that allow all **Magic**  players to participate and experience the thrill of a large-scale competition. In addition to $30,000 in cash prizes, Pro Tour invitations for the top 16 finishers, and exclusive foil promo cards for participants, Grand Prix feature a host of other activities, including public events and artist signings.
