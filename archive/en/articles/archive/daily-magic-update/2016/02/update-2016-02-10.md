The February 10, 2016 Update

The Daily *Magic* Update is a roundup of everything *Magic* you should know on February 10, 2016. Today's Update is brought to you by [Fish, the only force in the Multiverse more powerful than the Eldrazi](#fish). Maybe.


Today's Must
============


1. [Modern Shouldn't Be a Pro Tour Format](http://www.channelfireball.com/articles/modern-shouldnt-be-a-pro-tour-format/) | ChannelFireball | Owen Turtenwald

Owen's article today is an extension of a discussion that started as the Pro Tour *Oath of the Gatewatch* Top 8 was getting underway, and it's a multilayered discussion with a lot of potential consequences and talking points. Owen doesn't want to do away with Modern—he thinks keeping it around for Grand Prix and the World Championship is great—but he does want to seriously consider removing it as a Pro Tour format, and he tells you why in this article. What do you think?


After That, Read, Watch, or Listen to These
===========================================


1. [Pro Tour *Oath of the Gatewatch*: The Real Rise of the Eldrazi](http://www.rocketjump.com/listen/10992) | Masters of Modern | Alex Kessler and Ben Bateman

The Masters of Modern were all over this Pro Tour before it happened, and they're all over it now that it's in the books. Is there a way to beat the Eldrazi? If it's there, these guys sure are going to scour all of Modern for it.


1. [Deck Improvement: Meren of Clan Nel Toth with Alex Kessler](http://www.rocketjump.com/listen/deck-improvement-meren-of-clan-nel-toth-with-alex-kessler-96) | The Command Zone | Jimmy Wong and Josh Lee Kwai

Alex Kessler is the special guest on this episode that tackles building with [Meren of Clan Nel Toth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Meren+of+Clan+Nel+Toth), discussing tackling problem areas, how to fix them, and Meren's decorating tips for using floating skulls. Maybe not that last one, but they should.

It's not every day our coverage folk do guest voice appearances on LoadingReadyRun videos, so for a quick, amusing bit (which is what their Crapshots series is all about) featuring the soothing voices of Marshall Sutcliffe and Rich Hagon, click below.

The [Pro Tour Gauntlet](http://magic.wizards.com/en/MTGO/articles/archive/pro-tour-gauntlet-oath-gatewatch-details-2016-02-09) starts *today*! With it you can test-drive the best decks from Pro Tour *Oath of the Gatewatch*, including, yes, the Eldrazi decks. Just be glad Merfolk didn't do well at the Pro Tour, because apparently, [that might be the cure for the Eldrazi overlords](#fish).

[@Quick\_MTGStat](https://twitter.com/Quick_MTGStat) has been busy lately, churning out stats on the Pro Tour, including this cool series on what players did the best in their first X Pro Tours or last X Pro Tours, or any number of ways to look at the data. I imagine (though don't know for sure) that things will get quiet until the next Pro Tour, and then heat up again. But that's just a guess based on the rate of tweets posted by this account. See—statistics!


The Top 25
==========


1. The More Things Change, the More They Stay the Same

Pro Tours always shake things up in the Top 25 Rankings, and this time is no exception. We have four new entries, a player who gained double-digit spots, one who shot into the Top 10 from not even being on the rankings, and two who very nearly fell off after lackluster Pro Tour performances.


Among the big winners this week are Ivan Floch, who jumped into the Top 10 from nowhere thanks to his second-place finish, Thiago Saporito, who finished 29th at the Pro Tour, and Luis Scott-Vargas, returning to the Top 25 after a prolonged absence thanks to his Top 4 finish.


But, of course, not everything changes. The top two on the list stayed exactly the same, as Owen Turtenwald finished the first half of this campaign as the Mid-Season Master, extending his lead even further over Seth Manfield. Paul Reitzl and Martin Müller also put up strong performances and kept their spots in the Top 10 exactly.

Deck of the Day
===============


1. [The Answer to the Eldrazi Might Just Be...Fish?](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/mtgo-standings/modern-constructed-league-2016-02-09)

Early results from the first post-Pro Tour Modern Leagues are coming in, and players are clearly looking to either beat the Eldrazi—or join them. There have been a number of 5-0 finishes playing the otherworldly creatures, but they're not the only creature type flooding over Modern. Merfolk, with their Island-changing capabilities and quick clock, actually seem to be putting up a fight against the Eldrazi, placing multiple players at 5-0 with the fishiest of tribes. WUBY123 here even went so far as to play a [Sea's Claim](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sea%27s+Claim) in addition to four [Spreading Seas](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spreading+Seas), plus a [Psionic Blast](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psionic+Blast) for a bit of reach. Also notice the complete lack of [Kira, Great Glass-Spinner](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kira%2C+Great+Glass-Spinner). When the decks you expect to play against have very little removal, Kira only slows down your clock, and this version is built for speed.
