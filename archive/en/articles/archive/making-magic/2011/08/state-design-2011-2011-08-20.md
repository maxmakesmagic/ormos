 Working in R&D since '95, Mark became Magic head designer in '03. His hobbies: spending time with family, writing about Magic in all mediums, and creating short bios. 





As Head Designer, I write a column every year where I examine the current state of **Magic** design by looking back at the previous year to appraise what went right and wrong with **Magic** design. I then look ahead and explain what goals we have for the year ahead. This is my seventh State of Design column; you can see the previous six here: [2005](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/daily/mr191), [2006](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/daily/mr242), [2007](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/daily/mr292), [2008](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/magazine/article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/mm/2), [2009](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/mm/53), and [2010](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/magazine/article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/mm/110).
