Happening September 12–14, 2014, this year's *Magic Online* Community Cup is sure to bring three days of entertainment, and perhaps a surprise or two, as we bring eight competitors to Seattle to compete for the Erik "Hamtastic" Friborg Memorial Trophy against the Wizards team. We will be announcing the Wizards team and more about the event in the coming weeks as the event draws nearer.



Mark your calendar for the September 12–14 weekend, as it will be three days of streaming *Magic* that you don't want to miss!
