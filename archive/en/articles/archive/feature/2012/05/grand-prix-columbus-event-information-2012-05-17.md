* Where necessary, the standings after the Swiss rounds will still be used to determine final order in the standings.
* For the first game of each match in the Top 8, the player that finished higher in the Swiss rounds chooses either to play first or to play second. For subsequent games in each Top 8 match, the usual Play/Draw rule applies (loser of the previous game decides whether to play first in the next game).

### Things to See and Do in Columbus


Columbus is fortunate to have a dynamic downtown, a wonderfully bohemian arts district, a lively theater and music scene, and top-notch museums. It's also the home of The Ohio State University (never leave off that "The"), which on football weekends is a Mecca for red-jersey-clad fans and an upper-echelon academic institution the rest of the year.


In downtown Columbus alone, you'll find more than 100 restaurants offering most every kind of cuisine.


You can touch a real, massive iceberg and see 20-plus artifacts on exhibit for the first time anywhere at "Titanic: The Artifact Exhibition" thru Sept. 6, 2010 at [COSI](http://www.cosi.org/). 


Visit the world renowned [Columbus Museum of Art](http://www.columbusmuseum.org/).


Watch polar bears as they frolic underwater and swim overhead as you walk through an acrylic tunnel under their huge pool. Polar Frontier opens this spring at the [Columbus Zoo and Aquarium](http://www.colszoo.org/). 


Climb aboard the Santa Maria, the world’s most authentic replica of Christopher Columbus’ ship. Learn about the teamwork it took to survive while crossing the Atlantic. 


Go birding at the [Grange Insurance Audubon Center](http://grange.audubon.org/), which opened in 2009 as one of the first Audubon centers close to the core of a major American city.
