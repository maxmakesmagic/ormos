****Name:**** Max Mcvety


**Age:** 24


**Occupation:** Mechanical Engineer


**Hometown:** Ann Arbor, MI


**Previous *Magic* accomplishments:**


Two GP Top 8s; SCG Invitational Champion


**What deck did you play this weekend and why?**


Black-Red [Hollow One](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hollow+One). The deck is broken. My two losses were to the mirror match.


**What was the best card in your main deck and why?**


[Faithless Looting](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Faithless+Looting). It helps win both your fair and broken draws.


**Did any cards or decks surprise you?**


[Lightning Bolt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt). I started out the tournament boarding it our a lot, but I realized that was wrong and [Lava Spike](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lava+Spike) with upside isn't so bad in this deck.


**What does this Top 8 mean to you?**


It locks me for Silver Pro Players Club status, and shows that Oliver Tomajko and Ethan Gaeski are great [Hollow One](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hollow%C2%A0One) deck builders. Also thanks to RIW Hobbies for being a fantastic sponsor.

**Hometown:** Phoenixville, PA


**Previous *Magic* accomplishments:**


1 SCG Open Top 8. Two-time Game Day Champion. L2 Judge.


**What deck did you play this weekend and why?**


Amulet Titan. The deck is secretly busted. It’s got good matchups versus basically everything once you figure them out.


**What was the best card in your main deck and why?**


[Primeval Titan](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Primeval+Titan)—have you read that card?


**Did any cards or decks surprise you?**


[Torpor Orb](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Torpor+Orb). It got played against me in both win-and-ins.


**What does this Top 8 mean to you?**


I’ve finally cashed a Grand Prix that I wasn’t judging.

**Name:** Gene Friedman


**Age:** 29


**Occupation:** Employee for Children’s Services (ACS)


**Hometown:** Queens, New York City, NY


**Previous *Magic* accomplishments:**


Won a RPTQ a few weeks ago. Many PPTQ Top 8s and StarCityGames IQ Top 8s.


**What deck did you play this weekend and why?**


Burn. It’s my favorite deck and is what I am most comfortable with.


**What was the best card in your main deck and why?**


Skull Crack. It cancels out Burn’s worst enemy: life gain.


**Did any cards or decks surprise you?**


No.


**What does this Top 8 mean to you?**


Every. I’m going to the Pro Tour for the first time regardless of how I do in the Top 8. All my playing and hard work in the game has paid off. It’s my greatest *Magic* accomplishment to date.

**Name:** Matt Grahn


**Age:** 22


**Occupation:** Student at Quinnipiac University


**Hometown:** Hebron, CT


**Previous *Magic* accomplishments:** 9th at a PPTQ


**What deck did you play this weekend and why?** Elves, I had the cards and I’ve worked on it since the GP was announecd.


**What was the best card in your main deck and why?** [Shaman of the Pack](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shaman+of+the+Pack). It’s a nice punch to the face that helps you win.


**Did any cards or decks surprise you?** The guy I lost to in the Swiss put [Goblin Guide](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Guide), [Ramunap Ruins](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ramunap+Ruins) and [Hazoret the Fervent](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hazoret+the+Fervent) into his Eldrazi aggro deck.


**What does this Top 8 mean to you?** Not sure yet. I would’ve been happy just making Day 2. Let’s see if my *Magic* friends from QU step up their game!

**Name:** Frank Skarren


**Age:** 27


**Occupation:** Loan Officer Assistant


**Hometown:** Merrick, NY


**Previous *Magic* accomplishments:** Winner at GP Charlotte in 2013 and GP Philly in 2014. Also made the Top 8 of a SCG Invitational.


**What deck did you play this weekend and why?** Affinity - I used to play Affinity a lot and I feel like it is in a good place in the meta again.


**What was the best card in your main deck and why?** Either [Cranial Plating](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cranial+Plating) or [Etched Champion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Etched+Champion). Plating is busted and Champion is an ace against all the fair decks.


**Did any cards or decks surprise you?** Not really. A lot of different decks but nothing mindblowing.


**What does this Top 8 mean to you?** More than I can explain. It’s been a while since I’ve had a strong finish. Getting back on the Pro Tour is huge.

**Occupation:** Landscaper


**Hometown:** Preston, CT

**What deck did you play this weekend and why?** Bogles because the deck is consistent at closing games.


**What was the best card in your main deck and why?** [Ethereal Armor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ethereal+Armor), because it is far better than [Lightning Bolt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt) on a bad day.


**Did any cards or decks surprise you?** Elves. The tribe put up a good fight.


**What does this Top 8 mean to you?** This Top 8 is a leap from unknown amatuer to the MTG Hall of Fame - here I come!

**What was the best card in your main deck and why?** KCI, because I need it to win.


**Did any cards or decks surprise you?** [Engineered Explosives](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Engineered+Explosives) because it answers everything.

**Name:** Kellen Pastore


**Age:** 27


**Occupation:** Phd Candidate


**Hometown:** Maple Glen, PA

**What deck did you play this weekend and why?** Bogles. [Gryff's Boon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gryff%27s+Boon) is very good.


**What was the best card in your main deck and why?** [Gryff's Boon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gryff%27s+Boon). It’s a recursive threat, I always win when I play it.


**Did any cards or decks surprise you?** Bogles - it was much better than I thought.


**What does this Top 8 mean to you?** I get to play more *Magic,* and Ralph Betesh was right about [Gryff's Boon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gryff%27s+Boon).
