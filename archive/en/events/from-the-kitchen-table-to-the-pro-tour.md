STARTING OUT
------------

Your first step is to check out a tournament held at your local game store. The best places to start are:


* [Friday Night Magic](/content/friday-night-magic-1)
* [Prerelease Tournaments](/content/eventsprereleases)
* [Magic Game Day](/content/eventsscheduleseventtypesmagicgameday)

 


These tournaments are usually comparatively casual affairs that typically feature:


* Formats friendly to newer players
* Lower-level rules enforcement
* A fun, welcoming atmosphere

 


Most players are at these types of tournaments for the same reason as you: to have a good time! It’s not uncommon for even experienced players to come to Friday Night Magic with fun, experimental decks, or for new players to play one of their first tournaments at a Prerelease.


These more casual events are also great for meeting people and getting to know your local Magic community. If you have dreams of playing on the Pro Tour—or if you just want to get better and have some fun—chances are, there’s someone at your local store who can help you improve.
