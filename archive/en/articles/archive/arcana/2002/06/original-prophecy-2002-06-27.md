If you thought the set *Prophecy* was a little sub-par, check out the *card* [Prophecy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Prophecy).


This *Homelands* common lifegain spell (I use the term loosely) is interesting because of it's art. In the center of the eye is reflected the real boss of *Homelands*, [Ihsan's Shade](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ihsan%27s+Shade). [Baron Sengir](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Baron+Sengir) had nothing on that guy.
