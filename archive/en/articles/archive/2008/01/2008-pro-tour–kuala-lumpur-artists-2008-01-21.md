Larry was born in Ontario, Canada where he went to school and learned to draw pictures of strange and unreal things.


Now he paints **Magic**  Cards and Faerie Tales and all manner of fantastical subjects.


In 2003 a collection of his work was published by Cartouche Press called Witching Hour. He has also appeared in several recent volumes of the Spectrum Annual.

### Ookubo


Seishirou Ookubo of Nagoya, Japan is known throughout the **Magic**  community for his spectacular 3-D card art. Taking 5-6 cards, Seishirou turns a flat piece of cardboard into a breathtaking layered piece of art. When asked how he started making them, he had this to say:


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/tournamentcenter/2008/ookubo.jpg) "I first started playing **Magic**  after *4th Edition*  began to be sold in Japan. I started buying a lot of **Magic**—so much, in fact, that the cards started to take over my room! I noticed I had lots of duplicates of many cards. Since I'm a bit of a pack rat, I was at a loss for what to do. One night, I was looking at the [Pradesh Gypsies](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pradesh+Gypsies) card, and for some reason I thought about some 3-D art I had seen as a child. Multiple copies of the same illustration had been layered and cut out to create a 3-D effect. I decided that's how I would solve my multiple card problem, by turning them into 3-D art."


"In the beginning, I didn't have anything to work off of, so there were many failed attempts. At that time, it took me a couple of weeks to finish one card, so every time I did it was a cause for celebration. What really got me motivated was Brian Snoddy's reaction when I gave him one of my cards as a present at Grand Prix–Kyoto 98. That's when I realized that other people were as interested in this art as I was."


"It's been years since I started making these cards, and there are still a lot of cards that I want to make into 3-D art, while at the same time Wizards of the Coast keeps making more. I may never catch up!"
