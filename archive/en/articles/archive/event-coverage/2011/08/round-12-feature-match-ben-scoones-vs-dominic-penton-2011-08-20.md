Dominic hails from Amersham in Buckinghamshire, and this is his third Nationals, despite only being 16. To date he's never had much success in Standard, but has a brilliant 6-0, 6-0, 5-1 record in Draft. Core set clearly agrees with him. Across the table, Ben Scoones comes from Cambridge, and the winner here will be in great shape for the top 8, although Ben has a draw to his name, meaning he's playing catchup at 8-2-1. This would be a classic mono-red vs Caw-Blade matchup.

*Dominic Penton* |


Penton began with [Goblin Guide](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Guide). When it attacked for two, Scoones revealed [Day of Judgment](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Day+of+Judgment) on top of his library. On turn two, [Celestial Colonnade](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Celestial+Colonnade) went into Scoones' hand, with turn two [Squadron Hawk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Squadron+Hawk) not searching out any other copies. [Jace Beleren](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace+Beleren) was on top turn three, the [Goblin Guide](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Guide) looking to take a third chunk out of Scoones' life total. The [Squadron Hawk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Squadron+Hawk) took one for the team, and we were back to Scoones, who laid his [Celestial Colonnade](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Celestial+Colonnade), a [Squadron Hawk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Squadron+Hawk), and found one more. At end of turn, Penton had [Staggershock](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Staggershock) for the Hawk, with Rebound dealing three to the face in his upkeep.


Now came [Koth of the Hammer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Koth+of+the+Hammer), untapping a Mountain. The wrong Mountain.

Scoones had [Emeria Angel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Emeria+Angel), which soon met [Lightning Bolt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt), clearing the way for another [Goblin Guide](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Guide)and Mountain attack. Scoones was down to six, but seemed unruffled as he laid [Squadron Hawk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Squadron+Hawk) and found another.  



**Dominic Penton 1 - 0 Ben Scoones**


[Celestial Colonnade](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Celestial+Colonnade) got us underway in Game 2, with Scoones ready for the turn one [Goblin Guide](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Guide) with [Mental Misstep](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mental+Misstep). Penton laid [Grim Lavamancer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grim+Lavamancer) and passed, and already this second game had a very different tone to the first. Two mana from Penton meant [Arc Trail](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arc+Trail) for a pair of [Squadron Hawk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Squadron+Hawk)s on turn three, but again the game felt very different as Scoones had [Timely Reinforcements](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Timely+Reinforcements). Penton ran out [Goblin Guide](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Guide), seeing [Flashfreeze](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flashfreeze) on top of Scoones' library. Scoones triple-blocked, but  [Lightning Bolt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt)plus [Grim Lavamancer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grim+Lavamancer) activation meant all three Soldiers died, while [Goblin Guide](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Guide) would live to fight another day (turn.)

Already this game had been going longer than the first, with Scoones still at nineteen life. Penton aimed [Staggershock](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Staggershock) at a [Squadron Hawk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Squadron+Hawk), forcing the [Flashfreeze](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flashfreeze) from Scoones. [Goblin Guide](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Guide) saw [Timely Reinforcements](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Timely+Reinforcements) on top, and it was becoming very hard work for Penton.

*Ben Scoones* |


Scoones was still in the driving seat, with [Gideon Jura](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gideon+Jura) entering the fray. Two [Lightning Bolt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt)s and a [Grim Lavamancer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grim+Lavamancer) activation took down the white Planeswalker, but repeating the feat would surely be impossible for Penton. Scoones cast [Preordain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Preordain), looking for something to seal the game. Penton cast [Koth of the Hammer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Koth+of+the+Hammer), which resolved, and Scoones took five. [Celestial Colonnade](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Celestial+Colonnade) activated for Scoones, and killed the red Planeswalker. Still, Scoones was improbably down to single figures at nine life.


[Celestial Colonnade](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Celestial+Colonnade) activated and attacked, putting Penton to thirteen. [Timely Reinforcements](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Timely+Reinforcements) this time really was Timely, and once again it looked as if Scoones was well and truly out of danger at fifteen. Penton fell to eight, and it wasn't clear what he could do against [Celestial Colonnade](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Celestial+Colonnade). The flying 4/4 dropped Penton to four, and soon afterwards to precisely zero.


**Dominic Penton 1 - 1 Ben Scoones**


Shootout time, with Penton on the play. [Goblin Guide](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Guide) met [Mental Misstep](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mental+Misstep). First bullet dodged for Scoones. Turn two for Penton saw [Shrine of Burning Rage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shrine+of+Burning+Rage), while Scoones started his [Squadron Hawk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Squadron+Hawk) action. [Searing Blaze](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Searing+Blaze) dealt three to the Hawk, three to Scoones, and put a counter on [Shrine of Burning Rage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shrine+of+Burning+Rage). Triple threat indeed. [Grim Lavamancer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grim+Lavamancer) was next for Penton, who already had his [Shrine of Burning Rage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shrine+of+Burning+Rage) up to four counters. [Teetering Peaks](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Teetering+Peaks) added two attack to his [Grim Lavamancer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grim+Lavamancer), and Scoones was in trouble.


He laid the second [Squadron Hawk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Squadron+Hawk) of the game, leaving [Mana Leak](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak) mana open. Penton aimed[Lightning Bolt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt) at the Hawk, then attacked for one.  

Scoones was down to eleven, with the [Shrine of Burning Rage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shrine+of+Burning+Rage) up to six.  

He cast another [Squadron Hawk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Squadron+Hawk), watching as Penton upped the counters to seven. [Arc Trail](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arc+Trail) dealt one to the Hawk and two to Scoones - at least, that was the plan, and it forced [Flashfreeze](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flashfreeze) from Scoones.  

Counter to eight.


Scoones surveyed the battlefield, and knew he was done.


**Dominic Penton 2 - 1 Ben Scoones**
