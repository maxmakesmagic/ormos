Brave heroes, your Hero's Path continues this weekend! A terrible hydra menaces the countryside and the poleis need those possessing courage and skill to slay it! 

[![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/arcana/arc1344_vtf.jpg)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=373640) The third quest in the Hero's Path occurs this weekend, October 19â€“20, at the [*Theros* Game Day](http://www.wizards.com/magic/tcg/events.aspx?x=mtgcom/events/gameday-facts). A Game Day event is a Standard tournament held by stores all across the world. [Find a store near you!](http://locator.wizards.com/)


While you're there, you can compete in the Face the Hydra third quest in the Hero's Path:

This third quest pits you and up to three of your friends (or friendly strangers!) against the Face the Hydra Challenge Deck. Here is an example of what you will see when you sit down across from the hydra:

And here is a close-up of what a couple of the Face the Hydra Challenge Deck cards look like:

 You can play any deck you have against the Face the Hydra Challenge Deck, including the Standard deck you bring to play in the Game Day tournament! (But no, you don't have to join the tournament to perform the third Hero's Path quest.) Regardless of the deck you bring, you may also play with *up to two* Hero Cards you've collected from previous Hero's Path quests. Once you (and your friends) finish your quest, your tournament organizer will provide you with your Game Day Hero Card, The Slayer:

 The great seer Dave Guskin (actual title: experience game designer) anticipated some questions you might have about the Face the Hydra Challenge Deck and [answered them](http://www.wizards.com/Magic/magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/feature/HerosPathFAQ#challenge), as well as general [Quest #3 questions](http://www.wizards.com/Magic/magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/feature/HerosPathFAQ#hydra), in the [Hero's Path FAQ](http://www.wizards.com/Magic/magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/feature/HerosPathFAQ). 

 Our friends at LoadingReadyRun have also taken up the call to heroism and scouted out the hydra for you. Go (humorously) forewarned and forearmed against your own Face the Hydra challenge with "[The Trial](http://www.wizards.com/magic/magazine/article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/feature/269)." 

Lastly, we expect that some players will want to bring home their own copy of the Face the Hydra Challenge Deck to battle against in the future. Fortunately for you, stores will be able to sell Challenge Decks starting with the Game Day event this weekend!
