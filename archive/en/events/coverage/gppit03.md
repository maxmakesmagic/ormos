Live Coverage of 2003 Grand Prix Pittsburgh
===========================================












![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gppit03/a931.jpg)If this tournament teaches us anything, it is that tiebreakers do mean something after all.


As Round 8 came to a close yesterday, Illuminati was seen hovering around their standings trying to figure out what crazy series of events needed to occur in order for them to make Day 2. They were 6-2, and were sitting in 29th after round 7. As only the top 20 teams advance, their chances looked bad.


But all the right teams lost, and through some miracle of fate that last win moved them up ten places in the standings.


After Illuminati defeated Peter Szigeti and "Efro Naked" to start Day 2, Zvi Mowshowitz was asked if he thought his squad could make the Top 4 if they won out. "Unlikely," he admitted, "We'd need a miracle, but not as big of a miracle as the one that got us here."

Well, after two more wins and a lot of nail-biting, the trio of Mowshowitz, Justin Gary, and Alex Shvartsman pulled it off, and were announced as the number four seed.


From there, they never looked back. They took down the Phoque Foundation and then capped it off with a 3-0 smashing of Prodigy, cementing themselves as one of the best teams of all time.
