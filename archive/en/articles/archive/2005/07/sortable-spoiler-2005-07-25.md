![Ninth Edition](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/global/images/mtgcom_arcana_801_pic1_en.jpg)Because readers have sometimes had trouble finding the spoilers for new sets, or commented that they didn’t know when the spoiler would be going up on the site, we will now be posting the spoiler for each new set on the Monday after set previews. To increase visibility we’ll be posting it in the Feature Article slot on the site’s front page. Here then is the sortable spoiler list for *Ninth Edition*. Enjoy!
