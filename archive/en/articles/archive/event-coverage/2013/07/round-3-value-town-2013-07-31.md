If there's one thing that **Magic** players like, it's value. Card advantage, enters-the-battlefield triggers, and two-for-one trades in cards.


You know. *Value.*


And value is exactly what we saw in this match.


The match pitted two of the workforces behind team ChannelFireball, Eric Froehlich and Josh Utter-Leyton, against each other. Both were coming off the back of a great season. Froehlich posted a 27th, a 4th, and a 10th place finish at this season's three Pro Tours. Josh Utter-Leyton, as the Player of the Year, managed to score even more pro points.


Now, the two heavyweights of American **Magic**, both sitting at 1-1 records, had to face off in *Modern Masters* draft.

*Both Eric Froehlich and Josh Utter-Leyton had incredible seasons. The two ChannelFireball teammates looked to start off the new season right with a solid finish early on in the 2013 **Magic** World Championship.* 
### The Draft and Decks


Before the games, the players got a peek at each other's draft pools, and they discussed each other's picks.


Utter-Leyton started off his draft with a first-pick [Cloudgoat Ranger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloudgoat+Ranger), arguably the best uncommon in the set, and subsequently took a bunch of red burn cards. When he opened another [Cloudgoat Ranger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloudgoat+Ranger) in second pack, his draft seemed to come together quite nicely. "Josh's pool is insane," Froehlich said. Utter-Leyton's deck features the excellent combination of creatures with enters-the-battlefield triggers (such as [Cloudgoat Ranger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloudgoat+Ranger), [Murderous Redcap](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Murderous+Redcap), and [Ivory Giant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ivory+Giant)) and so-called blink effects ([Flickerwisp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flickerwisp) and [Otherworldly Journey](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Otherworldly+Journey)) to get even more value out of those creatures.


In the draft, Utter-Leyton was passing directly to Froehlich, giving him a clear signal that the domain archetype was open with cards like [Skyreach Manta](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skyreach+Manta). Froehlich duly picked them up, but he felt the packs did not serve him well. "I was in the right archetype, but there were hardly any bombs, not a lot of mana fixing, and no payoff for being five-color. My deck is perfectly average," he said. Taking a closer look at Utter-Leyton's list, Froehlich pointed at [Imperiosaur](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Imperiosaur) and said, "Look at all those cards you cut from me!" Utter-Leyton reassured his teammate that had actively been hating cards from him. "Imperisaur was the third pick of my draft," Utter-Leyton explained.


### The Games


In Game 1, Utter-Leyton started off the value theme by blinking his [Murderous Redcap](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Murderous+Redcap) with [Flickerwisp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flickerwisp), netting him a free enters-the-battlefield trigger. But that was the only two-for-one that Utter-Leyton managed to get. Froehlich, on the other side of the table, showed him the true meaning of card advantage: [Masked Admirers](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Masked+Admirers), [Citanul Woodreaders](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Citanul+Woodreaders), and [Mulldrifter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mulldrifter) gave him a steady stream of cards, while [Marsh Flitter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Marsh+Flitter) and [Riftwing Cloudskate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Riftwing+Cloudskate) provided additional value.


As the game progressed, Eric found himself in a commanding position, only at the risk of losing to a top-deck from Josh. Otherworldy Journey would be particularly scary because Utter-Leyton might use on his [Ivory Giant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ivory+Giant) to tap any blockers. Unfortunately for Utter-Leyton, however, he hit a glut of land. When he finally drew a non-land card in [Cloudgoat Ranger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloudgoat+Ranger), Eric had [Traumatic Visions](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Traumatic+Visions) at the ready, and that was that. "I drew five spells and ten lands," Utter-Leyton despondently said afterwards.

*Froehlich's steady stream of card advantage allowed him to run over Utter-Leyton in the first game, whose mana flood kept him from getting any foothold.* 
Game 2 was closer. Utter-Leyton had a fast start, including [Kithkin Greatheart](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kithkin+Greatheart) and [Cloudgoat Ranger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloudgoat+Ranger). Froehlich, in the meantime, used [Kodama's Reach](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kodama%27s+Reach) to ramp into two 5/5 [Skyreach Manta](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skyreach+Manta)s. He then had [Maelstrom Pulse](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Maelstrom+Pulse) to kill off [Cloudgoat Ranger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloudgoat+Ranger), and had a [Plumeveil](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plumeveil) to block the Kithkins that remained. Utter-Leyton then made a cool play: he cast [Otherworldly Journey](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Otherworldly+Journey) and targeted not a creature of his own, but Froehlich's [Skyreach Manta](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skyreach+Manta). This meant that the Manta would shrink from a 5/5 to a 1/1, and a [Murderous Redcap](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Murderous+Redcap) cleaned up afterward. Nevertheless, Utter-Leyton was still facing one of the 5/5 flying creatures.

*Utter-Leyton attempts to fight through his deck's unforgiving draws.* 
Holding [Fiery Fall](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fiery+Fall) and [Bound in Silence](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bound+in+Silence), but lacking a sixth land, he could only enchant the flier with [Bound in Silence](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bound+in+Silence), and had to extend his hand as Froehlich had [Krosan Grip](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Krosan+Grip) to keep on attacking for 5 in the air.


"There was no way I could play around [Krosan Grip](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Krosan+Grip)," Utter-Leyton said. "Not having my sixth land for [Fiery Fall](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fiery+Fall) to kill his 5/5 cost me the game. I think I had the best deck in the pod; I just ran bad in the games."


Froehlich offered some comments on the matchup as well. "[Cloudgoat Ranger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloudgoat+Ranger) is actually not all that good against me since I have [Maelstrom Pulse](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Maelstrom+Pulse) and a ton of removal spells," he said. "Actually, [Murderous Redcap](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Murderous+Redcap) may be his best card against me. My removal spells aren't good against [Murderous Redcap](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Murderous+Redcap), and after I use a removal spell on it, he can [Otherworldly Journey](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Otherworldly+Journey) and [Flickerwisp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flickerwisp) it back to start over again." Fortunately for Froehlich, that did not happen.
