**ARTISTS: MARK TEDIN and JIM MURRAY**


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/gpbri09/artist_tedin.jpg)Mark came on board as a freelance artist at Wizards of the Coast in the summer of 1992. Since then, he's contributed artistically to nearly all the fantasy/adventure games the company produces-including most sets of the trading card phenomenon **Magic: The Gathering**. When Mark's not working on Wizards of the Coast projects, he enjoys hanging out and drawing in Seattle cafes, designing sets for theatrical productions, or going to science fiction movies. In fact, it's Mark's fondness for the worlds of science fiction and fantasy that helped shape him into the artist he is today.


Born in 1968, Mark grew up in the small town of Sitka, Alaska. When younger, Mark wanted to be an astronaut. As a result, he started drawing pictures of outer space and flying saucers-soon including monsters and creatures in the illustrations. His appetite to draw grew as the years went by, sometimes getting him in trouble. In the 5th grade, Mark says he was often reprimanded for racing through math quizzes so he had time to draw pictures on the paper's backside.


It wasn't until Mark was in Junior High School that he decided to pursue a career in art. He drew whenever he could and was fortunate to have a regular drawing partner. Mark's best friend, fellow Wizards of the Coast artist Anson Maddocks, had the same passion for drawing and a similar imagination.


After high school, Mark went to college at Gonzaga University in Spokane, Washington, to expand and hone his artistic talents. While there he took many classes outside of art because they provided information about a variety of subjects and helped Mark come up with ideas. In particular, he liked science courses. Following Gonzaga, Mark went on to receive his master's degree in fine arts at Washington University in St. Louis, Missouri. He then packed his bags and joined his friend Anson to work in Seattle.


Mark's freelance work for Wizards of the Coast began shortly after he arrived in the Emerald City. For him it was, and still is, a dream come true: drawing strange creatures and environments and making a living at it!


From 1997 - 2000, Mark also worked on site at Wizards of the Coast as a staff conceptual artist. Since then, he's also been teaching illustration, visual composition, and figure drawing part-time at the Northwest College of Art near Seattle.


Mark has been freelancing illustrative and conceptual design work for sixteen years and is loving it.

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/gpbri09/artist_murray.jpg)Jim Murray was born in England in 1972 and enjoyed drawing and painting from an early age. He studied visual media at Bournemouth College of Art and Design and went on to illustrate comics, primarily 2000AD and Judge Dredd Megazine, but also producing 2 Batman graphic novels, a 'Judge Dredd Batman' crossover called 'Die Laughing’, and an Elseworlds book, 'Batman Demon’ published in 1999. 


His first cards for **Magic**  were for the *Mirrodin*  set. Since then he has tried to be involved with every new release, averaging about 3 cards per expansion. Jim can honestly say that working on MTG is one of his most rewarding jobs!


Jim also works in video games as a concept artist, currently he’s employed at Eidos Montreal on Deus Ex III. You can also check out his stuff on his site, [www.jimmurrayart.com](http://www.jimmurrayart.com) (sorry for the lack of recent updates!) and most recently in Spectrum 14, and the upcoming Spectrum 15.
