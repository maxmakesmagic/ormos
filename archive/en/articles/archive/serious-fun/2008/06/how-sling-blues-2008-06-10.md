[Counterspell](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterspell)s don't work in multiplayer," I hear. Then I arrive at our table, where you can almost always see one or two [Counterspell](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterspell) decks, and wonder why [Counterspell](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterspell)s *do* work for some people. 

The answer is in how you play [Counterspell](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterspell)s. [Counterspell](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterspell)-packin' decks, particularly in multiplayer, require a level of finesse and understanding to pull off. Unlike beatdown decks, which can often win just by windmill-slamming your hand onto the table, [Counterspell](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterspell) decks are much more vulnerable to losing thanks to poor decision-making.

So with that in mind, let me give you controlly novices five lessons in playing [Counterspell](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterspell)s. 

### Lesson #1: Play "The Game"

When I'm playing a control deck, I find it's best to play a fun little subgame of **Magic**. That game is called "How many cards can I keep in my hand?" 

Whenever I'm tempted to play a spell, I ask, "Do I *really* need to play this now... or can I save it for later?" Sometimes I do need to play it—you always require mana acceleration and early defense—but often, when I'm playing **Magic** with my goal to keep as many cards in hand as possible, I find out that I'm a little too quick on the draw to expend my personal power. And cards in hand *are* power. 

[![Mind_Games](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/cardart/ST/Mind_Games.jpg)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Mind%2BGames)What I've discovered in playing the "How many cards?" game is that often, other players will handle things for you. Sure, I'm terrified of someone's [Grim Poppet](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grim+Poppet) / [Torture](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Torture) combo... but so is everyone else at the table! And they'll often helpfully [Shatter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shatter) the Poppet for me if I'm quiet enough, thus saving me a card.

When you're playing control in multiplayer, particularly of the [Counterspell](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterspell) variety, you have to lay back and let others do as much of the work as possible. They will come for you, no doubt; that's how this game works. But ideally, you want them to come to you with weakened hands and depleted resources, while *you* have a fresh grip of seven killer spells. That's what you seek.

Don't be foolish, of course. Sometimes you have to expend a card or two to stay in the game, or to cripple an opponent's plans before he can win—try to be as stingy as Ebenezer Scrooge and you might wind up more like Jacob Marley. But the "How many cards?" game forces you to question every play you might theoretically make, keeping both your board presence to a minimum and your power to a maximum. 

When you're playing control, you want that. 

Plus, every spell you do *not* play means that you have mana open for a counterspell. Too many fledgling blue players tap out all the time to play stuff, then get pantsed when they realize that they *could* have stopped this [Profane Command](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Profane+Command) if they hadn't tapped out to play this now-useless [Mahamoti Djinn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mahamoti+Djinn) instead. 

Most of the time, you can wait. Try it! 

### Lesson #2: [Counterspell](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterspell)s Are Not a Panacea

Novice players run into a wall of solid "No" and think, "Wow, [Counterspell](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterspell)s solve everything." Then they throw sixteen counterspells into a deck and wonder why they fail.

First off, remember that [Counterspell](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterspell)s don't win the game on their own. You need some way of killing your opponents—and unfortunately, there are only so many slots in a deck. Every [Counterspell](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterspell) merely stops your opponent from winning. It does not let *you* win. 

Secondly, you can't counter every spell. (Particularly in multiplayer, where opponents abound.) Every long-time blue player has had the frustration of having a hand full of stupid [Counterspell](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterspell)s when what they need is an answer to the 3/3 creature that's killing them *right now*. If you counter twelve spells, well, the thirteenth can still kill you.

[![Meddle](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/cardart/ONS/Meddle.jpg)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Meddle)[Counterspell](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterspell)s are not a magic wand that will make your deck great. Not every deck needs counterspells, or wants them. 

What you use counterspells *for* is to ensure that an otherwise-winning strategy will be able to get through to completion. A Standard Faeries deck will win the game with cards like [Bitterblossom](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bitterblossom) and [Mistbind Clique](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mistbind+Clique), *if nobody interferes*. [Reveillark](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reveillark) is going to combo you out, *if nobody interferes*. Merfolk is going to beat you to death with fins and gills, *if* *nobody interferes*.

[Counterspell](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterspell)s are there to make sure that nobody interferes. They're the insurance that guarantee that the *good* spells will do their work, and that your opponents can't stop them in time.

As such, your [Counterspell](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterspell)s are *valuable*. You only have a handful in any deck, and chances are good you won't see more than three or four in a given game. You have to hoard them like they're WMD, using them only when you absolutely have to—and you use them strategically, to ensure that your goals are being met. 

Which leads me to the next lesson of playing counterspells.... 

### Lesson #3: Know What Needs to Be Protected

In any given counterspell deck, you're going to use counterspells to protect your most precious resources from the evil spells of your enemies. But you have to know what's worth protecting. A Saudi prince who spends all of his time guarding the sand and not the oil is going to look mighty silly in the end. 

To illustrate this, let's take a look at a successful control deck of mine in multiplayer, which has fared well in a variety of circumstances: Rebels.

Now let's be frank here: [Lin Sivvi, Defiant Hero](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lin+Sivvi%2C+Defiant+Hero) makes this deck tick. She's the legendary kick-butt babe who allows this deck to recurse [Lawbringer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lawbringer)s and [Lightbringer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightbringer)s in the late game, giving you incredible long-term power. With [Lin Sivvi, Defiant Hero](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Lin%2BSivvi%252C%2BDefiant%2BHero), you can continually recur the [Aven Riftwatcher](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aven+Riftwatcher) every turn against some overwhelming attacker—"In response to your attack, I fetch the Riftwatcher as a blocker. Then, once it's dead, I put it back into my library with her second ability to be fetched again the next turn"—thus staving off damage and gaining you 4 life a turn. And unlike all the other Rebels, you can do it for the lowest possible cost: the Rebel's converted mana cost. (And every mana counts when you're trying to hold back mana for a counterspell.) 

![Lin Sivvi, Defiant Hero](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Lin+Sivvi%2C+Defiant+Hero)Now here's the question: What's the most important thing to protect in this deck? Hint: It's *not*

Thing is, while you need [Lin Sivvi, Defiant Hero](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Lin%2BSivvi%252C%2BDefiant%2BHero) in this deck, you don't need to *protect* her. You have at least five other non-Sivvi Rebels who can search her up upon command—and if she's the target of a removal spell, just have her whip out a [Defiant Falcon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Defiant+Falcon) in response so you can chain right back into her your next turn. Plus, you can't have more than one [Lin Sivvi, Defiant Hero](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Lin%2BSivvi%252C%2BDefiant%2BHero) on the board at a time anyway, so you can often go, "All right, she dies. Next turn, I'll play this other copy that's been stuck in my hand." 

Sure, you still have to worry about "remove from game" effects like [Eradicate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eradicate). But if you wanna get sneaky, you can fizzle a lot of the nastier spells by fetching out a duplicate copy of [Lin Sivvi, Defiant Hero](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Lin%2BSivvi%252C%2BDefiant%2BHero) in response to, say, a [Biting Tether](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Biting+Tether) and watching both Sivvis (Sivvae? Sivvises?) hit the graveyard thanks to the legend rule. Then start the lather, rinse, repeat cycle all over again. 

Lin Sivvi is *critical* to the deck.... but that doesn't mean she's not *expendable*. You can afford to let her die, so relax a little when someone [Lightning Helix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Helix)es your Rebel-in-Chief. 

But again: you have to know your deck well enough to realize that [Lin Sivvi, Defiant Hero](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Lin%2BSivvi%252C%2BDefiant%2BHero) is *not* your path to power. If you're wasting one of your four precious [Absorb](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Absorb)s to protect something that's not ultimately important, then you lose. 

The first thing any good control player learns to say is, "Okay. That resolves." Too many articles on control focus on *countering spells*, as if the only thing a control deck does is just mindlessly counter every spell until it wins. But you can't do that, not even in a duel. Even behind a wall of solid Blue, your opponents are going to kill your creatures, destroy your enchantments, even counter your counterspells. 

You're going to have to take some losses before you win. 

Bad control players are afraid to let anything die, because to them, "losing things" means "I'm losing." The best control players know what to fight for—and, more importantly, when to let things go. And in this deck, [Lin Sivvi, Defiant Hero](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Lin%2BSivvi%252C%2BDefiant%2BHero) isn't worth fighting for in all but the rarest of circumstances. She can die, because she's irrelevant to your longer-term strategy. 

Don't mourn for her. The needs of the many outweigh the need of the few. Or the one. 

![Plains](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Plains)But hey! Superfluous *Star Trek* references aside, you know what *is* vital to this deck?Your land.

*Look* at this deck! It's so mana-hungry it might as well be Pac-Man. All that cool recursive stuff I talked about earlier about requires at least six mana, and that's if you don't leave any mana open for an [Absorb](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Absorb). This deck functions best on nine lands in play – which is a lot to ask for anyone. One resolved [Boom](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Boom) will ensure you're dead in the water. 

(Which means that frankly, to play this deck properly you have to mulligan until you get hands with a lot of mana. Two-land hands won't cut it. Again, good control play involves *knowing what matters*.)

Thankfully, [Armageddon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Armageddon)-style effects are relatively rare these days. But should someone threaten your land with something crazy like a [Deus of Calamity](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deus+of+Calamity) or a [Wildfire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wildfire) or even a [Winter Orb](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Winter+Orb) or a [Stasis](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stasis), that's something you want to counter, and fast. 

Lin Sivvi? See ya. Land? Critical. [\*](#footnote1) But you have to know what needs to be protected before you can start knocking spells out of the air with your counters. 

### Lesson #4: Know What the Real Threats Are

It's the midgame. You have a [Lin Sivvi, Defiant Hero](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Lin%2BSivvi%252C%2BDefiant%2BHero) in hand, a [Defiant Falcon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Defiant+Falcon), and an [Absorb](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Absorb). On the board you have seven mana available—four white and three blue—and, thanks to your other *active*
[Lin Sivvi, Defiant Hero](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Lin%2BSivvi%252C%2BDefiant%2BHero), you also have a [Thermal Glider](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thermal+Glider), a [Jhovall Queen](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jhovall+Queen), a [Nightwind Glider](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nightwind+Glider), and a [Ballista Squad](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ballista+Squad). Like any good control player, all of your mana is currently open. 

![Wrath of God](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Wrath+of+God)Your opponent plays [Wrath of God](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wrath+of+God). Do you counter? The answer, nine times out of ten: "Oh, *heck* no." Because [Wrath of God](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wrath+of+God) is not a threat to you. 

While [Wrath of God](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wrath+of+God) is traditionally a threat to all sorts of creature decks, *this* deck is different in that it can recycle creatures and grow new armies out of nothing at all. As long as you have a single fetching Rebel, you have an army that will grow by itself. 

Yes, your opponent will destroy five of your creatures with that [Wrath of God](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Wrath%2Bof%2BGod). But he'll also, God willing, destroy all the *other* creatures on the board, making it harder for your other opponents to win. You're losing five creatures, yes, but you can get them back. Your opponents most likely won't. 

You, on the other hand, can plop down another [Lin Sivvi, Defiant Hero](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Lin%2BSivvi%252C%2BDefiant%2BHero) on your next turn with three mana open for an [Absorb](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Absorb) should someone try to kill it before your next upkeep—and even if they succeed in that, you have a [Defiant Falcon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Defiant+Falcon) ready to go. Then, the next turn, you can start fetching up a new army and then start stuffing your graveyard back into your deck again. 

[Wrath of God](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wrath+of+God) is *not a big threat to this deck*. This deck eats [Wrath of God](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wrath+of+God) for breakfast. But a bad counterspell player will panic and counter reflexively, without taking his own deck into account. "OMG, WRATH? ME LOSING CREATURES? THAT'S BAD!" they'll scream, countering blindly.

Not every [Wrath of God](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wrath+of+God) is a must-counter. Quite often, the thunder of Jehova actually harms your opponents more than it does you. 

Likewise, is [Kokusho, the Evening Star](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Kokusho%252C%2Bthe%2BEvening%2BStar) a must-counter? It depends. If you have a [Crib Swap](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crib+Swap) in hand to remove [Kokusho, the Evening Star](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Kokusho%252C%2Bthe%2BEvening%2BStar) should Mister Black 'N' Scaly look at you sideways, then the answer is usually a pretty clear "No." 

Bad counterspell players tend to look at the raw power of any given spell, as opposed to the amount that spell hurts *them*, *in this moment*. They go on autopilot countering binges. They "know" that an [Akroma, Angel of Wrath](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Akroma%2C+Angel+of+Wrath) is unstoppable, so they'll burn a counterspell to get rid of it while forgetting that a) the other players are playing black and red and thus will now have to gang up on Ms. Akroma or lose, and b) they have a bounce spell in hand that can send Akroma flying back home if she decides to come for them. 

Alternatively, Akroma isn't a threat to you if you're at 20 life and have enough damage on the board to kill Ms. Akroma's controller with a counterattack. (Ironically, the thing that would terrify you in that circumstance? [Wrath of God](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wrath+of+God).) 

Every threat is situational. It depends on board position, your deck's strategy, and your opponent's goals. 

So remember Lesson #1, and question every spell you're about to [Cancel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cancel). Do you have other, non-[Counterspell](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterspell) answers for this in hand? Will it do more overall damage to your opponents if you let this resolve, forcing them to counter or kill it? Is this damage going to put you so far back that it will kill you or cripple you? Does it really resolve your lead? 

If not, quash the panicky impulses that tell you, "NO ONE SHOULD EVER HAVE A 9/9 FLYING GUY BUT ME!" and let it resolve. That 9/9 is not going to kill you. (The enchantment someone places on it might, but you'll still have the [Counterspell](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterspell) for that if you need it.) 

Gauge every threat appropriately, because they're all different to every deck. [Wrath of God](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wrath+of+God) merits a shrug in the Rebels deck.... but large, trampling beef will stomp Rebels dead. 

Seriously. A single resolved [Deus of Calamity](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deus+of+Calamity) is nearly impossible for this deck to handle unless it gets the [Defiant Vanguard](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Defiant+Vanguard) / [Big Game Hunter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Big+Game+Hunter) / [Wrath of God](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Wrath%2Bof%2BGod) right away. Because that [Thermal Glider](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thermal+Glider)? It's only got 1 toughness. All your guys are teeny. They can't soak up enough of that trample damage, and you can't expect to win in combat when your biggest creature is a 4/6. 

Thankfully, you *do* have some spot removal to get rid of things like that. One Deus can be handled. 

![Garruk Wildspeaker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Garruk+Wildspeaker)Three or four of them means you might as well start digging your grave. Which is why a single [Overrun](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Overrun) effect means you are going to lose. *Badly*. *That* is why you let that [Wrath of God](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wrath+of+God) pass. Because though it seems counterintuitive, a [Garruk Wildspeaker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Garruk+Wildspeaker) or a [Bramblewood Paragon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bramblewood+Paragon) can actually be a more serious threat to your deck than [Wrath of God](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Wrath%2Bof%2BGod), and when your opponent tries to cast that you can politely say, "No thank you" and let it slide. And thank the ([Wrath of God](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Wrath%2Bof%2BGod) of) God that you had the [Power Sink](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Power+Sink) in hand when you needed it. 

Once you know your deck well enough to know where it's vulnerable, you'll know what matters. It might seem crazy to counter someone's third-turn [Goblin Warchief](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Warchief) when you have so much easily summoned red hate in this deck.... but this deck is *very* vulnerable to an early rush, and if you know you're going to be stuck at four mana without a [Wrath of God](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Wrath%2Bof%2BGod) in sight, sometimes it's the right move to slow down someone's army before they wipe you out. 

Remember: Every counterspell is used to further your goals. Sometimes, using them aggressively in the early game is also the right move.

It all depends. 

### Lesson #5: Try Not to Tussle with the Other [Counterspell](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterspell) Decks

If you waste all of your precious [Counterspell](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterspell)s in a fight to let one of your spells resolve, generally you've lost the longer game. Yes, sometimes that one spell is going to win the game right there, and it's absolutely correct to counter it in that instance. 

Most of the time, however, fighting the other blue players is counterproductive. You've lost a lot of spells, and your other opponents haven't. More than one game has gone like this: 

PLAYER #1: "I'll [Spellstutter Sprite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spellstutter+Sprite) your [Rune Snag](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rune+Snag)." 

PLAYER #2: "YES! I [Broken Ambitions](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Broken+Ambitions) your [Spellstutter Sprite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spellstutter+Sprite)... and finally, my [Wren's Run Packmaster](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wren%27s+Run+Packmaster) resolves!" 

PLAYER #3: "I [Terror](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Terror) it." 

PLAYER #2: "Poop." 

Yet novice counterspell players seem to positively *relish* the thrill of winning a counter-war, charging into battles just because they can! 

Instead than getting into counterspell wars, try the old tried-and-true methods of getting around counterspells so you can keep your own: 




[![Flash_Counter](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/cardart/LE/Flash_Counter.jpg)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Flash%2BCounter)2. **Whenever possible, play a threat right before your turn**. Force them to burn up all of their mana and counterspells just before you untap and draw a new card. Ideally, they'll spend all of their strength halting the end-of-turn spell and fall prey to the spell you *really* wanted to play on your main phase.
3. **Stockpile threats.** Your opponent can counter the first spell in your hand? Great. How about the second? Or the third? If you can save up enough cards to overload your [Counterspell](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterspell) buddy, do it. Sometimes this means waiting a turn or two, but generally it's worth it (unless he's got seven cards now).
4. **Play threats one at a time.** Many casual players plop down the three spells they were going to play this turn as though they were one entity. Don't. Give as little information as possible. Lay the first spell down, then make them decide whether it resolves. If you show them three spells at once, they can decide which, if any, are the real threat. One at a time, they have to guess. Which leads us to....
5. **Play spells in reverse order of importance.** As a rule, play your least-relevant spell first. That way, if you have multiple spells in a turn—and your opponent never knows whether you do—he has to decide whether he wants to use up a [Counterspell](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterspell) on what might be a feint, or whether he lets it go and discovers that really that's the spell you wanted most.

But before you start playing those threats willy-nilly, let me refer you to the first lesson. Should you be casting that guy? Shouldn't you wait? Maybe? 

Don't get suckered. Play only when you have to. By and large, save your counterspells to stop opponents' threats from resolving, not to let your threat resolve. 

Be sneaky and blue. That's the way to counter. 

[\*](#footnote1back) – Which brings up the question of whether the land-thinning aspect of the two [Flooded Strand](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flooded+Strand)s here are correct in this deck, since it effectively means we're playing with 22 land. I worried about that initially, but as it turns out the more you Rebel-search the greater your chances of drawing a land are—you're reverse-thinning—and I haven't had that many problems in practice. Ah, land bases. Eat your vegetables, folks.
