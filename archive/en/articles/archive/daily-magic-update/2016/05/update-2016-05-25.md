The May 25, 2016 Update
=======================

Blake is the content manager for DailyMTG.com, making him the one you should email if you have thoughts on the website, good or less good (or not good). He's a longtime coverage reporter and hasn't turned down a game of Magic in any format ever. 






The Daily *Magic* Update is a roundup of everything *Magic* you should know on May 25, 2016. Today's Update is brought to you by an exclusive Daily *Magic* Update preview card!


Official *Eternal Masters* Preview
==================================


1. Exclusive Daily *Magic* Update Preview Card

Today, the Daily *Magic* Update gets its own preview card, rather than just showing off where all of the others are (though we're still going to do that, too). Why? Because I control the preview plan and I feel like it. That's why.


Also, the card I've got for you today is new art on an old favorite. I present to you, Void:


![](https://media.wizards.com/2016/adhfianalodifdj2_EMA/en_WxESMTZ8Gu.png)


So what's the story with Void? It was a strong card for Standard not once, but twice, both when it was originally printed and again when it was timeshifted in *Time Spiral*. You might have even felt its power during a recent *Time Spiral* flashback draft on *Magic Online*.


Since then, Void hasn't seen play in older formats (though, now that I squint, it maybe could in Modern), but its real value lies in Commander and Cube, where it can be a powerful sweeper, especially against token strategies or decks with lower curves.


Plus, no robot suits.


Today's *EMA* Previews

1. [8 Things to Remember from the Modern GP Weekend](http://www.channelfireball.com/articles/8-things-to-remember-from-the-modern-gp-weekend/) | ChannelFireball | Frank Karsten

While we're all a bit caught up in the excitement for *Eternal Masters*, Frank Karsten is here to remind us that the past Modern Weekend taught us a lot about Modern right now. At least eight things, anyway.

============================================


1. [How Learning to Play *Magic: The Gathering* Changed My Life](http://uproxx.com/life/learn-to-play-magic-the-gathering/2/) | Uproxx | David Pemberton

I missed this a few days ago somehow (previews and whatnot, I'm sure), but it was cool enough to post anyway. Plus, you probably haven't seen it. In this piece, David Pemberton shares how he went from lonely, depressed, and bored to playing *Magic* and doing something he hadn't done in a long time—smiling.


1. [Titans of Commander VS!](http://www.starcitygames.com/article/32984_Titans-Of-Commander-VS.html) | StarCityGames.com | Justin Parnell and Stephen Green

All bets are off as the Commander VS crew ditches the themes and play decks that have previously won Commander VS episodes in the past. Battle!

Top 25
======


1. The Grand Prix Giveth and the Grand Prix Taketh Away

It's a pretty simple story this week—do well at one of two Grand Prix, and you rise. Don't do well at a Grand Prix, and someone is there, more than happy to take your place.


This week, Mike Sigrist, Sam Black, and Shota Yasooka turned in strong performances to each climb several spots. Yasooka finished 11-5 in [Los Angeles](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/gpla16) while Sigrist and Black met in the quarterfinals of the Top 8 of [Grand Prix Charlotte](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/gpcha16).


That left a few other plays sliding down or up slightly, but no one dropped out of the Top 25 altogether. Kazuyuki Takimura is the player currently on the Top 25 trap door, but even he is safe for now.


"For now" being the important phrase. There are two more Grand Prix this weekend, in [Manchester](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/premierplay/grandprix/fact-sheet-gpman16) and [Minneapolis](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/premierplay/grandprix/fact-sheet-gpmin16), which means we're likely to see more shifts here and there as the Top 25 continues on.


Where we won't likely see any shifts for some time is at the very top of the standings, where Seth Manfield has a stranglehold on the top spot—and Owen Turtenwald's grasp on second place is equally firm. It would take a tectonic shift the size of a Pro Tour to budge either player from their perch, so don't expect there to be much movement between those two until we get to Australia later this year.

What to Watch Tonight
=====================


1. [Magic Mics](https://www.twitch.tv/magicmics)

There's always good reason to watch Reuben Bresler, Evan Erwin, and Erin Campbell talk issues of the day, but tonight (starting at 11 p.m. ET) those reasons include an exclusive preview card! The show runs on [twitch.tv/magicmics](https://www.twitch.tv/magicmics), so I highly suggest tuning in.


Community Spotlight
===================


1. [Young Mage](http://www.youngmage.com/)

Young Mage is an awesome video blog aimed at kids and hosted by the Young Mage himself! It's both adorable and informative. Perfect for younger players, but, as the Young Mage himself says, you can be any age and still be a Young Mage.


Deck of the Day
===============


1. [Necropotence](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Necropotence) is busted

After previewing [Hymn to Tourach](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hymn+to+Tourach) this morning, I got a little nostalgic. And then I started thinking about [Hymn to Tourach](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hymn+to+Tourach) pairing with [Necropotence](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Necropotence) to absolutely bury opponents. And then I remembered all that talk about "what makes [Necropotence](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Necropotence) so special" that happened when we previewed it as a mythic rare, and realized we could all use a little history lesson.


The year is 1997, the tournament is Pro Tour Chicago, and the player is Randy Buehler, not yet in the Hall of Fame or masterminding Vintage Super League.


The deck is [Necropotence](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Necropotence), and the opponents are all dead.


Combining [Necropotence](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Necropotence) and [Hymn to Tourach](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hymn+to+Tourach) meant you almost always won the card advantage game—by a lot. Adding in [Demonic Consultation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Demonic+Consultation) meant you always had access to [Necropotence](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Necropotence) (or anything else, really).


These three cards were so powerful, you could basically surround them with anything. [Drain Life](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Drain+Life) hasn't been a Standard-playable card since. [Firestorm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Firestorm) has really only been used in reanimator decks, but here it could be used simply because you just had so many extra cards. And [Knight of Stromgald](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Knight+of+Stromgald) and [Order of the Ebon Hand](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Order+of+the+Ebon+Hand) are fine creatures, sure, but that's about all they are—fine.


But by the power of The Skull (with some help from [Lightning Bolt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt)), this deck was a monster. You can see that, unlike other Necro decks, Randy didn't even bother with [Nevinyrral's Disk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nevinyrral%27s+Disk) or [Ivory Tower](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ivory+Tower)—which were safety nets to keep you from losing to [Necropotence](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Necropotence) itself—and simply relied on the raw power of the three-mana enchantment to get him there.


Respect The Skull.
