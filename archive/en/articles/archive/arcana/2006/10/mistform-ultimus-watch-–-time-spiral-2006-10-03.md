![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/mtgcom/arcana300/mistformultimuswatch.jpg)Welcome again to Mistform Ultimus Watch! In this recurring sub-feature of Magic Arcana we keep track of everybody's favorite legendary illusion (and bane of trivia enthusiasts everywhere) to see what creature types it has gained and/or lost.

We last [checked in](/en/articles/archive/mistform-ultimus-watch-coldsnap-edition-2006-07-31) with the Ultimus after the release of *Coldsnap*. Since then, *Time Spiral* and its associated set of [timeshifted cards](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=magic/cardlist/timespiral-timeshifted) have released. Although those hourglass-marked cards are themed around **Magic’s** past, [Mistform Ultimus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mistform+Ultimus) has picked up an interesting set of new types.

* Eye – [Evil Eye of Orms-by-Gore](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Evil+Eye+of+Orms-by-Gore) got a tweak to interact with the new [Evil Eye of Urborg](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Evil+Eye+of+Urborg). They both get the new Eye type and can therefore attack together.
* Dauthi, Kor and Soltari – The Dauthi and the Soltari were races trapped in the interplanar gap between Rath and Dominaria (this “trapped between planes” state is tied to the shadow mechanic). The Kor were a race of nomadic humanoids in Rath, divided between the *en*-Kor and *il*-Kor. These humanoid races aren’t human, so in their new printings they get their own creature type.
* Triskelavite – Triskelavus generates a new type of token, the Triskelavite. [Mistform Ultimus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mistform+Ultimus) appreciates both the [Triskelion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Triskelion)/[Tetravus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tetravus) homage—and its new creature type.
* Splinter – [Splintering Wind](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Splintering+Wind) from *Alliances* made Sprite tokens for a time, to avoid confusion with the card [Splinter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Splinter). Now it makes Splinter tokens again.

[Mistform Ultimus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mistform+Ultimus) has lost these types:

* Cavalry – When [Moorish Cavalry](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Moorish+Cavalry) was printed in *Arabian Nights*, it was “Summon Cavalry.” Now (as seen in *Time Spiral’s* timeshifted cards) it’s a Human Knight.
* Dandan – [Dandan](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dandan) is now Creature – Fish.
* Dervish – [Whirling Dervish](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Whirling+Dervish) from *Legends* is now a Human Monk.
* Flying-Men, Sindbad and Uncle-Istvan – These single-card types (that are just people with very old templates) all become Creature—Human.
* Gaea's-Liege – [Gaea’s Liege](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gaea%E2%80%99s+Liege) becomes Creature—Avatar.
* Hunter – [Witch Hunter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Witch+Hunter) from *The Dark* becomes Creature – Human Cleric. “Hunters” in **Magic** are represented as a variety of types from Assassins to Warriors to Archers.
* Mosquito – [Swamp Mosquito](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swamp+Mosquito) was trying to keep a creature type alive all by itself, and is now consolidated into Insect.
* Sprite – Like *Ravnica’s* [Surveilling Sprite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Surveilling+Sprite), “Sprite” cards have always been Faeries. Now that [Splintering Wind](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Splintering+Wind) is back to making Splinter tokens, Sprites are no longer their own creature type in **Magic**.
* Squire – Ol’ [Squire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Squire) is actually better than he was back in the day. Now at least he’s a Human Soldier.
* Taskmaster – [Kobold Taskmaster](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kobold+Taskmaster) gets the much more sensible type line of “Kobold.”

So [Mistform Ultimus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mistform+Ultimus) is now a Lemure Construct, a Shyft Preacher, a Splinter Being, a Chicken Bringer, a Sliver King, a Nightmare Lurker, a Kor Spawn, and a Ninja Spy Horse Exorcist.

All together, as of *Time Spiral*, [Mistform Ultimus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mistform+Ultimus) is a:
