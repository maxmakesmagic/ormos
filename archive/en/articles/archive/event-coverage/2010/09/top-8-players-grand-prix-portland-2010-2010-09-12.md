**Name:** Paulo Vitor Damo da Rosa  
**Profession:****Magic** player  
**Age:** 22


Record in Sealed: 10-0  

Record and color(s) in Draft 1: 2-1  

Record and color(s) in Draft 2: 1-2


Previous top finishes (Grand Prix, Pro Tour, SCG Open, etc.):  

6 GP Top 8  

6 PT Top 8


What colors did you draft and why?  

Blue-white. I opened [Sleep](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sleep), got passed [Blinding Mage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blinding+Mage) and never saw a reason to move.


What common do you most hope to open during **Magic* 2011* drafts?  
[Foresee](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Foresee)


How many hours a week do you spend playing *Magic*?  

Depends. When there are no tournaments in sight, I preey much don't play, though I read articles and talk to people. Before tournaments, around 20-25 hours/week.


Who did you prepare for Grand Prix-Portland with?  

Channel[Fireball](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fireball).com crew.


What archetype do you feel is strongest in *Magic 2011* Draft and why do you feel that way?  

I think blue-white is the strongest overall, both colors are deep and you don't need many strong cards to make a blue-white deck work. Black-red [Act of Treason](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Act+of+Treason) is also good, but a "bad" blue-white deck is better than a "bad" black-red deck.

Red-back, green-black, just happened to be those colors, o preferences.

[Doom Blade](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Doom+Blade).

Around 10. If there is a GP/PT to prepare for, it's obviously WAY more.

This is my first money finish! I've made a deck that 2x GP Top 8'ed before. (P.S. Kik-Jiki!)


What colors did you draft and why?  

Blue-black. First pick [Doom Blade](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Doom+Blade), late Water Seravnt. I like blue a lot in this format. Pack three made me think I read pack one signals wrong.


What common do you most hope to open during **Magic* 2011* drafts?  
[Doom Blade](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Doom+Blade) is the default answer, but Ã†ther Adept is the fun answer.

6-15, maybe 20 on really busy weeks.

Brian Wong! And the rest of the Seattle crew: Gavin Verhey, Kellen Abel, Peter Beckfield, etc.

Blue-white if it is open is awesome. It just has the best Scroll Thieves.
