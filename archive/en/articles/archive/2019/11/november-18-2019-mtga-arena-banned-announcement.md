**MTG Arena Effective Date:** November 18, 2019


**Standard:**


* [Oko, Thief of Crowns](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oko%2C+Thief+of+Crowns) is banned.
* [Once Upon a Time](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Once+Upon+a+Time) is banned.
* [Veil of Summer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Veil+of+Summer) is banned.

The ban applies to both Traditional (best-of-three) and Arena (best-of-one) Standard constructed formats and events. This includes Play, Standard Ranked, Traditional Standard Play, Traditional Standard Ranked, Standard Event, and Traditional Standard Event. This does not include Direct Challenge matches except for Tournament Mode. As a general reminder, Brawl maintains a separate ban list from other Standard formats.


To read more about this change, please refer to today's [Banned and Restricted Announcement](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/news/november-18-2019-banned-and-restricted-announcement).

Important: Scheduled Maintenance
================================


We will be deploying a data only patch to implement the changes outlined below. While no downtime is expected, these changes may not be in effect until maintenance is complete. Please refer to our [status page](https://forums.mtgarena.com/forums/threads/61658) for more information.


Player Collections
==================


Players who have [Oko, Thief of Crowns](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oko%2C+Thief+of+Crowns), [Once Upon a Time](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Once+Upon+a+Time) and/or [Veil of Summer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Veil+of+Summer) as a part of their in-game collection on MTG Arena prior to 1.01.00.04 game update on November 18 will receive an equal number of Wildcards of the appropriate rarity to their collection as part of the update. Players will receive a notification in-game when the ban takes effect as well as the number and types of Wildcards they have received.


Players can still redeem Wildcards for [Oko, Thief of Crowns](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oko%2C+Thief+of+Crowns), [Once Upon a Time](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Once+Upon+a+Time) and [Veil of Summer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Veil+of+Summer) for play in non–Standard formats. There will be confirmation messages reminding players that these cards are currently banned in Standard.


Pack Collation
==============


We will be adjusting the *Throne of Eldraine* pack collation to change the rate in which [Oko, Thief of Crowns](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oko%2C+Thief+of+Crowns) and [Once Upon a Time](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Once+Upon+a+Time) appear in booster packs. After the 1.01.00.04 patch, players will only receive [Oko, Thief of Crowns](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oko%2C+Thief+of+Crowns) if they have collected playsets of every other mythic rare card and will only receive [Once Upon a Time](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Once+Upon+a+Time) if they have collected playsets of every other rare card available in *Throne of Eldraine* boosters.


[Veil of Summer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Veil+of+Summer) will still appear in *Core Set 2020* booster packs at its normal distribution rate.


These changes will not impact the collation of cards in Limited boosters used in *Throne of Eldraine* or *Core Set 2020* sealed and draft events (cards will still appear at their original distribution rate).


Individual Card Rewards (ICRs)
==============================


[Oko, Thief of Crown](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oko%2C+Thief+of+Crown) and [Once Upon a Time](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Once+Upon+a+Time) will be removed from ICRs. Players may still receive [Veil of Summer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Veil+of+Summer) from ICRs. Players will receive vault progress for any copies of [Veil of Summer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Veil+of+Summer) they receive beyond a playset.


A Note on In-game Events
========================


Standard Events
---------------


If you were participating in a Traditional Standard and/or Standard Event using a deck that included any of these cards prior to the 1.01.00.04 game update, you will still be able to complete the event with your current deck. Please note that your deck will be flagged as invalid because of the ban, however, this will not prevent you from finishing a previously entered event. Once you have finished the current event, you will no longer be able to submit decks that contain these cards.


Standard Cascade
----------------


[Oko, Thief of Crowns](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oko%2C+Thief+of+Crowns), [Once Upon a Time](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Once+Upon+a+Time), and [Veil of Summer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Veil+of+Summer) will remain playable in the Festival of The Fae: Standard Cascade event.
