Welcome to a macabre edition of Sketches! Today, we're taking a look at [Wretched Banquet](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wretched+Banquet). Those of fragile and weak constitutions might want to steel themselves for a challenge.

### Artist Portfolio

 Artist [Nils Hamm](http://beta.gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&artist=+Nils+Hamm) has illustrated 28 **Magic** cards, going back to *Future Sight* and *Tenth Edition*.

### Art Description

The first step of the creation of a card's art is its art description. The art description tells the artist what the card will do, what its flavor is, and what the mood of the illustration should be. Here were the instructions given to Nils for [Wretched Banquet](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wretched+Banquet):


> 
> Color: Black spell  
>  Location: Grixis  
>  Action: This spell represents the thirst of the wretched vampires of Grixis. There arenâ€™t many living creatures on Grixis, so vampires there have had to feed on other undead creatures, making them bony, wasted husks. Show one of these wretched, starving vampires sinking its fangs into the neck of a limp, fleshy zombie. Running out from the wound, instead of blood, we see rivulets of blackish-greenish ichor.  
>  Focus: The bite is the most important part. Feel free to "zoom in" on or otherwise highlight that action.  
>  Mood: We all do what we have to, to eat.

### Sketches

Here's the initial sketch that Nils submitted:

Okay, that's a little more sketch-y than what we usually show, but it looks kind of neat. Let's skip ahead to a more completed version.

This version clearly shows a ravening vampire, but the creative team wanted to make a few changes to the victim. It's more interesting if the vampire isn't feeding on a helpless pale waif, which vampires have been doing constantly since Bram Stoker. In fact, if the victim is a rotting zombie, that will show how hungry the vampires of Grixis must be.

### Final Art
