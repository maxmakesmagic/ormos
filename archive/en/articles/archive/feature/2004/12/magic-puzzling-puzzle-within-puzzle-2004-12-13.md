Magic: the Puzzling - Puzzle Within a Puzzle!

At its most fundamental level the game of **Magic** is ultimately just one large puzzle made up of several smaller puzzles. Which are the correct pieces to use for deck construction? In what way do I need to use my cards to turn these pieces into a winning game? And because of that nature, **Magic** (like chess and other great games) lends itself well to puzzle creation.

One of my favorite kinds of **Magic** puzzles are those that Mark Rosewater originally put together in a Duelist magazine series called "Magic: the Puzzling." The idea is to look at a given **Magic** scenario and find a way to win, even if it is a bit tricky. While these types of puzzles are interesting (and educational), Scott Johns and I felt that we needed to find a way to go above and beyond that level for Puzzle Week. After all, **Magic** itself is a puzzle made up of smaller puzzles, not just one simple problem.

So, without further ado, I present you with a puzzle within a puzzle. To solve this week's Feature Article, you must first determine which cards you are playing with, and then determine how to use those cards to win the game (though note that the game being played may be of use in figuring out some of the clues). One hint: remember that this is an Extended game when considering which cards you think may be the answers to the following questions. Have fun taking on as many of these as you find enjoyable, and if you get them all good luck on the final puzzle – here we go!

### The Puzzle

You are playing a match of Extended with your opponent, Scott. You have been racing up to this point, but Scott's sideboard tech, CARD 6, threatens to kill you in short order. After drawing CARD 11 for the turn, though, things are looking up. Your goal is to win this turn.

Scott (4 life)

In Play:

* 1 CARD 3
* 1 CARD 4
* 1 CARD 5
* 1 CARD 6
* 3 CARD 7 (tapped)
* 1 CARD 2 (tapped)

No relevant cards in hand / graveyard.

You (2 life)

In Play:

* 1 CARD 8
* 1 CARD 9 (imprinted with [Mana Leak](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak))
* 3 CARD 1
* 1 CARD 10

In Hand:

* CARD 11
* CARD 12
* CARD 13
* CARD 15

Graveyard:

* 3 CARD 1

Other: Removed From Game / Sideboard:

* CARD 14
* CARD 16
* CARD 17
* CARD 18

### Card Clues

Example Clue:


> CARD 141  
> *A) Color*  
>  The first card, alphabetically, in *Homelands*.  
> *B) A word in the card title*  
>  Electric, Rule, Water

The solution to (A) is [Abbey Gargoyles](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Abbey+Gargoyles), which is a white card, so CARD 141 is a white card.

The solution to (B) is Slide (Electric Slide, Slide Rule, Water Slide), so CARD 141 has ‘Slide' in its title.

Therefore, CARD 141 is a white card with Slide in its title. The only such card is [Astral Slide](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Astral+Slide).

The creatures in the list exactly die to the next creature without surviving (ie: the 5/3 kills the 2/5 in combat without a point of damage to spare, the 3/6 kills the 5/3, etc.) There are several 4/7 creatures to come next in the series, and two 7/5 creatures. There are currently no 5/8 creatures, however, so either of the two 7/5's would be the end of the series.

Notice that CARD 9 in the main puzzle is imprinted with [Mana Leak](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak). The other choices for this puzzle have a converted mana cost of 1, 8, and 9. There are no cards with imprint that have these CMC's.

11) **[Cunning Wish](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cunning+Wish)**



>  A) Matches [Mana Short](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Short) (this card and card 16 need to be solved simultaneously).
> 
> 
>  B) Any of the 5 'Wishes' ([Burning Wish](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Burning+Wish), [Death Wish](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Death+Wish), [Golden Wish](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Golden+Wish), [Living Wish](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Living+Wish), [Cunning Wish](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cunning+Wish)). [Chaos Orb](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chaos+Orb) was the inspiration for the two *Unhinged* cards, and [Ring of Ma'ruf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ring+of+Ma%27ruf) was the inspiration for the wishes.

> 
> 
> 


14) **[Boomerang](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Boomerang)**



>  A) [Dissipate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dissipate) (Richard Kane Ferguson). The parallel is that the second spell does the same as the first spell, but also removes the target from the game. The analogy is still not perfect. For example, the card could be [Mana Drain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Drain), since [Disintegrate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Disintegrate) is a souped-up version of [Blaze](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blaze), as [Mana Drain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Drain) is of [Counterspell](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterspell). Taking clue B into account, though, it's clearly [Dissipate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dissipate).

> 
> 
>  B) [Circle of Protection: Shadow](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Circle+of+Protection%3A+Shadow) (*Tempest*, Enchantment, CMC of 2). The rest are misprinted cards.
> 
> 


16) **[Mana Short](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Short)**



>  A) Any card with 'Mana' in its title. 
> 
> 
>  B) [Circle of Protection: Blue](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Circle+of+Protection%3A+Blue) (Dameon Willich). Only [Mana Short](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Short)/[Cunning Wish](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cunning+Wish) and [Mana Seism](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Seism)/[Burning Wish](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Burning+Wish) both meet criteria A, and offer possible matches for CARD 11. Edward P. Beard, Jr. illustrated [Mana Seism](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Seism), but none of the Circles. Therefore the artist must be one of the artists of [Mana Short](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Short). Dameon Willich illustrated both a version of [Mana Short](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Short) and a version of [Circle of Protection: Blue](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Circle+of+Protection%3A+Blue).

17) **[Shadow Rift](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shadow+Rift)**



> Gain shadow + deal 3 damage + draw a card – deal 3 damage = gain shadow + draw a card.

### And the rest...


This is what the final puzzle will look like with all of the cards revealed. You do not in fact need to know all the cards to solve this puzzle – but you only get full credit if you managed to solve all of cards 1-18, too.


You are playing a match of Extended with your opponent, Scott. You have been racing up to this point, but Scott's sideboard tech, [Underworld Dreams](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Underworld+Dreams), threatens to kill you in short order. After drawing [Cunning Wish](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cunning+Wish) for the turn, though, things are looking up. Your goal is to win this turn.
