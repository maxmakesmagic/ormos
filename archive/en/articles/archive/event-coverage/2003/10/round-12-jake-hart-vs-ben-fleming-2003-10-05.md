Jake Hart drafted an aggressive Green Red deck, it hosted a lot of artifact removal, a [Grab the Reins](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grab+the+Reins) and an [Electrostatic Bolt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Electrostatic+Bolt) as well as a lot of solid creatures including a monster [Plated Slagwurm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plated+Slagwurm). Ben Fleming also had Red cards but mixed them with Blue.

### Game One

![Krark-Clan Grunt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Krark-Clan+Grunt)Jake won the roll but had to wait for Ben to take his mulligan, Ben kept his second hand which had 2 spellbombs, but only one land. Both Jake and Ben cycled their spellbombs and on turn 3 Ben played a [Krark-Clan Grunt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Krark-Clan+Grunt), Jake had a blocker with his bottle gnomes. The [Bottle Gnomes](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bottle+Gnomes) got sent to the graveyard when Ben sacrificed his [Pyrite Spellbomb](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyrite+Spellbomb) to give his grunt first strike. Giving Jake 3 life. Ben added to his team with a [Goblin Replica](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Replica). Jake played out a [Vulshok Berserker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vulshok+Berserker) and swung in for three damage. Ben attacked back for four damage and played out an unimpressive [Slith Strider](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Slith+Strider). Jake sent his Berserker back into the red zone and played a [Tel-Jilad Archers](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tel-Jilad+Archers) which held back Ben's army.Ben could only play out an [Aether Spellbomb](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aether+Spellbomb) and a [Alpha Myr](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Alpha+Myr) and passed the turn. Jake's land drop for the turn was a [Stalking Stones](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stalking+Stones), Jake shattered Ben's goblin and played a [Serum Tank](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Serum+Tank). Ben didn't want Jake to be the only one drawing extra cards and sent his Slith into Jake's Archers. Ben drew a land, which was what he was after so he could play out his [Myr Enforcer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Myr+Enforcer). 

Jake just draws a card from his tank, attacked and passed back the turn. Ben still not happy to draw only one card a turn played a [Thoughtcast](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtcast), drew a scimitar and attempted to put it on his grunt. Jake killed off the grunt with an [Electrostatic Bolt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Electrostatic+Bolt), Ben saved it by sacrificing his [Aether Spellbomb](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aether+Spellbomb) to return it to his hand. 

Leaving all of his mana open Jake passed back the turn back to Ben. Ben played out his second [Myr Enforcer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Myr+Enforcer) which now only costs him three mana. Ben attacked with both his [Alpha Myr](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Alpha+Myr) and his [Myr Enforcer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Myr+Enforcer) with a Scimitar. Jake showed why he didn't play anything on his turn and played a [Neddlebug](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Neddlebug) at instant speed, killing the [Alpha Myr](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Alpha+Myr). On Jake's Turn, Jake destroyed the [Myr Enforcer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Myr+Enforcer) with his [Viridian Shaman](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Viridian+Shaman) and sent his army in.

Seeing that there was lethal damage on the table next turn, Ben looked at his next card then scooped.

Jake leads 1-0

### Game Two

Ben started off the game with a [Pyrite Spellbomb](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyrite+Spellbomb), next turn following it up with an [Alpha Myr](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Alpha+Myr). Jake shattered Ben's Spellbomb. Both players put down [Klark-Clan Grunt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Klark-Clan+Grunt)s on each of their turns.

Ben played a [Leonin Scimitar](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leonin+Scimitar) which lets him play his [Thoughtcast](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtcast) for only three mana. Ben attacked and traded his Grunt for Jake's, and doing two damage.

Jake ripped a land off the top of his deck and passed the turn with 4 mana untapped. Before attacking Ben played a [Myr Enforcer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Myr+Enforcer) before he attacked. Jake again had the [Neddlebug](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Neddlebug) to kill the [Alpha Myr](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Alpha+Myr).

![Predator's Strike](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Predator%27s+Strike)Jake played out his [Serum Tank](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Serum+Tank) and Ben had a second [Myr Enforcer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Myr+Enforcer) and equipped it. The next turn Ben put both of his Myrs into the red zone, only to have one die to a [Predator's Strike](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Predator%27s+Strike)d [Needlebug](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Needlebug). Jake added to his team with a [Krark-Clan Grunt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Krark-Clan+Grunt) and a [Bottle Gnomes](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bottle+Gnomes) and Ben added an [Atog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Atog) and a [Slith Strider](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Slith+Strider). Jake having run out of counters on his [Serum Tank](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Serum+Tank) only had a play of a [Tel-Jilad Archers](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tel-Jilad+Archers).Ben decided it was time to attack, and gets through with his Atog but his Slith gets blocked and killed.

Ben drew a Lumenguard Warden and equipped it with his Scimitar.

Jakes answer to that was a [Plated Slagwurm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plated+Slagwurm). Ben wasn't afraid and played a [Silver Myr](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Silver+Myr) and an [Aether Spellbomb](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aether+Spellbomb) which gave Jake's tank some more counters.

Jake got rid of the [Atog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Atog) with a [Grab the Reins](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grab+the+Reins) and threw it at the [Silver Myr](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Silver+Myr). Without enough power on the board to kill the [Plated Slagwurm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plated+Slagwurm) Ben didn't block and took eight.

Ben peeled another creature and played out his [Goblin Replica](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Replica), this time blocking with all his men to trade his [Myr Enforcer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Myr+Enforcer) and a [Lumingrid Warder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lumingrid+Warder) for the 8/8 Wurm. Ben had another blocker with a [Cobalt Golem](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cobalt+Golem) but Jake had the [Electrostatic Bolt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Electrostatic+Bolt) and was able to attack for the win.

Jake Defeated Ben 2-0
