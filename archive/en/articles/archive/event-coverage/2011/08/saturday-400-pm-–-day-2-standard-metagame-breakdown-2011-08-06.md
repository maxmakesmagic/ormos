Here at US Nationals, Day 2 concludes with more rounds of Standard. This is the place where solid shots at top eight will either be solidified or will miss in the final moments.


The metagame is dominated by Caw Blade, the blue/white control deck that has had to adapt to the bannings of both Jace, the Mind Sculptor and Stoneforge Mystic. It would seem that it has succeeded in doing so, as the most represented deck in the field, at a little over a third of all players still in running it. Varieties of Splinter Twin, Valakut and Birthing Pod decks follow, after which there is a fair variety of individual decks, including such intriguing singleton contenders as a Death's Shadow Green/Black deck, and a revival of Mono Black Control.
