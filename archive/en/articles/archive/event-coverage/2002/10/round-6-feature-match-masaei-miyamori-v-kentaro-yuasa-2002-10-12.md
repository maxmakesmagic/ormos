![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gputs02/976.jpg)Masaei Miyamori may look like he just picked up the cards, but don't let that fool you. The thirteen year-old wunderkind has been tearing up Japanese tournaments for over a year. He's second on Hobby Japan's Junior (15-and-under) rankings list, just behind Shinsuke Hayashi. Today he's already at 4-1, and making a run at Day 2. His opponent this round is the always-stoic Kentaro Yuasa, whose pace of play verges on impercebtible. 

Miyamori started with an inauspicious mulligan. His [Disciple of Grace](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Disciple+of+Grace) was met by a [Battlefield Medic](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Battlefield+Medic), and then he had no third-turn play. Always a bad sign. His fourth turn he spent playing [Explosive Vegetation](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Explosive+Vegetation), while Yuasa's mystery monster was free to smash. Yuasa added a [Severed Legion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Severed+Legion) to his team and passed it back to Miyamori. He made a [Daunting Defender](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Daunting+Defender), but things were not looking good for him.

The Legion struck. Yuasa made yet another morphed creature. Miyamori answered with [Dive Bomber](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dive+Bomber). A [Doomed Necromancer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Doomed+Necromancer) from Yuasa strengthened his defenses. Miyamori decided that his flyer was his best bet, and enchanted it with [Improvised Armor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Improvised+Armor). Yuasa revealed [Daru Healer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Daru+Healer) to soften the blow. Then he swung in with his remaining mystery ogre and took down the [Daunting Defender](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Daunting+Defender) with [Inspirit](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inspirit).

Things were downhill from there. The floodgates were opened to swarm attacks from Yuasa. [Pacifism](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pacifism) made sure the [Dive Bomber](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dive+Bomber) couldn't race. Miyamori was short on defenders. [Symbiotic Elf](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Symbiotic+Elf) bought him some time, but not much. [Doom Cannon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Doom+Cannon) meant he needed [Akroma's Vengeance](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Akroma%27s+Vengeance). He didn't get it.

Yuasa 1 - Miyamori 0

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gputs02/977.jpg)Miyamori's draw for game two was more suited to racing. He started with [Thoughtbound Primoc](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtbound+Primoc) and [Dive Bomber](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dive+Bomber) opposite Yuasa's [Battlefield Medic](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Battlefield+Medic) and [Severed Legion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Severed+Legion). Yuasa made [Nantuko Husk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nantuko+Husk), still behind, and Miyamori came back with [Wirewood Elf](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wirewood+Elf) and a secret man. Yuasa hit for four and made a secret of his own.

Now Miyamori was thinking. Four more damage brought Yuasa to ten. He decided to hand it over. Yuasa unmorphed his [Daru Healer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Daru+Healer), and Miyamori chose to [Solar Blast](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Solar+Blast) the [Battlefield Medic](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Battlefield+Medic), despite holding [Chain of Plasma](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chain+of+Plasma) and racing in the air. It still looked like he was ahead, until Yuasa dropped [Starlit Sanctum](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Starlit+Sanctum). The race was a lot tighter.

He brought Yuasa to four, planning to kill him on his next turn with the plasma. Yuasa dropped a morphed creature, cycled [Dirge of Dread](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dirge+of+Dread) on his [Nantuko Husk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nantuko+Husk), then swung for the final eight, aided by [Misery Charm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Misery+Charm).

Kentaro Yuasa defeats Masaei Miyamori 2-0
