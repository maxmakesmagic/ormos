With Prerelease of *Theros Beyond Death* later this week, what better way to celebrate than another community contest? Which is why we are thrilled to announce the Theros International Film Festival!


Starting today, we will be accepting submissions for 15 second videos with the creative prompt of “escape your fate.” Just as Elspeth escaped her fate from the Underworld of Theros, show us how you escape yours! Whether that be something as mundane as refusing to refill the office coffee pot (sorry Steve!), or something far more serious, share it with us.


We have some incredible prizes lined up for this contest, including these really impressive Ashiok statues made by community artist [Miss Monster Mel](https://www.instagram.com/missmonstermel/). The top four winners of this contest will each receive one of the four statues, and a total of ten winners will be named Official Selections for the Theros International Film Festival. Once all ten winners are selected, they will be debuted on our [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/wizards_magic/) account as official selections to the world.


The first, second, third, and fourth place winners will receive the custom Ashiok statues. They will also receive a full foil set of *Theros Beyond Death*, a sealed booster box of *Theros Beyond Death*, ten *Theros Beyond Death* Collector Boosters and ten codes that can be redeemed for *Theros Beyond Death* booster packs on *MTG Arena*.


The fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth and tenth place winners will receive one full foil set of *Theros Beyond Death*, a sealed booster box of *Theros Beyond Death*, five *Theros Beyond Death* Collector Boosters and five codes that can be redeemed for *Theros Beyond Death* booster packs on *MTG Arena*.
