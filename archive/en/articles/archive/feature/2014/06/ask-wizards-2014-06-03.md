 **Q: So why is the reprint of [Phage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phage+the+Untouchable) an Avatar Minion? — [katduckcrossing](http://markrosewater.tumblr.com/post/87616037793/so-why-is-the-reprint-of-phage-an-avatar-minion)**  


**A: Mark Rosewater, Magic head designer:**


The original [Phage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phage+the+Untouchable) was just a Minion. The Great Creature Type update happened during *Lorwyn* with a small additional update during *Morningtide*. The extra *Morningtide* update changed her to a Zombie Minion, which is what she is in current Gatherer because the *Conspiracy* cards are not yet in Gatherer/Oracle. [*They are scheduled to go in Tuesday, June 3, 2014. —ed.*]


The card was changed in *Conspiracy* because the current creative team felt putting Zombie was factually inaccurate and as the card had never been printed with the word "Zombie" on it they felt okay making the change from Zombie to Avatar.
