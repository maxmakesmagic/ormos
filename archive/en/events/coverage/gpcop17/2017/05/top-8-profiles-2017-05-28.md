 Name:**  Mattia Rizzi




**Age:** 23




**Occupation:** *Magic* player




**Hometown:** Lecco, Italy




**Previous *Magic* accomplishments:**



Three Grand Prix Top 8s. Top 4 at the 2016 World *Magic* Cup. Gold level pro.



**What deck did you play this weekend, and why did you choose it?**



Grixis [Death's Shadow](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Death%27s+Shadow). I was undecided between Eldrazi Tron and this deck. In the end, I chose this because I think it's more solid and you also need more skill to play it.



**What was the best card in your main deck, and why?**



[Snapcaster Mage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snapcaster+Mage). I just love it and think it's the best card in all of Modern.



**What was the best card out of your sideboard, and why?**



[Surgical Extraction](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Surgical+Extraction), the best card against combo decks and very powerful with discard effects.

**Age:** 33




**Occupation:** Software developer




**Hometown:** Aschaffenburg, Germany




**Previous *Magic* accomplishments:**



Competing at the 2013 World *Magic* Cup.



**What deck did you play this weekend, and why did you choose it?**



[Collected Company](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Collected+Company) with [Devoted Druid](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Devoted+Druid). I started to play with the deck immediately upon the release of [Vizier of Remedies](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vizier+of+Remedies) and it simply felt too strong.



**What was the best card in your main deck, and why?**



[Devoted Druid](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Devoted+Druid), because it needs to be killed on sight, regardless of the combo being present or not.



**What was the best card out of your sideboard, and why?**



[Tireless Tracker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tireless+Tracker), because it is great in grindy matchups.

**Age:** 24




**Occupation:** Data scientist




**Hometown:** Paris, France




**Previous *Magic* accomplishments:**



Grand Prix Trial Top 8 ...



**What deck did you play this weekend, and why did you choose it?**



[Dredge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dredge), since it's the deck I had the most practice with and I thought it was decently positioned in the metagame.



**What was the best card in your main deck, and why?**



Probably [Life from the Loam](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Life+from+the+Loam). It's the card that makes the deck fall into place.



**What was the best card out of your sideboard, and why?**



Probably [Lightning Axe](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Axe). Helps in so many matchups, killing everything that passes the bolt test.

**Age:** 25




**Occupation:** Tourist




**Hometown:** Lahti, Finland

None.



**What deck did you play this weekend, and why did you choose it?**



Titan Shift. Had experience with the deck and all the cards for it.



**What was the best card in your main deck, and why?**



[Scapeshift](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scapeshift). Allows you to win in positions where you're nearly dead.



**What was the best card out of your sideboard, and why?**



[Obstinate Baloth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Obstinate+Baloth). Sick sideboard which can be brought in in almost every matchup.

**Occupation:** *Magic* player




**Hometown:** Jyllinge, Denmark




**Previous *Magic* accomplishments:**



Two Pro Tour Top 8s, World *Magic* Cup victory.



**What deck did you play this weekend, and why did you choose it?**



Blue-Red Storm. It's a great deck and I wanted to play a deck that did its own thing, so I didn't need to know what every deck is playing.



**What was the best card in your main deck, and why?**



[Gifts Ungiven](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gifts+Ungiven). If you have any of the eight creatures in play, it's really easy to kill with that card.



**What was the best card out of your sideboard, and why?**



[Empty the Warrens](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Empty+the+Warrens). It's a key card, essential to win against discard, counters, graveyard hate, and to beat [Death's Shadow](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Death%27s+Shadow).

[Ensnaring Bridge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ensnaring+Bridge)! Because people can't attack you!

[Ghirapur Æther Grid](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ghirapur+%C3%86ther+Grid). People don't expect it and it's a way to interact against small creatures and [Stony Silence](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stony+Silence).
