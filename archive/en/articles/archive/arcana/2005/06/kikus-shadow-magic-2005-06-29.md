Legendary assassin **[Kiku, Night's Flower](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kiku%2C+Night%27s+Flower)** uses magic instead of messy knives to kill, mystically animating her mark's shadow and forcing it to do the dirty work. She leaves a flower as a calling card; note how she seems to be dropping one on the viewer in her art (meaning the perspective is that of one who's being slain by her):

The *Saviors of Kamigawa* removal spell **[Kiku's Shadow](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kiku%27s+Shadow)** represents an instance of Kiku's shadow-assassination magic. See how the ponytailed mage is being, er, skewered by his own shadow? 

Also note how the shadow's eyes are pink flowers -- an element of Kiku's calling card.
