When I started asking pro players what their most feared card in Sealed Deck was, there was a common answer: [Archangel Avacyn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Archangel+Avacyn). It turns out the legendary angel is quite strong. I then pressed on the pros to let me know the next card on their list:

**Four-time GP Top 8 competitor Chapman Sim:** The planeswalkers and [Drogskol Cavalry](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Drogskol+Cavalry). Once any of them get going, it's pretty difficult to stop them

**Grand Prix Taipei Champion Huang Hao-Shan:** I'm pretty afraid of [Sorin, Grim Nemesis](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sorin%2C+Grim+Nemesis), but I'm equally afraid of Red-Green Werewolf decks.

**Four-time PT Top 8 competitor Lee Shi Tian:** [Ongoing Investigation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ongoing+Investigation). When it goes online you just can't stop the card advantage. You trade and then they exile their creatures and just continue getting Clues.

**Pro Tour Hall of Famer Kenji Tsumura:** [Ever After](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ever+After). It's really good in long games and in this format the games are either very long or very fast.
