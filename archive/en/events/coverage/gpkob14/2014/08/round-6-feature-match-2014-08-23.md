 Pro Tour *Journey into Nyx* Finalist, Nam Sung Wook made the trip to Kobe with a pair of his MTG Mint Card teammates, Kuo Tzu Ching and Li Shi Tian. All three of them opted to play Blue-Red-Green [Scapeshift](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scapeshift) this weekend. The Modern staple attempts to get seven or eight lands in play with mana accelerants such as Sakura Tribe Elder and [Search for Tomorrow](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Search+for+Tomorrow) before using [Scapeshift](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scapeshift) to put into play [Valakut, the Molten Pinnacle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Valakut%2C+the+Molten+Pinnacle) and a number of Mountains, instantly dealing an opponent lethal damage.




 His opponent was Japanese veteran, Kenichiro Arai. Arai has had high level tournament finishes since the late 2000s, but has yet to make a Grand Prix or Pro Tour top eight. This weekend, he brought his White-Blue-Red midrange deck into battle. Including high impact creatures such as [Wall of Omens](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wall+of+Omens), [Restoration Angel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Restoration+Angel), [Snapcaster Mage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snapcaster+Mage), and [Vendilion Clique](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vendilion+Clique), along with a countermagic suite, he hoped to land a creature and ride it to victory while countering anything that got in the way.



The Games



 The first game started off slowly; Nam set up his draws with [Serum Visions](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Serum+Visions) and [Telling Time](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Telling+Time), while Arai played some [Celestial Colonnade](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Celestial+Colonnade)s and a [Wall of Omens](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wall+of+Omens).




 At the end Arai's fourth turn, Nam attempted to use [Cryptic Command](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cryptic+Command), hoping to bounce one of Arai's [Celestial Colonnade](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Celestial+Colonnade)s and draw a card. Arai responded with a [Vendilion Clique](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vendilion+Clique).




 Clique revealed a landless hand from Nam, which included a singleton copy of [Scapeshift](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scapeshift). Arai pushed the four-mana sorcery to the bottom of Nam's library.




 Removing the [Scapeshift](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scapeshift) was not enough, though. When Arai tapped out on the following for a [Blade Splicer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blade+Splicer), Nam untapped and cast [Scapeshift](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scapeshift) sending the match to a second game.
