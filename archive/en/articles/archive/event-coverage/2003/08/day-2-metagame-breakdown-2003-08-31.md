There's significantly less science to the tabulating of the Day 2 metagame, and a lot more beancounting. The actual decklists you can [find here](/en/articles/archive/event-coverage/2003-grand-prix-atlanta-day-2-decks-2003-08-31), if your curiosity about details needs satisfying.

Here then, are the numbers themselves.

**Goblins –14**

![Goblin Warchief](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Goblin+Warchief)From fifty-four to fourteen is quite the rousing success. A lot of the pros in the know anticipated a Wake-heavy field and ran this deck with the intention of brawling over them. They succeeded.**Wake – 13**

Mirari's Wake decks took a little more than Day 1 percentage, showing that the deck's proclaimed prowess is no joke.

**Mono-Black Control – 8**

A big gain here, sending a third of its players across into Day 2. Could this be the fabled Rock that manages to punch through Paper?

**Black-White Control – 7**

Well, you can't blame people for not trusting Kibler right away. He's known as the boy who cried "Best Deck Evar". This time, though, he's definitely made a splash by handing out his take on Gabriel Nassif's "Decree Dot Dec". Two of these seven are with a roguish redesign.

**Goblin Bidding – 4**

Poor, poor, Goblin Bidding. It's just second fiddle to Goblins. 

**Reanimator – 3**

![Rotlung Reanimator](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Rotlung+Reanimator)Reanimator's thirty-odd players became three, which doesn't feel like a gain, but is.**Blue-Green Madness – 2**

A huge downswing in population. Perhaps its day is done?

**Mono-Black Braids – 2**

This deck seems poised to crush the wealth of control decks.

**Red-Green Beats – 2**

Another downswing. It just doesn't have the gas of the Goblin decks.

**"The Red Army" – 2**

"The other Goblin Bidding" managed to put up something of a fight.

**One-of's – 7**

These are: Mono-Red Control, Blue-White Control, Blue-Green-Black Madness, Zombies, Red-White Slide and Red-Green Goblins
