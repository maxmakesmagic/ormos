After beating Jacques van Eeden’s Abzan deck 2-1 in the quarterfinals, Teruya Kakumae advanced to face John Brugman’s Temur deck, after Brugman had bested Dylan Goldsmith 2-0 in the Temur mirror.


Both players traded creatures and developed their boards, but neither made much headway in their efforts to win the game, until Brugman refilled his hand with a [Shamanic Revelation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shamanic+Revelation) for four.


Brugman found and employed a [Savage Knuckleblade](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Savage+Knuckleblade), but Kakumae’s Mardu horde supplied a seemingly endless supply of sacrificial 1/1 creature tokens to get in its way. Meanwhile, Kakumae had found a [Noxious Dragon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Noxious+Dragon) and a [Leaping Master](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leaping+Master), and retaliated in the air.


A [Sandsteppe Mastodon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sandsteppe+Mastodon) traded with the Dragon, but understandably failed to take out the Knuckleblade. In the end, the [Leaping Master](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leaping+Master) was unable to keep up with “Big Knucks”.



**Brugman 1 – Kakumae 0**



Both players traded creatures again in the early game, but Kakumae quickly found the midgame trump in a dashing [Kolaghan, the Storm’s Fury](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kolaghan%2C+the+Storm%E2%80%99s+Fury), that Brugman was unable to answer.



**Brugman 1 – Kakumae 1**



Brugman’s early [Highland Game](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Highland+Game) ran afoul a [Mardu Charm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mardu+Charm), which enabled an all up-side Bellowing Saddlebrute. Brugman was missing a fourth land, and could only play another [Highland Game](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Highland+Game) and a Morph.


[Burn Away](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Burn+Away) roasted the Morph – a [Rattleclaw Mystic](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rattleclaw+Mystic) – and Kakumae kept attacking with the Saddlebrute. Brugman fell to 8 before the Saddlebrute was joined by a [Noxious Dragon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Noxious+Dragon). Brugman drew a fourth land, but it wasn’t enough.


“I’ve had a good run!” Brugman announced with a smile, offering Kakumae the handshake.
