**Card of the Day - vendredi 29 avril 2005**


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Soltari%20Monk)#### Soltari Monk


*Tempest* uncommon. The shadow mechanic was originally codenamed "Astral" before it was changed to "Shadow". Then it spent some time as "Ethereal" before returning to the familiar name.
 


**Card of the Day - jeudi 28 avril 2005**


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Powder%20Keg)#### Powder Keg


*Urza's Destiny* rare. Not all playtest names are short: Powder Keg used to be called "Nevinyrral's Pinpoint Disk."
 


**Card of the Day - mercredi 27 avril 2005**


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Death%20Pits%20of%20Rath)#### Death Pits of Rath


*Tempest* rare. Before they got their evocative title, the Death Pits were known simply as "Slaughterville".
 


**Card of the Day - mardi 26 avril 2005**


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Tree%20of%20Tales)#### Tree of Tales


*Mirrodin* common. The cycle of artifact lands were originally given building names: "Windmill" for blue, "Factory" for red, "Shanty" for black, "Farmhouse" for white, and "Observatory" for green.
 


**Card of the Day - lundi 25 avril 2005**


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Mindslaver)#### Mindslaver


*Mirrodin* rare. Many people know that this was called "Gleemax" during playtesting, but its *original* name was "Helm of Volrath" (a name that was also applied to the card that became Helm of Possession.)
 


**Card of the Day - vendredi 22 avril 2005**


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Mountain%20Titan)#### Mountain Titan


*Ice Age* rare. Mountain Titan is a two-color card in two ways: not only does its mana cost require both black and red, its ability also encourages two different colors.
 


**Card of the Day - jeudi 21 avril 2005**


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Soratami%20Cloudskater)#### Soratami Cloudskater


*Champions of Kamigawa* common. After going through many different possibilities for this Moonfolk, R&D finally settled on "the new improved Cephalid Scout".
 


**Card of the Day - mercredi 20 avril 2005**


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Stronghold%20Zeppelin)#### Stronghold Zeppelin


*Nemesis* uncommon. There was behind-the-scenes discussion about whether the word "zeppelin" (coined in 1900) was an acceptably "Magic" word, or if the card should use "airship" instead.
 


**Card of the Day - mardi 19 avril 2005**


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Ghostly%20Wings)#### Ghostly Wings


*Torment* common. Sometimes it was used to give a creature flying. Sometimes it was used to boomerang an opponent's creature. And sometimes it was just used as an excuse to discard a card, since Madness and Threshold were such powerful mechanics.
 


**Card of the Day - lundi 18 avril 2005**


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Lim-D%C3%BBl%E2%80%99s%20Paladin)#### Lim-Dûl’s Paladin


*Alliances* uncommon. The only Paladin with a red component, Lim-Dûl's Paladin is also one of the only two cards associated with Lim-Dûl that isn't pure black (the other one, Lim-Dûl's Vault, is black and blue).
 


**Card of the Day - vendredi 15 avril 2005**


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Roar%20of%20Jukai)#### Roar of Jukai


*Betrayers of Kamigawa* common. Down in the lower right of the art, you can see two villagers reacting to the bad news that the kami of the forest itself is attacking them.
 


**Card of the Day - jeudi 14 avril 2005**


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Vital%20Surge)#### Vital Surge


*Betrayers of Kamigawa* common. These three forest kami are being overwhelmed with magic, which is drawing out and combining their life force.
 


**Card of the Day - mercredi 13 avril 2005**


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Overblaze)#### Overblaze


*Betrayers of Kamigawa* uncommon. In the art for Overblaze, a spell has superheated the talons of the kami; the samurai is frantically defending himself.
 


**Card of the Day - mardi 12 avril 2005**


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Goryo's%20Vengeance)#### Goryo's Vengeance


*Betrayers of Kamigawa* rare. A goryo is the vengeful kami/ghost of someone who died wrongly or prematurely. This, then, is an angry, undead oni. Scary!
 


**Card of the Day - lundi 11 avril 2005**


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Hundred-Talon%20Strike)#### Hundred-Talon Strike


*Betrayers of Kamigawa* common. White magic of the spirit world has transformed this kami into a killing machine as its arms change to whirling blades.
 


**Card of the Day - vendredi 8 avril 2005**


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Higure,%20the%20Still%20Wind)#### Higure, the Still Wind


*Betrayers of Kamigawa* rare. Higure's master gave him his name to commemorate how he came to him, unmoving in the twilight breeze.
 


**Card of the Day - jeudi 7 avril 2005**


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Kentaro,%20the%20Smiling%20Cat)#### Kentaro, the Smiling Cat


*Betrayers of Kamigawa* rare. "Cat" is a nickname, like with Mageta the Lion. Kentaro is called that because of his grin, which does not normally indicate that he's happy.
 


**Card of the Day - mercredi 6 avril 2005**


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Iwamori%20of%20the%20Open%20Fist)#### Iwamori of the Open Fist


*Betrayers of Kamigawa* rare. It's a good thing that Iwamori trained his entire life to be a powerful fighter; judging by his ability, he's had to face legendary foes every single day.
 


**Card of the Day - mardi 5 avril 2005**


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Patron%20of%20the%20Akki)#### Patron of the Akki


*Betrayers of Kamigawa* rare. Although it's technically worshipped by the Akki, the Patron cares almost nothing for them, demanding great sacrifices before it indulges their requests.
 


**Card of the Day - lundi 4 avril 2005**


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Ink-Eyes,%20Servant%20of%20Oni)#### Ink-Eyes, Servant of Oni


*Betrayers of Kamigawa* rare. The ink leaking from the eyes of Ink-Eyes is actually a red mist, a manifestation of the power she got from her Oni.
 


**Card of the Day - vendredi 1 avril 2005**


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Zombie%20Assassin)#### Zombie Assassin


*Odyssey* common. There are over a hundred Zombies in **Magic**, and yet, this is the only one that's also an assassin.
