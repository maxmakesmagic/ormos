It's rare in a tournament like this to have the two most accomplished players in the field meet in the finals. There are so many pitfalls along the way that it is almost a certainty that one will fall prey to them. Not so here at Eternal Weekend in Philly, though.


Osyp Lebedowicz, Pro Tour Champion and man-about-town, brought a UR [Delver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Delver) deck that he was hoping to test before the upcoming Legacy Grand Prix in Washington DC. It is safe to say that his testing bore fruit. This was originally orchestrated as a chance for him to test Commander 2013's [True-Name Nemesis](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=True-Name+Nemesis) in a RUG [Delver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Delver) shell, though it ended up dropping the green for a better mana base. In the end, *Nemesis* ended up being an all-star against the fair decks, and [Force of Will](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Force+of+Will) bait against the unfair decks (read: Sneak and Show and Storm).

In his way was Ari Lax, a stalwart and perennial top finisher at Legacy events, with multiple top finishes at the upper level of competition. Rather than his usual [Ad Nauseam](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ad+Nauseam) Tendrils deck, Lax opted for Death and Taxes, a mono-white aggro deck aimed at disrupting everything that opposing decks could plan on. It was interesting to see two "fair and interactive" decks playing against each other in a field that has previously been dominated by "unfair" Sneak and Show decks.


### The Games (Kind of...)


Lax opened with one of the best possible cards in this matchup, or any matchup for that matterâ€”[Stoneforge Mystic](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stoneforge+Mystic). It was two Mystics, in fact, allowing him to search up not only an [Umezawa's Jitte](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Umezawa%27s+Jitte), but a [Batterskull](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Batterskull), as well. Lebedowicz had a [Lightning Bolt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt) to stop one before it could activate, but not the second. This let him get Jitte into play, dominating Lebedowicz's [Young Pyromancer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Young+Pyromancer) in the early stages of the game. Even with Lebedowicz's [True-Name Nemesis](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=True-Name+Nemesis) presenting three points a turn, it was better served as a defender against Lax's equipped attackers. Unfortunately for Lebedowicz, Lax also had a [Mother of Runes](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mother+of+Runes) in play, allowing him a path past the *Nemesis*. This combination proved too strong for Lebedowicz, and when a [Phyrexian Revoker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phyrexian+Revoker) shut down Lebedowicz's [Engineered Explosives](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Engineered+Explosives), he just packed it in.

The next game was even more quick and painless than the first. Lax had his first-turn [Mother of Runes](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mother+of+Runes) hit with [Daze](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Daze), setting Lebedowicz back a turn in mana, but eliminating the stupidly powerful protector from the game. Lebedowicz even had the [Stifle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stifle) to stop Lax's attempt at a second-turn [Stoneforge Mystic](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stoneforge+Mystic), preventing it from searching out the game-winning [Batterskull](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Batterskull). When Lax simply tapped two mana and put the [Batterskull](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Batterskull) that he already had in his hand into play, Lebedowicz laughed. When Lax followed that by [Wasteland](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wasteland)ing Lebedowicz's second land, the laugh turned to a quick concession.


"That's about enough of that," he said, picking up his cards.


Ari Lax has defeated Osyp Lebedowicz in a quick two-game match to become the 2013 Legacy Championship winner!
