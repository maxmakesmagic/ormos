One week on from the maelstrom of the Pro Tour, and there's plenty of movement in the *Magic* Top 25 Pro Rankings. There were Grand Prix points to be won in both Europe (Krakow, Poland) and Japan (Kyoto), spanning the Constructed world. While Krakow showcased the new Standard format broadcast around the world from the Pro Tour, Kyoto covered the full breadth of the game with Legacy the format. Of the Top 25, most decided to stay in Europe to ply their newfound Standard knowledge.


Only Yuuya Watanabe and Shota Yasooka, both of whom were returning to home turf in Japan, chose Kyoto. They both had plenty to be pleased with. Watanabe climbs three places to No. 6 as a result of his 20th place finish, while Yasooka continued the fine run of form he displayed at the Pro Tour by making the Top 8 of the Grand Prix a week later. His 7th place finish in Kyoto makes him the week's biggest climber, up five to No. 15.



In Krakow, it was a true All-Star event, and a tremendous opportunity for a passionate Polish community to interact with some of the game's very finest pros. The standout performance came, without question, from Canada's Alexander Hayne. He enters the chart as the lone new entry at No. 21, courtesy of his Grand Prix victory—his fourth title. Martin Juza and Seth Manfield also made Day Two, but couldn't make a deep run. For seven others—Lee Shi Tian, Ivan Floch, Shahar Shenhar, Josh Utter-Leyton, Craig Wescoe, Ondrej Strasky, and Ben Stark—there was plenty of time for sightseeing in the beautiful city of Krakow, as they failed to reach Day Two.



Now we have a quiet couple of weeks, before a May that is packed with vast amounts of MTG goodness, culminating in the glorious *Modern Masters* Weekend. Join us next week for more from the home of the *Magic* Top 25 Pro Rankings.
