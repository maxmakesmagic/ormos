Borteh showed no signs of slowing down. Fresh off of his second place finish at World Championships, Borteh was 6-0 on the day at GP Denver. He was playing a blue-black-red control deck heavy on burn such as [Prophetic Bolt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Prophetic+Bolt), [Urza's Rage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Urza%27s+Rage), Fire/Ice and [Undermine](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Undermine). The deck put his opponents on a quick clock while he worked to control the board.


Brian Kibler had not lost a single game the entire day when he sat down against Borteh. Kibler was playing his new, highly successful design of Domain, complete with [Spiritmonger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spiritmonger)s, [Destructive Flow](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Destructive+Flow)s, [Planar Despair](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Planar+Despair), and [Pernicious Deed](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pernicious+Deed). Steve O'Mahoney-Schwartz, the only other person playing the deck, was 5-1. 


The first game saw little action from Kibler's side of the board due to a slight stall on mana after a mulligan. Borteh meanwhile dealt eight points of damage a turn at a time with his [Nightscape Familiar](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nightscape+Familiar). Before Kibler could get established, Borteh went into burn mode. He played [Prophetic Bolt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Prophetic+Bolt), [Undermine](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Undermine), [Urza's Rage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Urza%27s+Rage), and [Undermine](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Undermine). This proved more than enough to bring down Kibler.

Kibler spent a lot of time looking for the fifth land so that he could force through a [Destructive Flow](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Destructive+Flow) with an [Evasive Action](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Evasive+Action). Instead Kibler had to use the [Evasive Action](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Evasive+Action) to avoid getting [Lobotomy](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lobotomy) played on him. Borteh got the burn going once again He threw a [Prophetic Bolt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Prophetic+Bolt) Kibler's way. Then he played two [Undermine](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Undermine)s and an [Urza's Rage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Urza%27s+Rage) over the next two turns. Unable to resolve any of his spells, much less stop the [Nightscape Familiar](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nightscape+Familiar) from dealing the last few points of damage, Kibler conceded.
