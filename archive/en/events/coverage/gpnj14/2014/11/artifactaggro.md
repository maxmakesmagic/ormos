 Ashok "AC" Chitturi has been playing Eternal formats for more than a decade at this point. Once a pillar of Team Meandeck, AC is known for his ability to innovate in *Magic*'s most powerful formats. AC hasn't played a ton of tournament magic in his life, but living in New Jersey made this Grand Prix an easy trip. He's managed to go 8-1 on Day 1 in the last two Grand Prix events he attended with unique strategies of his own design. This weekend, AC brought an exciting colorless aggro deck to the table. Currently sitting at 11-1, AC is proving that his gameplay and deck building skills are world class.



I sat down with AC to talk about his exciting new aggressive Legacy strategy.
