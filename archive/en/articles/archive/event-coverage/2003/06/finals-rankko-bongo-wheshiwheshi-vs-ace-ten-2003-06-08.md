### Game 1

After some debate about which side of a one-Euro coin was heads and which was tails, Eric won the flip. He was stuck on only two [Swamp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swamp)s, but this still allowed him to cast two [Goblin Turncoat](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Turncoat)s and a [Withered Wretch](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Withered+Wretch). Jose sucked up some early beats from the Turncoat as he had [Embermage Goblin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Embermage+Goblin) and didn't want to waste blockers. Eric did find some more land but he needed [Plains](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plains) and drew [Swamp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swamp)s, and all of his Turncoats were removed by [Embermage Goblin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Embermage+Goblin). 

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gpams03/a874.jpg)Barbero dropped an [Anurid Murkdiver](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Anurid+Murkdiver), then a second Murkdiver as Eric still only had four [Swamp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swamp)s in play. The 4/3 unblockables ended the game in short order.

### Game 2

Eric once again had a second turn [Withered Wretch](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Withered+Wretch). Jose took two then played [Embalmed Brawler](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Embalmed+Brawler), amplifying with [Anurid Murkdiver](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Anurid+Murkdiver). Eric dropped a [Vile Deacon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vile+Deacon). Jose couldn't remove it, deciding to play [Lay Waste](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lay+Waste) on Eric's [Swamp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swamp) instead. Froehlich swung with both and [Inspirit](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inspirit)ed the [Withered Wretch](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Withered+Wretch). Barbero could only play an [Embermage Goblin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Embermage+Goblin) and went to seven from Froehlich's attack. Eric made [Prowling Pangolin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Prowling+Pangolin). "You don't talk so much when I have lands, do you"

Jose used [Noxious Ghoul](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Noxious+Ghoul) and [Embermage Goblin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Embermage+Goblin) to kill the [Vile Deacon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vile+Deacon), and went to one from the Pangolin. Eric played a [Fallen Cleric](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fallen+Cleric), and Jose had no way of dealing with the three potential attackers.

### Game 3

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gpams03/a866.jpg)Eric played [Silver Knight](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Silver+Knight) on turn two and a morph on turn three. Jose got through with his morph and summoned [Vengeful Dead](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vengeful+Dead). Eric also had a [Vengeful Dead](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vengeful+Dead), and swung again with his other guys, putting Jose down to fourteen. 

Barbero gave his [Vengeful Dead](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vengeful+Dead) a [Clutch of Undeath](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Clutch+of+Undeath), and attacked with that and the morph. Eric traded his dead for the morph, and went down to eleven. Froehlich hung back with a Sanctifier and used it to block the Dead before unmorphing. This knocked him to ten. Jose dropped [Anurid Murkdiver](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Anurid+Murkdiver). Eric windmill-slammed [Visara the Dreadful](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Visara+the+Dreadful), but it wasn't enough as Barbero waved a [Torrent of Fire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Torrent+of+Fire) at Eric's head, and attacked with the Murkdiver for exactly ten, before leaping out of his seat and jumping on a nearby table.

**Final Result:** Jose Barbero 2 – Eric Froehlich 1
