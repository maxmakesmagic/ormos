The latest edition of the **Duels of the Planeswalkers** video game franchise is closer than you might expect! We are pleased to announce that the game will release globally on **June 20th** (although times will vary by platform and region) across all of our platforms: Steam, XBLA, PSN, and iTunes for iPad.

**Duels of the Planeswalkers** 2013 is your first chance to play more than fifty new **Magic** cards from the upcoming ***Magic 2013** Core Set*. The launch of Duels 2013 also means that this upcoming preview season is going to be a little... different. Rather than the standard two weeks of previews back-to-back, we're going to split them up with Duels's release sitting in between them.

Starting next week, on June 11, we'll have a Duels 2013 preview week, where every card previewed is in both ***Magic** 2013* and Duels 2013. The week of Duels's release (the week starting June 18) will have no previews except what the decklists from Duels 2013 reveal. Then the week of June 25 will be ***Magic** 2013* Preview Week to wrap up our previews for this upcoming set.
