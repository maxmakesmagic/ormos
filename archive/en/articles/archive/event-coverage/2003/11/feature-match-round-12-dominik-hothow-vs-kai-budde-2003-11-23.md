With the second draft out the way it’s getting down to crunch time for the players. Both Kai Budde and Dominick Hothow have 9-2 records. As 11-3 might not be good enough to make the top 8 the tournament has effectively entered single elimination mode for both players.

Budde has a solid black-red deck packed with 11 removal spells while Hothow has a slightly shabby looking white-green deck with a bunch of [Alpha Myr](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Alpha+Myr)s and [Raise the Alarm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Raise+the+Alarm)s.

Budde had to mulligan his first hand but was happy with his second. Hothow came zipping out of the blocks with [Alpha Myr](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Alpha+Myr), Talisman, [Alpha Myr](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Alpha+Myr) and [Clockwork Condor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Clockwork+Condor). Budde traded an [Iron Myr](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Iron+Myr) for the first Alpha and had to [Shatter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shatter) the second before it looked like Hothow’s deck had blown out of Steam. Budde summoned a [Hematite Golem](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hematite+Golem) and started to hit back.

A [Soul Foundry](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soul+Foundry) looked to give Hothow a bit of mid-game as he imprinted [Titanium Golem](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Titanium+Golem). Budde [Terror](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Terror)ed a [Leonin Elder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leonin+Elder) to prevent the lifegain and kept smashing with his Golem.

The Foundry was looking slow and the Golem took a couple of big chunks out of Hothow’s life total. When he built up a force of three to double-block the Haematite Golem and a [Nim Replica](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nim+Replica) Budde was waiting with an [Electrostatic Bolt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Electrostatic+Bolt). Hothow had to tap out and reveal the last card in his hand was [Altar's Light](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Altar%27s+Light) to kill the Golem. This left the way clear for Budde to finish him off with [Shrapnel Blast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shrapnel+Blast).

Budde 1-0 Hothow

Hothow zipped out again with an [Alpha Myr](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Alpha+Myr), this time Budde traded early with a [Nim Replica](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nim+Replica). Hothow followed with a [Soldier Replica](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soldier+Replica) and [Nuisance Engine](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nuisance+Engine) that limited the damage from Budde’s [Barter in Blood](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Barter+in+Blood) although it still netted the Soldier.

Budde started eating Pest tokens with a Haematite Golem and added a [Nim Devourer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nim+Devourer). Hothow was managing to frustrate him with his token generators as a [Raise the Alarm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Raise+the+Alarm) mugged the Devourer. The Devourer came back out of the graveyard through an [Alpha Myr](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Alpha+Myr) and Budde had to hold off while Hothow brought out a [Leonin Elder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leonin+Elder) and Scimitar’ed up a Den Guard. [Grab the Reins](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grab+the+Reins) removed both Den Guard and Elder but Budde didn’t seem to have any gas and had to just sit behind his Golem and Devourer.

The Devourer had to block an [Alpha Myr](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Alpha+Myr) and when Hothow cast a [Serum Tank](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Serum+Tank) he looked well set to win the long game.

Budde added a [Pewter Golem](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pewter+Golem) only to see Glissa enter play on Hothow’s side. Budde couldn’t get rd of it immediately and ended up throwing a dying Haematite Golem at the Elf Legend with a [Shrapnel Blast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shrapnel+Blast). When Budde made a [Serum Tank](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Serum+Tank) of his own it looked like the game might get interesting. However Hothow had an [Altar's Light](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Altar%27s+Light) to ensure he would maintain the card drawing advantage.

Budde drew yet more land and then conceded to take the match to a decider.

Budde 1-1 Hothow

Budde’s early [Serum Tank](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Serum+Tank) was met with an [Altar's Light](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Altar%27s+Light) before he could make use of it. Hothow started nibbling again with an early [Raise the Alarm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Raise+the+Alarm) and used a second to ambush Budde’s Devourer.

A block, [Shrapnel Blast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shrapnel+Blast) and [Barter in Blood](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Barter+in+Blood) later and the board was clear. Hothow recovered with a Banshee Blade and then a [Nuisance Engine](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nuisance+Engine), but he only got to make one pest before Budde [Shatter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shatter)ed it. Budde recovered much better as he made the near invulnerable [Mirror Golem](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mirror+Golem) and imprinted an [Alpha Myr](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Alpha+Myr) to give it protection from artifacts and creatures.

Hothow’s [Alpha Myr](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Alpha+Myr) succumbed to a [Betrayal of Flesh](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Betrayal+of+Flesh) and when that also fetched a [Nim Devourer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nim+Devourer) back into play it looked like it was all over for Hothow. A [Pewter Golem](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pewter+Golem) was just icing on the cake.

Kai Budde beat Dominik Hothow 2-1
