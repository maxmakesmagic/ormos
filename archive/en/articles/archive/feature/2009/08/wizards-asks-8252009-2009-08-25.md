*What's your favorite **Magic** article on the Web?*


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/mtgcom/authorpics/authorpic_kellydigges.jpg)**Kelly Digges:** It's hard to even contemplate at this point how much digital ink has been spilled in relation to **Magic**. How many Usenet posts, Web articles, emails, tweets, Facebook posts, and countless discussion threads, including the ones in which you respond to this very feature.


Unfortunately, this week we *are* without your countless discussion threads, as the new Wizards Community system that will replace our previous forums takes shape. In the meantime, you can still find us out there in the social mediaverse on Twitter and on Facebook. With that in mind, we're going to do things a little differently this week.


So, about all that digital ink, and back to the question at hand: Somewhere in the millions and millions of words that have been typed about **Magic**, there are probably a few articles that really stuck with youâ€”great articles, that changed the way you play, changed the way you think about the game, or even brought about some more fundamental shift in your perception.


What's your favorite **Magic** article on the Web? Tell us what articles are your favorites, and why. Oh, and this is the Internet, people, so let's see some links!
