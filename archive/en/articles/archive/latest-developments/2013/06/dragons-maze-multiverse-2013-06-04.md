It's time once again to take a jaunt through the records of Multiverse, the database we use to store and work on the card files, and see what people were thinking about during the design and development of *Dragon's Maze*. Some comments will be insightful, some will be snarky, but I hope they are all entertaining. 

But first, the cast:

 Text size is one of the hardest things for us to get around as a team. We are bound to having cards that can actually be read and actually fit on cards. While there was a desire to get Ætherling to better line up with the other [Morphling](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Morphling) variants, we couldn't do it and keep the text above our minimum-text-size requirements.

 As Doug mentioned, one of the issues with **Magic** is that we only get to show a card in one still frame. Cards that change dramatically can end up being very weird on the card, since you have to either show it in its first or final state. Still, Zac really pushed for the card, so that aspect of it didn't change. 

In terms of strength, this was much stronger as a 3/3 for four and would often shut out heavy-white-based decks or Zombies pretty quickly, and first strike made it a pretty powerful blocker (who would sometimes awkwardly level up in the middle of combat, only to level back down after non-first-strike damage was dealt). We decided to make the change pretty late in development to the current stats, making it a bit beefier but giving other decks a better chance of having an established board before it came down.

 Developers often template using old cards to get the words pretty close to right. Sometimes, especially when the card you are looking at is from *Time Spiral* block, this ends up with wordings we wouldn't use today. Luckily, editing is there to fix the problems.

>  Mago 4/30: 5 CMC is way over the top. Compare [Wring Flesh](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wring+Flesh), [Pull Under](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pull+Under), [Last Gasp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Last+Gasp), [Grasp of Darkness](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grasp+of+Darkness)... This isn't strictly worse than any specific precedent, but it's ugly.

 Zac Hill loved [Fatal Fumes](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fatal+Fumes) in a way that many other developers simply couldn't understand. Some believe it is because the 4 and 2 reminded him of a [Pillarfield Ox](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pillarfield+Ox). Others believed he liked ponderous removal. Yet others believed it had something to do with [Pillarfield Ox](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pillarfield+Ox) as well. But why, really? The world may never know.

>  Max 5/8: lol "potentially"  
>  ZH 6/6: 1/4 now because of the 2/3 in Hook  
>  GSV 6/11: Might be my favorite card in the set. My Johnny/Timmy cube senses are tingling.  
>  ZH 6/18: Shifted to 1/3 at Gavin's request.

 Zac Hill loved himself a [Pillarfield Ox](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pillarfield+Ox).

While creatures are allowed to have as many heads as they want to without having a mechanical reinforcement (who are we to tell them how to live their lives?), we do have a long-established history of creatures with two heads either being harder to block or blocking better. It's always good that someone is looking out for these kinds of flavor issues and bringing them up to development.

>  ZH 4/12: Now without trample. Big numbers are awesome!

 A little backstory on this. First off, yes, trample was pretty good. Originally, the Hydra was an XRG 0/0 double striker that entered the battlefield with X +1/+1 counters and had the ability: XRG: Put X +1/+1 counters on [Savageborn Hydra](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Savageborn+Hydra). The **Magic** rules handle X well enough. It's pretty easy to figure out what to do when it appears on instants and sorceries. But permanents get a little weirder. You see, by choosing a value for X in the activated ability, you're choosing a value for \*all\* the Xs. Yep, the one in the corner, too. So, it turns out you can't use X like that. It's a time loop thing, I think. Like [*Back to the Future*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Back_to_the_Future). While it is easy for humans to parse what it intended, there are many cards in the past that have taken a similar approach and ended in disaster years later for **Magic Online** programmers or for rules managers trying to get them to work. I'm looking at you, [Illusionary Mask](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Illusionary+Mask).

>  ZH 5/4: To Rhino to go up rather than down the chain.  
>  AF 5/10: Dust off your [Reveillark](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reveillark)s! 
> 
> 

The original version of this card was a 4/4 and made a 3/3, a 2/2, and two 1/1 birds. The current configuration was deemed to be more interesting. Aaron, in the way he likes to, immediately pointed out the busted thing this would allow. I don't think it's going to break Modern, but I would love to accomplish it in Cube or Commander.

>  MJ 6/14: This guy's interaction with Planeswalkers might be a bit much.  
>  ZH 6/18: No longer works with Planeswalkers.  
>  Gideon 9/10: No longer works with what, exactly?

Awwwwkward.

That's it for this week's Multiverse wrap-up. As the summer approaches, there are lots of open weeks of columns for me and I'm interested in hearing what you all would like to read about. If you have any development-related questions or topics that you'd like to see me write about, use the email author link at the top of this article and send them to me. I can't guarantee that I can hit all of them, but I will try to do as many as a I can.
