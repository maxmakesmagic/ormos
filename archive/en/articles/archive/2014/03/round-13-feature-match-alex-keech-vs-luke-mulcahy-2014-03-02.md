Luke Mulcahy is hunting for his second Grand Prix Top 8 to bolster his previous Top 4 performance at Grand Prix Brisbane 2011. The local community knows that he is one of the best, with his most impressive performance coming from a Top 16 finish at Pro Tour San Diego few years back. Faced against Alex Keech, he would need to overcome the Gruul horde with his little blue men.


**Game One** 


Mulcahy opened solidly (and quite customarily for the Mono-Blue Devotion player), with [Judge's Familiar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Judge%27s+Familiar), [Frostburn Weird](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Frostburn+Weird) and [Nightveil Specter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nightveil+Specter). Keech's Red Green Monsters deck lived up to expectations as well and coughed up Sylvan Caryatid, [Courser of Kruphix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Courser+of+Kruphix) and [Polukranos, World Eater](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Polukranos%2C+World+Eater).


[Tidebinder Mage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tidebinder+Mage) emerged from the waves to tap down the Legendary Hydra and Mulcahy also added a second [Nightveil Specter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nightveil+Specter), hoping to loot some green mana sources to summon the two [Polukranos, World Eater](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Polukranos%2C+World+Eater)s the first Specter had already stolen.


Keech advanced his board with [Ghor-Clan Rampager](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ghor-Clan+Rampager) and [Xenagos, God of Revels](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Xenagos%2C+God+of+Revels), while hatching a secret plan. He soon accumulated sufficient mana to overload [Mizzium Mortars](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mizzium+Mortars), including one extra for paying [Judge's Familiar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Judge%27s+Familiar)'s mana tithe.


This annihilated the opposing board while keeping his own intact and it was a simple matter of turning his entire army sideways to prompt Mulcahy's concession.

*Keech overloads [Mizzium Mortars](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mizzium+Mortars) and charges in to take Game One.* 
**Game Two**
A pair of [Cloudfin Raptor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloudfin+Raptor)s plus [Judge's Familiar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Judge%27s+Familiar) quickly started to peck away at Keech's life total and threatened to end the game fast in conjunction with [Thassa, God of the Sea](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thassa%2C+God+of+the+Sea).


Keech could only muster [Courser of Kruphix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Courser+of+Kruphix) and [Bow of Nylea](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bow+of+Nylea), but before he could even untap it seemed like the game was over.


Mulcahy summoned a second [Judge's Familiar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Judge%27s+Familiar), before activating [Nykthos, Shrine to Nyx](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nykthos%2C+Shrine+to+Nyx). With his devotion to blue at five, this gave him enough mana to summon [Nightveil Specter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nightveil+Specter), evolving both [Cloudfin Raptor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloudfin+Raptor)s to 2/3s and even had mana left over to grant [Thassa](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thassa%2C+God+of+the+Sea) unblockability.


With his life total already slashed in half, Keech did his math and figured that he would be too slow to stop the quintet of flyers, much less "switch off" the angsty Sea God.

*Mulcahy forces the rubber game by harnessing the power of the skies and the seas.* 
**Game Three**
Keech was on the play this round and make the risky decision to keep a one lander. As he missed his second and third land drops, Mulcahy wasted no time to assemble [Judge's Familiar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Judge%27s+Familiar), [Cloudfin Raptor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloudfin+Raptor) and [Tidebinder Mage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tidebinder+Mage).


When Keech did draw [Elvish Mystic](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elvish+Mystic), it was mercilessly sent home with [Cyclonic Rift](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cyclonic+Rift). [Mutavault](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mutavault) hastened the clock considerably and Keech was simply too far behind. He could only extend his hand, wishing Mulcahy good luck in his next two games.


**Luke Mulcahy defeats Alex Keech 2-1 and moves on to 11-2.**
