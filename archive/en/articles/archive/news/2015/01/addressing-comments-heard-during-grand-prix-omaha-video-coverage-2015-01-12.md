Hélène Bergeot started her career with Wizards of the Coast in France in December, 1995; afterwards, she spent a few years in the European headquarters based in Belgium and eventually relocated to the Renton office. She is currently the director of organized play and trade marketing. 





During the Grand Prix Omaha live video coverage, inappropriate remarks were overheard from members of the coverage team on the stream before the start of the quarterfinals.



The overheard comments were offensive and unprofessional, and do not reflect the views of Wizards of the Coast. We will take the appropriate actions in addressing each individual responsible for these unacceptable comments.



Wizards of the Coast is proud to deliver a game in eleven languages to the global market and to support a Grand Prix schedule that will encompass visits to more than twenty countries in 2015. We are honored to have a vibrant and diverse community of players from all over the world that is brought together by the love of *Magic*, and we are committed to ensuring this community and its environment is open and inviting to all players on a global scale.
