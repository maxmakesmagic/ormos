Because COVID-19 is keeping millions of people around the world indoors, we wanted to do a little something to help make social distancing a little more tolerable.


To that end, we are making changes to the Magic: The Gathering Arena event schedule beginning on Thursday, March 19 to give you more ways to play Magic from the comfort and safety of your home:


* The Brawlers' Guildhall event for March will have no entry fee and will be available March 19–April 16.
* Theros Beyond Death Ranked Draft will be available March 19–April 16 in addition to our regular bi-weekly rotating Ranked Draft event.

These changes are scheduled to go live on March 19 at approximately 8 a.m. PT.


Stay safe, wash your hands, and try to avoid becoming too stir-crazy as you’re cooped up in your house for the time being. We’re continuing to explore ways to make it easier for you to keep in contact with players from your local communities as well as support your local game store, and we hope to have more info on that soon.
