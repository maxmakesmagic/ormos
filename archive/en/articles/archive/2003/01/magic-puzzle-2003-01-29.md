### "Typecasting" by Mark L. Gottlieb


There's just enough time for one more *Onslaught* puzzle before *Legions* kicks in. You're playing New Jersey Devils goalie Martin Brodeur using all-*Onslaught* decks. Martin played an [Imagecrafter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Imagecrafter) on his turn and attacked with some of his creatures. It looks like he'll overwhelm you next turn, but it's time for your type-changing trickery to finally pay off. It's the beginning of your first main phase. Even though Martin is at 23 life, you can defeat him this turn. How?
