As a writer, Van Lunen has had more than three hundred Magic strategy pieces published 





In the quarterfinals, Fabio Ancelmo celebrated his birthday by handily destroying Rodrigo Soto Sanchez in a pair of games that never seemed remotely close. No opponent can feel safe against Ancelmo, whose Mardu Dragons deck is designed to have game against everyone.



Marcos Paulo De Jesus Freitas, a systems analyst from Rio De Janeiro, upset the first seed with powerhouse plays like [Dragonlord Atarka](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragonlord+Atarka) in his quarterfinal match. Paulo De Jesus Frietas is armed with a Green-Red Devotion deck that fits his fancy for ramp strategies.



In the first game, Paulo De Jesus Frietas started to ramp his mana with [Sylvan Caryatid](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sylvan+Caryatid) and threatened to play some very big spells on the following turn when he played a morph that was, in all likelihood, a [Rattleclaw Mystic](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rattleclaw+Mystic).

Ancelmo wasn’t playing anything to the board despite having a very large hand. Paulo De Jesus Frietas thought about his options and presumed he would need to drain his opponent of removal spells before he stuck his Dragonlord.



Ancelmo looked to be in a good position against a board of mana dorks when he had a few dragons in hand, but Paulo De Jesus Frietas was able to find a pair of [Arbor Colossus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arbor+Colossus) after Ancelmo had already spent all his removal. [Arbor Colossus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arbor+Colossus) matched up beautifully against Ancelmo’s Dragons; Paulo De Jesus Frietas even had enough green permanents to activate [Nykthos, Shrine to Nyx](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nykthos%2C+Shrine+to+Nyx) after casting [Arbor Colossus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arbor+Colossus) to use the Monstrous ability.



If was too much for Ancelmo and Paulo De Jesus Frietas won the first game.

The second game featured [Soulfire Grand Master](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soulfire+Grand+Master) for Ancelmo in the early turns. Paulo De Jesus Frietas kept up with [Rattleclaw Mystic](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rattleclaw+Mystic) and [Courser of Kruphix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Courser+of+Kruphix), setting himself up well to ramp into his larger threats.



Paulo De Jesus Freitas didn’t have any big threats, though, and once [Outpost Siege](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Outpost+Siege) stuck for Ancelmo, he looked to be in solid control of the game.

Ancelmo was drawing multiple cards a turn for the entirety of the game, but he soon found himself in a rough position when Paulo De Jesus Frietas cast [Dragonlord Atarka](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragonlord+Atarka). Even though it was his birthday, Ancelmo couldn’t find a removal spell for the massive dragon. Ancelmo, did, however, have [Anger of the Gods](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Anger+of+the+Gods) and [Soulfire Grand Master](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soulfire+Grand+Master) that were able to join forces to gain him a ton of life and put him well above 30.



Paulo De Jesus Frietas took more than half of that lifetotal away with his next attack, though, and, despite being at just seven life, it seemed like Paulo De Jesus Frietas had solid control of the game.



Ancelmo had just one draw step and one [Outpost Siege](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Outpost+Siege) trigger to find himself a way out. [Thoughtseize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtseize) and another land came off the top and Paulo De Jesus Frietas had secured victory.



The countrymen emphatically grabbed each others arms and Ancelmo wished Paulo De Jesus Frietas luck for the finals.
