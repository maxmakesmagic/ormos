With the World **Magic** Cup and Players Championship in the books, attention is turning toward the release of *Return to Ravnica*. The invitation list for Pro Tour *Return to Ravnica* has been finalized, with a total of 437 players invited to Seattle to battle in the Modern and  *Return to Ravnica*  Booster Draft formats on October 19-21.


As was done for Pro Tour *Avacyn Restored*, Wizards of the Coast is awarding Sponsor's Exemption invitations and airfare to players who showed excellence in play and positive community activity during the qualifying season but did not earn an invitation through other means. This consideration includes quantity and quality of finishes at Grand Prix events, Pro Tour Qualifiers, World **Magic** Cup Qualifiers, Pro Tour  *Avacyn Restored* , and the World **Magic** Cup. Sponsor's Exemption invitations for Pro Tour *Return to Ravnica* have been awarded to Michael Hopkins (USA), Fernando Solorzano (Costa Rica), Stephen Murray (Scotland), Jasper Johnson-Epstein (USA), and Gergely Gulyas (Hungary). At the conclusion of future qualifying seasons, Wizards of the Coast will examine the list of uninvited players and award Sponsor's Exemption invitations at its sole discretion. In addition, a special invitation has been extended to William Jensen.
