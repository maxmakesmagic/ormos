There comes a moment in every young mage's life when he or she puts forth a built-up request of emotion to another, gets shot down in flames, becomes embittered, turns to the dark side, and forevermore sees all of his or her spells of flesh and blood become twisted with cursed passion. At least, so I've been told. I hear that progression can diverge, though, splitting off into a much happier, flower-laden path if said mage's feelings are reciprocated. Again, for all I've ever experienced, these are just rumors.

Lucky me, though. I've been given a preview card that's basically a snapshot of that first sentence in **Magic** form. Therefore, I get to dwell on what looks more and more like my dark, sad future all column! Okay, not really. There are times, though, where my mental state is such that all I want to do is build decks around Heartless Summoning. Hopefully, when you click here and check out this card, you'll see why.

![](https://media.wizards.com/images/magic/tcg/products/isd/6v8ies3sq2_en.jpg)  
No lengthy FAQs are necessary for this puzzler of an enchantment. Accurately described as a "backwards [Blood Funnel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Funnel)" by behind-the-scenes whiz Kelly Digges, Heartless Summoning offers a tremendous reduction of your creature spells... for a twisted price. All your recently cast creatures will bear your internal burden for the world to see. That -1/-1 ability is pretty darn painful.

So how to build around Heartless Summoning? Good question. Let's see if I can answer it.

Only Shallow
There are a couple things I need to keep in mind about Heartless Summoning before I begin. First, it costs two mana. The ideal mana-curving play, then, would be to cast a five-drop creature of some sort of terrifying nature. It would roll out for only three mana! Of course, it'll be weakened by my heartlessness, so it should have a toughness greater than one.

![](https://media.wizards.com/images/magic/daily/ftl/fygdfhgjkhnilujduyfjbgjsndthjgfhj.jpg)Heartless Summoning | Art by [Anthony Palumbo](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoileramp;method=visualamp;action=advancedamp;artist=+[%22Anthony+Palumbo%22])

That above plan is a good one, but I also must remember something else. In a deck that contains four copies of Heartless Summoning (as today's decks will, by default of the "preview article" tradition) there's a fine chance that I could wind up with the opportunity for multiple Heartless Summonings on the battlefield. The trick to building such decks is to anticipate these situations, and come up with creatures that both want to be reduced by four and could withstand a painful -2/-2.

Back to my five-drop creature conundrum. Another aspect of sculpting these decks that I must remember is to make sure that my five-drop creatures have at least four generic mana in their converted mana costs. This is so that if I ever have the double Summoning condition, I can play these creatures for a mere one mana!

Finally, I should consider what I'm going to be doing with excess mana. It would be nice to have a mana sink for excess savings floating around my mana pool.

What I like about all these logical restrictions is that they naturally lead me to a peculiar set of cards that I might otherwise never think about playing: dangerous creatures that cost ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227130050im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless3.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227195556im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/black.gif) or ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20160830042801im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless4.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227195556im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/black.gif) (or any other color) and can withstand one, or ideally two, Heartless Summonings. Some staple deckbuilding tools happily fall into this pile, like the ever-deadly [Shriekmaw](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shriekmaw). But wacky random stuff just quirks my circuits. [Fendeep Summoner](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fendeep+Summoner) seems hilarious when active by turn four, for example, and it even solves the excess mana problem in a way!

Another funky one is [Shirei, Shizo's Caretaker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shirei%2C+Shizo%27s+Caretaker), which warps into another strategy. If I had a creature with a toughness of 1 out, the stench from the Heartless Summonings takes it out. If that creature also had a power of 2 or less (it's getting -1/-1, remember), then [Shirei](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shirei) could loop its soul for eternity. Let's say I cast [Perilous Myr](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Perilous+Myr). It'll instantly die and deal something 2 damage. Then, at the beginning of the next end step, [Shirei](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shirei) will haul it back, upon which it instantly dies again (and deals 2 damage). This trick works with abilities that trigger upon entering the battlefield as well, like [Ravenous Rats](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ravenous+Rats) or [Farhaven Elf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Farhaven+Elf).

That entire concept gives me a broader idea: use the -1/-1 ability as a benefit by intentionally playing creatures that instantly die. Then an effect such as [Fecundity](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fecundity) (or the deliciously appealing Murder of Crows, from the [*Innistrad* Card Image Gallery](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/tcg/article.aspx?x=mtg/tcg/innistrad/cig)) could potentially draw me into more of these creatures, creating an engine of sorts.

Other 1/1s that fit the aims of this deck include [Elvish Visionary](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elvish+Visionary) (a draw-two card with [Fecundity](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fecundity) out) and [Myr Sire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Myr+Sire) (likewise). (By the way, this deck really wants [Fecundity](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fecundity) out.) [Entomber Exarch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Entomber+Exarch) enters my subconscious as a [Gravedigger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gravedigger) variant that can dig, either up a corpse or through your opponent's mind, for only ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227195556im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/black.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227195556im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/black.gif). With two Heartless Summoning out, [Solemn Simulacrum](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Solemn+Simulacrum) becomes a free cantripping [Rampant Growth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rampant+Growth)!

Wheel through your deck until you get one of your unique win conditions. [Psychosis Crawler](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psychosis+Crawler) can be pretty big for a lower cost in this deck, plus it docks your opponent 1 life for each card you draw. That seems useful. [Butcher of Malakir](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Butcher+of+Malakir) combines with the rest of the deck to maul your opponent's creature forces, equalizing the battlefield for every spent 1/1. The aforementioned [Shirei](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shirei) does its thing. Finally, [Gristle Grinner](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gristle+Grinner) steps up to the plate as a potential win condition that can be Summoned out for a great advantage.
