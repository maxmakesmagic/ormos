GRAND PRIX KOBE 2015
--------------------




* [DAY 1 COVERAGE](#tabs-0)


DAY 1 COVERAGE



As the sun sets here in Kobe, 2572 players have been reduced down to the 293 that will play tomorrow. Among them 8 players have perfect 9-0 records including Japanese pros Shuhei Nakamura, Teruya Kakumae, and Akio Chiba. Hot on their heels include Lee Shi Tian, Park Jun Young, Tzu-Ching Kuo, and Ken Yukuhiro sitting with 8-1 records. Barely scraping into day 2 with 7-2 records include such pros as Martin Juza, Naoki Shimizu, Nam Sung Wook, Makihito Mihara, Yuta Takahashi, and Tomoharu Saito.


Abzan came out in full force today here in Kobe and was seemingly the most popular deck in day 1. To combat it players brought a variety of decks, including Esper Dragons, Rally The Ancestors, Dark Jeskai, and many others. With the field whittled down, the cream will rise to the top tomorrow.



Join us tomorrow for 5 more rounds of Standard before we cut to a top 8 and crown another Grand Prix champion here in Kobe!
