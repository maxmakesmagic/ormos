The three day-long Junior Super Series event in Florida wasn't just for the 
kids - older players had plenty to do at the Disney's Wide World of Sports 
Complex where the championship took place.


Artists were present on site to sign cards and chat with the fans - among 
them are popular D.Alexander Gregory (Cursed Scroll, Persecute) and Ron Spencer 
(Hammer of Bogardan, Yawgmoth's Will). Richard Garfield was present to talk with 
the fans and play a few games of "giant magic" with decks built out of 
promotional oversized cards. Demos for various WOTC games and a well-stocked 
retail booth were available.


The main attraction of the weekend for those not competing in JSS was 
certainly an *Urza's Destiny* pre-release ran by New Wave Conventions. Each 
player competing in the main event got a starter of *Urza's Saga* and three 
*Urza's Destiny* boosters. In addition, each person got a promotional copy 
of a False Prophet, a foil rare card from the new set.


For those who just could not get enough *Destiny* many side events were 
available. Most popular format was 8-man booster drafts ranging from the pro 
style *Saga-Legacy-Destiny* format to an extravagant all-*Destiny* 
seven pack draft. All winners received *Destiny* packs in prizes.


Most players strongly approve of the set and cannot wait to get their hands 
on more cards once it is released. The pre-release card itself did cause too 
much enthusiasm, but a wide range of other *Destiny* novelties appealed to 
competitors.


For players who enjoy combo decks, a Yawgmoth's Bargain is an enchantment 
that is even better than Necropotence if you do not mind a higher casting cost. 
Bargain has been hailed by many as the best card in the set. "This card is on 
top of R&D's watch list," comments Tournament Play manager Jeff Donais. "We 
want to give players a chance to use it," adds R&D member and the lead 
*Destiny* designer Mark Rosewater. "If this card proves too powerful we 
will do something about it."


Another very powerful card to come out of this set, and a personal favorite, 
is Theiving Magpie. Many players remember just how powerful Ophidian was in 
tournament decks. For only one additional mana this new version of Ophidian 
flies and even gets to deal damage to an opponent while gaining you card 
economy.


Keldon Champion is welcomed by some of the players who prefer beat-down decks 
as the replacement for Ball Lightning. At one additional mana it gets to deal at 
least three damage when it comes into play, and possibly three more if it isn't 
blocked or destroyed. Plus, you have an option of paying echo and keeping Keldon 
Champion in play.


These are just some of 143 new cards introduced in *Urza's Destiny*.This 
set's storyline continues the story of an epic struggle between planeswalker 
Urza and the invading Phyrexians. Collectors can look forward to more foil cards 
randomly inserted into the packs - an additional incentive that proved 
successful with *Urza's Legacy*.
