Live Coverage of 2004 Canada National Championship
==================================================




July 2-4, 2004












![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/canat04/fin.jpg)


Jingpeng Zhang is Canadian National Champion! After sawing through a control-heavy field with his March-[Obliterate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Obliterate) deck and showing that his limited game was up to snuff he earned a place in today's Top 8 competition. In the quarters he played London's Mike Viner, who came to the competition unqualified on Thursday, ground in, and kept on winning. He was with blue-white control, and Zhang dispatched him in four thanks to the the uncounterable kaboom.


In the semis he faced David Rood, who had just bested Ontario Regiona Champion Sacha Bakht in the affinity mirror. They went the full five, but Zhang emerged victorious. That meant he would face Murray "The Mauler" Evans in the finals. Evans had somehow escaped Jason Howden's blue-white control and then massacred Michael Thicke, who had [Obliterate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Obliterate)d Felix Tse in the quarters.

The finals were quick and brutal. [March of the Machines](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=March+of+the+Machines) and manascrew determined the outcome. It was the same in the playoff for the third spot on the team. Affinity couldn't stand up to [Obliterate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Obliterate)'s removal backed by the awesome power of March.


Zhang is already looking forward to Worlds, which will be his first Pro Tour. In addition to the responsibility of leading the Canadian team (he's already co-ordinating with Thicke and Evans for testing) it will give him a chance to see some friends of his from the Chinese National Team. Congratualtions to Jingpeng Zhang, Canadian National Champion!
