Send your rules questions to Level Four Judge [John Carter](javascript:makeWinXY('/company/emailtoauthor.asp?author=John%20Carter&headline=Rules%20Question',500,455);). Can't find the answer to your question somewhere else, like the [**Magic** Comprehensive Rules](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=magic/rules/tourneyplayer)? Maybe he's already answered it! Try the [Saturday School Searchable Rules Database](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/satschoolarchive).

Last weekend Saturday School took a field trip to one of the many Team Constructed [Pro Tour Charleston Qualifiers](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=protour/charleston06/qualifiers). We open today with several questions directly from that event.

**Q**: What is unified deck construction?


**A**: Unified deck construction means that the entire mixture of all decks and sideboards on a given team is legal in the format. For example, no more than four copies of any card except basic lands can appear in the combined mixture regardless of what decks they actually are in. If your opponent plays four [Umezawa's Jitte](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Umezawa%27s+Jitte), your teammates' opponents on that team won't have any.


![Zur's Weirding](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Zur%27s+Weirding)**Q**: Does [Pithing Needle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pithing+Needle) stop [Zur's Weirding](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Zur%27s+Weirding)? [Firemane Angel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Firemane+Angel)?
 **A**: [Pithing Needle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pithing+Needle) won't affect [Zur's Weirding](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Zur%27s+Weirding) - the Weirding is a continuous ability generating a replacement effect (uses "instead"). [Pithing Needle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pithing+Needle) shuts down only [Firemane Angel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Firemane+Angel)'s return to play graveyard ability - the other abilities aren't activated.


**Q**: Does [Umezawa's Jitte](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Umezawa%27s+Jitte) get counters if I sacrifice the creature it was attached to after stacking damage?


**A**: If the creature is no longer in play when the damage resolves, then the Jitte can't be attached to it. Thus, the Jitte isn't equipping anything and will not get counters.


**Q**: Does playing a second [Ghost Council of Orzhova](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ghost+Council+of+Orzhova) cause it to trigger?


**A**: Yes, the fact the legend rule will put both into the graveyard as a state-based effect doesn't negate the fact it came into play and its ability triggered.


**\*Extra\***: State-based effects are checked when a player gets priority and resolve immediately. If both are in play, you won't have the opportunity to save one before SBEs kick in. You could respond to the Ghost spell by sacrificing the Ghost in play to itself so the upcoming Ghost will be the only one around.


**Q**: What happens if I remove [Ghost Council of Orzhova](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ghost+Council+of+Orzhova) from the game with its ability, play another one, and them remove that one, too?


**A**: At the end of turn, you'll have two triggers to stack. One trigger will return a Ghost, and a new trigger will drain your opponent for one (giving it to you). When the other Ghost's trigger resolves, the Ghost will come into play and trigger; SBEs will put both Ghosts into the graveyard, and then you'll get to stack the second drain trigger.


**Q**: What happens if you [Seize the Soul](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seize+the+Soul)[Keiga, the Tide Star](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Keiga%2C+the+Tide+Star) with no creatures in play?


**A**: Keiga will be destroyed and trigger, you'll put a 1/1 white Spirit token creature into play, and [Seize the Soul](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seize+the+Soul)'s haunt will trigger. Then both triggers will be put on the stack (active player first, then non-active player - APNAP) targeting the only possible target - the brand new token.


**Q**: Can [Tallowisp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tallowisp) search for [Threads of Disloyalty](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Threads+of+Disloyalty)?


**A**: Yes, [Threads of Disloyalty](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Threads+of+Disloyalty) is an Aura with enchant creature. The "with converted mana cost 2 or less" modifies what kind of enchant creature it is, but it's still an enchant creature.


**Q**: If I [Shining Shoal](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shining+Shoal) targeting an opponent and choose damage on the stack from their own creature equipped with [Umezawa's Jitte](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Umezawa%27s+Jitte), does the Jitte get counters?


**A**: Yes, the Shoal doesn't take away the "combatness" of the creature's damage, even if the player damaged isn't the defending player.


![Shining Shoal](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Shining+Shoal)**Q**: For [Shining Shoal](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shining+Shoal), what constitutes a source? What happens if the source leaves play before any damage that would be dealt resolves?
 **A**: A "source" is a permanent in play, a spell on the stack, or an object referred to by something on the stack (an ability or combat damage, for example). The source does not need to be in play when [Shining Shoal](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shining+Shoal) resolves or when the damage resolves - the object that referenced the source that was on the stack is connection enough for [Shining Shoal](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shining+Shoal) to remember the source.


**\*Extra\***: You can think of [Shining Shoal](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shining+Shoal) as affecting three pieces. Those pieces are the target, the source, and the shielded player and creatures. The main piece is the target. It must be named while announcing the Shoal. If the target is illegal when the Shoal would resolve, the Shoal is countered. If the target is gone when the Shoal would redirect damage, nothing happens. The source is chosen as the Shoal resolves. It doesn't matter if something happens to the source after the Shoal resolves. The final piece is the creatures and player protected. If a creature or player that was going to take damage doesn't (the creature was bounced or destroyed before the source's damage resolved), the redirection shield sits there waiting for the next time that source would deal damage - not likely in most turns.


**Q**: If our third game is a draw, who starts the fourth game?


**A**: If the first three games end in a tied match (1-1-1 or 0-0-3), and there's time left in the round, a fourth game is played. The player who had the choice of playing or drawing at the start of the drawn game gets to choose again.


**Q**: An opponent plays a [Beastmaster's Magemark](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Beastmaster%27s+Magemark) on his creature. His teammate also has [Glorious Anthem](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glorious+Anthem) in play. He stated that all of his creatures get the Magemark bonus since [Glorious Anthem](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glorious+Anthem) is "enchanting them." That doesn't work, right? --Cho


**A**: No, being affected by an enchantment isn't the same as being enchanted by an enchantment. Only Auras, not regular enchantments, will cause the Magemark bonuses.


**Q**: Does a Genju'd land count as an enchanted creature for the Magemark effects if the Magemark is attached to a different creature you control? --Mo


**A**: Yes, animated Genjus will get Magemark bonuses. The Magemarks ask two simple questions: Is it a creature? Is it enchanted? Magemarks don't actually care if the Aura is an enchant creature.


**Q**: The effects of the cards [Necromancer's Magemark](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Necromancer%27s+Magemark) and [Leyline of the Void](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leyline+of+the+Void) have been ruled to prevent cards from reaching the graveyard thru their activated ability. How does this work if a creature is sent to the graveyard because of lethal damage or 0 toughness (since they're state-based effects)? --Dan


**A**: It doesn't matter what is sending the card to the graveyard, those replacement effects (uses "instead") will replace the graveyard event with a return to hand or remove from game event instead.


**\*Extra\***: Be careful with words like "prevent." Prevent has a very particular meaning in **Magic** lingo which is unrelated to Magemarks or Leylines. Amusingly enough though, prevention effects are a specialized subset of replacement effects (like replacing damage with [null]). 


**Q**: Do [Blind with Anger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blind+with+Anger) and [Ink-Treader Nephilim](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ink-Treader+Nephilim) interact in the way I hope and dream? --Simon


**A**: If you hope and dream that you'll untap, gain control of, and haste-ify every targetable nonlegendary and creature in play, yes, it does.


![Ink-Treader Nephilim](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Ink-Treader+Nephilim)**Q**: I play [Flame Fusillade](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flame+Fusillade). I tap all of my creatures and ping something. Then I play [Rally the Righteous](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rally+the+Righteous) targeting my [Ink-Treader Nephilim](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ink-Treader+Nephilim). The Nephilim's ability will put multiple copies of [Rally the Righteous](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rally+the+Righteous) on the stack. Can I tap my creatures to ping something again in between resolutions of these copies? --Patrick B.
 **A**: Each [Rally the Righteous](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rally+the+Righteous) will untap creatures, compliments of the Boros' radiate ability. If some of your creatures happen to untap, then you'll be able to ping again before the next spell on the stack resolves. Don't forget that the original Rally will be the last one to resolve (if anyone's left alive).


**\*Extra\***: Since you're stacking all the copies, try to stack them in a way that maximizes your benefits. If you don't want your opponents to untap first, stack the Rallys that target their creatures last. In a group game, don't forget that killing someone means their creatures won't be there for the Rally copies to resolve. This can affect how often your own creatures untap. Let a guy live until his creatures' Rally radiates have helped you out, *and then* mercilessly poke him to death.


**Q**: I play [Electrolyze](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Electrolyze) targeting two of my opponent's 1/1 creatures. He uses [Shining Shoal](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shining+Shoal) removing to redirect all damage of [Electrolyze](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Electrolyze) to me. Is this correct? --Vincenzo C.


**A**: [Shining Shoal](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shining+Shoal) can protect a player's creature as well as the player. In this case, you'll take two and then draw a card.


**Q**: How exactly does [Sundering Titan](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sundering+Titan) deal with dual lands? For example, I play [Sundering Titan](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sundering+Titan) and my opponent has two [Overgrown Tomb](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Overgrown+Tomb)s in play, do I get to destroy only one or both of them? --Mario G.


**A**: [Sundering Titan](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sundering+Titan) can choose a dual land for either of its applicable types or both. You could choose one [Overgrown Tomb](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Overgrown+Tomb) as a Swamp and one as a Forest, or you choose the same one.


**Q**: If my opponent has a [Wurm's Tooth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wurm%27s+Tooth) out and plays [Fists of Ironwood](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fists+of+Ironwood) on his [Llanowar Elves](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Llanowar+Elves). I play [Shock](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shock) on his Elf before Fists resolves. Would he still gain life? Would the tokens come into play? --Chad F.


**A**: Though the [Fists of Ironwood](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fists+of+Ironwood) is countered for lack of target, the opponent will gain life. Abilities that trigger off the playing of something don't care if the something actually resolves. However, since the Fists never came into play, no Saprolings will be generated.


**Q**: If my opponent plays [Cranial Extraction](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cranial+Extraction) naming [Wildfire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wildfire), and I respond by playing [Shadow of Doubt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shadow+of+Doubt), my opponent cannot search my library correct? --Mark


**A**: [Shadow of Doubt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shadow+of+Doubt) will stop the library-searching portion of [Cranial Extraction](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cranial+Extraction).


**\*Extra\***: Be careful with when the Shadow is played. You don't name the card until [Cranial Extraction](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cranial+Extraction) resolves, and if the Extraction is resolving, you won't have time to play [Shadow of Doubt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shadow+of+Doubt). Technically, you'll be predicting that something bad for you will be chosen - a safe enough bet.


![Sandsower](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Sandsower)**Q**: If a creature I control has summoning sickness, can it be used to pay convoke costs? By the same token, if I play [Scatter the Seeds](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scatter+the+Seeds), can I use them to immediately tap a creature via [Sandsower](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sandsower)? --Ross M.
 **A**: Yes, summoning sickness won't stop you from tapping a creature for convoke or [Sandsower](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sandsower). Summoning sickness only stops  abilities on the sick creature.


**Q**: If my opponent activates [Firemane Angel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Firemane+Angel)'s ability and I respond with [Time Stop](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Time+Stop), where does the [Firemane Angel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Firemane+Angel) go? --Niek T.


**A**: The Angel doesn't go anywhere. It stays in the graveyard, and the turn ends.


**Q**: Is the ability of [Searing Meditation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Searing+Meditation) triggered or activated? In my country problems exist with this card and whether [Pithing Needle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pithing+Needle) affects it or not. --Jose U.


**A**: [Searing Meditation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Searing+Meditation) has a triggered ability and won't be affected by [Pithing Needle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pithing+Needle). "When", "whenever", and "at" are good indicators of triggered abilities. For activated abilities, just look for the colon (:). If you see ":" on a card, you can bet the ability is activated no matter what the language is.


**Q**: Would replacing the "draw a card" from [Phyrexian Arena](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phyrexian+Arena) with dredge prevent me from taking the 1 damage from that enchantment? --Jayson


**A**: No, replacing the card draw doesn't replace any other part of [Phyrexian Arena](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phyrexian+Arena)'s effect.


**Q**: I play [Booby Trap](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Booby+Trap) and choose my opponent and [Ornithopter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ornithopter). I then [Donate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Donate) it to him. What happens? --Charley C.


**A**: That player will continue revealing cards until an [Ornithopter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ornithopter) sets off the Trap. Being an opponent only matters while the [Booby Trap](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Booby+Trap) is resolving. Once the Trap is set, giving it to another player has no effect the outcome.


**Q**: With split cards in *Dissension*, I have a question. What is the official name of a split card? May I search for Crime, Punishment, X, and Y with [Gifts Ungiven](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gifts+Ungiven)? --Zach D.


**A**: The official name of a split card is both halves of the name. You'll see them written as "Name 1 // Name 2." You can find only one copy of Crime // Punishment with [Gifts Ungiven](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gifts+Ungiven).


**Q**: How does [Dark Confidant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dark+Confidant)'s ability interact with split cards? Which mana cost will determine the life lost? --Ryan C.


**A**: [Dark Confidant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dark+Confidant) asks for the converted mana cost and gets both answers. The resulting life loss is a sum of those answers. In the case of Crime // Punishment, ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227130050im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless3.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227125855im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/white.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227195556im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/black.gif) and ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20160829100442im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/x.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227195556im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/black.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20220123123600im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/green.gif) converts into 5 and 2, so 7 life is lost total.


After the [sneak peek](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/arcana/1045) at the end of March, *Dissension* previews begin in earnest on Monday and continue every weekday until the prerelease. The [prerelease itself](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/prerelease/dissension) is only two weeks away on the 22nd and 23rd of this month. Rest assured that we'll be covering questions on previewed cards as well as our normal slew of entries in the weeks to come.

Class Dismissed.
