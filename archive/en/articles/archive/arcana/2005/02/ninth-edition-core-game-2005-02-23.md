Last week we teased you with some packaging art of [*Ninth Edition* boosters](/en/articles/archive/ninth-edition-product-shots-2005-02-14). This week we bring you a look at the packaging of the *Ninth Edition* Core Game box. Here's what you get with that Core Game product, intended for new players.

|  | *The Core Game contains everything you need to learn how to play **Magic**! It contains:** *two 33-card decks,*
* *a 14-card pack with more advanced cards for expanded game play,*
* *a collectible premium card,*
* *two play guides to take you and your opponent through the game step by step,*
* *an easy-to-read rulebook for complete rules reference,*
* *two playmats with scorekeeping counters,*
* *a CD-ROM featuring exciting games that cover the key aspects of **Magic** play, plus the **Magic** Online program,*
* *and a credit for online versions of the cards included in the game.*

 And, because we like ya, here's one more booster image we didn't show you [last week](/en/articles/archive/ninth-edition-product-shots-2005-02-14). It appears to feature the same art as the Core Game box above -- some sort of winged woman with a sword. Huh.




 Next week: More juicy *Ninth Edition* stuff.
