 **Q: I have a quick question regarding Battlefield Thaumaturge. How does the cost-reduction ability work with replicate and overload? Does it reduce those costs as well or not? —Daniel J.**

**A: Matt Tabak, Magic rules manager:**


Battlefield Thaumaturge works with additional costs, like replicate costs. It also works with cost increases like strive costs. Simply start with the mana cost, then add in any additional costs or increases before factoring in cost reductions. Battlefield Thaumaturge also works with alternative costs, but overload is an exception, as it takes away all the spell's targets.


 **Q: How does converted mana cost work with strive? For example, I have Eidolon of the Great Revel out and cast Ajani's Presence with one extra strive, so I pay four. Is the CMC 1 or 4? —Zak S.**

**A: Matt Tabak, Magic rules manager:**


Additional costs like strive don't change a spell's mana cost or converted mana cost. The converted mana cost of Ajani's Presence is 1 no matter how many targets it has.
