How would you like to play **Duels of the Planeswalkers** 2012 against the members of a prominent Canada-based Internet sketch comedy group?


Are you thinking about it? Have you decided on an answer? Is it locked in? Pencils down!


Okay, now let's rephrase the original question. In fact, we're going to rephrase it so much, it's not even a question anymore.


Come and play **Duels of the Planeswalkers** 2012 with the members of the online comedy troupe [LoadingReadyRun](http://loadingreadyrun.com/) on August 4, 2011! The seven full-time members of the LoadingReadyRun will be ready to take on challengers in the featured game, **Duels of the Planeswalkers** 2012, in the PSN **Magic: The Gathering** Home space between 4 p.m. and 6 p.m. PDT on August 4, 2011. Come say hello and challenge them to a friendly duel.
