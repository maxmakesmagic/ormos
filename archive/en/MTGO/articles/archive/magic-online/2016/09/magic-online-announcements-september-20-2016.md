**Inactivity Timeout for Premier Play Events Extended**


Effective immediately, the timeout limit for PTQ Finals, MOCS, and RPTQ Events will be extended to 15 minutes from the original 10. Our hope is that extending the time limit will give players who are experiencing technical issues in high-level events more time to contact [DEC support](http://magic.wizards.com/en/MTGO/articles/archive/meet-digital-event-coordinators-2014-06-04) and troubleshoot the problem.
