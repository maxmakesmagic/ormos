The MOCS are fast-approaching, and we couldn't be more excited to see what will happen in San Francisco. Mark your calendars for March 28–30, because some of the top players from around the world are gathering to showcase their skill. Some of the MOCS competitors are recognizable from their *Magic Online* username or twitch channels; others are relative newcomers to competitive *Magic*. All are extremely skilled and more than worthy of the title of MOCS finalist.

### **Dmitriy Butakov**



**Age:** 25  
**Hometown:** Barnaul, Russia  
**Occupation:** Professional Gamer



**What is your favorite format to play and why?**



I really liked the Momir Basic format and mourn for Momir Dailies. Despite one of three games where either you or your opponent is a victim of circumstances, the other two usually provide a unique situation with lots of variables. Momir was not good for preparing for any other format, but it was great to train your abilities to evaluate your resources and the board (no matter how big the board is) and to stay focused for the entire game



**What other *Magic* results do you have?**



[GP Valencia](https://www.wizards.com/magic/magazine/article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/eventcoverage/gpval13/welcome) Top 8, [2013 World Championship](https://www.wizards.com/magic/magazine/article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/eventcoverage/wc13/welcome) 9th, [2012 MOCS champion](https://www.wizards.com/magic/magazine/article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/eventcoverage/mocs12/welcome).



**What does your normal day of *Magic Online* look like?** 



I play all of the Constructed Dailies for the period of four to ten hours (depends on my other plans and schedule) five days a week, when there is a pause between rounds I try to do something to clear my mind—doing exercises, cooking, or reading



**What thought ran through your head as soon as you realized you were going to the MOCS?**



Now I have a good reason to visit some USA GPs.



**What is your favorite *Magic* card and why?** 



Gifts Ungiven. That card rewards good plays and punishes bad ones both for you and your opponent.



**How big is your family?**



I'm the only child and have no children yet, but I have a lot of relatives in Siberia



**What is one fact about you that might surprise people?**



I live in Siberia.



**What is your spirit animal?**



Badger**.**

### **Rune Tikær Andersen**



**Age****:** 27  
**Hometown:** Aarhus, Denmark  
**Occupation:** Student



**What is your favorite format to play and why?**



Legacy. It's more or less the only format I play. It's my favorite format because most games are interesting and have difficult decisions. There are a lot of viable decks, and you have to know the ins and outs of them all. Lastly, the format rarely changes drastically. Since I don't always have a lot of time to spend on *Magic*, this is a good thing.



**How many hours a week do you think you spend on *Magic Online*?** 



It varies a lot. Sometimes I spend four hours per day, and other times I don't open *Magic Online* for months.



**What is your favorite *Magic* card and why?** 



[Upheaval](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Upheaval). Its effect is powerful and unique. The art is cool, too! UB [Psychatog](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psychatog) Control was also my first competitive deck.



**What single card do you have the most of in your collection?**



[Restoration Angel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Restoration+Angel). Somehow I accidentally bought seven of them.



**What thought ran through your head as soon as you realized you were going to the MOCS?**



"Wow, this is amazing!"


Quickly followed by:


"Wait, now I have to learn how to play Limited? This is a disaster".



**What would winning the MOCS mean to you?**



It would mean I would have to play a lot more Limited and other non-Legacy formats, so let's hope it doesn't happen! Joking aside, it would be nothing short of amazing.



**Who is your favorite *Magic* player to watch?** 



Andrew Cuneo.



**What is your spirit animal?**



Has to be FrankerZ, the dog from twitch chat.

### **Farand Lee**



**Age****:** 28  
**Hometown:** Vancouver, BC  
**Occupation:** Gate Gourmet



**When did you start playing *Magic Online*?** 



I made a *Magic Online* account last year in January but I didn't really start utilizing it until around April when I started using it to test Standard. Then, around August another one of my friends got me hooked onto playing the Limited format. I had never really played Limited before this and I found it really fun.



**When did you start playing *Magic*?**



I started playing *Magic* in elementary school around the time of *Fallen Empires* in 1995, all the way to high school, and quit during the *Odyssey* block in 2002.


Two years ago, one of my friend got hooked onto *Duels of the Planeswalkers* and asked me to join him in playing the paper version and I've been playing again since then.



**What does your normal day of *Magic Online* look like?** 



Nowadays I just log onto the casual play, tournament practice area, load up my Standard deck and have a few games.



**What guild are you?**



Selesnya.



**What is your favorite *Magic* card and why?** 



[Pouncing Jaguar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pouncing+Jaguar) because I really loved playing green stompy back in the days.



**What thought went through your head as soon as you realized you were going to the MOCS?**



I actually didn't know about the invitations until like half an hour after winning, when a friend messaged me about it. I felt pretty elated, as I had never flown out of the country before and that greater things were waiting for me.



**What would winning the MOCS mean to you?**



I would feel really stoked at accomplishing it and would be more inclined to travel out for high-level tournaments.



**What record do you think you'll have at the end of the event?**



Undefeated. One can dream, can't he?
