We've got a special edition of Sketches today! Normally, an artist provides one sketch, with maybe a second option. For [Brave the Elements](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brave+the+Elements), Goran Josic handed in *six* options. Check it!


The art description sent to Goran was:



> Color: White spell  
> Location: A jagged ice chasm  
> Action: This spell keeps travelers safe from the elements. Show two kor explorers (one male, one female) who are braving the icy wilderness. They're using a system of ropes and hooks to traverse the gap of a chasm. Snow swirls around them, but a swirl of golden light orbits around them, keeping the snow at bay.  
> Focus: The protected travelers  
> Mood: It's hard going, but they're going to make it thanks to a little magic.  
> Notes:


And here's what the creative team got back!

The team liked all of the options and ended up telling Goran to go ahead with whichever one he wanted. He chose number 6 and dazzled everyone with the final.
