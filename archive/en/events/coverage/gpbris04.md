GRAND PRIX BRISBANE 2004
------------------------


Copeman's Creatures Conquer
===========================




November 12-14











![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gpbris04/fin.jpg)It took two days, 222 players, and sixteen rounds of play, but we now know that the new Grand Prix--Brisbane champion is an Australian. Twenty-four year-old Will Copeman and his nearly mono-green deck overcame teammate Bryce Trevilyan in the quarterfinals before smashing Masami Ibamoto in the semis, setting up a meeting with countryman Anatoli Lightfoot. Copeman fell behind in the first game, as Lightfoot played [Meloku the Clouded Mirror](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Meloku+the+Clouded+Mirror) and then bounced Copeman's creatures out of the way long enough to get a game 1 victory. However, it was at that point that Lightfoot's deck decided to let him down, completely manascrewing him in games 2 and 3 and giving Copeman his first Grand Prix Championship. Congratulations Will, and to all the great competitors this weekend in beautiful Brisbane, Australia!
