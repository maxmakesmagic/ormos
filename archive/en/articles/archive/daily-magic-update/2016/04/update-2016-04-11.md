The Daily *Magic* Update is a roundup of everything *Magic* you should know on April 11, 2016. Today's Update is brought to you by [Thing in the Ice](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thing+in+the+Ice). If [The Gitrog Monster](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=The+Gitrog+Monster) got a day, [Thing in the Ice](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thing+in+the+Ice) definitely gets one too.


Today's Musts
=============


1. [Standard Snapshot: First Look at *Shadows over Innistrad*](http://www.gatheringmagic.com/nickvigabool-041116-standard-snapshot-first-look-at-shadows-over-innistrad/) | Gathering Magic | Nick Vigabol

Curious what Standard looks like after this weekend, but don't want to wade through all of the pesky words and videos? Try a chart! Or twelve! Just in case you needed visual representation that white cards had a pretty good weekend.


1. [This Is That: *Shadows over Innistrad* with Dave Humpherys](http://www.mtggoldfish.com/articles/this-is-that-shadows-over-innistrad-with-dave-humpherys) | Jake Stiles | MTGGoldfish

Jake Stiles's "This is That" series tries to establish a level set for a new expansion by comparing new cards to older ones, showing off functional reprints, and categorizing the changes. This one is a bit special, as Dave Humpherys, lead developer for *Shadows over Innistrad*, stopped by to offer some insight into this one. This article is great for game designers, aspiring game designers, and people who just love delving deep into the minds of R&D.


1. [Nahiri Naya In Baltimore](http://magic.tcgplayer.com/db/article.asp?ID=13210&writer=Jadine+Klomparens&articledate=4-11-2016) | TCGPlayer | Jadine Klomparens

One of the more unique creations to come out of the [Open in Baltimore](#open) this weekend was the Naya deck featuring [Nahiri, the Harbinger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nahiri%2C+the+Harbinger) brought by Jadine Klomparens. Three-color decks were rare, but Jadine bravely brought Nahiri and friends to the table.


1. [Judges Announce New Level Changes](http://blogs.magicjudges.org/blog/2016/04/11/the-new-new-world-order/)

This morning, judges announced they were changing how the judge level system works. Check it out if you're a judge or if you're curious how judges manage their level system.


What You Might Have Missed This Weekend
=======================================


1. [StarCityGames.com Baltimore Open](http://www.starcitygames.com/events/090416_baltimore.html)

The first major tournament of the new Standard season took place this weekend, and there was a ton new to see. There was a [Thing in the Ice](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thing+in+the+Ice) being thawed out by the raw power of [Pyromancer's Goggles](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyromancer%27s+Goggles) (see today's [Deck of the Day](#deck)), there were Humans aplenty, Eldrazi, and the occasional Dragon. You can check out the Top 64 deck lists [here](http://sales.starcitygames.com/deckdatabase/deckshow.php?&t%5BC1%5D=1&start_date=04/08/2016&end_date=04/10/2016&start=1&finish=64&city=Baltimore&start_num=0), or check out the [Day One](https://www.twitch.tv/scglive/v/59539127) broadcast or the [Day Two](https://www.twitch.tv/scglive/v/59743986) broadcast.


Ultimately, it was won by Jim Davis and his Bant Company deck, proving that [Collected Company](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Collected+Company) is still a very real card. Whether or not that's what the Pro Tour will look like in two weeks is an open question.


1. [*Magic: The Gathering* Office Hours—Jace Beleren](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCWN6IgPj94) | Tolarian Community College | The Professor and Jimmy Wong

Another in the series of Office Hours videos from The Professor where he talks to one of *Magic*'s main Planeswalkers, but this one features The Command Zone's Jimmy Wong as Jace! It's like one of those [crossover TV episodes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJzaNzPJqWI), like when the Ninja Turtles and Power Rangers inexplicably got together. Like no one would have ever off-handedly mentioned that they lived in a world where giant robots occasionally fight giant monsters before the crossover episode.

*Enter the Battlefield*, a documentary about *Magic* by the guys from *Walking the Planes* (Nate Holt and Shawn Kornhauser), drops at the end of this month! On Netflix! We screened a version of the film back at PAX to a select few, but since then the crew has still been busy working on it and finalizing the version you'll all get to see starting April 25! Check out [the announcement](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/news/enter-battlefield-premieres-april-25-2016-04-11) for more details.

Standard wasn't the only new game in town this weekend, as Modern received a facelift as well and, as intended, the Eldrazi Winter has finally thawed. A variety of decks returned. In Baltimore, at the [StarCityGames.com Classic](http://sales.starcitygames.com/deckdatabase/deckshow.php?&t%5BC1%5D=28&start_date=04/08/2016&end_date=04/10/2016&start=1&finish=32&city=Baltimore&start_num=0), [Scapeshift](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scapeshift) took the crown with a variety of decks on its heels, though very few of them utilizing newly unbanned [Ancestral Vision](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ancestral+Vision) or [Sword of the Meek](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sword+of+the+Meek).


However, the other significant Modern tournament of the weekend, the [Face To Face Games Modern Sunday Showdown](http://manadeprived.com/modern-sunday-showdown-top-8-lists-2/), featured a heavy dose of both Thopter Gifts and Grixis Control—both doing well and each utilizing [Sword of the Meek](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sword+of+the+Meek) and [Ancestral Vision](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ancestral+Vision), respectively.

Paul Jordan, he who holds many *Magic* stats, has been posting some charts on win rates among notable pros lately, using the hashtag [#mtgcharts](https://twitter.com/hashtag/mtgcharts). So far a few have been posted, but more will likely be coming in the run up to [Pro Tour *Shadows over Innistrad*](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/premierplay/protour/ptsoi). It's a fun follow for stat-heads everywhere. Or for Pros looking for statistical evidence of when they're good or when they suck.


Deck of the Day
===============


1. [Thing in the Ice wear some pretty nice Goggles](http://www.starcitygames.com/events/coverage/ur_control_with_todd_anderson.html)

Sure, the real deck of the [StarCityGames.com Baltimore Open](http://www.starcitygames.com/events/090416_baltimore.html) was probably White-Blue Humans, which put three copies in the Top 8 (plus a Mono-White Humans list) and was [the most-played Day Two deck](http://www.starcitygames.com/events/coverage/3734_day_2_metagame_breakdown_.html), but let's face it, the talk of the weekend was Todd Anderson's Blue-Red Control deck featuring [Thing in the Ice](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thing+in+the+Ice) and [Pyromancer's Goggles](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyromancer%27s+Goggles), for pretty much the Johnny/Jenny dream.


Anderson bounced and burned his way to the Top 8 before ultimately losing in the semifinals to Kellen Pastore.


The deck's main goal is to utilize its two headlining cards to turn the tides quickly. [Thing in the Ice](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thing+in+the+Ice) resets a board and acts as a quick clock, while [Pyromancer's Goggles](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyromancer%27s+Goggles) can deal with multiple creatures via [Lightning Axe](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Axe) and [Fall of the Titans](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fall+of+the+Titans) or draw tons of cards with [Magmatic Insight](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Magmatic+Insight) and [Tormenting Voice](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tormenting+Voice). The deck sets up and then turns the corner quite quickly, making it a formidable weapon in a new metagame.


But don't take my word for it (or do, I'm a pretty smart guy sometimes). Anderson did a [video deck tech during the tournament](http://www.starcitygames.com/events/coverage/ur_control_with_todd_anderson.html) for anyone curious about why he built what he built (plus a pretty amusing story about how [Fall of the Titans](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fall+of+the+Titans) made the deck).
