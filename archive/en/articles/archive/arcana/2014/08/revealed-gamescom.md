Based in London, UK, Dan is responsible for the Magic community in Europe, and can often be found at European Premier events. He loves cats, cube drafting, and attacking for 2. 






Thursday was the first public day of Gamescom in Cologne, Germany, and *Magic* has [a significant presence](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/gamescom-2014-08-06) at the show. You can see a number of pictures in [our Facebook photo album](https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.10154430619255307.1073741856.201120755306&type=3).


We took this opportunity to show our fans there a few exciting new things, but we certainly wouldn't want you at home to miss out on the excitement, so here's a brief recap of what we showed off:


Changes to Intro Packs
======================


As of *Khans of Tarkir*, the face cards in Intro Packs will not just be premium rare cards…but *alternative art* premium rare cards that you won't be able to open in booster packs.


Here's a first look at the alternative artworks of the *Khans of Tarkir* Intro Pack rares:

Mardu Heart-Piercer shows off the Mardu clan's raid ability, which plays into their swift and aggressive strategy.

Thousand Winds is from the Jeskai clan, and shows how the trickiest clan uses the ancient dragon magic of morph to hide their true form.


*Commander* (2014 Edition)
==========================


Finally, we revealed a new legendary creature from *Commander* (2014 Edition), releasing November 7. He's from the plane of Innistrad, has a sister named Gisa, and has already created a Messenger and a Mindcrusher. His name? Geralf.
