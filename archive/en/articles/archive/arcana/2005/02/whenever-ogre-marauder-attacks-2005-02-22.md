**[Ogre Marauder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Ogre%2BMarauder)** is an ogre on a mission. You want to block him? You have to toss a creature in the bin first -- like the poor lizard creature in the background of Adam Rex's awesome art (below).Did you know that if your [Ogre Marauder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ogre+Marauder) attacks more than once in a turn, your opponent has to sacrifice a creature for *each combat* in which he wants to block it? So if you manage to rig up an [additional combat phase](http://gatherer.wizards.com/default.asp?term=additional_combat_phase&fields=%7Cname%7Crules%7Ctype&format=Allsets&color=All&output=summary&sort=name&first=1) (perhaps by [Seize the Day](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Seize%2Bthe%2BDay), or by delivering a [Savage Beating](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Savage+Beating) -- perhaps during a [Fervent Charge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fervent+Charge)), your opponent gets to decide a *second time* whether to lose a creature just for the privilege of blocking your 3/1.
