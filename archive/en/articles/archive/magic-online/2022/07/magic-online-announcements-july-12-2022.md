*Double Masters 2022* Limited Preliminaries – Now with QP Entry Option
----------------------------------------------------------------------


Limited Preliminary events now feature *Double Masters 2022*. For the first time, players will be able to enter these events with Qualifier Points!


This is the Limited offering we mentioned back in April for players to use their excess QPs (especially all of those earned during the 20th Anniversary Series) due to our Premier Play gap in May.


Like other *Masters* offerings, the entry options are 45 Event Tickets and 450 Play Points. The third option is 45 MOCS Season 2 QPs.


Prizes are the same as regular-set Preliminaries—this is due to the ability to reinvest QPs into extra Preliminaries in addition to the normal Qualifier, Super Qualifier, and Showcase Challenge options.

* **July 13–****20**: *Dungeons & Dragons: Adventures in the Forgotten Realms*—Keeper

* [Deranged Assistant](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deranged+Assistant) and [Millikin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Millikin)'s mana abilities have been changed to work only at instant speed.
