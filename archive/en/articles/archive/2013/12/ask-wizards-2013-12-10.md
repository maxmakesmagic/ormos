 **Q: I was just curious as to what the descriptions were for some of my favorite card art, specifically [Bridge from Below](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bridge+from+Below) (*Modern Masters*) and [Counterbalance](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterbalance)? —JR**  


**A: Mike McArtor, copy editor, DailyMTG:** 


This is a fun question to answer because delving into Multiverse—our internal database that holds this kind of information—is always educational and entertaining. Here's what Multiverse tells us:


### Bridge from Below

Color: Black-mana spell  

Location: see below  

Action: We see a series of floating stones that form a staircase that rises up out of a sinister void. The void swirls with sickly, deep purple smoke. On the magic staircase, one or two faceless undead humanoids can be seen plodding upward.  

Focus: the scene  

Mood: a slow, eerie procession toward undeath


### Counterbalance

Color: Blue  

Location: NA  

Action: A spell flies through the air towards a mage. That mage has just thrown a illusionary copy of that spell at that spell. When the two collide they will both fizzle. The mage need not be shown.  

Focus: The two spells  

Mood: matter-antimatter collision
