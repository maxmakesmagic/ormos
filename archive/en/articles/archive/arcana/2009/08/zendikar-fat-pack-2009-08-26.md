Hey! Check this out!

*That* is the Fat Pack for *Zendikar*. Let's take a look inside, shall we?

We'll run down the contents for you in a moment, but first we just want to look at it. It's so, so pretty.

Okay, enough stalling. Let's do this!

* Eight 15-card booster packs
* A card box with panoramic art
* The *Zendikar* Player's Guide, which contains play tips, story background, and a visual encyclopedia of every card in the set (we just got ours here in the office, and they're nice!)
* A learn-to-play insert
* An excerpt from *Path of the Planeswalker* (the full version of *Path of the Planeswalker* collects 8 issues and over 160 pages of expertly painted comics. It includes a bonus comic not yet available on the web. *Path of the Planewalker* will be in book and comic stores everywhere early 2010)
* An exclusive *Zendikar* Spindown Life Counter, and finally
* A pack of 40 *Zendikar* basic landâ€”yes, the full-art kind, as seen [here](/en/articles/archive/zendikar-forests-and-wallpaper-week-2009-08-14).
