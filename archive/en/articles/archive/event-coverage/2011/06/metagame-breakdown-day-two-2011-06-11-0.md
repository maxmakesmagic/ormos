The dust had settled after five rounds of *Scars of Mirrodin*  Block Constructed and three rounds of *Scars of Mirrodin*  Block Booster Draft. One hundred thirty-two players emerged with at least five wins to make the cut to Day Two. Of these Block Constructed decks, eleven posted impressive undefeated records. Four Tempered Steel, three Tezzeret Control, and one each of Blue-Black Control, Blue-White Control, Big Red and Mono-Black Infect were guaranteed a spot on Saturday with 5-0 starts.

With five more rounds of *Scars of Mirrodin*  Block Constructed still to come, we would soon see which decks would come forth as the ones to beat. The complete Day Two metagame numbers are here for your pleasure.
