With our arrival in December, it's time that we here at DailyMTG begin winding down and preparing to roll into the holiday break.

For those of you new around here, Wizards of the Coast (and all of Hasbro) closes down between Christmas and New Years. To enable this, DailyMTG runs two weeks of reruns over this period. Last year, we changed it up to support **Magic Online** Week and the early arrival of *Gatecrash*.

So, I wanted to give you all a guide to DailyMTG's schedule through the end of the year:

* This week (December 9–13): It's the last week of new content from our normal stable of writers for 2013.
* Next week (December 16–20): **Magic Online** Week. Like last year, we take a week to look at **Magic Online** with guest writers from Ramp;D and the **Magic Online** team.
* December 23–27: Happy holidays! It's the first week of reruns for 2013.
* December 30–January 3: Happy new year! Our second week of reruns for 2013.
* January 6: We're back! Welcome to 2014!

Now, just because I've given you this outline doesn't mean we don't have a few surprises still waiting for you.
