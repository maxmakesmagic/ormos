Angel may be the most popular and most iconic white creature type. We've received more than one request at ask@wizards.com for large art of some of some of the splashy Angels from recent sets, and as we dug around in the database for some Angel art, we discovered something interesting.


Angel art is *tall*.


Of course, the color white is the champion of all that is just and righteous, and so the natural mode of illustrating an angelic white paragon of these virtues is with a lot of verticality. Unfortunately, while the art box of **Magic** cards has grown in size with the recent [change in card face](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/feature/121), it's still a mostly *horizontal* rectangle. What's an art director to do?


Not much to do but crop, and frown.


But lucky you: you clicked on **Magic** Arcana today, so you get to see a few of these screen-dominating Angels in all their glory.


Prepare to scroll, folks.
