DAY 2 COVERAGE



It's nice and early here in Atlanta, Georgia! The players are seated and ready to draft their hearts out in *Battle for Zendikar*. The format has proven nuanced and difficult. You always want the Blue-Red Devoid deck, or the Black-White Lifegain deck, but if you don't get there, you might end up with the Blue-Red-X Pile, or the Black-White Pile—not the optimal places to be.


Sitting at the top of the piles are Dan Musser, Aryah Wiznitzer, Gregory Michel, Jordan Berkowitz, Davis Merced, and Samuel Cocchiarella at 9-0. But hot on their heels are the 8-1s, including people like (2) Owen Turtenwald, Hall of Famers Ben Stark and Jon Finkel, (21) Ari Lax, Gerry Thompson, Brian Braun-Duin, Michael Majors.


And don't count the 7-2s out yet either. All surviving their bubble matches in Round 9, Luis Scott-Vargas, Matt Sperling, (14) Reid Duke, Dave Williams, and Pascal Maynard are all through to today and ready to smash some face.


See it all on [twitch.tv/scglive](http://www.twitch.tv/scglive).


It's a *Magic*al world out there, Hobbes, ol' buddy—let's go exploring.

DAY 1 COVERAGE



It’s been a long-fought day here in Atlanta. 2,073 players rallied to battle for Zendikar, but only a many came up devoid of a good finish, and only a small fraction will awaken to converge again tomorrow.


Seven players sit atop the heap at 9-0: Davis Merced, Jordan Berkowitz, Minh Diep, Aryeh Wiznitzer, Dan Musser, Gregory Michel, and Samuel Cocchiarella. These are your players to beat for tomorrow.


*Battle for Zendikar* Sealed has proved a sticky wicket. The power is there; the synergy is there; but getting both in the correct dosages can be tricky. There’s more potential for things to go right in draft tomorrow, but also more potential for things to go very wrong.


Will the undefeated players keep afloat in a sea of Day 2 sharks? Tune in tomorrow at 9 am EST on [twitch.tv/scglive](file:///C:/Users/toleb/AppData/Local/Microsoft/Windows/Temporary%20Internet%20Files/Content.Outlook/ZKSN5Y60/twitch.tv/scglive) to find out. From Atlanta, see you tomorrow!
