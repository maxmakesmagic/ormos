Modern Cube Continued
---------------------


The Modern Cube is a great way to try out all the iconic cards and synergies that shape one of *Magic*'s most dynamic formats. Modern Cube can be found in the Limited Leagues section of the Play Lobby and will run through September 26, with the start of *Throne of Eldraine* events. Here are some words from Reggie Valk of *Magic* R&D about this year's Modern Cube:


*"The guiding principle behind this last batch of changes was to introduce relevant cards from the sets that came out since [Modern Cube] was last updated (November 2018), which ended up including RNA, WAR, MH1, and M20. Aside from including a lot of the more obvious inclusions due to iconic status and Modern playability (like Urza, [Wrenn and Six](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wrenn+and+Six), etc.), I also tried to update the Cube to have some cards and strategies that align with popular Modern strategies currently, which is why things like [Arclight Phoenix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arclight+Phoenix) and [Duskwatch Recruiter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duskwatch+Recruiter) were introduced. I also was cognizant of the amount of planeswalkers in this cube as that has been its largest criticism by far, so despite WAR adding a lot of cool new PWs, the number stayed the same and, if anything, should only go down from here."*

Vintage & Pauper Playoffs This Weekend
--------------------------------------


Format Playoffs aren't done yet with Vintage and Pauper set for this weekend. To join, accrue 35 Format Points in Challenges and Leagues within either format by its Playoff date—Vintage on Saturday, September 14, and Pauper on Sunday, September 15.


The *Magic Online* Format Challenges continue every weekend for Modern, Vintage, Legacy, and Pauper formats except when replaced by Format Playoffs during scheduled Format Playoff dates.


Format Playoff events qualify you for the Format Championship in January that sends the top player to the *Magic Online* Championships and the tabletop Mythic Championships.

Format Focus Tournament Update
------------------------------


This past Saturday's Modern Format Playoff reached its announced [player cap](https://magic.wizards.com/en/content/2019-magic-online-championship-series#FormatPlayoffs2019). Unfortunately, this meant that many players who were otherwise eligible to participate couldn't. We believe that players who have the points should be able to play in the Format Playoff events, and so we're making some changes to the way the Format Focus series will work for the remainder of 2019.


We will be holding an additional set of Format Playoffs on the following schedule. These events will, as with other Format Playoff events, replace the Format Challenge on that day. The entry requirement (35 Format Points) and prize payout is unchanged.


* Bonus Modern Format Playoff on October 12
* Bonus Legacy Format Playoff on October 13
* Bonus Vintage Format Playoff on October 19
* Bonus Pauper Format Playoff on October 20

All Format Playoff events, including the bonus round in mid-October, will have their player cap raised to 672 players. This should alleviate this concern for future events as well.


By adding a Playoff for each format, we're increasing the number of participants in the Format Championships by eight each. To account for this, we're extending the prize schedule such that the prizes previously announced for 17th–32nd place will extend to 40th place; all players in the Championship will end the event with at least 24 boosters, 200 Play Points, and their format's Championship Avatar.
