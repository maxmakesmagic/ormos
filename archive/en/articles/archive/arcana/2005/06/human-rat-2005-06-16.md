The 1/1 regenerator **[Kuro's Taken](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kuro%27s+Taken)** may look like a simple [Drudge Skeletons](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Drudge+Skeletons)-type blocker when you're drafting *Saviors*, but it has a lot of depth.


First of all, it's a samurai, and samurai have Bushido. So this katana-wielding [Drudge Skeleton](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Drudge+Skeleton) is a bit more skilled in a fight, and less likely to be blocked.


Second of all, its flavor is that of an evil samurai enchanted with dark energies. It's not just your ordinary bushido-trained rat -- it's *[Kuro's Taken](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kuro%27s+Taken)*. And we all remember who Kuro is, right? That's right: a 9/9 legendary demon (**[Kuro, Pitlord](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kuro%2C+Pitlord)**). [Kuro's Taken](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kuro%27s+Taken) is a dark samurai fuelled with the demonic energies of a legendary demon, with some creepy phantom-tendrils to show for it. Check him out in the full art below:



One last thing about [Kuro's Taken](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kuro%27s+Taken). It was actually initially sketched as a *human* samurai by artist [Puddnhead](http://gatherer.wizards.com/default.asp?first=1&last=100&term=puddnhead&Field_Artist=on&setfilter=Allsets&colorfilter=All&output=summary&sort=name&x=29&y=20), then later changed to a rat in the final, at the art team's request. Here's a sneak peek at that sketch:
