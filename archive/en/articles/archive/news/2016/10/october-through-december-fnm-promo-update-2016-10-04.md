It's almost October, so it's time to announce the promos that Friday Night *Magic* players can look forward to over the next three months. They are shiny, and soon they can all be yours.


**October**


It can't be all Eldrazi all the time—at some point the heroes of the story were going to rise up. It's just that, well, this time the heroes are Zombies, and they're rising from the tides in this premium foil version of Rise from the Tides with art from Lucas Graciano.

**November**


Well that's just—just horrifying. I know *Eldritch Moon* and *Shadows over Innistrad* were all about horror but, this is madness...


...oh, I get it. Yeah, this one features an Angel doing something wholly terrifying. But that was the point, wasn't it, Eric Deschamps?

**December**


If you happened to pick up one of those terrifying Fiery Tempers, this is a pretty effective way to madness it out. And 1/1 lifelink Vampires, to boot!
