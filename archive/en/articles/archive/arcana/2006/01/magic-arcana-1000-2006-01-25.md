Check out the address bar in your browser. That's right -- today marks **Magic Arcana number One Thousand**. As Magic Arcana moves into its four-digit era, we take this opportunity to review some of the highlights of Magic Arcana's history -- before we start in tomorrow on the next thousand! 

Magic Arcana has been a mainstay of **magicthegathering.com's** content landscape since the site [debuted](/en/articles/archive/beginning-2002-01-02-0) on January 2, 2002. Concepted as a feature that would share sneak peeks of future products and reveal little-known factoids about the game's past, it has provided a new daily tidbit about the game for over four years running. (It has gone into reruns during holidays, so there haven't been one thousand distinct Arcanas quite yet, but we're celebrating today anyway.) What have been some of Magic Arcana's recurring attractions and individual highlights during these first nine hundred ninety-nine?

![Sketches](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/mtgcom/arcana1000/1000_sketches.jpg)### [Sketches](http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=mtgcom/fullarchive&tablefilter=sketches:)

The popular Sketches, a regular feature of Magic Arcana, looks behind the scenes of the creation of **Magic** art. It debuted in February of 2002 with [this look](/en/articles/archive/sketches-vengeful-dreams-2002-02-28) at Mark Tedin's [Vengeful Dreams](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vengeful+Dreams). Sketches has peeked at [tourney staples](/en/articles/archive/sketches-withered-wretch-2003-02-24) and [obscure oddities](/en/articles/archive/sketches-kamahls-summons-2002-10-14), [beloved reprints](/en/articles/archive/sketches-bottle-gnomes-old-and-new-2003-10-08) and [true originals](/en/articles/archive/sketches-time-stop-2004-09-02), [5-card cycles](/en/articles/archive/sketches-onslaught-cycling-lands-2004-03-25) and [legendary heroes](/en/articles/archive/sketches-higure-still-wind-2005-01-11). Sketches has taken over Magic Arcana almost 100 times throughout its career, and looks to add a few more notches to its metaphorical, black-and-white belt with the recent release of *Guildpact*. 

![The Lexicon](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/mtgcom/arcana1000/1000_lexicon.jpg)### [The Lexicon](http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=mtgcom/fullarchive&tablefilter=lexicon)

Back in 2002, the Lexicon [debuted](/en/articles/archive/viv%C2%B7i%C2%B7fy-scriv%C2%B7en%C2%B7er-%C2%B7mu%C2%B7ga%C2%B7ba-2002-01-04) as an independent feature of **magicthegathering.com**, meant to help players bone up on the sometimes-obscure vocabulary used in **Magic** card names. The Lexicon dropped away for a year and a half as the site's content offerings changed around, but it was resurrected at the [end of 2003](/en/articles/archive/lexicon-mirrodin-edition-2003-12-15) as a semi-regular feature of Magic Arcana. 

![Magic Dossiers](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/mtgcom/arcana1000/1000_dossiers.jpg)### [Magic Dossiers](http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=mtgcom/fullarchive&tablefilter=dossier)

The first Magic Dossier (of R&D developer [Henry Stern](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/arcana/389)) went up in July of 2003, providing to Magic Arcana readers an FBI-style intelligence file about the people who make **Magic** go. (Aaron Forsythe spent *hours* hunched over his computer creating the Photoshop template for Magic Dossier's manila folder graphic. Dig the font on "CLASSIFIED", will you? And that coffee stain? Classic!)

![Wallpaper of the Week](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/mtgcom/arcana1000/1000_wallpaper.jpg)### [Wallpaper of the Week](/en/articles/archive/wallpaper-week-archive-2003-11-10)

A set of desktop wallpapers featuring [Stalking Bloodsucker](/en/articles/archive/wallpaper-week-stalking-bloodsucker-2003-08-22) ushered in a new Friday tradition for Magic Arcana in August, 2003. To date we've handed over 100 wallpapers. The readers' favorite to date, judging by site traffic? Our April Fools' special for 2005: [Silhouette](/en/articles/archive/wallpaper-week-silhouette-2005-04-01). (Second most popular? The double-wide [B.F.M.](/en/articles/archive/wallpaper-week-bfm-big-furry-monster-2004-02-06)! Maybe we try too hard to find cool fantasy art...)

![Mistform Ultimus Watch](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/mtgcom/arcana1000/1000_MUW.jpg)### [Mistform Ultimus Watch](http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=mtgcom/fullarchive&tablefilter=mistform%20ultimus)

[Debuting](/en/articles/archive/mistform-ultimus-watch-mirrodin-block-2004-06-28) in June of 2004, this semi-regular sub-feature showcases and celebrates the ever-changing list of creature types embodied by that *Legions* legend, [Mistform Ultimus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mistform+Ultimus). Ever want to know what creature types are legal to name with [Engineered Plague](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Engineered+Plague) or [similar cards](http://gatherer.wizards.com/?first=1&last=100&term=choose+a+creature+type&Field_Name=on&Field_Rules=on&Field_Type=on&setfilter=Allsets&colorfilter=All&typefilter=All&output=summary&sort=name)? Keep track of Mistform Ultimus Watch!

![Product Previews](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/mtgcom/arcana1000/1000_previews.jpg)### Product Previews

Magic Arcana often serves as a showcase for upcoming **Magic** products. You've seen [set announcements](/en/node/598051), [product shots](/en/articles/archive/saviors-kamigawa-product-shots-2005-04-20), that [new fat pack](/en/node/608941), previews of those [textless promo cards](/en/articles/archive/new-promo-terror-2004-09-13), and holy crap the [Temple Garden thing](/en/articles/archive/special-ravnica-preview-2005-08-18). 

![Art and Flavor](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/mtgcom/arcana1000/1000_flavor.jpg)### Art and Flavor

Magic Arcana has also shown off the flavor behind the game and its gorgeous art. You've seen [obscure art connections](/en/articles/archive/lavamancers-buddy-2002-01-25), [uncropped angel art](/en/articles/archive/blacks-tall-angels-2004-06-24), [bizarre peeks into style guides](/en/articles/archive/hungry-hill-2004-02-17), [glossaries of Japanese terms](/en/articles/archive/kamigawa-glossary-part-1-2004-09-14), amazing [land art](/en/articles/archive/basics-setting-2005-08-29), [art "Easter eggs"](/en/articles/archive/goblin-grenade-secret-2004-07-20), [vignettes](/en/articles/archive/kamigawa-block-vignette-roundup-2005-06-07) about the legendary characters of Kamigawa, and more [style guide information](/en/articles/archive/mirrodin-environments-green-2003-11-19) than you could shake a colored pencil at.

![A flash of history](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/mtgcom/arcana1000/1000_history.jpg)### Flashes of History

The term "Arcana" surely fits when we reveal arcane snippets of **Magic**'s past. There's been [misprint lore](/en/articles/archive/alpha-oops-2002-02-01), [complex *Legend*ary cycles](/en/articles/archive/family-trees-2002-03-07), [the first prerelease foil promo](/en/articles/archive/first-foil-prerelease-card-2004-07-26), classic [*Duelist* articles](/en/articles/archive/duelist-flashback-control-jim-lin-2004-08-02) and [**Magic** commercials](/en/articles/archive/orgg-vs-bob-accounting-2004-12-02), scans of old [**Magic** comics](/en/articles/archive/jedit-ojanen-comic-2005-03-29), looks at the [older days of Wizards.com](/en/articles/archive/wizardscom-through-years-2004-03-03), behind-the-scenes peeks at R&D's [playtest cards](/en/articles/archive/ffl-playtest-cards-2003-08-18). 

![Odds and Ends](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/mtgcom/arcana1000/1000_oddsends.jpg)### Other Odds and Ends

You've also come to know Magic Arcana as a source for that slightly less categorizable **Magic** content -- [birth announcements](/en/articles/archive/rosewaters-design-new-split-card-2004-01-22), [job openings](/en/articles/archive/magic-assistant-brand-manager-position-2004-11-20), [April Fools' jokes](/en/articles/archive/artist-easter-eggs-2004-04-01), [guessing games](/en/articles/archive/whos-spirit-2005-03-01), [whiteboards of wisdom](/en/articles/archive/rd-whiteboard-wisdom-2005-04-25), [neato web tools](/en/articles/archive/draft-viewer-pro-tour-london-top-8-2005-07-14), and, uh, [*Tijuana Nights*](/en/articles/archive/tijuana-nights-2004-11-17)... 

### We Look Forward to #2000

We hope you enjoyed this stroll through the history of this feature of **magicthegathering.com**. We'll review Arcana's history again sometime around 2010. See you tomorrow!
