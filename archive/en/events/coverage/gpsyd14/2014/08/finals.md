 Perth newcomer Paul Jackson sat down to face the Sydney *Magic* veteran James Zhang in the finals of GP Sydney. Zhang had already won Australian Grand Prix trophies back in 2005 and 2006 and was looking towards a repeat performance in 2014. Jackson, however, was determined to bring the trophy home to Perth.




 "I haven't seen Zhang's deck at all," Paul said. "I asked Zhang about it, but he didn't seem too fussed, so I suspect I have the better deck. But I'm determined to play the *Magic* I've been playing all weekend and focus on winning, one game at a time."




**Game 1**




 With the higher finish in the Swiss rounds Jackson elected to play. Jackson raced out of the gate with a quick [Research Assistant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Research+Assistant) and [Kinsbaile Skirmisher](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kinsbaile+Skirmisher), while Zhang's first play was a Guardian [Sentinel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sentinel). Jackson continued pressing his advantage with a [Frost Lynx](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Frost+Lynx) targeting the Guardian [Sentinel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sentinel) to push through his creatures.
