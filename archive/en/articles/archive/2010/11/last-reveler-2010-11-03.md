The *Lorywn* card [Final Revels](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Final+Revels) portrayes a kithkin and a boggart dancing while under the effect of some unnamed plants.

According to the flavor text, *One whiff of the sweet, pungent scent leads to euphoria—or to an early grave.* And as the dancers seem pretty cheerful, they're presumably experiencing the euphoria of a temporary +2/+0. But what about the -0/-2? There ought to be some kind of reference to something dying! Study the art and see if you can detect its presence.
