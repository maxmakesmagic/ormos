 Mike Rosenberg is a writer and gamer and has been part of the Magic text coverage team since 2011. He joined Wizards as organized play’s content specialist in June 2014. 






With the conclusion of [Pro Tour *Eldritch Moon*](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/ptemn/), the 2015–16 season has come to a close. The Pro Tour not only determined a winner, but also the final 24 competitors that you'll see at the 2016 World Championship in just a few short weeks.


We'll go through the aftermath of the Pro Tour, but first up, let's take a look at how the 2016–17 season will start out this weekend with Grand Prix Rimini.


GP Rimini and Portland
======================


The new season kicks off with Grand Prix Rimini and Grand Prix Portland, two Standard main events to follow up the metagame that revealed itself at the Pro Tour.

[Grand Prix Rimini](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/gprim16) will be the first of these to begin, with articles, photos, and more coming from our writer-reporter team of Tobi Henke and Frank Karsten. The tournament gets going at 9 a.m. local time (CET)/midnight PT/3 a.m. ET/7 a.m. UTC.
