This week's "Sketches" takes a stroll down memory lane as we look at the *Mirrodin* reprint of a *Tempest* favorite, **[Bottle Gnomes](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bottle+Gnomes)**. Before we get to Ben Thompson's task of illustrating the updated Gnomes, let's set the wayback machine to 1997 and look at Kaja Foglio's original painting.

### 0. Original Art

The first [Bottle Gnomes](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bottle+Gnomes) lived happily in many *Tempest* block sideboards. They were chumped-and-chugged by many a control mage looking to slow down speedy red weenie decks. As *Tempest* rotated out of Standard, so generally did the aggressive red decks, so the three Gnomes with their round, life-giving bellies marched their way off to Extended. 

### 1. Art Description

Fast forward to *Mirrodin* design, just when *Onslaught* block had started a resurgence in fast red weenie decks. The Gnomes were recruited again, and needed updated art. Here were the instructions given to Ben Thompson for the project:


> "Color: Artifact (neutral to colors)  
>  Location: Inside the 'Lumengrid'  
>  Action: Show three 'Bottle Gnomes' full of magical blue lymph liquid  
>  Notes: Refer to the previous Bottle Gnomes art, but update them so they look like they're from this 'metal world.'"
> 
> 

We learned about Lumengrid, the Vedalken city featured on [Seat of the Synod](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seat+of+the+Synod), in [Monday's Magic Arcana](/en/articles/archive/mirrodin-environments-blue-2003-10-06). "Lymph," in the *Mirrodin* universe, is the [Thirst for Knowledge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Thirst%2Bfor%2BKnowledge) that permeates the Quicksilver Sea and that is given off by [Blinkmoth Urn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Blinkmoth%2BUrn).

### 2. Sketches

Here is Ben's initial sketch: 

We recognize the round, potion-like bellies and their diminutive size. What's new is a sleeker, more organically metallic look, and a plucky marching pose. The art team liked Ben's combination of new and old, and bade him proceed.

### 3. Final Art

The new Gnomes have a pleasing familiarity yet an attractive new look. That blue liquid looks as chuggably refreshing as ever, but we know that in *Mirrodin* it's delicious "lymph." Maybe the plane of Rath had some sort of proto-lymph?

### 4. Card

Lastly, here is both versions of the card, as you can see it in booster packs, old and new.
