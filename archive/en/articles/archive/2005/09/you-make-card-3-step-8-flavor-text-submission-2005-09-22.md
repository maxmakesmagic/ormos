And here's how the card currently stands:

All that remains is one last piece. A little something known as flavor text. We've templated the card (please note that it's been tweaked since you last saw it) and have discovered that there is space for two lines of flavor text. The maximum length of two lines is 80 characters (and yes, that counts everything – letters, punctuation, spaces). Remember that quotation attributions fall onto their own line meaning if you're quoting someone, you only have 40 characters. Also, for expert expansions we do not use real world quotations. For some more tips on writing flavor text, check out Rei Nakazawa's “[Adding a Little Flavor](/en/articles/archive/tales-beyond-veil-2005-06-13)” article, as well as the several [feature articles](http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=mtgcom/columnarchive&column=FeatureArticle) by Jay Moldenhauer-Salazar on writing flavor text.


As with other creative elements, we have to limit each person to a single submission. Note that any flavor text that is over 80 characters will not be considered. Deadline for submissions will be a week from when this article goes up, so until the site updates on Wednesday night, September 28.


Good luck with your writing, and when we return we'll be ready for the last step of the process!
