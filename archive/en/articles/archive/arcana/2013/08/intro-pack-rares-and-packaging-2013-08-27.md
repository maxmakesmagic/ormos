The preview season is just around the corner, truly kicking off this coming weekend at PAX Prime here in Seattle. But until that time I've got some new stuff to show you!

### Booster Packs

*Theros* will have our standard fifteen-card booster packs. Let's see who will grace the cover of each of these packs.

First up is Thassa, looking mighty fine with her bident.

Next is Erebos with all his Nyxian flair. I love those shoulder pieces; maybe someone will cosplay him?

This would be Purphoros the red god wielding flame and looking rather imposing.

That is not a god, that's Elspeth! Can't wait to see what she has in store in *Theros*.

And who is this? We don't know yet.

There will be a new sixty-card Event Deck with *Theros*, it will contain ten rares and the fifteen card sideboard.

### Intro Packs

Now for the part which is sure to get you all excited, let's look at the five Intro Packs for *Theros*. Each of the five *Theros* Intro Packs comes with a ready-to-play sixty-card deck featuring a foil premium rare card (it's the one you can see in the pictures!), two sealed fifteen-card booster packs, a strategy insert, and a **Magic** "learn to play" guide.

Since you all are likely to want a better look at the card, though you can see it all in the Intro Pack box, here's the card image.
