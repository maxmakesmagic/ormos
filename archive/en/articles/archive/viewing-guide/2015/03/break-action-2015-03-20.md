Occasionally, in rare circumstances, there are weekends during which no Grand Prix and no SCG Opens take place. This is one of those weekends.



Typically, these weekends are also when Prereleases are going on at stores worldwide for the new set. This is one of those weekends.



If you aren't already planning to do so, talk to [your local store](http://locator.wizards.com/) and pre-register for your local [*Dragons of Tarkir* Prerelease](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/feature/dragons-tarkir-prerelease-primer-2015-03-16), because of course, it's going to be a blast.

Meanwhile…

The Vintage Super League is heading into its eighth week of round-robin play, and already some key moments have taken place. One of those involves two of last season's Top 4 competitors: Eric Froehlich and Luis Scott-Vargas. LSV's win against EFro in Week 7 has left both players with 6-1 records, which is good enough to clinch a spot in the post-season matches.



After that, it's really tough to say what will happen. Chris Pikula and Randy Buehler both have 5-2 records and are a lock for post-season play as well, but Rich Shay and Steve Menendian are right behind them at 3-4, and they're not out of contention yet! If Chris and Randy lose their next two, two more wins from Rich and Steve will force a post-season playoff match to see who advances to the Top 4.



After that, all eyes are on David Williams, who sits at last place and is in dire need of some wins if he wants to stave off elimination from the league!



With Top 4 contention and eliminations on the line, these next two weeks are big! Join host Randy Buehler and the rest of the VSL crew for Week 8 on the [*Magic* Twitch Channel](http://www.twitch.tv/magic) Tuesday, March 24, at 6 p.m. PT/9 p.m. ET/1 a.m. GMT.

If you missed the premiere of Downtime, the interactive bundle of comedy-trivia-guesthost-interactive-British-rapping-singing-goodness hosted by Rich Hagon, then shame on you.



SHAME. ON. YOU.



But you can make it up to yourself by tuning in for the second three-hour spectacular next Wednesday, March 25, at 8 a.m. PT/11 a.m. ET/3 p.m. GMT on the [MTGRich Twitch Channel](http://www.twitch.tv/mtgrich).



It's a lot of fun, highlighting everything from last weekend's Preliminary PTQ winners to trivia covering the obscure or the pun-laden, and more. You can even get in on the action as well, since Rich participates with people from the chat, as long as you have a microphone and access to Google Hangout.



Again, that's Downtime, you, the Audience, Rich Hagon, Wednesday, at 8 a.m. PT. We'll see you then.
