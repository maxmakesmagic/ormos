A samurai may be only one person, but when attacking alone, they are at their most dangerous. Underestimate them at your own risk. Or better yet, strike first with your own solitary Samurai, and push your opponent onto the back foot. Mastery of the blade may not be the*only*thing to decide the game, but it sure won't hurt.
