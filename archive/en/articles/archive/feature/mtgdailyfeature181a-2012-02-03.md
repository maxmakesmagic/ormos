Hello!

I am Helene Bergeot, the Director of Organized Play, and I hope that you all had a great time at the **Magic** *Dark Ascension* Prerelease and Launch Parties!

As we're already starting to prepare the *Avacyn Restored* events with your local WPN stores, we wanted to give you a quick heads up on a few changes we're implementing with this set.

The changes primarily impact the way stores will schedule their events. Currently, for the weekend a new set releases, stores have the opportunity to run their regular FNM, run a variety of tournaments as part of the Launch Party, and kick off their store League.

Starting with *Avacyn Restored*, the name of "Launch Party" will be phased out— but we will still encourage stores to run a variety of events for you, including drafts! At the same time, the League will still kick off the Friday of the release. Lastly, the foil participation cards previously distributed during the Launch Party event will be made available to you at the Friday Night **Magic** on release day.

As I said, the changes will primarily impact the way stores schedule their events. You will still get access to a variety of events (and promo cards!) that will give you the opportunity to enjoy the new set.

We’ll also be introducing a very cool component to the *Avacyn Restored* Prereleases and hope you’ll be as excited as we are. Stay tuned!
