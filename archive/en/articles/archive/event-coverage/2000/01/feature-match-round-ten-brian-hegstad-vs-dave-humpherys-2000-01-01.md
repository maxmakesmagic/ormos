![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/GPMON01/864.jpg)Humpherys comes into the match riding a consecutive winning streak at Grand Prix events that includes GP: Minneapolis and GP: Columbus, which he won with teammates Rob Dougherty and Darwin Kastle. Hegstad, a member of AlphaBetaUnlimited.com, has been a consistent performer on the pro circuit for the last 6 months but has yet to earn a title.


Both players come into the round with 7-2 records. A victory is required for either player to have a realistic chance at making top eight. Humpherys is playing a U-W-r deck sporting a lot of stall and board control elements. Hegstad has brought a fast B-U deck with weenies and removal, including the powerful blue enchantment [Chamber of Manipulation](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chamber+of+Manipulation), that he hopes will run over his opponent.


### Game One


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/GPMON01/865.jpg)Both players keep their hands and establish their mana bases quickly. Humpherys creates a wall of blockers early, playing a consistent stream of threats, including [Hallowed Healer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hallowed+Healer), [Blessed Orator](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blessed+Orator), [Angelic Wall](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Angelic+Wall) and [Cephalid Looter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cephalid+Looter). Many of these are met by Hegstad's removal spells, but the defense is enough to keep Hegstad from threatening with anything serious. By the mid-game Humpherys is sitting behind the Wall and Orator - which has been enhanced with [Psionic Gift](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psionic+Gift) - and Hegstad is sending a Wererat and [Aven Fisher](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aven+Fisher) into the Red Zone. The deadlock is broken when Hegstad sacrifices a [Seafloor Debris](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seafloor+Debris) to fill his graveyard enough to kill the Orator with [Ghastly Demise](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ghastly+Demise). He then adds a Looter of his own and starts swinging for the fence like Barry Bonds. Without the Orator things look pretty bleak for Humpherys. He stops the Rat with a [Kirtar's Desire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kirtar%27s+Desire), but Hegstad has added a [Gravedigger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gravedigger), [Dusk Imp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dusk+Imp) and [Chamber of Manipulation](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chamber+of+Manipulation). 


Cue the comeback. Humpherys uses [Embolden](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Embolden) to survive the turn, then drops [Mystic Zealot](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mystic+Zealot) and [Auramancer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Auramancer), returning the [Psionic Gift](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psionic+Gift) to his hand. Over the next couple of turn he adds [Cephalid Scout](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cephalid+Scout), [Pilgrim of Virtue](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pilgrim+of+Virtue) and [Chainflinger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chainflinger). He quickly reduces Hegstad's army to nothing and then goes to work on his life total. It's not long before Hegstad, who can't find a solution to the Tims and is mindfull of the clock, concedes to save some time for game two.

### Game Two


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/GPMON01/866.jpg)Only a few minutes remain in the match, and Hegstad's chances of earning a draw. Again both players keep their hands and start quickly. Hegstad busts out [Filthy Cur](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Filthy+Cur) and [Dusk Imp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dusk+Imp), going for the quick win. The Imp is removed by [Engulfing Flames](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Engulfing+Flames), only the second red card Humpherys has played in the match, but Hegstad continues to play out threats. Humpherys counters his opponent's quick army with a [Mystic Zealot](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mystic+Zealot) and a Looter. His [Chainflinger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chainflinger) is removed by [Patriarch's Desire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Patriarch%27s+Desire). Hegstad swings with an [Aven Fisher](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aven+Fisher) while trying to find a way through the Zealot. It finally comes in the form of [Ghastly Demise](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ghastly+Demise) and Humpherys drops to six. The following turn he is at two, but that is as close as Hegstad could push him as on his final extra turn he topdecks a [Pilgrim of Virtue](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pilgrim+of+Virtue) to hold off a Wererat and has [Syncopate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Syncopate) in hand for any threat Hegstad might muster on the last turn. Hegstad draws his card and extends his hand.
