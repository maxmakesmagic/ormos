If you're just getting here, you should know that we've been showing off some of the *Zendikar* basic lands this week. Monday was [Plains](/en/articles/archive/zendikar-plains-2009-08-10) and Tuesday was [Islands](/en/articles/archive/zendikar-islands-2009-08-11), and Wednesday had [Swamps](/en/articles/archive/zendikar-swamps-2009-08-12). Today is Mountains.

First, let's look at the ones that come in Intro Packs.

There are two more Mountains we're not showing you, because we like to keep some mystery in life. Tune in tomorrow, when we'll have two Forests!
