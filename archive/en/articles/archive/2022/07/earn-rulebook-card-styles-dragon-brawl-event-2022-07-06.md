*It gets tiring, you know . . . generation after generation of humans on quests to slay us. Ha! A mouse may rage, but the lion hears only squeaks. My kin, on the other claw, are much more worthy adversaries. I'm especially eager to test the mettle of Ziatora, a challenger from a plane called "New Capenna."* 


*To her I can only say: "It's time for a Dragon Brawl, Zi!"*
