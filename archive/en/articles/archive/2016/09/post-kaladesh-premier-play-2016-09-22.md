With *Kaladesh* Prereleases this weekend, it's almost time to start cracking some new booster packs to explore the world of *Kaladesh* Limited and the puzzle that is post-*Kaladesh* Standard.


With the official release of *Kaladesh* next Friday, the Standard Constructed format will go through a rotation, as *Dragons of Tarkir* and *Magic Origins* leave the format, and *Kaladesh* comes in. The new set also means a brand new Limited format, as the plane of madness, gothic horror, and many zombies shifts to a world of invention, bright colors, and lots and lots of cool combos and synergies.


Let's start off with what October will bring, and then look ahead to November.


October Premier Play
====================


The month of October kicks off with two *Kaladesh* Limited Grand Prix in London and Atlanta October 7–9. It's also the kickoff of a whopping seven weekends of live *Magic* video coverage, featuring live video at one event every weekend, starting with Atlanta and continuing all the way until the 2016 World *Magic* Cup.


The main event playmat for [Grand Prix Atlanta](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/premierplay/grandprix/fact-sheet-gpatl16) or [Grand Prix London](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/premierplay/grandprix/fact-sheet-gplon16) features art from the [Torch of Defiance *Magic* Story](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/magic-story/torch-defiance-2016-09-07). Details on how to receive these playmats can be found on the tournament organizer's Grand Prix web sites.

London and Atlanta will also be our first look into the competitive side of *Kaladesh* Limited. What pools are players looking to open? What sorts of draft strategies will spark the creativity of players at the Day Two draft tables? We'll bring you the latest analysis through our writer-reporters in London, and we will follow a little closer in Grand Prix Atlanta with live video coverage. The full team for this weekend is below:

Following the Grand Prix debut of the new set is [Pro Tour *Kaladesh*](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/premierplay/protour/ptkld) in Honolulu, Hawaii October 14–16. This will be the Standard proving grounds for all of the new cards, as well as a refinement of the Booster Draft environment. What strategies and combos will rise to the top of the tables at the end of this three-day tournament with $250,000 on the line for top finishers?


We'll be bringing you everything from Honolulu all three days on [twitch.tv/magic](http://twitch.tv/magic), along with updates on social media, articles, decklists, and a whole lot more. The full team is:

Premier Play in November
========================

While our writer-reporters bring you the latest stories and some sweet, sweet post-*Kaladesh* Modern decklists, the ChannelFireball video team will be bringing you live video coverage on [twitch.tv/channelfireball](http://twitch.tv/channelfireball) for those wanting to catch every round of action.


Next up after that is Grand Prix Rotterdam November 11–13, featuring some Team Limited right before the 2016 World *Magic* Cup. Players who compete in this main event receive one of these three playmats, with one of each going to each team that registers.

It would be little surprise if we see a ton of national teams there getting in some Limited reps before the big event. And you'll be able to follow along on [twitch.tv/magic](http://twitch.tv/magic) with live video!


The same, of course, can be said for the [2016 World *Magic* Cup](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/premierplay/2016wmc), which also takes place in Rotterdam November 18–20. Always a blast to cover. As we witness the action unfold in the feature match area, the World *Magic* Cup ignites some of the year's most exciting moments. You'll be able to watch all three days of the tournament on [twitch.tv/magic](http://twitch.tv/magic), with full coverage teams being revealed later next month.


November wraps up with [Grand Prix Chiba](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/premierplay/grandprix/fact-sheet-gpchi16), at Legacy main event taking place November 25–27. While pre-registration has already opened and closed (with a chance that some seats may open up closer to the event), all main event competitors will receive this playmat featuring the *Masterpiece Series* artwork from [Crucible of Worlds](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crucible+of+Worlds).

Coverage globetrotter Chapman Sim will be on-hand with the Japanese coverage team to bring you the latest from Chiba. While we will not have English video coverage, the Nico Nico team will be hard at work bringing the latest round-by-round content in Japanese to all viewers on that platform.


We've got an exciting two months ahead of you, and we'll revisit the November (along with December) as we get closer to that month!
