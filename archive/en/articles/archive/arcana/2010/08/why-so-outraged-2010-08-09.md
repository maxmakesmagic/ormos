Remember [a couple of weeks ago](/en/articles/archive/dryads-favorite-guy-2010-07-28) when we showed you that ***Magic** 2011*'s [Dryad's Favor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dryad%27s+Favor) contained a reference to ***Magic** 2010*'s [Borderland Ranger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Borderland+Ranger)? Well, today we've got another refugee from the previous core set.

Let's take a look at [Chandra's Outrage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chandra%27s+Outrage) (from a safe distance):

Something seems to have incurred her anger. And that something is ...

Aha! So *that's* why [Snapping Drake](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snapping+Drake) isn't in ***Magic** 2011*! Clearly Chandra burned it to the ground before it could take a card slot.
