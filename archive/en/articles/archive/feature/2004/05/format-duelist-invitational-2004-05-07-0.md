The preliminary rounds of the Duelist Invitational will be fifteen matches (best two out of three) with each player facing off against every other player once. The two players with the best record at the end of the fifteen rounds will meet in a three out of five duel final match. The fifteen rounds will consist of five different formats: three constructed and two limited. Each format will be used for three matches.


### Constructed Formats


You will need to construct the following three decks for the Invitational: 


1) **Standard** - The following sets will be used for this format: Fifth Edition, Tempest, Weatherlight, Visions, Mirage. This format will follow the banned list as of January 1, 1998.


2) **Extended, New York Style** - All decks for this format must contain at least four cards (in either the main deck or sideboard) from each of the following sets: The Dark, Fallen Empires, Ice Age, Homelands, Alliances, Mirage, Visions, Weatherlight, Tempest. This format will follow the banned list as of January 1, 1998.


3) **Mystery Constructed** - The following cards are legal in this format: Mirage, Visions, Weatherlight, and Tempest. In addition, all players must use one of the sixteen Vanguard cards. The decks must have sixty cards with no more than four of any card other than basic lands. Squandered Resources is banned in this format. (Players were only informed of this format three weeks before the event.)


### Limited Formats


For all limited events, the card mix will not be announced until directly before the event. Also, all limited events will have a forty card deck minimum size restriction. The following are the limited formats used at the 1998 Duelist Invitational:


1) **Duplicate** - All competitors will receive an identical card mix from which to construct their deck.


2) **Solomon** - This is a two player draft format. The players shuffle all the cards provided together. A randomly selected player then begins by flipping up eight cards from the top of the card pile. He divides the eight cards into two piles (the piles need not be of the same size) allowing the other player to chose which pile to draft. The two players alternate dividing and drafting until all the cards have been selected.
