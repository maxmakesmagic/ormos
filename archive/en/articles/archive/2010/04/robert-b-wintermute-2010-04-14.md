Robert B. Wintermute was born and raised in the Badlands of South Dakota. A writer by decree, a philosopher by design, and an engineer by decision, Wintermute has spent much of his adult life contemplating Bentham's panopticon as a model for modern society. Early investigations into orgone energy have given Wintermute a peculiar insight into the nature of mana. Experience raising a son and daughter with his wife in Madison, Wisconsin, has given him a peculiar glimpse into the nature of being. *Zendikar: In the Teeth of Akoum* is his first novel.

  || **1. Hero or Villain** | I'm not altogether sure there is a difference between these two when written right. |
| **2. Mac or PC** | Neither. A Commodore 64, or a light blue Lettera 32 Olivetti manual. |
| **3. Dog or Cat** | I would pick dogs for hosts if I were a visitor from another planet. |
| **4. Soft Candy or Hard Candy** | I should eat more of both. |
| **5. Cake or Pie** | Angel food cake, one of the most marvelous developments of modern chemistry. |
