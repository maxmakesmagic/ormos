Users who have been to the *Magic Online* Account Creation site in the past may have an old background image cached that's causing display issues. If you are experiencing display issues, holding Shift+F5 should resolve the problem.



Please note, if you had an account on a previous version of *Magic Online*, you can log on to the current version by using your old user name and password. All of your account's contents were moved over to the current version. If you forgot your password, you can learn how to retrieve it [here](https://accounts.onlinegaming.wizards.com/reset.aspx). If you've forgotten your user name, please contact Customer Service [here](http://company.wizards.com/contact-us).


To create a new account, go to the [Magic the Gathering Online webpage](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Digital/MagicOnline.aspx) and click on the create new account link.


The rest of the process is very self explanatory, however, feel free to use this guide for reference. If you enter information that's invalid or incorrect, a small error message will appear by the field that needs to be changed.

If you are not old enough to complete account activation, you must have a parent or legal guardian complete the account setup and activation process for you.


Once you've entered a birthdate, you'll be asked how much *Magic Online* experience you have. If you have never played *Magic*, we suggest learning by playing [*Duels of the Planeswalkers*](http://magic.wizards.com/en/game-info/products/duels-of-the-planeswalkers)!

Any other option will prompt you to continue with the sign-up process.

First, you'll be asked to enter your email address. Be absolutely sure your Email address is correct. If it's not, you'll need to contact Customer Service for assistance activating your account.

Next, you will need to pick a User Name or User ID.

Please read the [Naming Policy](http://wizards.custhelp.com/cgi-bin/wizards.cfg/php/enduser/std_adp.php?p_faqid=1357) to make sure the name you want is allowed. A box will appear on the field indicating if the desired name is available or not. If it is not, you'll have to pick another. Once you find a suitable name that is available, you will need to choose a password.

You will need to choose a password that is at least 7 characters long and contain at least one numeric, lower, and upper case character.


Once you have your password, you'll set a Security Question and Security Answer. Your security question answer should be something that cannot be easily guessed; you’ll need to make sure your answer’s something you can remember, as you will be asked for it when contacting Customer Service for assistance.

Remember that the purchaser of this account will be considered the account's owner. DO NOT PURCAHSE ACCOUNTS FOR YOUR FRIENDS.


Once you've entered the payment information, double check it for accuracy, then proceed to the next step.


To proceed, you'll complete a short test to confirm you're not a robot.
