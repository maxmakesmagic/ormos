Sunday, Sept 10: 2:44 p.m. - The Top 8 Player Profiles
------------------------------------------------------


**Jeroen Remie**


Jeroen is a player who doesn't need much introduction, he's one of the 5 pro's on the train who placed this year. His previous winnings include 3 Pro Tour top 8's, including winning 1, 3 Grand Prix to 8's and 4 Nationals top 8's, including winning one two year ago. He's also known for being the funniest pro player to use a saproling token.


Jeroen is playing the Dutch blue-green aggro deck that only 4 players played this weekend. Wessel Oomens told me to put his name in the coverage again, he finally designed a deck good enough to place 2 out of 4 players playing it into the top 8.


He isn't really confidant about his matchup (about 40-60), he thinks the most important card in the matchup is [Umezawa's Jitte](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Umezawa%27s+Jitte): "The one who draws Jitte wins."


If Jeroen could be a magic card, he would be a Spike Feeder.


**Rogier Maaten** 


Even though Rogier hasn't made a pro tour top 8 yet, he's known as one of the best players Holland has to offer. He has 3 Grand Prix top 8 and 3 nationals top 8's on his name, including winning the nationals in 2003.


Rogier is playing the deck he's been playing for almost a year now: Heartbeat combo. He tested the quarterfinal matchup against Kenji last night, and he thinks his odds are about 30-70.


**Jasper "Bongo" Bongaards**


Jasper is one of the three rising stars in this top 8, his best result so far is a 17th place at Grand Prix Hasselt.


He's playing a Snake/Glare deck, he netdecked a normal snake deck, and tuned it himself. He thinks his matchup is about 60-40.


**Frank Karsten**


Frank is another one of those players in the top who doesn't really need introduction. He got two Pro Tour top 8's, including a second place at last year's world championships, about 7 Grand Prix Top 8's, and is a feature writer for Wizards. this is the fifth time he's in the nationals top 8, and he's playing the deck he said he would play in his article a few weeks ago: Structure & Force (UWB [Counterbalance](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterbalance) control, the Japanese are even worse at making decknames than Wessel Oomens). He and Julien tested at Roel van Heerwijk's place, but Julien mana flooded each game they tested. Frank thinks the matchup is a little in Julien's favour in game 1, and a little in frank's favour after sideboarding.


If Frank could be a magic card, he would be a Krosan Cloudscraper (because of the Diek-factor.)


**Julien Nuijten.** 


Julien is probably became the most famous Dutch magic player ever when he won the world championships at the age of 15. Since then he showed us he's no one-day fly by making 5 Grand Prix top 8's, and of course placing for top 8 on the nationals this year. He's playing the Wessel deck (Go Anan is the best player.dec), and he already tested against Frank.


If Julien Nuijten could be a magic card, he would be a Dominating Licid.


**Jasper de Jong**


Jasper de Jong is mostly known in Holland for winning the Open Fries Championship (the only tournament that's more important to win than the nationals). Jasper also won 350$ on a Grand Prix by going 3-11 (he was in a team with Julien Nuijten and Roel van Heeswijk). He didn't play magic for half a year. He went to a FNM last week, where he played a snake deck with Ninja of the deep Hours. When he won a couple of games with just a Ninja and some counters, he decided to play Ninja-Erayo.


And if Jasper could be a magic card, he would be a Fraction Jackson.


**Robert v/d Medevoort**


Robert is also known as a player to watch the next couple of years, he played 3 Pro Tours in the last 2 years, and he already qualified for Pro Tour Kobe. He didn't test for the Quarter finals, but he did comb his hair.


If Robert could be a magic card, he would be a Predator Strike.


**Kamiel Cornelissen**


Kamiel has been on the train for a couple of years now, and he makes top 16 in almost every Pro Tour he plays. He got into the top 8 5 times, including 1 win, and he made about 6 Grand Prix top 8's. This is the second time he made top 8, and National Champion is about the only title yet to claim for him. He's playing a Sea Stompy deck he made by combining deck from the Japanese Nationals, and he thinks his chances in the Quarters are about 55-45.


If Kamiel could be a magic card, he would be a Brainstorm…
