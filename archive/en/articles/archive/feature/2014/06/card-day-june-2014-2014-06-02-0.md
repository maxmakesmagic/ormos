 Mike first played with Ice Age and became the copy editor for DailyMTG.com in December 2011. Before DailyMTG, he was an editor on D&D's Dragon magazine for four years. 









![Gods Willing](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Gods+Willing)
  
[Gods Willing](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gods+Willing) – *Theros*. From the art description: "Show Elspeth as she offers her sword to the gods at the Temple of the Gods. It's an epic moment when a planeswalker supplicates to the divine." 
 


![Worst Fears](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Worst+Fears)
  
[Worst Fears](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Worst+Fears) – *Journey into Nyx*. It is difficult to see at card size, but that tiny glowing figure in the center of the art is Elspeth surrounded, the art description helpfully informs, by "the forces of darkness and hatred bearing down on her. She stands alone among a throng of hellhounds, gorgons, and other monsters of the Underworld." 
 


![Pernicious Deed](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Pernicious+Deed)
  
[Pernicious Deed](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pernicious+Deed) – *Conspiracy*. English picked up *pernicious* in the early fifteenth century from Middle French, which took it from Latin's *perniciosus* ("destructive"), which in turn developed from *pernicies* ("ruin"). Both parts of the word almost certainly came from [Proto-Indo-European](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proto-Indo-European_language). *Per-* just meant "forward" or "through," but *necis* and its originator *nex* probably look familiar to **Magic** players, as they gave us [nausea](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=174915) and [necro-](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=382317), [for example](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=194977). 
 


![Grenzo's Rebuttal](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Grenzo%27s+Rebuttal)
  
[Grenzo's Rebuttal](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grenzo%27s+Rebuttal) – *Conspiracy*. We are perhaps more familiar with the legal and political form of *rebut*, meaning to contradict or refute, but that meaning traces back only to the early nineteenth century. Originally, rebut had a more violent meaning. From Old French through Middle English in the fourteenth century, it originally meant "to drive or beat back," or "to repulse." 
 


![Bite of the Black Rose](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Bite+of+the+Black+Rose)
  
[Bite of the Black Rose](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bite+of+the+Black+Rose) – *Conspiracy*. Short words that describe concrete, observable phenomena (like *bite*, *black*, and *rose*) tend to be pretty old. Both *bite* and *black* trace back easily via Old English and [Proto-Germanic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proto-Germanic_language) to [Proto-Indo-European](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proto-Indo-European_language). *Rose* traces back via Latin and Ancient Greek to Persian (which, in turn, might have taken it from [PIE](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proto-Indo-European_language)). 
 


![Ã†ther Tradewinds](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=%C3%86ther+Tradewinds)
  
[Æther Tradewinds](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=%C3%86ther+Tradewinds) – *Conspiracy*. [This Arcana](/en/articles/archive/%C3%A6ther-words%E2%80%A6-2014-03-21) explains *Æther*. *Trade wind* originated in the mid-seventeenth century. As explained by the OED (*Oxford English Dictionary*), it is "from the phrase *blow trade*," which means "blow steadily in the same direction." The OED continues: "Because of the importance of these winds to navigation, 18th-century etymologists were led erroneously to connect the word *trade* with 'commerce.'" 
 


![Custodi Soulbinders](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Custodi+Soulbinders)
  
[Custodi Soulbinders](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Custodi+Soulbinders) – *Conspiracy*. The Custodi were an order of priests who served King Brago. They unnaturally prolonged his life to preserve their own power, with [unintended consequences](http://www.wizards.com/magic/magazine/article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/ur/299). *Soul* has held its meaning since roughly Old English, which got it from [Proto-Germanic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proto-Germanic_language). *Bind* also has pretty consistent meaning all the way back to [Proto-Indo-European](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proto-Indo-European_language). 
 


![Sentinel Dispatch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Sentinel+Dispatch)
  
[Sentinel Dispatch](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sentinel+Dispatch) – *Conspiracy*. Dack Fayden, mentioned in the flavor text, is known as the greatest thief in the Multiverse. Fiora (the setting for *Conspiracy*) is his home plane. 
 
*Conspiracy* is now [in Gatherer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&set=+%5B%22Conspiracy%22%5D) and releases today! 





![Worldknit](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Worldknit)
