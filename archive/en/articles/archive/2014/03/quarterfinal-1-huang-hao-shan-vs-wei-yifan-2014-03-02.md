**Game One** 


After a trip to Paris, Huang found himself on the receiving end of [Thoughtseize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtseize), revealing that he had been forced to keep a one lander. After missing his second land drop, Huang bounced back with double [Sylvan Caryatid](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sylvan+Caryatid) and [Xenagos, God of Revels](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Xenagos%2C+God+of+Revels) but Wei was happy to suppress it with [Detention Sphere](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Detention+Sphere).


Xenagos took form as a planeswalker this time round and Huang seemed to be back in the game, generating a couple of tokens and adding Ghor-Clan Rampager to the board. Unfortunately, the efforts were all undone with an "end of turn" [Fated Retribution](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fated+Retribution) and Wei looked like he was firmly in control of the game, who proceeded to draw five cards off [Sphinx's Revelation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sphinx%27s+Revelation).


Soon after, each of Huang's threats were deftly maneuvered, one after another. [Thoughtseize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtseize) got rid of [Stormbreath Dragon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stormbreath+Dragon), [Syncopate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Syncopate) dealt with [Domri Rade](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Domri+Rade) and [Detention Sphere](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Detention+Sphere) locked down [Polukranos, World Eater](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Polukranos%2C+World+Eater).


When [Jace, Architect of Thought](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace%2C+Architect+of+Thought) flipped over another [Sphinx's Revelation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sphinx%27s+Revelation), it was enough to convince Huang to pack up his cards. There was no way he was beating another seven cards.

**Game Two**
Huang mulliganed again but managed to put up a strong start comprising [Sylvan Caryatid](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sylvan+Caryatid), [Xenagos, the Reveler](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Xenagos%2C+the+Reveler) as well as [Xenagos, God of Revels](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Xenagos%2C+God+of+Revels). Both cards started to generate a steady stream of Satyrs, with one of them becoming a 4/4 each turn.


When Huang summoned a potentially lethal [Ghor-Clan Rampager](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ghor-Clan+Rampager), Wei countered it with [Syncopate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Syncopate), before untapping to drop [Elspeth, Sun's Champion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elspeth%2C+Sun%27s+Champion). However, Huang was ready with another copy of the bloodrush creature, allowing his trio of Satyrs to trample past Wei's soldiers for the win.

**Game Three**
Although the gods were in his deck, they certainly weren't on his side as Huang proceeded to mulligan yet again. Wei used a combination of [Dissolve](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dissolve) and [Syncopate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Syncopate)s to counter Huang's [Domri Rade](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Domri+Rade), [Stormbreath Dragon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stormbreath+Dragon) and [Ruric Thar, the Unbowed](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ruric+Thar%2C+the+Unbowed).


The attrition tango started once again, and Wei proceeded to nullify each of Huang's threats almost rhythmically. [Thoughtseize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtseize) plucked away [Stormbreath Dragon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stormbreath+Dragon) from Huang's grip (again), and Chandra Pyromaster was rendered useless with [Pithing Needle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pithing+Needle). [Supreme Verdict](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Supreme+Verdict) swept the board clean, taking [Ghor-Clan Rampager](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ghor-Clan+Rampager) and [Elvish Mystic](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elvish+Mystic) with it.


With Wei sitting at ten lands, either of the [Sphinx's Revelation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sphinx%27s+Revelation)s in his hand would seal the deal for him. Refusing to concede, Huang lay in wait as he gradually got overwhelmed by [Jace, Architect of Thought](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace%2C+Architect+of+Thought) and [Elspeth, Sun's Champion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elspeth%2C+Sun%27s+Champion).

 **Wei Yifan defeats Huang Hao-Shan 2-1 on the back of his [Sphinx's Revelation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sphinx%27s+Revelation)s and advances to the semifinals.**
