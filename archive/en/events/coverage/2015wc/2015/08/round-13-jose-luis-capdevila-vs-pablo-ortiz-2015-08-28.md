Capdevila is an old-hand at Magic, a two time Chile national champion in ‘03 and ‘05 and subsequently a World Flagbearer those years. Capdevila also attended 3 Pro Tours in his Magic career. Ortiz, however, is relatively new to Magic, having played for four years, attending 3 GPs recently Top 8’ing World Magic Cup Qualifier.


**Game 1**


After an early traded of [Timberpack Wolf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Timberpack+Wolf) from Capdevila and [Nantuko Husk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nantuko+Husk) from Ortiz, the game quickly evolved into a battle of the 2/3s. Ortiz raised an undead army of [Shambling Ghoul](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shambling+Ghoul)s, while Capdevila managed a lone [Ramroller](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ramroller).


Ortiz used Nissa’s Pilgrimage to ramp up to six lands. Capdevila, however, was trapped on three lands. When Ortiz brought a [Skysnare Spider](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skysnare+Spider) out of the forests to support his zombie troops, Capdevila could see the writing on Charlotte’s Web. A turn later, still stuck for mana, Capdevila scooped it up.

*Jose Luis Capdevila hits a string of bad luck during Round 13.*


**Game 2**


Capdevila struck further bad luck with a mulligan to five. Clearly upset, he regained his composure, kept his new hand, and played a first turn [Evolving Wilds](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Evolving+Wilds), fetching a Forest.


The two made the same trade as first game, a [Timberpack Wolf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Timberpack+Wolf) for a [Nantuko Husk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nantuko+Husk). For the next two rounds Capdevila nuked whatever Ortiz played with double [Lightning Javelin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Javelin), using the scry ability to smooth his draws and minimise the effect of his mulligan.


Ortiz was not to be slowed down. Again, he found his [Skysnare Spider](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skysnare+Spider), this time following it up with a [Priest of the Blood Rite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Priest+of+the+Blood+Rite) and its pet Demon. Capdevila couldn’t find an answer for the two big finishers and was finished.
