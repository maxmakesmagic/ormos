Carlos Romão and Frank Karsten are currently second and fourth in the standings, respectively, and drafted next to each other at table one before Round 10. In fact, they both ended up drafting the Dimir Guild, a fact that should favor Romão since he was passing to Karsten in packs 1 and 3. Karsten is splashing red for [Viashino Fangtail](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Viashino+Fangtail) and [Galvanic Arc](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Galvanic+Arc), while Romão has only blue and black.


Karsten is a solid player with a recent top 8 in Nagoya, while Romão is a former World Champion who would undoubtedly love to grab another shot at the title. They played each other two rounds previous and ended up with a draw.


### Game 1


(Romão white, Karsten blue)




|  |  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **#** | **Attacks** | **Blocks** | **Results** | **RL** | **KL** |
| 3 | [Golgari Thug](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Golgari+Thug) | None | Romão gets in for an early point. | 20 | 19 |
| 4 | [Golgari Thug](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Golgari+Thug) | None | Another point. | 20 | 18 |

| 6 | [Halcyon Glaze](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Halcyon+Glaze) and [Stinkweed Imp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stinkweed+Imp) | None | Karsten absorbs another five. | 20 | 9 |
| 6 | [Snapping Drake](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snapping+Drake) | None | Romão declines a trade and takes the three. | 17 | 9 |
| 7 | [Halcyon Glaze](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Halcyon+Glaze) and [Stinkweed Imp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stinkweed+Imp) | [Snapping Drake](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snapping+Drake) on Stinkweed | [Clutch of the Undercity](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Clutch+of+the+Undercity) sends the Glaze back to Karsten's hand and [Snapping Drake](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snapping+Drake) trades with Stinky. | 17 | 9 |
| 8 | [Cerulean Sphinx](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cerulean+Sphinx) | None | Romão takes five damage from the Sphinx. | 12 | 9 |
| 9 | [Dark Confidant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dark+Confidant) | None | Karsten could block with [Nullstone Gargoyle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nullstone+Gargoyle) but chooses to leave Romão with the Confidant. | 12 | 7 |
| 9 | [Cerulean Sphinx](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cerulean+Sphinx) and [Nullstone Gargoyle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nullstone+Gargoyle) | [Stinkweed Imp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stinkweed+Imp) on [Nullstone Gargoyle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nullstone+Gargoyle) | The creatures trade. | 7 | 7 |
| 10 | [Snapping Drake](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snapping+Drake) | [Snapping Drake](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snapping+Drake) | The two Drakes trade. | 7 | 7 |
| 12 | [Cerulean Sphinx](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cerulean+Sphinx) and [Tidewater Minion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tidewater+Minion) (both unblockable from [Ethereal Usher](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ethereal+Usher)) | None | [Disembowel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Disembowel) on the Minion keeps Romão alive. | 2 | 7 |
| 12 | [Belltower Sphinx](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Belltower+Sphinx), two [Stinkweed Imp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stinkweed+Imp)s, [Golgari Thug](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Golgari+Thug), [Tattered Drake](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tattered+Drake) and [Vedalken Entrancer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vedalken+Entrancer) | None | Romão clears out the only blocker with a [Darkblast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Darkblast) and sends in a ragtag Dimir team for the win. | 2 | 0 |

Romão applied some early pressure with a [Halcyon Glaze](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Halcyon+Glaze) (cast through a [Terrarion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Terrarion), since he only had one [Island](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island)) but Karsten put a stop to that with [Clutch of the Undercity](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Clutch+of+the+Undercity). The Dutch player then took control of the skies with [Cerulean Sphinx](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cerulean+Sphinx). Romão summoned [Dark Confidant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dark+Confidant), which surprised Karsten, who commented, "Risky business…uh, yep." He attacked Romão to 12 and then used [Tidewater Minion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tidewater+Minion) to power out a turn-eight [Nullstone Gargoyle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nullstone+Gargoyle).


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/worlds05/fm11_romao.jpg)*Romao, the 2002 World Champ, was moving up the leaderboard.*
Romão revealed an [Island](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island) with the Confidant and dredged a [Stinkweed Imp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stinkweed+Imp) that traded with the Gargoyle. This allowed him to [Peel from Reality](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Peel+from+Reality) Karsten's Sphinx and his own Confidant, a fine play since he was at a precarious 7. When Romão added [Belltower Sphinx](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Belltower+Sphinx) and a new [Stinkweed Imp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stinkweed+Imp), it looked like he had the game locked up, as he also had a [Vedalken Entrancer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vedalken+Entrancer) that was slowly grinding away at Karsten's library.


That is, until Karsten summoned an [Ethereal Usher](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ethereal+Usher). With two cards left in his deck, he activated it on [Tidewater Minion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tidewater+Minion) and re-activated on [Cerulean Sphinx](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cerulean+Sphinx), then attacked with both for the potential win. Romão had the [Disembowel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Disembowel) though, and was able to take down the Minion to stay at 2, then untap and dig with card drawing for his [Darkblast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Darkblast). He took down Karsten's only blocker and killed him with damage.

(Romão white, Karsten blue)




|  |  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **#** | **Attacks** | **Blocks** | **Results** | **RL** | **KL** |
| 3 | [Roofstalker Wight](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Roofstalker+Wight) (with flying) | None | Two damage to Romão. | 18 | 20 |
| 3 | [Golgari Thug](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Golgari+Thug) | None | One back to Karsten. | 18 | 19 |
| 4 | [Roofstalker Wight](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Roofstalker+Wight) | [Stinkweed Imp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stinkweed+Imp) on the Wight | The creatures trade. | 18 | 19 |
| 5 | [Snapping Drake](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snapping+Drake) | [Snapping Drake](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snapping+Drake) blocks | The two Drakes trade. | 18 | 19 |
| 7 | [Stinkweed Imp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stinkweed+Imp) | None | Stinky sneaks in for a point. | 18 | 18 |
| 7 | [Mausoleum Turnkey](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mausoleum+Turnkey) (unblockable) | None | Karsten uses [Ethereal Usher](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ethereal+Usher) to send in Turnkey for 3. | 15 | 18 |
| 8 | Two [Stinkweed Imp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stinkweed+Imp)s | None | Romão hits back for two. | 15 | 16 |
| 8 | [Mausoleum Turnkey](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mausoleum+Turnkey) (unblockable) | None | After combat Karsten played [Galvanic Arc](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Galvanic+Arc) on a [Roofstalker Wight](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Roofstalker+Wight) and targeted Romão. | 9 | 16 |
| 9 | [Mausoleum Turnkey](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mausoleum+Turnkey) (unblockable) | None | Another three to Romão. | 6 | 16 |
| 10 | [Mausoleum Turnkey](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mausoleum+Turnkey) (unblockable) | None | The [Ethereal Usher](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ethereal+Usher) has been quite the all-star this game. | 3 | 16 |
| 11 | None | None | [Clutch of the Undercity](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Clutch+of+the+Undercity) on a [Stinkweed Imp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stinkweed+Imp) finishes Romão off. | 0 | 16 |

The early turns consisted of trading creatures, but when Karsten followed up with [Mausoleum Turnkey](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mausoleum+Turnkey) and [Ethereal Usher](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ethereal+Usher), Romão struggled to keep up. The Usher was huge this game, as was as a key play where Karsten transmuted for [Consult the Necrosages](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Consult+the+Necrosages) and knocked a [Disembowel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Disembowel) out of Romão's hand. [Mausoleum Turnkey](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mausoleum+Turnkey) returned a [Roofstalker Wight](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Roofstalker+Wight) and also just kept coming across for three a turn, with Romão unable to stop the damage. [Clutch of the Undercity](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Clutch+of+the+Undercity) finished things off.

### Game 3


(Romão white, Karsten blue)




|  |  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **#** | **Attacks** | **Blocks** | **Results** | **RL** | **KL** |
| 3 | [Golgari Thug](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Golgari+Thug) | None | The traditional early Thug damage. | 20 | 19 |
| 4 | [Stinkweed Imp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stinkweed+Imp) | None | And some Imp damage for good measure. | 20 | 18 |
| 6 | [Stinkweed Imp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stinkweed+Imp) | None | Romão is getting nowhere fast… | 20 | 17 |
| 6 | [Snapping Drake](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snapping+Drake) | [Surveilling Sprite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Surveilling+Sprite)s blocks | The Sprites are happy to jump in front and exchange themselves for a card. | 20 | 17 |
| 7 | [Viashino Fangtail](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Viashino+Fangtail) and [Surveilling Sprite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Surveilling+Sprite)s | None | Having cleared Romão's board, Karsten begins the assault on Romão's life total. | 16 | 17 |
| 8 | None | None | Romão takes a point from a [Tidewater Minion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tidewater+Minion), untapping the Fangtail. | 15 | 17 |
| 8 | None | None | [Clutch of the Undercity](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Clutch+of+the+Undercity) targets Romão's [Stinkweed Imp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stinkweed+Imp) and he promptly concedes the game. | \* | 17 |

What the attacks don't show you is that Karsten had a turn-three [Viashino Fangtail](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Viashino+Fangtail) followed by a turn-four [Tidewater Minion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tidewater+Minion). Romão's hand wasn't helped by the fact that his [Golgari Thug](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Golgari+Thug) jumped back on top of his library when it died, and whatever semblance of board position he had crumbled quickly thereafter. The final straw came when Romão cast [Compulsive Research](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Compulsive+Research) and chose to dredge [Darkblast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Darkblast), then watched the [Disembowel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Disembowel) that he would have drawn fall right into the graveyard. He conceded on Frank's next turn.


Final Score  

Frank Karsten 2, Carlos Romão 1
