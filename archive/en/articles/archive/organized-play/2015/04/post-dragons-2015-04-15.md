Pro Tour *Dragons of Tarkir* has come and gone, and left in its wake are some big stories: a Pro Tour champion, and a ton of Standard decks that got over a hundred players 18 match points or better. In case you missed those, we've got those decklist articles compiled for you at the bottom of today's Organized Play. However, before we get to that…

Game Day!
=========



Don't forget! *Dragons of Tarkir* Game Day takes place this weekend. [Game Day](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/event-types/gameday) events take place the weekend following the Pro Tour.

Regional Pro Tour Qualifiers—Next Weekend
=========================================



Also on the horizon is the very first round of Regional Pro Tour Qualifiers (RPTQs). This round qualifies the top finishers of each [RPTQ for Pro Tour *Magic Origins*](http://magic.wizards.com/en/protour/rptqvan15): if an RPTQ is 128 or fewer players, then it qualifies the Top 4 finishers. If an RPTQ is 129 or more players, then it qualifies the Top 8 finishers. Players who qualify for the Pro Tour via an RPTQ also receive a [travel award](http://magic.wizards.com/en/content/travel-award-faq).



However, that's not the only thing players in RPTQs receive. Every player who competes in an RPTQ receives a [Liliana of the Veil](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Liliana+of+the+Veil) promo card, as well as one of these event-exclusive deck boxes.

Regional Pro Tour Qualifiers are an invitation-only event. Silver status players in the Pro Tour Players Club are invited to compete, as well as winners of Preliminary Pro Tour Qualifiers (PPTQs) during the qualifying round. If you missed out on this first round, and you're like to compete in the next round of Regional Pro Tour Qualifiers, then [find a PPTQ near you](http://magic.wizards.com/en/protour/pptqmil15) and see if you can qualify!

The Flashback
=============



Last weekend, Pro Tour *Dragons of Tarkir* brought out the inner winged death of the world's best competitors. Dragons were cast, things were scorched, and in the end, it was Martin Dang of Denmark who stood tall at the end of the weekend, roasting everyone in his path with the power of little red creatures and the deadly Atarka's Command.
