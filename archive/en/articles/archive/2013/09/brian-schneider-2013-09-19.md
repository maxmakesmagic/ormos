I did a lot of thinking on which factors to take into account for each candidate.


**Total Performance**: **60%** (Includes PT Points, Median Finish, the Type 1 Pro Tour, Juniors, Masters, Euros, Nationals and Years in the Money)


**Contribution to the Game: 25%** (Writing, Personality, Organizing Tournaments, Running a Store, Editing a Magic Site, Fun for the Community, Integrity, Fame, Deckbuilding)


**Experienced Player Vote**: **15%** (I polled 13 long-time followers of the Pro Tour including Ben Bleiweiss, Seth Burn, Jeff Donais, Nathan Heiss and Pat Chapin and included their votes with mine)
