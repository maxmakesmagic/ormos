A new home for the Weekly Announcements Blog
Did you notice anything different about this week's Announcement Blog? That's right, we're on the new site now! Why make *Magic Online* players scour the internet to gather the latest *Magic Online* news? Starting today, you can find our weekly articles and blogs right here on [MTGO.com](mtgo.com).


Our content schedule remains the same, so keep checking the site on Mondays for new articles and Tuesdays for Announcement Blogs!





Wide Beta Update
There is only a week left before the current version of *Magic Online* is disabled on July 16 and the Wide Beta becomes the only version available. As we prepare for release, we have another large update releasing tomorrow, July 9, that includes several requested features and as well as additional memory and stability fixes. Here are the highlights.


Trade continues to improve with another batch of updates, including adding a quantity indicator on cards that are both in your trade partner's binder and in your collection and some fixes for issues that could cause collection display issues after completed trades. When using the Search Tool to compare your Wish List or deck list to your partner's trade binder, a special filter will apply to show only the cards that are that list.

For game play, we've updated the player info box in the Duel Scene to be clearer, including a larger life total. We've also added a more robust confirmation process for dropping from events to prevent accidental withdraws from tournaments with entry requirements. Finally, we've fixed the converted mana cost sort so that it no longer adds new CMCs to the right of the existing piles.


![](http://www.wizards.com/mtg/images/digital/magiconline/blog_7-8-2014_img2.png)
Help has been updated to include a quick overview of many of the most common features of the new version of *Magic Online*. This basic help, along with our series of [transition articles](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/getting-to-know-your-magic-online-client), will get you started on your adventure with the new client.


For more help, check out the existing [tutorial videos](http://magic.wizards.com/en/gameinfo/products/magiconline/whatismagiconline).


Refer to the [change log](#changelog) below for the full list of updates. For more information on the transition to the new client, be sure to check out Executive Producer for Magic Online [Worth Wollpert's recent article](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/magic-online-v3-date-and-new-client-update-2014-06-26).





Transition to New Client Article Series
Many of you have probably been guests in someone else's house before. It's a weird experience. You might say, "I've been looking for hours, it's dark out now, and I still can't find the light switch," shortly before tripping over a stool, or perhaps a small animal. You're not sure which it is; it's too dark. The new client is similar — nice, but disorienting until you figure out where everything is.


To help players get accustomed to some of the new features, and changes to existing features, we're running a series of articles that bring out the "fun" in "client fundamentals." Each day, one of our experts will walk players through a different aspect of the client. We hope the series provides players with some direction while they get to know their new client.


Head over to [the series directory](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/getting-to-know-your-magic-online-client) for the series schedule and links to published articles.
