M**agic Online** is fun. That's a bold statement but we stand behind it. There's **Magic** happening any time of the day or night, and it looks like [this weekend](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/digital/magiconline.aspx?x=mtg/digital/magiconline/calendar#082510) is no exception. There are premier events in formats from ***Magic** 2011* Sealed to Standard, Extended, and even Classic!

There's also the [**Magic Online** Championship Series VIII](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/magazine/article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/other/121509a) tournament. The weekend is just packed!

But we're not here to tell you about all those tournaments. No, we're here to tell you about the **Magic Online** Newsletter, which is a newsletter you could be getting that contains personalized information on how to become a better **Magic** player.

Each issue contains your Qualifier Points for the current season's Championship Series, your **Magic Online** Player Rewards Points, and your lifetime boosters won. And then it gets interesting! The game can't tell you what card you should be drafting, but it *can* tell you, for example, which ***Magic** 2011* commons you're drafting less than everyone else. You can use that to directly tune your draft skills! If everyone else is letting a particular common go later than you're taking it, maybe you can start taking it sixth instead of fourth! For example.

Because we love trivia (who doesn't?), each newsletter also comes with something like "Top first picks from 8-4 M11 draft winners." The answer, if you're curious, is [Doom Blade](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Doom+Blade).

If you're currently a **Magic Online** player and you're not receiving the newsletter, you're missing out. Here's what you need to do: in **Magic Online**, open your Personal Settings (Off the "Menu" button, choose the "Settings" submenu) and click on "Mailing List Opt-In." It's worth it!
