Isn't it great that there are new cards in core sets now? Why, just check out [Warstorm Surge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Warstorm+Surge) here:

![Warstorm Surge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Warstorm+Surge)  
That's some handsomely lightning-filled Raymond Swanland art, and it merits a closer look.

One of the neat things about a card making its debut in a core set is that the art can show a plane that isn't the setting for an entire block. And the flavor text of [Warstorm Surge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Warstorm+Surge) contains a reference to its plane:


> *"Listen to the roar! Feel the thunder! The Immersturm shouts its approval with every bolt of lightning!"*

Remember *Planechase*? Remember, specifically, [Immersturm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Immersturm)?

![Immersturm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Immersturm)  
The Immersturm is on the plane of Valla. Here's a closer look!

Yeah, that looks like the sort of place that would have a [Warstorm Surge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Warstorm+Surge). We'd love to claim that [Warstorm Surge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Warstorm+Surge) is actually depicted inside the art of [Immersturm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Immersturm), but instead we'll just have to pretend that it's taking place just out of the frame.
