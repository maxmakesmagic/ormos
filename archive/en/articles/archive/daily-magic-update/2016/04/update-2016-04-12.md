The Daily *Magic* Update is a roundup of everything *Magic* you should know on April 12, 2016. Today's Update is brought to you by [Frank Lepore](#lepore). Because he's everywhere.


Today's Must
============


1. [The 10 Most Overrated Cards in *Shadows over Innistrad* Limited](http://www.channelfireball.com/articles/the-10-most-overrated-cards-in-shadows-over-innistrad-limited/) | ChannelFireball | Pascal Maynard

We're just starting to understand *Shadows over Innistrad* limited, but Pascal Maynard already has some of the set's most overrated cards ready for us in list form. I'd like to add [Sanitarium Skeleton](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sanitarium+Skeleton) to that list—assuming anyone but me thought that card was great. Which they don't. So maybe you should just listen to Maynard, especially with three Grand Prix approaching this weekend in [Albuquerque](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/premierplay/grandprix/fact-sheet-gpabq16), [Beijing](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/premierplay/grandprix/fact-sheet-gpbei16), and [Barcelona](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/premierplay/grandprix/fact-sheet-gpbar16), all featuring the *Shadows over Innistrad* Limited format.


And while you're checking out Pascal's Limited article, you might as well read [Neal Oliver's primer on the enemy color archetypes in the format](http://www.channelfireball.com/articles/shadows-over-innistrad-draft-archetypes-enemy-colors/) as well, also on ChannelFireball. I mean, you're already there.


After That, Read, Watch, or Listen to These
===========================================


1. [Rocket Jump Double Dip—Command Zone AND Masters of Modern](http://www.rocketjump.com/)

Over at Rocket Jump, we've got two podcasts for the price of, well, also two podcasts. They're all free people.


First up is The Command Zone's [The Gitrog Monster / Self Expression in Deck Building](http://www.rocketjump.com/listen/the-gitrog-monster-103) with Jimmy Wong and Josh Lee Kwai. In this episode, they take everyone's favorite Frog Horror and work through a deck-building exercise, and talk about what it means to put a bit of yourself into your deck.


Next is Masters of Modern from Alex Kessler and Ben Bateman, talking Modern brews with *Shadows over Innistrad* cards in an episode appropriately titled [Sweet New Brews: Werewolves, Zombies, Thopters, Oh My!](http://www.rocketjump.com/listen/sweet-new-brews-werewolves-zombies-thopters-oh) Actual Werewolf content may vary.


1. [Top 8 Decks from the first Tournament of *Shadows over Innistrad* Standard!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJPIQQOk-dw) | Strictly Better MTG

As far as I can tell, this is the first lengthy analysis posted about the Top 8 of the [StarCityGames.com Baltimore Open](http://www.starcitygames.com/events/090416_baltimore.html) from this past weekend. Here, Strictly Better MTG goes through all eight decks, discussing their strengths and weaknesses.


Second place for discussing the weekend's results looks like it goes to Mark Nestico on StarCityGames.com itself, where he runs through [the weekend's winners and losers](http://www.starcitygames.com/article/32747_Week-One-Winners-And-Losers.html).

1. [PureMTGO's Pauper Day](http://puremtgo.com/)

It's Pauper Day on PureMTGO, with a whopping four articles about the most common of formats. To wit:


* [Part two of a Pauper review of *Shadows over Innistrad*](http://puremtgo.com/articles/writer-adept-standard-pauper-review-shadows-over-innistrad-part-two) by Gwyned
* [An Elves tutorial video](http://puremtgo.com/articles/pauper-elf-video-tutorial) by Adrian Grey Marsden
* [Mono-Black Devotion](http://puremtgo.com/articles/mono-black-even-more-devotion) by Anthony Davis
* [An Inside Out decklist](http://puremtgo.com/articles/league-play-playing-inside-out-pauper) by Joshua Claytor

As a bonus, Gathering Magic's Alex Ullman also wrote a Pauper article today on [Value and Devotion](http://www.gatheringmagic.com/alexullman-041216-value-and-devotion/), all about mono-black decks.


That should fulfill your weekly Pauper articles quota all in one sitting. Be sure to pace yourself. Stretch before reading. Hydrate. Pauper League will wait.


1. [Writing for Werewolves](http://www.gatheringmagic.com/anttessitore-041216-writing-for-werewolves/) | Gathering Magic | Ant Tessitore

For you Vorthoses out there, Ant looks at what makes Werewolves and other double-faced cards so freakin' cool—double the art, double the flavor text, double the card names.


1. [Liliana Corrupting Avacyn?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7qexzujI7Y) | SeibenMTG

Seiben has a lot of theories about what's corrupting Innistrad, and his latest is—well, it's perfectly reasonable. Could Liliana be behind the corruption? Maybe Nahiri and Liliana are working at cross purposes? Is the Chain Veil involved?


I don't know, I just work here. He's the one with the YouTube channel. Listen to his thoughts.

What People Are Talking About
=============================


1. > 
> "Extensive digital experience," are the words that stuck out in the announcement of the new WOTC CEO Chris Cocks. <https://t.co/zQHNXRNzLd>
> 
> 
>  — Saffron Olive (@SaffronOlive) [April 11, 2016](https://twitter.com/SaffronOlive/status/719616528749039617)

It was announced yesterday that current Wizards of the Coast President Greg Leeds would be stepping down from the post he's held for eight years, making way for Chris Cocks to transition from Microsoft to heading up Wizards of the Coast. We love Greg Leeds, but we've heard nothing but good things about our incoming President. We can also confirm [he is not Emrakul](https://twitter.com/ninox_morpork/status/719648990929625088).


The important thing? He's a *Magic* and *Dungeons & Dragons* player. My new goal is to play against him in an employee Prerelease. Will report back.


1. [Maro explains Goldnight Castigator's power and toughness](http://markrosewater.tumblr.com/post/142667594703/why-is-goldnight-castigator-a-49-rather-than-a?)

This is only the second time Mark Rosewater has ended one of his Tumblr posts with the phrase "mike drop." I checked.


Community Spotlight
===================


1. [FrankLepore.com](http://www.franklepore.com/)

It was inevitable. Frank Lepore, budding media mogul. He's a longtime content creator, Pro Tour Top 8 competitor, and now owns a website that bears his name and links to his content all around the *Magic*-sphere. Everything from Modern Monday on [NumotGaming](http://www.numotgaming.com/) to [ChannelFireball](http://store.channelfireball.com/landing) to [Freshly Brewed](http://freshlybrewed.libsyn.com/freshly-brewed-episode-36-shadows-set-review-part-2-and-modern-bannings), this site has all of your Frank Lepore needs. Because it's not just raining anymore—it's le-pouring.


1. [So Many Insane Plays](http://mtgcast.com/mtgcast-podcast-shows/active-podcast-shows/so-many-insane-plays/so-many-insane-plays-podcast-episode-52-shadows-over-innistrad-and-banned-and-restricted-list-updates) | Kevin Cron and Steve Menendian

The self-proclaimed longest-running Vintage strategy podcast (and they're very likely right about that) tackles *Shadows over Innistrad* and the restriction of [Lodestone Golem](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lodestone+Golem) in their latest podcast. The Vintage community was up in arms about the restriction, and Cron and Menendian dive deep on the ramifications.


Deck of the Day
===============


1. [Gitrog Jund Midrange](http://sales.starcitygames.com/deckdatabase/displaydeck.php?DeckID=100715)

[The Gitrog Monster](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=The+Gitrog+Monster) Day was last week, but I'll allow a little bleed over until this week. Like Christmas, [The Gitrog Monster](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=The+Gitrog+Monster) Day only comes once a year, so people tend to celebrate it all month long. It's really becoming way too consumer-driven for my tastes. I just want to get back to the true meaning of [The Gitrog Monster](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=The+Gitrog+Monster) Day. Like this deck.


Darryl Donaldson wasn't the only player to bring Gertie to the StarCityGames.com Open in Baltimore last weekend, but they were the highest finishing. And there were some cool things going on, even if [Molten Vortex](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Molten+Vortex) wasn't one of them.


First [Mina and Denn, Wildborn](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mina+and+Denn%2C+Wildborn) offer a sizeable body and a second way to drop more lands into play. That can help set up [Sylvan Advocate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sylvan+Advocate)s to get bigger faster, as well as powering the Tireless Tracker engine in the deck.


Next, the deck goes heavy on planeswalkers, playing four different named 'walkers and eight copies total. Coupled with a heavy removal suite, this Jund deck looks poised to protect its planeswalkers.


The deck looks like it could be slow out of the gates, especially in a Human-heavy metagame, leaning on [Radiant Flames](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Radiant+Flames) to catch back up. But the sideboard can fix that with more Flames and more [Languish](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Languish), if need be. I also like the look of more [Pulse of Murasa](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pulse+of+Murasa)s and [Goblin Dark-Dwellers](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Dark-Dwellers) for all of the value.
