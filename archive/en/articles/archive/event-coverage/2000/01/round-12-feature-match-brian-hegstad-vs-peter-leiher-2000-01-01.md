Leiher started off fast with a Llanowar Elf, and played a turn two Fires of Yavimaya. Hegstad stayed back on three untapped lands, and Absorbed a Blastoderm. On the following turn, Leiher made a 3/3 Elephant with Battery, which resolved and attacked. At the end of the turn, Hegstad played Fact or Fiction, revealing two Islands, two Dismantling Blow and a Coastal Tower. One pile was two Islands and a Blow, and the other was Coastal Tower and a Blow, and Hegstad took the three-card pile.


On Leiher's next turn, he played a Chimeric Idol, which resolved. All the creatures attacked, and the Idol was destroyed with Dismantling Blow. Hegstad continued to sit back on untapped mana, ready to react to Leiher's threats. A Flametongue Kavu was played, and Hegstad responded with another Fact or Fiction. The piles presented were Foil, Millstone and two Accumulated Knowledge, Plains- Hegstad took the three card pile. He then untapped and played Wrath of God.


Leiher started to rebuild by playing a Bird, and then playing a damage source in Flametongue Kavu, which was Absorbed. Leiher did not play a threat on the following turn, and Hegstad played two Accumulated Knowledge on end step. He then untapped, and played a Millstone. Leiher had two Ports running, and used them on Hegstad's end step to tap down some lands. He played Shivan Wurm, which was Absorbed. Hegstad continued to build up his defense with Story Circle on Green. Leiher played a Red source of damage the following turn in Flametongue Kavu, but it was countered with Foil.


At this point, Leiher had only two cards in hand, and Hegstad was in a comfortable position sitting behind Story Circle and a lot of cards. This situation became even better when he cast Fact or Fiction on Leiher's next end step, which was broken down into piles of Accumulated Knowledge/plains and Dismantling Blow/Counterspell/island. Hegstad took the two-card pile, which contained a Knowledge for three cards. A second Story Circle was soon played on Red, which made the game practically unwinnable for Leiher. A second Millstone soon followed, and Leiher eventually conceded.

### Game 2


Leiher played first, and mulliganed his opening hand. He kept the next one, and opened with a Forest and no one-drop. He then played a Port, tapping down Hegstad's Adarkar Wastes on upkeep. This allowed him to cast Chimeric Idol on the following turn without fear of a counterspell. Hegstad tapped out for a Story Circle on the next turn, and the Idol started to go to work in the Red Zone. A Burst was played on the next turn, and countered. Yet another Burst followed on turn six, and it was countered as well. Hegstad was having problems with the Idol, but things got even worse when Leiher played a Kavu Chameleon, which could dodge the Story Circle as well.

With Hegstad at four, Leiher put four mana into his pool during his attack step, and played Boil, which was countered with Foil. Hegstad saw that he still had no answer for the Idol, and scooped.

### Game 3


Hegstad went first time, and Leiher once again mulliganed his opening hand. Leiher played a turn two Port, tapping down one of Hegstad's lands on upkeep. Chimeric Idol was then played on his turn, and it resolved. A Llanowar Elf came out on the following turn, and Leiher chose not to attack. Instead, he tapped down one of Hegstad's three Islands on upkeep. During his next turn, he tapped another, and Hegstad responded with Dismantling Blow on the Idol. However, this allowed Blastoderm to pass through countermagic. Hegstad had the answer on the following turn in Story Circle, but Leiher used his Port and an attack to tap Hegstad out. This allowed Hull Breach to resolve and destroy the Circle.


Still trying to grab control of the game, Hegstad, played Mageta, the Lion. Blastoderm then came through for five damage, and was followed up by Saproling Burst. Leiher tried to make Saproling tokens, but Hegstad destroyed the Burst with a kicked Dismantling Blow. The Blastoderm got through for another five points of damage, and a second soon joined it. On the next upkeep one Blastoderm faded away, but the second attacked, prompting Hegstad to activate his Mageta, discarding Wrath of God and Plains. With Hegstad tapped out, Leiher was able to sneak yet another Blastoderm through countermagic.


When it attacked on the following turn, Hegstad did not activate Mageta, and went down to five life. On end step, Hegstad cast Fact or Fiction. The piles presented were Disenchant, Coastal Tower, and two Plains, with Gerrard's Wisdom in the other pile. Hegstad took the pile of four. With time running down, Leiher pointed out that the pace of the game had thrown him off, as he forgot to play a land and also neglected to Port down Hegstad on upkeep.

It was killed off with Mageta, and Hegstad played Tsabo's Web, which would nullify Uncle Pete's two Ports once they became tapped. On Hegstad's end step, Leiher tapped two lands and played Hull Breach of the Web, but did not realize that it was a sorcery. This resulted in a warning from the judge for misrepresentation. With two mana floating, he Ported down Hegstad once and took a point of mana burn. The Hull Breach was played and resolved on Leiher's turn, and was followed up by Chimeric Idol. At this point, time was called.


Dismantling Blow with kicker was now played on the Idol, and Mageta got to work on the task of dealing enough lethal damage before time ran out. Leiher asked if Hegstad had a counter, and was shown three. Mageta attacked and brought Leiher down to one life point on the last turn, and asked "Would you like to concede since you're at one life point and I have a hand filled with cards and control of the game?" Leiher turned down the offer, and the match ended in a draw.


**Final Result:** Hegstad 1 - Leiher 1


After receiving all the facts about the game, the head judge felt that the time taken while dealing with Leiher's illegal play of Hull Breach significantly affected the outcome of the match, and upgraded the penalty to a game loss. The match ended as a 2-1 victory for Hegstad.
