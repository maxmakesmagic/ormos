Director of R&D Aaron Forsythe has been having a tough time this weekend. After winning his very first match on Friday by [Tooth and Nail](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tooth+and+Nail)ing in [Progenitus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Progenitus) â€“ Aaron has gone winless through his next 7 rounds.
