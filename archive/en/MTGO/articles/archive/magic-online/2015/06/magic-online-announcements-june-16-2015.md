**Reimbursement Policy Update**


Our last *Magic Online* Reimbursement Policy update was back in October. If you missed it, you can find Robert Schuster's write-up on it [here](http://magic.wizards.com/en/MTGO/articles/archive/reimbursement-policy-update-2014-10-27). Since then, we've been listening to customer feedback and re-evaluating the best way to serve *Magic Online* players. Increased transparency is a priority for the *Magic Online* team, so we want to share the thinking behind some changes we’ve put together for the reimbursement policy update that we'll be rolling out with the Wednesday, June 17, Magic Online deployment.

**Qualify for the *Dragons of Tarkir* Championship**


You might not be able to become a [Dragonlord](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?action=advanced&name=+%5BDragonlord%5D&type=+%5B%22Legendary%22%5D) and rule the skies of Tarkir, but you can become a champion who rules at *Dragons of Tarkir*! The *Dragons of Tarkir* Championships are coming up on *Magic Online*.


Some might say (a Dragonlord might say) that Constructed is more of a celebration than a mere format, an elaborate 60-card dance meant to show off Dragons in their purest form. Perhaps you disagree and wish to bring an unequivocally worse deck (a non-Dragon deck) to the Qualifiers. Please join us for the [*Dragons of Tarkir* Standard Championship Qualifiers](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/magic-online/dragons-tarkir-championship-events-2015-04-13#strdqualifier) starting on Wednesday, June 17, 12:30 p.m. Pacific where you can sign up for a slot in which your deck can be put to task by one containing more Dragons than yours. Standard Qualifiers run every three hours, on the half hour, through Tuesday, June 23, 9:30 p.m. Even if you're not able to win your first time out, participation in any Qualifier Event will net players a full-art promo version of [Scaleguard Sentinels](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scaleguard+Sentinels), a glorious card that is, like all things, better with Dragons. Four or five wins in any Qualifier earns you an invitation to the Finals!
