![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/activity/simulator.jpg)Welcome back to the Booster Draft Simulator, now with the ***Magic** 2012* Core Set! Practice your ***Magic** 2012* drafting skills right here every week by participating in a Booster Draft against seven AI drafters, powered by the collective intelligence of **Magic**'s R&D department.

 When you're done with your draft, you can compare your picks with other readers in the Forums. Think you can draft a better deck? Want to know what would happen if you made a different first pick? You can keep drafting against the same pool all week and see how your picks change from strategy to strategy.

And each Monday we’ll add in a whole new set of packs to practice with. When you’re ready hit the Draft Now button below, and after you’re done make sure to use the thread link to post your deck, discuss the draft, and learn even more!
