It's a good day to be Tsuyoshi Fujita. The father of modern Japanese **Magic** is sitting in a huge tie for third place at thirty points. A win means he can intentional draw into the Top 8. Everyone just assumes it's going to happen. Everyone, that is, except amateur Ichiro Shimura. He's gunning for a place of his own.

Shimura opened with [Battlefield Medic](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Battlefield+Medic), and then attacked it right into Fujita's waiting [Vitality Charm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vitality+Charm). Fujita made a secret guy and passed it back, but Shimura had no answer. That let Fujita reveal [Haunted Cadaver](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Haunted+Cadaver) and strip all but two cards from Shimura's hand. He had four land in play, with two more, [Misery Charm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Misery+Charm), [Pacifism](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pacifism) and [Prowling Pangolin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Prowling+Pangolin) in hand. 

Shimura kept [Prowling Pangolin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Prowling+Pangolin) and [Pacifism](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pacifism), rather than the fifth land to cast it. His decision was punished with a [Cruel Revival](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cruel+Revival) waiting for him. He had [Pacifism](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pacifism) for Fujita's [Elven Riders](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elven+Riders), but there weren't any lands forthcoming. Fujita played out a pair of morphs. Shimura matched them with one of his own. He tried to trade, but the one he'd blocked waas [Snarling Undorak](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snarling+Undorak). He made a [Severed Legion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Severed+Legion) and tried again, only to be foiled by a cycled [Primal Boost](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Primal+Boost). His [Gustcloak Harrier](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gustcloak+Harrier) finally managed to trade.

But not before they had helped power up Fujita's [Stag Beetle](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stag+Beetle). Shimura drew swamp, and decided to make the Pangolin. Fujita showed him [Cruel Revival](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cruel+Revival), and they were on to game two.

Fujita 1 - Shimura 0

Shimura opened with Medic again in the second game, but Fujita had no forest to threaten [Vitality Charm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vitality+Charm). However, Shimura's draw was slow with no third turn play. Fujita made a morph, and swung into Shimura's next play of [Dive Bomber](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dive+Bomber). Shimura bit, and of course Fujita had the [Vitality Charm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vitality+Charm) to finish the Bomber. 

Shimura rebuilt with [Daunting Defender](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Daunting+Defender), and his Medic was [Swat](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swat)ted. [Thrashing Mudspawn](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thrashing+Mudspawn) threatened to rule the table. Shimura answered it expertly with [Nantuko Husk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nantuko+Husk) and [Disciple of Grace](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Disciple+of+Grace). Fujita dropped a giant [Stag Beetle](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stag+Beetle), but Shimura had [Pacifism](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pacifism). [Festering Goblin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Festering+Goblin) made blocking the incoming Defender and Husk a bad idea. Fujita started to eat damage. He bought time with [Wirewood Herald](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wirewood+Herald), searching out a twin for the following turn.

Shimura kept hammering. The second Herald blocked the Husk, and the Mudspawn blocked the Defender, forcing Shimura to eat the Goblin. [Cruel Revival](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cruel+Revival) Before damage took care of the Defender. Fujita got a [Wellwisher](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wellwisher) and then played it and a morph on his turn. Shimura played [Frightshroud Courier](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Frightshroud+Courier).

Fujita swung with his morph. Terrified that it might be [Haunted Cadaver](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Haunted+Cadaver), Shimura blocked with his Courier. Fujita turned over [Snarling Undorak](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snarling+Undorak). Shimura hit it with [Cruel Revival](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cruel+Revival) on his turn, getting back his Goblin to pave the way for the Husk. Fujita trumped with [Krosan Groundshaker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Krosan+Groundshaker). Shimura swung again and traded his Disciple and Goblin for it. [Misery Charm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Misery+Charm) got back his [Daunting Defender](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Daunting+Defender).

But now Shimura was out of gas. He held back. Fujita busted out [Elven Riders](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elven+Riders) and started swinging. Shimura started to draw land. Four in a row, in fact. Fujita hit a bit of a glut, too, but he had the advantage. He drew a card that made him consider his next move, but he decided that he had to risk the game, since Shimura clearly had nothing for so long. Down came [Mythic Proportions](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mythic+Proportions), turning the Riders lethal. Shimura showed his hand of lands, and scooped.
