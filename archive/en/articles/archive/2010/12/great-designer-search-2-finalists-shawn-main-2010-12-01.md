After figuring out the blight mechanic for the first challenge, there was a temptation to wrap everything in Wodotha around it. Because Blight was only going to work in black with small doses in red and green, blue needed to be subtle. I considered themes of counter manipulation and gating as a means of curing blighted creatures, but playtesting showed that blue wasn't doing anything on its own, only being tricky with black cards. The question quickly became: "How does blue respond to the end of the world?" Many mechanics were considered, playtested, and rejected.


The breakthrough moment came after contemplating what the world of Wodotha might look like: small bands of survivors, fleeing blighted lands, driven into conflict with their neighbors. Mechanically, this brought me to the assault mechanic. There was often an air of desperation to the combat it set up, which felt very appropriate and it played well, even in blue, even against blight. I imagine assault to be a central mechanic in each color. I toyed with the idea of "battle plan" assault enchantments like Zendikar's quests or assault spells like Worldwake's landfall instants, but both had a complexity that felt inappropriate for first set commons.


Once assault was in place, a minor tapped-creatures-matter theme was brought back into blue to represent its on-the-ground scholarship and to ensure blue would play distinctly from other colors.
