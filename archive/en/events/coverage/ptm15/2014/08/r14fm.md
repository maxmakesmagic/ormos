What's a seat at the World Championship worth? For the Hall of Fame player and No. 20 Ranked Play William Jensen, it was worth defeating his teammate, No. 5 Ranked Player Owen Turtenwald, on his march to an 11-0 start. Playing at perfection is one way to get there, and so far he had lost just once: the King of the Hill seat at the switch to Constructed. With the Top 8 near his grasp, Jensen fought for every match point he could find to ensure he'd make the cut for the biggest tournament of the year.


For Patrick Cox, Top 16 would mean maintaining his Gold level status in the Pro Players Club. However, his trend up to the match was aiming much higher: Coming into the round at 11-2 meant he could make Top 8 with a series of wins. Gold status might be what he needed most, but a Top 8 and potential win would earn him so much more.



**The Decks**




 Jensen was playing one of the most consistent decks of the weekend: White-Black Midrange. Gaining share of the metagame overnight, the deck is built to kill creatures, planeswalkers, and anything else opponents might throw their way as they build up an army of [Pack Rat](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pack+Rat)s or [Blood Baron of Vizkopa](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Baron+of+Vizkopa)s. [Elspeth, Sun's Champion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elspeth%2C+Sun%27s+Champion) put a cap on most games, ensuring they can finish by going big, wide, or both as needed. Its one fault is, perhaps, how slow it can begin games by relying on it's suite of removal to give it time to set up.




 Cox's deck was something of his own specialty. "I've been playing white aggro variants since Pro Tour *Theros*," he explained. "I was testing it then, and played it in several Grand Prix. I went from Boros to Orhzov, but when they printed [Mana Confluence](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Confluence) so I decided to try green. Since all the creatures cost double colors I couldn't play [Mutavault](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mutavault) anymore, but Josh Utter-Leyton," the 4th-ranked 2013 Player of the Year and Cox's teammate, "suggested I splash red for [Ghor-Clan Rampager](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ghor-Clan+Rampager). Naya was already a deck so it's really an amalgam of that and a white weenie approach: You can hit them for a ton of turn 4 with it if they tap out."



Filled with small, efficient creatures, Cox's plan was to be as fast a possible. It seemed like the only way to overcome the wall of White-Black's inevitability.





*No. 20 Ranked Player William Jensen may have his sights set on a Pro Tour Top 8, but Patrick Cox isn't willing to give up a win that easily, especially with a need for Pro Points to achieve Gold and a fire to Top 8 as well.*
