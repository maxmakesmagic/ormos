**Invitation Source**: Winner, Pro Tour Philadelphia  
**Lifetime Pro Points**: 113  
**Professional Magic Accomplishments**:


* Pro Tour Philadelphia 2011 Champion
* National Champion / Top Pro on Italy national team at 2012 World **Magic**  Cup

### Player of the Year Top 10s: 0


### Pro Tour Top 8s: 1


* 2011: Pro Tour Philadelphia, 1st

### Grand Prix Top 8s: 2


* Milan 2011: 3rd
* Malmo 2012: 7th

### National Team Appearances: 2


* 2009: 41st
* 2012: 39th

Even in a game like **Magic** that is constantly shifting and raising the bar, the game has only so many firsts. The first World Champion (Zak Dolan), the first Pro Tour Champion (Michael Loconto) and the first Player of the Year (Olle Råde) are forever part of **Magic**'s history. Thanks to his victory at Pro Tour Philadelphia, Samuele Estratti has secured his own place among **Magic**'s firsts as the first winner of a Pro Tour featuring the newly created Modern format, cutting a swath through the competition with his take on Splinter Twin.


It wasn't, however, Estratti's first dog and pony show. Estratti has represented Italy on the national team twice now, including this year as the nation's top pro at the World **Magic** Cup. He currently stands third on Italy's all-time Pro Points list with 113, but could easily move into second place this season with just 17 additional Pro Points. He has a ways to go to catch Antonio De Rosa's 269 lifetime points, but at just 25 years old, there's little doubt Estratti is capable of doing just that. And a win this weekend would give him another incredible first—first winner of the **Magic** Players Championship.
