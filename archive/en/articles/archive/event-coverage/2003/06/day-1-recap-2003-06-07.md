 Brian David-Marshall is a New York–based game designer who has been involved with Magic since 1994, when he started organizing tournaments and ran a Manhattan game store. Since then, he has been a judge, a player, and one of the longest-tenured columnists on DailyMTG.com, as he enters his second decade writing for the site. He is also the Pro Tour Historian and one of the commentators for the Pro Tour. 






Neil Reeves was still grumbling about the Angel of Mercy that cost him a match against Don “The Governor” Paul. You’ll have to forgive him though he doesn’t have anything else to gripe about. At 8-1 he is alone atop the day one standings with a the Build a Better Mousetrap Trophy bound for his mantle.

Neil Reeves 8-1 - Mousetrap Champion  
 Aaron Rzepka 7-2 - MQ Champion  
 Jeff Taylor 6-3  
 Bryan Lyons 6-3 - 4-Way Solomon Champion  
 Don Paul 6-3  
 Trent Boneau 5-4  
 Jonathan Pechon 5-4

No other players managed a better than .500 record including early favorite Dave Williams who ended the day with a disappointing 0-3 in the MQ format. He has had Bob Maher Jr and a team of experts working on his decks for the “Your own set of rules” format and was pretty optimistic about pulling out a 6-0 in the two exciting constructed formats that awaited the competitors for Sunday.
