Day 2 Coverage
==============



 Posted in **Event Coverage**
 on August 21, 2010 










![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration//mtg/images/daily/events/gernat10/sat_close.jpg)Eight names remain in the bracket for Sunday morning. Eight men will enter the battle enclosure where honor and prizes are won. Four, two, then one will remain. And Germany will have a new National champion. The planeswalker crown will pass on from the reigning National champion Sebastian Thaler to one of them.


We have seen a rise of talent and prowess to the top of the standings. While Germany's recent Pro Tour champion Simon Görtzen and the current Rookie of the Year Lino Burgold did not feature prominently in the final standings, two players repeated their Top 8 appearance from last year's tournament: Tobias Gräfensteiner and Florian Pils have proven their prowess once more.


Among the rest, Jörg Unfried, Dennis Johannsen and Daniel Gräfensteiner know how being under the lights feels, be it at Nationals or (in case of Gräfensteiner) at the Pro Tour. Their decks are a diverse mix of different strategies, although two Jund decks slipped through the cracks between all the new-fangled combo decks enabled by Zendikar and M11.


Join us when we meet again in Aschaffenburg to find out who will become Germany's National Champion 2010!

Saturday, 10:50 a.m. – An angelic presence at the artist's booth
----------------------------------------------------------------


*by Hanno Terbuyken*

Volkan Baga is one of the more recent additions to ***Magic***'s art portfolio. The 32-year-old artist mostly works within the confines of traditional oil painting and has a penchant for fantastic themes and pieces. He came to the ***Magic*** fold in 2006 and was the one to create the alternate artworks for Alpha's Moxen, to be given away as prizes at the Vintage Championship. His work can not only be found on ***Magic*** cards, but also on book and magazine covers. We posed five short questions to Volkan. Here are his answers.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration//mtg/images/daily/events/gernat10/artist_volkan_baga.jpg)**What kind of ***Magic*** card would you like to create artwork for?**


There is this expansion set that I especially liked and that did fulfill all of my wishes so far: Shards of Alara. It was the most beautiful set that I have worked on yet, because Wizards specifically asked for something picturesque. What I do like most is depictions of humans, particularly angels, my favorite subject matter.


**How important is the artwork on the cards for the players that you meet?**


It is important, sometimes even very important for them, I feel. There are many kinds of people coming to me, but mainly those who admire the artwork and respect the artist.


**What are your favorite ***Magic*** artworks that you did?**


[Elspeth, Knight-Errant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elspeth%2C+Knight-Errant) and [Stoic Angel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stoic+Angel).


**What is your favorite ***Magic*** artwork that another artist did?**


I am a big fan of Donato Giancola. His work is very pictorial, too, and I had the pleasure to be his studio assistant for a while. I don't have single cards in mind, but a number of artists. Donato, of course, with his traditional artistic style. Then there are many artists who work digitally, like Michael Komarck, who I admire. And there's Justin Sweet, who does both, digital illustrations as well as traditional paintings.


**Do you prefer painting creatures or abstract artworks like spells?**


I prefer painting humans by far. But I have to say this: When I have painted many human figures in a row, I feel a desire to work on some sort of creature. It's a game of saturation for me. The same goes for illustrations with a positive feel: After one too many, I sometimes need to paint something more negative, something darker,.


  


Feature Match Round 9: Carsten Schäfer vs. Mike Hofmann
-------------------------------------------------------


*by Hanno Terbuyken*

With the first round of the second draft in the books, the players at the top of the standings can already catch a whiff of top 8 air. But before rejoicing, they will have to take both their draft decks and their Standard decks through the paces once more. Two of these hopefuls on Saturday morning were Mike Hofmann with just a single loss and undefeated player Carsten Schäfer, who came to the table with a 7-0-1 record. The decks these two had drafted were nearly diametrally opposed. Whereas Schäfer relied on black-red, Hofmann set his hopes on a blue-green specialty.


### Game 1:


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration//mtg/images/daily/events/gernat10/rd9_carsten_schaefer.jpg)*Carsten Schäfer*
Schäfer dominated the early turns, with [Crystal Ball](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crystal+Ball) making sure that he wouldn't run out of useful things to do just yet. [Reassembling Skeleton](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reassembling+Skeleton), [Child of Night](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Child+of+Night) and [Viscera Seer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Viscera+Seer) threatened to become a major attack force. However, Hofmann retaliated with [Ice Cage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ice+Cage) and made good use of his [Gargoyle Sentinel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gargoyle+Sentinel) to drop Schäfer to 17 before Doomblade dismissed the Gargoyle.


Hofmann put the pressure on with water servant and [Awakener Druid](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Awakener+Druid), taking Schäfer to 13 with the aid of an animated [Forest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest). Schäfer had a Servant of his own, this one a [Fire Servant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fire+Servant), and [Child of Night](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Child+of+Night)s [Lifelink](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lifelink) ability kept him level with Hofmann at 15 life each.


Schäfer scryed for action. He found [Act of Treason](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Act+of+Treason), commandeered Hofmann's [Water Servant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Water+Servant) and came in for a whooping nine points of damage. Hofmann, however, decided to put his [Prized Unicorn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Prized+Unicorn) in the way of Schäfer's [Fire Servant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fire+Servant) and saved the Unicorn and killed the Servant with [Giant Growth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Giant+Growth). That left the battlefield wild open for a retaliatory attack that Schäfer, on 13 life, promptly scooped to.


Mike Hofmann 1 – 0 Carsten Schäfer


### Game 2:


Hofmann mulliganed on the draw and Schäfer had a dream start with turn two [Child of Night](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Child+of+Night) and turn three [Barony Vampire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Barony+Vampire). [Chandra's Outrage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chandra%27s+Outrage) dispatched Hofmann's [Gargoyle Sentinel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gargoyle+Sentinel), and quickly Hofmann was down to 11 life. [Sword of Vengeance](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sword+of+Vengeance) didn't prevent him falling to 6, and even on turn five, Hofmann failed to produce anything. Schäfer scryed with [Crystal Ball](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crystal+Ball), played [Fire Servant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fire+Servant), attacked unhindered and Hofmann fell to 1. He drew nothing of any value and shuffled up for game 3.


"Without creatures, even the most beautiful sword is useless," Hofmann sighed. Schäfer had demonstrated how much pressure a Limited deck can exert on an opponent if it simply draws everything on curve and cue. He simply left Hofmann no time to draw into anything.


Mike Hofmann 1 – 1 Carsten Schäfer


### Game 3:


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration//mtg/images/daily/events/gernat10/rd9_mike_hofmann.jpg)*Mike Hofmann*
Once again, Hofmann started with a mulligan, but this time – on the play – he was the first to drop some points of power, with [Gargoyle Sentinel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gargoyle+Sentinel). Schäfer answered with [Barony Vampire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Barony+Vampire) and [Crystal Ball](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crystal+Ball), while Hofmann had [Water Servant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Water+Servant) and the board looked almost exactly like game one. This time, though, Schäfer had [Assassinate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Assassinate) und [Combust](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Combust) to clear the board, which left Hofmann with no choice but to play a lonely [Prized Unicorn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Prized+Unicorn) next turn.


Schäfer summoned [Vulshok Berserker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vulshok+Berserker) to the battlefield and hastily attacked Hofmann from 17 down to 11. The double dip of removal had cost Hofmann five turns of development, and he was on the ropes, his hands shaking nervously as spectators gathered around the feature match area.


[Cultivate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cultivate) gave Hofmann two [Island](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island)s to pay for [Cloud Elemental](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloud+Elemental), but he fell to 5 regardless from Schäfer's next attack. [Liliana's Specter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Liliana%27s+Specter) joined Schäfer's ranks and Doomblade killed Hofmann's Elemental. Then, Hofmann drew [Sword of Vengeance](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sword+of+Vengeance) to enhance his lonely [Prized Unicorn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Prized+Unicorn), hoping for that to draw him out of the quagmire. Schäfer wasn't about to let that happen: [Act of Treason](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Act+of+Treason) took the Unicorn away and Hofmann was left defenseless and dead.


Mike Hofmann 1 – 2 Carsten Schäfer


  


Saturday, 11:50 a.m. – Draft Signals: See How Things Go Wrong
-------------------------------------------------------------


*by Hanno Terbuyken*

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration//mtg/images/daily/events/gernat10/draft_denis_sinner.jpg)*Denis Sinner*
Denis Sinner had a hard time in draft. Seated in draft pod two, his opponents were formidable. His draft emphasized how signalling can be a two-edged sword. Signalling is essentially the art of letting your draft neighbours know what you are drafting without explicitly telling them, because that would be against the rules.


So Denis kicked off with a first-pick [Serra Angel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Serra+Angel) and passed [Blinding Mage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blinding+Mage) and [Assassinate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Assassinate) to the left. Denis continued with [Doom Blade](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Doom+Blade), [Corruption](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Corruption) and – crucially – [Cloud Crusader](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloud+Crusader) as fourth pick. What Denis could not know was that Dennis Johannsen, sitting to Sinner's right, had also started the draft in white, with [Elite Vanguard](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elite+Vanguard) as first pick, [Knight Exemplar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Knight+Exemplar), and then Warlord Axe over the very same [Cloud Crusader](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloud+Crusader) that Sinner would take as fourth pick.


Sinner took that as a signal that white was open for him, but did not receive any more significant white in pack two. However, in the second booster, Sinner continued with the white strain, getting [Squadron Hawk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Squadron+Hawk), [White Knight](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=White+Knight) first and second. As third pick, he took [Nether Horror](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nether+Horror) and passed both [Siege Mastodon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Siege+Mastodon) and [Honor of the Pure](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Honor+of+the+Pure) to Dennis Johannsen, but scooping up [Day of Judgment](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Day+of+Judgment) as fifth pick.


So while Sinner had successfully cut off white to his left, Dennis Johannsen was still firmly entrenched in white. The result: In the third booster, Sinner only got the dregs of white that Johannsen had left over. Granted, that included a seventh pick [Cloud Crusader](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloud+Crusader), but Johannsen picked up [Squadron Hawk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Squadron+Hawk), [Serra Angel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Serra+Angel), [Assault Griffin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Assault+Griffin), [Blinding Mage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blinding+Mage), [Assault Griffin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Assault+Griffin), [Mighty Leap](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mighty+Leap), and [Elite Vanguard](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elite+Vanguard).


Arguably, Johannsen signalled badly in the first booster by letting the [Cloud Crusader](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloud+Crusader) through, and Sinner can be said to have made a similar mistake by letting the [Honor of the Pure](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Honor+of+the+Pure) through to Johannsen. It is the typical situation in a draft: Two players in the same colors right next to each other will always, often unknowingly, fight over the same cards. In this case, both decks got worse, so make sure to watch for those signals!


  


Saturday, 12:00 p.m. –

There are many ways to exit a ***Magic*** tournament. Being late in the morning for day two at Nationals is one of them, but even worse is a forced exit via Rules Avenue.


The draft is one of the times when players have even more chances to get themselves disqualified. Pro Tip: Keep your eyes to yourself! Because peeking into another player's picks is a really bad idea, as one Nationals player now knows quite well.


"We clearly saw that he moved his head and saw the cards of his draft neighbour," explained head judge Michael Wiese. Two judges and the head judge concurred that this particular player was looking where he shouldn't have looked. "That is enough for a disqualification, because it is cheating." The full name for the infraction is Cheating – Hidden Information Violation.


While discovering secrets is fun, it is explicitly forbidden in ***Magic***. What is supposed to stay unknown must stay unknown. But how can you pervent this, for example if your draft opponent holds his cards in a way that makes it impossible for you not to look?


Hopefully, you know the answer: Call a judge! "The judges are there to help you. Raise your hand, call "Judge!" and tell him that you don't want to see anything but your own cards," advises Michael Wiese.


And he has another helpful tip: Don't lie to a judge. That is one of the most common reasons for a disqualification. Whenever something happens and there is a judge call involved, stay truthful! "We (almost) always find out if someone has lied to us," is the judge's consensus, and let me tell you, I've seen it happen more than once. Even if you know you did something wrong: Call a judge and let them know. "The penalties are not as tough as players think," says Wiese.


Not everything you do wrong by accident will automatically lose you the game. Especially if your story is true. A lie goes around the world before truth even has her boots on – but the lie will land you smackdab in the middle of trouble, because you cannot steer where it goes. So stay honest – it makes your life easier, and your ***Magic*** tournaments far less likely to end prematurely!


  


Saturday, 1:35 p.m. – Draftviewer
---------------------------------


*by Tobias Henke*

Something which might be interesting to everyone: The folks over at [planetmtg.de](http://planetmtg.de) have covered one complete draft, all boosters and all pick of all players at the table. Among them Grand Prix–Prague champion Jan Schmidt, the runner-up from GP–Lyon Tobias Gräfensteiner, Worlds quarterfinalist Florian Pils, and PT–Berlin quarterfinalist Denis Sinner.


Here is the link: <http://www.planetmtg.de/articles/artikel.html?id=5533>


There, you'll first find a schematic view of the draft table as seen from above. Clicking on one of the player names will then direct you to that player's draft. Below each pack, there is a left and a right arrow, which link to that very same pack, as the respective neighbor saw it before (or after). This way you can not only follow the draft from the perspective of one player, but also follow one booster pack around the table.


  


Feature Match Round 10 – Florian Pils vs. Jan Schmidt
-----------------------------------------------------


*by Tobias Henke*

Both players are 1-1 in this draft and need a win to stay in contention for Top 8. Pils had draftet green-white with a splash of red, Schmidt was bringing a solid blue-black control deck to the feature match area.


Pils had [Sacred Wolf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sacred+Wolf) as his first creature, Schmidt had [Liliana's Specter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Liliana%27s+Specter). The creatures traded in combat, while Pils reloaded with a 3/3 [Protean Hydra](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Protean+Hydra). [Wall of Frost](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wall+of+Frost) for Schmidt took care of the Hydra and his [Quag Sickness](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Quag+Sickness) dispatched Pils's [Blinding Mage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blinding+Mage). But Pils wouldn't let go. He summoned [Spined Wurm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spined+Wurm), then [Serra Angel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Serra+Angel).


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration//mtg/images/daily/events/gernat10/rd10_pils.jpg)*Florian Pils*
"Infinite fatties," Schmidt complained.


"Infinite fatties," echoed Pils and smiled.


Schmidt tried to stop the bleeding. First, [Harbor Serpent](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Harbor+Serpent) provided some fat for himself, then [Diabolic Tutor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Diabolic+Tutor) came up with [Corrupt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Corrupt), which shot down the [Serra Angel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Serra+Angel).


The board was stable now, but whereas Pils was completely out of gas, Schmidt's deck only started rolling: a second [Harbor Serpent](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Harbor+Serpent), [Foresee](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Foresee), and [Royal Assassin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Royal+Assassin) elicited a sigh from Pils: "How am I supposed to ever get through this?"


Soon after, Schmidt's own offense showed up: a [Cloud Elemental](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloud+Elemental) and another, and finally [Nightwing Shade](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nightwing+Shade). The fliers quickly wrapped things up.


Florian Pils 0 – 1 Jan Schmidt


The second game started with [Infantry Veteran](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Infantry+Veteran) for Pils and [Augury Owl](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Augury+Owl) for Schmidt. Then a series of quick trades commenced: [Awakener Druid](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Awakener+Druid) (or rather the awakened [Forest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest)) traded with [Assassinate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Assassinate), [Spined Wurm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spined+Wurm) met [Cancel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cancel), [Blinding Mage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blinding+Mage) got stuck under [Ice Cage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ice+Cage), and [Garruk's Packleader](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Garruk%27s+Packleader) got [Mana Leak](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak)ed.


This exchange of cards left the board predominantly... well, empty. So, when finally Pils found a seventh land and cast [Gaea's Revenge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gaea%27s+Revenge), the game was over in two turns.


Florian Pils 1 – 1 Jan Schmidt


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration//mtg/images/daily/events/gernat10/rd10_schmidt.jpg)*Jan Schmidt*
Unexpectedly, it was Schmidt who went for some early beatdown in the final game. [Augury Owl](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Augury+Owl) and [Liliana's Specter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Liliana%27s+Specter) got in for a couple of damage. Pils had his first drop in the form of [Garruk's Packleader](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Garruk%27s+Packleader) on turn five. However, [Serra Angel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Serra+Angel) on turn six turned the game right around, and now Schmidt was on the back foot. [Garruk's Companion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Garruk%27s+Companion) drew Pils another card, while Schmidt used [Diabolic Tutor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Diabolic+Tutor) in a desperate attempt to find something that was, apparently, not in his deck.


With [Garruk's Packleader](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Garruk%27s+Packleader) running hot, Schmidt was in big trouble already, but when [Gaea's Revenge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gaea%27s+Revenge) showed up once again, he wasn't anymore. He just picked up his cards.


Florian Pils 1 – 1 Jan Schmidt

Feature Match Round 12 – Sebastian Thaler vs. Max Pritsch
---------------------------------------------------------


*by Tobias Henke*

Both players were right at the edge of contention. With scores of 8-3, just one more loss ment certain elimination. Pritsch won the die-roll and had to mulligan. Thaler was happy with his draw and the reason soon became obvious, when he first shot down Pritsch's [Birds of Paradise](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Birds+of+Paradise) with [Burst Lightning](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Burst+Lightning), then killed [Fauna Shaman](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fauna+Shaman) via [Lightning Bolt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt), all the while [Ponder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ponder)ing through his options (and his deck, of course).


More [Ponder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ponder) and [Preordain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Preordain) followed, while Pritsch was stuck on two lands. Still, Thaler was missing the centerpiece of his deck, [Pyromancer Ascension](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyromancer+Ascension), and couldn't really capitalize. Even with [Foresee](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Foresee) the former Rookie of the Year couldn't find the elusive enchantment.


By turn six, Pritsch had a third land and summoned [Knight of the Reliquary](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Knight+of+the+Reliquary). Another [Lightning Bolt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt) took care of that and a second [Foresee](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Foresee) finally foresaw [Pyromancer Ascension](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyromancer+Ascension). As they tend to do, the Pyromancer ascended, a [Time Warp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Time+Warp) was copied and Pritsch decided to shuffle it up for game two.


Sebastian Thaler 1 – 0 Max Pritsch


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration//mtg/images/daily/events/gernat10/fm12Pritsch.jpg)*Max Pritsch*
In the second game, Pritsch's first play was [Fauna Shaman](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fauna+Shaman), which Thaler sent back with [Into the Roil](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Into+the+Roil) and, when recast, sent to the grave with [Lightning Bolt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt). [Bloodbraid Elf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodbraid+Elf) stuck to the battlefield, as did the [Cunning Sparkmage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cunning+Sparkmage) the Elf cascaded into. Another [Fauna Shaman](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fauna+Shaman) led to another [Bloodbraid Elf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodbraid+Elf) led to another [Cunning Sparkmage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cunning+Sparkmage), and Thaler soon succumbed to the beats.


Sebastian Thaler 1 – 1 Max Pritsch


With a potential Top 8 berth on the line, both players kept solid seven-card hands. Thaler played first and gunned down [Noble Hierarch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Noble+Hierarch) with [Spawning Breath](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spawning+Breath), then took care of [Fauna Shaman](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fauna+Shaman) with [Lightning Bolt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt). Next Pritsch summoned [Qasali Pridemage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Qasali+Pridemage), Destroyer of all things [Pyromancer Ascension](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyromancer+Ascension). (At this point the reporter took a little peek into Thaler's sideboard. Sure enough, all Ascensions were enjoying a breather on the sidelines.)


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration//mtg/images/daily/events/gernat10/fm12Thaler.jpg)*Sebastian Thaler*
Pritsch made [Bloodbraid Elf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodbraid+Elf) and, with its help, [Knight of the Reliquary](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Knight+of+the+Reliquary). Thaler cast [Ponder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ponder) and didn't like what he saw. He shuffled, drew a card, looked at it in astonishment, and cast the topdecked [Polymorph](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Polymorph). His measly Eldrazi Spawn turned into a mighty [Progenitus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Progenitus).


Pritsch cast a second [Knight of the Reliquary](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Knight+of+the+Reliquary) and a second [Qasali Pridemage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Qasali+Pridemage). Thaler attacked for ten and played [Khalni Garden](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Khalni+Garden). Would Pritsch be able to squeeze through the 15 points of damage needed to kill Thaler? Another [Bloodbraid Elf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodbraid+Elf) seemed to actually enable that, even more so when the cascade turned over [Cunning Sparkmage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cunning+Sparkmage). But when the Sparkmage ran into [Mana Leak](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak) and one [Bloodbraid Elf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodbraid+Elf) met [Lightning Bolt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt), the Plant token was enough of an obstacle to leave the damage total at 13. Close, but no cigar.


**Sebastian Thaler 2 – 1 Max Pritsch**


 

Saturday, 5:20 p.m. – Combo, Schmombo
-------------------------------------


*by Tobias Henke*

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration//mtg/images/daily/events/gernat10/decktech_combo_1.jpg)Combo is out and about in full force at German Nationals. There is [Runeflare Trap](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Runeflare+Trap), [Polymorph](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Polymorph), [Pyromancer Ascension](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyromancer+Ascension), and even a new twist on [Time Sieve](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Time+Sieve). No one went particularly well with the deck, but one player did provide this screenshot of an actual turn-three kill from **Magic** Online! All thanks to the long disregarded [Etherium Sculptor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Etherium+Sculptor), which plays a prominent role in both [Time Sieve](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Time+Sieve) decks in attendance.


Off to the more succesful lists. Currently, Carlo Mazzurco is 9-3 with [Runeflare Trap](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Runeflare+Trap).

Mazzurco was convinced to play the deck after talking about it on the phone with Sebastian Thaler. The very next weekend, he even made the Top 8 of a Pro Tour Qualifier. "The deck is not that good anymore with the recent changes in the metagame," Mazzurco said, adding, "but still good!"


The deck is similar to the Owling Mine decks of old. [Howling Mine](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Howling+Mine), [Jace Beleren](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace+Beleren), and [Font of Mythos](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Font+of+Mythos) draw cards, [Unsummon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Unsummon), [Into the Roil](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Into+the+Roil), [Mana Leak](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak), and [Lightning Bolt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt) are effective weapons to control the tempo of the game, and finally [Runeflare Trap](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Runeflare+Trap) and [Twincast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Twincast) deal lethal damage in record time.


"Basically, any slow deck that cannot quickly empty its hand is a good match-up. Mono Red is terrible, and the new Jund which runs [Thought Hemorrhage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thought+Hemorrhage) in the sideboard is something I'd rather not play against," said Mazzurco about his chances. "Oh, and the match-up against [Pyromancer Ascension](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyromancer+Ascension) is really, really tricky. I can't even say, which deck is supposed to win here."


 

Feature Match Round 13 – Daniel Gräfensteiner vs. Carlo Mazzurco
----------------------------------------------------------------


*by Hanno Terbuyken*

This is it! Everything is on the line on the final stretch to Nationals Sunday. Daniel Gräfensteiner is one half of the pair of brothers that has been on a romp for a good while now, with Daniel's Top 8 appearance in Pro Tour: San Diego gracing the brother's success. Carlo Mazzurco is an old hand at the game, with top 8 experience on the national level, but never making the leap to the international stage. Both players were on 27 points, with a 9-3 record, and playing for a sunday seat.


**Game 1:**


After an uneventful deck-check, both players decided to mulligan their opening hands. Gräfensteiner kicked off the game with a fetchland to find one of the beautiful Zendikar full-art [Island](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island)s that are all the rage with players these days. Mazzurco, on the other hand, preferred the old-school full-art lands that made [Unhinge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Unhinge)d such a commercial hit.


And here's the thing about this match. Mazzurco had the [Runeflare Trap](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Runeflare+Trap) combo deck with him, Gräfensteiner the [Pyromancer Ascension](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyromancer+Ascension) deck with transformational [Polymorph](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Polymorph) sideboard that had served a number of people well. Few would argue that this match-up is unexciting, but a play-by-play write-up of that many small spells truly becomes boring after the third Into The Roil.


Luckily, every match has a few turning points. So here's the cliff notes version of Game 1:


BAM! Dead.


Well, no. That's a lie. (But it sounds good. So there.) Gräfensteiner played a handful of cantrips, the likes of [Ponder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ponder) and [Preordain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Preordain). Both players tried to get key cards in play, but Mazzurco managed to keep Gräfensteiner's [Pyromancer Ascension](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyromancer+Ascension) off the table or without enough counters. Gräfensteiner, in turn, kept [Jace Beleren](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace+Beleren) off the battlefield.


Mazzurco threw the burn spells in his deck at Gräfensteiner's head until he had him at 12 life. With [Temple Bell](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Temple+Bell) and – finally – [Jace Beleren](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace+Beleren) in play, Mazzurco's [Time Warp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Time+Warp) stuck. Two [Howling Mine](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Howling+Mine)s ensured that Gräfensteiner would be reliably vulnerable to [Runeflare Trap](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Runeflare+Trap), and an additional [Temple Bell](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Temple+Bell) ensured that the inevitable [Runeflare Trap](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Runeflare+Trap)s would hit home hard enough.


Daniel Gräfensteiner 0 – 1 Carlo Mazzurco

**Game 2:**


Once more into the breach, old boys! Gräfensteiner kicked things off very much like in the first game: Fetchland for [Island](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island), [Ponder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ponder), then [See Beyond](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=See+Beyond) on turn two, [Preordain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Preordain) on turn three, which met [Mana Leak](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak). As Gräfensteiner had not yet played a land, Mazzurco hoped for a little mana disruption, but in vain: Gräfensteiner had [Khalni Garden](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Khalni+Garden).


Gräfensteiner spent his turns looking at cards from his library through the likes of more [Preordain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Preordain)s and [Ponder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ponder)s, looking for that crucial [Pyromancer Ascension](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyromancer+Ascension) – or the missing red mana. Instead, he revealed [Polymorph](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Polymorph) (targeting the token from [Khalni Garden](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Khalni+Garden)), which Mazzurco attempted to [Mana Leak](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak). Gräfensteiner had [Dispel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dispel) for the Leak, and as the fourth-to-last card of his library, into play came [Emrakul, the Aeons Torn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Emrakul%2C+the+Aeons+Torn)!


Mazzurco tapped his five mana for [Time Warp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Time+Warp), a very expensive cantrip at this point, but he needed something... or else! [Time Warp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Time+Warp) yielded nothing, so else happened.


Daniel Gräfensteiner 1 – 1 Carlo Mazzurco

**Game 3:**


This time, Mazzurco had the advantage of going first – and the disadvantage of a mulligan. Twice. Gräfensteiner's cavalcade of card drawing continued with [Ponder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ponder), but this time, a turn-two [Pyromancer Ascension](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyromancer+Ascension) played right into Gräfensteiner's plans.


Mazzurco, meanwhile, hoped to make up his mulligans with [Temple Bell](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Temple+Bell) and [Jace Beleren](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace+Beleren). [Spawning Breath](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spawning+Breath) from Gräfensteiner took Mazzurco to 18, and gave Gräfensteiner a Spawn token as a target for – once again – [Polymorph](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Polymorph). Mazzurco had nothing to stop Emrakul coming into play. Annihilator 6 would destroy his entire board, but life-wise, Mazzurco could buffer one attack. However, when he passed the turn and Gräfensteiner turned the Eldrazi sideways, Mazzurco extended the hand. Daniel Gräfensteiner was through to the Top 8!


Daniel Gräfensteiner 2 – 1 Carlo Mazzurco


 

Saturday, 6:30 p.m. – Is It Izzet? Again?
-----------------------------------------


*by Tobias Henke*

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration//mtg/images/daily/events/gernat10/blog_izzet_tobi_grfensteiner.jpg)*Tobias Gräfensteiner*
Well, yes, it is. [Runeflare Trap](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Runeflare+Trap) is not the only blue-red combo deck running around. The trio of Sebastian Thaler, Tobi & Daniel Gräfensteiner came up with a new list for [Pyromancer Ascension](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyromancer+Ascension), which was rocking the top tables all weekend (and will continue to do so tomorrow).


Tobias Gräfensteiner took a few minutes to explain what's special about their version: "Ascension became more and more popular over the last couple of week, and things like [Qasali Pridemage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Qasali+Pridemage) and [Celestial Purge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Celestial+Purge) started to show up in sideboards in ever increasing numbers. So we needed an alternative route to victory: [Polymorph](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Polymorph)."


"We put three [Khalni Garden](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Khalni+Garden)s in the maindeck and additional four [Spawning Breath](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spawning+Breath)s in the sideboard to have enough targets for [Polymorph](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Polymorph)," said Tobi. "[Spawning Breath](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spawning+Breath) is easily the best token producer: it kills [Cunning Sparkmage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cunning+Sparkmage); together with [Khalni Garden](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Khalni+Garden) one can actually cast [Polymorph](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Polymorph) on turn three; and it's an instant, so you can completely take some people by surprise when you make the token end of turn and then follow it up with [Polymorph](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Polymorph)."

Saturday, 7:33 p.m. - Day Two Wrap-Up
-------------------------------------


*by Hanno Terbuyken*

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration//mtg/images/daily/events/gernat10/sat_wrapup.jpg)Ah, the world and woes of coverage reporters. It is hard to convey how hectic the closing round of a day can be. There is the round 13 feature match to cover, then the players who are already safe in the Top 8 must be rounded up, Top 8 photos and Top 8 profiles need to be done, the decklists for the Top 8 need to be typed up and printed... for us coverage reporters, the last two rounds of the swiss are a Top 8 extravaganza.


And then the internet breaks down. Honestly? I cannot remember a single Nationals where we didn't have internet trouble on Saturday night. It is the curse of the coverage cruise.


When the internet was back, we had a Top 8 that is by all accounts a high-caliber line-up. Between Dennis Johannsen, Christian Hauck, Tobias Gräfensteiner, Florian Pils, Jörg Unfried, Daniel Gräfensteiner, Tobias Dreger and Sebastian Potyka, Germany can be sure to be represented well once Worlds in Chiba rolls around.


But of course, one man's gain is another man's loss. Sebastian Thaler for example had to face a hard defeat at the hand of fellow Nationals veteran Jörg Unfried. His Ascension-[Polymorph](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Polymorph) hybrid with Progrenitus as sideboard tech. Carsten Schäfer, who held on to the top spot for a couple of rounds, fell out of grace and out of contention when Standard rolled around for the second time. Nationals dinosaur Carlo Mazzurco, GP champion Jan Schmidt and two-time GP Top 8 player Raul Porojan all three just missed the Top 16 by a hair.


Interestingly enough, though [Fauna Shaman](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fauna+Shaman) and [Primeval Titan](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Primeval+Titan) seemed all the rage before, only two decks sporting either one of them made it to the Top 8. Two copies of Jund and two copies of Ascension also made it, the latter piloted by the Gräfensteiner brothers. When the sun rises over Aschaffenburg on Saturday morning, we will see the Brother's War unfold in the quarterfinals. Will archenemy Jund be toppled by one of the newcomer decks? Will Valakut or [Polymorph](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Polymorph) explode all over the slower decks? We'll see. The format is diverse and powerful, and that power and diversity will carry one player to Nationals glory on Sunday.
