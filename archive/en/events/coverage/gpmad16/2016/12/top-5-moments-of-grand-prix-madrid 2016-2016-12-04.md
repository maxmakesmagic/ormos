The tournament, like every Grand Prix, had been full of memorable stories, of exciting matches, of interesting decks doing interesting stuff. The following are our Top 5 picks, the five moments which made Grand Prix Madrid an event to remember ...


### 5. When Metalwork Colossus Crushed Delirium

One of the more "out there" builds to make a bit of a wave early on Saturday was Marc Tobiasch's [Metalwork Colossus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Metalwork+Colossus) deck. Of particular note was it's great matchup against Black-Green Delirium, a battle the deck could hardly lose, not even when [Noxious Gearhulk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Noxious+Gearhulk)s took down its signature card. With Black-Green Delirium one of the most played decks, by far the most played deck among the players with three byes, that came in handy. Then again, crushing Delirium was something like the theme of the weekend here in Madrid.

### 4. When Noose Constrictor Won on its Own

While the more traditional Black-Red Zombies was piloted to a Top 8 berth by Rafael Sarriegui Hidalgo, its black-green counterpart drew quite a bit more attention for most of the tournament. The Dutch duo of Jan van der Vegt and Daan Pruijt went 7-2 and 9-0 with matching lists on Day 1, suggesting they had stumbled over something worth further investigation. The top moment associated with the deck was when van der Vegt won a game in which he cast but a single spell, despite facing heavy resistance including [Fumigate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fumigate). [Noose Constrictor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Noose+Constrictor) was all it took for him to enable the (un-) deadly engine of [Haunted Dead](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Haunted+Dead) and [Prized Amalgam](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Prized+Amalgam).

### 3. When Draw-Go Control Proved Viable

Belgium's Peter Vieren, a World Magic Cup finalist and two-time GP Top 8er, missed the playoffs by just one match win this weekend. He was likely playing the purest, truest control deck imaginable, consisting of a whopping 28 instants in blue and red, four [Torrential Gearhulk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Torrential+Gearhulk), and 26 lands. This scared more than one [Aetherworks Marvel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aetherworks+Marvel) player. Platinum pro Niels Noorlander, an early proponent of Red-Green Marvel, claimed, "Blue-Red Control is nearly unwinnable." Vieren could just chuckle and dropped the "nearly" from this assesment: "Marvel is a bye."

### 2. When the Best Black-Green Delirium Player Finished Ninth

 You can probably tell from the above photo and the grim look directed to the camera here who this was about. Pro Tour *Magic Origins* champion (15) Joel Larsson was watching Pro Tour *Dragons of Tarkir* quarterfinalist Marco Cammilluzzi play his Round 15 match and he wasn't happy. Not because Larson begrudged Cammilluzzi his victory, but rather because he had taken a risky intentional draw in Round 15 which, after Cammilluzi's win, left Larsson in ninth place. With this, the last of the Black-Green Delirium players had fallen by the wayside and the Top 8 painted a decidedly different picture compared to the last European Standard Grand Prix. A mere five weeks ago, in Warsaw, six black-green decks had made the playoffs. This weekend, at Grand Prix Madrid, none did.

### 1. When Red-Green Aetherworks Marvel ...


... put twenty of its pilots into the Top 100 after Day 1, not far behind Flash and Delirium and almost surpassing the latter.


... was the most represented archetype among the 9-0 players' choices.


... claimed a full 50 percent of the tournament's Top 8 spots!


... was used by Carmine D'Aniello to win it all!
