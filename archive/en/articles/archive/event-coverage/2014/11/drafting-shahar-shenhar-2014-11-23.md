For a year Shahar Shenhar has been known simply as The Champ. He's worn the title well, being a fixture in the Top 25 Rankings. The World Championship looms on the horizon, offering him a chance to repeat the performance that solidified his place among the game's elite. For now, however, his focus is on the task at hand. He sat at 8-1 after the first Day with strong position to make a run at the Top 8.


The draft started easily enough. His first pick was [Mardu Heart-Piercer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mardu+Heart-Piercer) head and shoulders over the rest of the pack. His next was not so clear-cut. He fanned a pack that featured [Opulent Palace](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Opulent+Palace), [Frontier Bivouac](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Frontier+Bivouac), Wooly Loxodon, [Riverwheel Aerialists](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Riverwheel+Aerialists), [Snowhorn Rider](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snowhorn+Rider) and [Kill Shot](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kill+Shot).

"At this point I have a red card I want to play at all costs. I love the Loxodon, but taking a green card means I'd have to be Temur. I'd rather take a blue card and stay open, and the Aerialists is very good."


He followed it up with a [War-Name Aspirant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=War-Name+Aspirant) and then a [Frontier Bivouac](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Frontier+Bivouac). [Bear's Companion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bear%27s+Companion) showed up fifth, so it looked like it would be Temur after all. He got some green early drops and knew his spot was secure when [Snowhorn Rider](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snowhorn+Rider) tabled.


"I felt really good after pack one. Early on I'd been hoping to stay blue-red and only splash green. I don't like playing decks with the colors evenly split up. By the end of the pack it looked like I was mostly red-green."


He opened the second pack and found a present waiting for him: [Hooded Hydra](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hooded+Hydra). He spent his next two picks on [Thornwood Falls](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thornwood+Falls) and [Rugged Highlands](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rugged+Highlands).


![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Hooded Hydra)
"Obviously the Hydra is insane. Double green means it'll force my manabase a bit, but it's so powerful. I didn't have to give up much to get the two lands, just solid cards like [Glacial Stalker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glacial+Stalker) and [Set Adrift](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Set+Adrift). I always want to get my lands in pack two, because I don't want to be in the situation of having to pass a bomb in pack three just to get my mana sorted out."


As the pack continued it seemed the picks were a little thin. Shenhar filled out his curve as best he could. [Trap Essence](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Trap+Essence) made the circuit back to him eleventh.


"It was tough because there were lands in every pack, but never the ones I wanted. [Trap Essence](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Trap+Essence) is by no means a great card, but the way my deck worked out I'm a little short on removal, and it can be a powerful effect. If I can two-drop, pass with three mana open and catch someone with it, the game's over pretty quickly."


Pack three was the real payday. Shenhar's picks went, in order: [Surrak Dragonclaw](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Surrak+Dragonclaw), [Mardu Heart-Piercer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mardu+Heart-Piercer), [Icefeather Aven](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Icefeather+Aven), [Sagu Mauler](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sagu+Mauler).


![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Surrak Dragonclaw)
"Yeah, wow. This is what I was talking about, I didn't have to give up any of those premium cards because I needed lands. I wouldn't have minded more lands, but even the Swiftwater Falls fifth I passed because there was a [Tuskguard Captain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tuskguard+Captain) with it."


I asked Shenhar how the build went.


"Pretty straightforward. The one big decision was about the lands. I had ten green sources, but I wasn't sure how I'd split the islands and mountains. I could've gone eight blue sources, five red sources, which seems better for only having five real red cards, but I went to seven and six because I really want to hit [Mardu Heart-Piercer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mardu+Heart-Piercer) on turn four as often as possible. The one pick I wish I had back was the [War-Name Aspirant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=War-Name+Aspirant). There was a [Force Away](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Force+Away) in that pack that I wish I had instead of the Aspirant who's in my sideboard. It's not that I should've taken the Force, but just the way my deck worked out, the Aspirant isn't great. Even early [Highland Game](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Highland+Game) might just be better for this deck. Still trades with the same things that the 3/2 would, and the life could be very relevant."
