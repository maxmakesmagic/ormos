*Rivals of Ixalan* Preview League
---------------------------------


If you can't even bear to wait until the Prerelease to try the new cards of *Rivals of Ixalan*, we've got good news! Starting January 11 at 10 a.m. PT, we will be running a 24-hour *Rivals* Sealed Deck league. It's open to all players—no qualifying necessary—and will feature a friendly prize structure that guarantees you'll walk away with at least one *Rivals of Ixalan* booster regardless of your record.


Perhaps you'd rather see how your favorite *Magic* streamers do with the new cards? We've got you covered there, too! For the *entire 24-hour duration* of the Preview League, a rotating cast of beloved streamers from the *Magic* community will be joining the action and streaming it live for your viewing pleasure at any hour of the day (or night). Check the tables below to see who's streaming when.


To learn more about the Preview League, check out [Lee Sharpe's article here](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/magic-digital/get-ready-magic-online-RIX-preview-league-2018-01-03).

Vintage Cube Runs through Jan. 15
---------------------------------


Vintage Cube's longest-ever run is coming to an end, but you've still got almost a week left to draft those powerful, ridiculous, seriously-who-thought-that-was-okay Vintage cards. Use those skills you've built up over the last few weeks between now and Monday, January 15, to put together whatever sort of busted storm, ramp, aggro, or anything-else deck your heart desires.


Learn more about Vintage Cube [here](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/magic-digital/vintage-masters-flashbacks-and-vintage-cube-2017-12-05).

No Premier Play Events This Week
--------------------------------


There will be no premier play events on *Magic Online* this week, so maybe use this gift of time to go to a *Rivals of Ixalan* Prerelease at your local store! Or write a book or something. It's your life.




---

Regular Rivals of Ixalan Events Start Jan. 15
---------------------------------------------


Previews, Pre-Prereleases, and regular ol' Prereleases aside, the usual slate of *Rivals* events will kick off on the release date, January 15. Whether you're a Draft fanatic or looking to crack the new Standard metagame, that's when you'll be able to dive in to your format of choice.
