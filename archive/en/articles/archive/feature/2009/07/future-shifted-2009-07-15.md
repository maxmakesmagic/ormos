You have decided and **now the work begins** as RYZ works with the winning designers to finalize the shoes for production and create a line of products inspired by their designs.


Today, we spotlight Nathan Christner, whose "Future Shifted" design made him the overall champion. Let's get to know Nathan a little better, shall we?

**1. How long have you played **Magic**?**


I started playing around 15 years ago during *Revised*, shortly before *Fallen Empires* came out. I still regret missing out on opening up some Moxes or a Lotus or two by not discovering the game a few months sooner.


**2. Do you play tournaments? If so, what is the best you have done?**  

The only tournaments I play in these days are the occasional Prerelease. I played in a few other tournaments back in the mid to late '90s, including winning a Beta [Berserk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Berserk) in a Type 1.5 tournament and taking second in a small Type 1 tournament. The best I've done lately is going 3-1 in a handful of PRs.


**3. What is the inspiration behind your design?**


I wanted something clean and simple. I'd recently built a deck that used a couple *Future Sight* cards and I remembered how much I loved the new frame they used on the "future-shifted" cards. I got the border done in a couple hours but it took me a day or so before I decided how to finish it off when I settled on incorporating the five mana symbols into it.


**4. What other things have you designed? Is your "day job" designing as well?**


I put some thought into going into graphic design in high school before I got interested in journalism by accident (our school offered "Intro to Broadcast Journalism" as one of the choices for a required speech credit). I've always been interested in drawing and visual art and working as a photojournalist allows me to challenge my creativity on a daily basis. I also enjoy drawing/painting and still photography in my spare time.


**5. Tell us a bit about the Nathan Christner story.**


I'm a 27-year old husband and father from a small town in Kansas. I am a graduate of Wichita State University and I currently work as a photojournalist (and infrequent sports reporter) for a local TV station. Apart from my **Magic** and art-related hobbies which I've already touched on, I also consider myself quite the beer connoisseur. I have a collection of nearly 500 foreign and imported beer bottles from over 60 different countries (all of which I've personally sampled).


The good people at RYZ are busily creating a line of clothes based on the winning designs. Here, for example, is what the hat based on Nathan's design will look like!


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/arcana/233_hat.jpg)RYZ is working with the other winners to complete the line, and we'll have more information as it becomes available.. To pre-order your **Magic** "future shifted gear" or any of the other winning shoes, go to [shop.ryzwear.com/collections/magic-the-gathering](http://shop.ryzwear.com/collections/magic-the-gathering).
