2000 Pro Tour Chicago Coverage
------------------------------


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/pt_lg.gif)Kai Budde has won 2000 Pro Tour Chicago with his Rebel deck, defeating Holland's Kamiel Cornelissen, 3-0. This is the second Pro Tour victory for Budde, as the Chicago trophy joins his 1999 World Champion prize.


Budde played straight monowhite rebels versus Cornelissen's blue-white "Counter-Rebel" strategy. The rest of the Top 8 decks (and, in fact, all 96 decks that were played on Day 2) are available below, as are numerous analysis and match coverage articles from the Sideboard's crack team of writers, including Anthony Alongi, Josh Bennett, Randy Buehler, Kim Eikefet, and a few surprise guests.
