These two have a long history. To date, Levy has never beaten Kai. He is 10-0 down.   
 Kai has managed to draft a monstrosity, he has a RB deck with eleven removal spells. Levy’s deck is a mediocre WR deck with nothing particularly special. Revenge or the biggest insecurity streak of all time?

Levy kept a one Mountain, [Pyrite Spellbomb](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyrite+Spellbomb), Leonin Skyknight, [Alpha Myr](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Alpha+Myr), [Sun Droplet](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sun+Droplet), [Clockwork Condor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Clockwork+Condor), [Krark-Clan Grunt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Krark-Clan+Grunt) hand, on the play. Kai’s hand is solid.

Typical to French flair, Levy ripped a Mountain and made the Myr. Kai snapped. Levy peeled a Plains and made the Grunt. Kai [Consume Spirit](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Consume+Spirit)ed the Myr. Levy was smoking; he laid another Plains and a Skyknight, the [Pyrite Spellbomb](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyrite+Spellbomb) still on the board. Better lucky than good I guess. Kai answered with an [Icy Manipulator](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Icy+Manipulator). Levy made his Condor.

Budde could not seem to do anything other than make land for his next turn, whist Raphael matched Budde’s Icy with a [Sculpting Steel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sculpting+Steel). The Spellbomb exploded, trying to take down Kai’s Myr, but it imploded first when Kai [Shrapnel Blast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shrapnel+Blast)ed Levy’s Grunt, the Condor was tapped by the Icy and the Skyknight was [Terror](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Terror)ed.

Levy played his [Sun Droplet](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sun+Droplet) whilst on still twenty life and used his Icy to out Icy Kai so that his Condor could attack. Kai found a [Moriok Scavenger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Moriok+Scavenger) which dug up an [Alpha Myr](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Alpha+Myr), bringing his offense online. The following turn, [Betrayal of Flesh](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Betrayal+of+Flesh) took out Levy’s freshly played [Needlebug](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Needlebug) and the German’s men swung in, inhibited by Levy’s Icy.

Kai found a [Serum Tank](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Serum+Tank) that gave him a [Mirror Golem](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mirror+Golem) that got [Arrest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arrest)ed. A [Shatter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shatter) took out the pesky [Sun Droplet](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sun+Droplet). Levy’s deck had given him a [Soldier Replica](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soldier+Replica), another [Alpha Myr](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Alpha+Myr), a [Neurok Hoversail](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Neurok+Hoversail) and an [Iron Myr](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Iron+Myr), but it was by no means enough. Budde found a [Nim Devourer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nim+Devourer) which traded a turn later with Raphael’s [Alpha Myr](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Alpha+Myr). 

Kai sacrificed his [Arrest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arrest)ed Golem in his upkeep to return the Devourer. He drew and made a [Nim Replica](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nim+Replica) and an [Iron Myr](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Iron+Myr). Levy’s deck continued churning up sub-par creatures but Kai had drawn a [Grab the Reins](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grab+the+Reins), which sealed the Frenchman’s fate.

“That wasn’t very nice, Mr.B.”

Budde 1 – Levy 0

Levy, in desperation, brought in a [Thought Prison](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thought+Prison). Almost a silver bullet against Kai’s killing machine.

Levy’s hand was far more reasonable this time, consisting of, amongst other things three land and a castable Skyknight, which, unsurprisingly, made its way into play on turn two. It was followed by a Grunt the next turn. Kai’s first play was a turn three [Serum Tank](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Serum+Tank). Levy responded with a Spellbomb and a [Neurok Hoversail](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Neurok+Hoversail).

Kai swept the board clean with a savage [Barter in Blood](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Barter+in+Blood). Levy was not done yet, tapping out for an [Ogre Leadfoot](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ogre+Leadfoot). Kai would not give him any ground though, making his [Icy Manipulator](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Icy+Manipulator).

Levy made a [Soldier Replica](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soldier+Replica), Kai answered with a [Nim Devourer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nim+Devourer). After a [Consume Spirit](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Consume+Spirit) fizzled thanks to a [Razor Barrier](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Razor+Barrier), Levy asked Kai to play with his hand face up. So Kai did. He had [Detonate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Detonate), [Terror](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Terror), [Shrapnel Blast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shrapnel+Blast), Bolt, and two land. After all of Raph’s men had hit the dust, Kai finally drew a creature – [Mirror Golem](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mirror+Golem).

Levy decided that he was so far behind he too would play the ‘hand face up’ game. He flipped his draw onto the table. It was a [Soul Nova](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soul+Nova). Laughter erupted from around the feature match area – such timing!

Levy ‘Nova’ed the Golem but it was [Shrapnel Blast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shrapnel+Blast)ed away so as not to be removed from the game so that Kai’s face up [Moriok Scavenger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Moriok+Scavenger) could bring it back. It came back. At this point Raph’s only permanent was a Hoversail. Levy drew his [Sculpting Steel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sculpting+Steel), looked around and, in jest, copied the Hoversail!
