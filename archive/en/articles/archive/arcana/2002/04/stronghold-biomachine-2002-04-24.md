[Stronghold Machinist](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stronghold+Machinist) and [Stronghold Biologist](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stronghold+Biologist) have a lot in common. They are both 1/1 uncommon blue spellshapers from *Nemesis*. They can both counter spells, and they both have activation costs of "![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161115194122im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/blue.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161115194122im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/blue.gif), discard a card from you hand."


They even use the same piece of art, albeit different sides. [Terese Nielsen](http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=mtgcom/feature/38) painted one scene for both cards, and once you look at them together, it's pretty obvious. The two scientists sit at each end of a big table, working away. And who is the guy in the middle, the guy that shows up on both cards? Oh, that's just Ertai, all cleaned up and ready for his implants.


The doctors will be with you shortlyâ€¦
