 'Twas 2007,   
 at New York's Worlds,   
 and around my deck of cards,   
 my fingers were curled.


I faced none other than,   
 Magic's Lead Designer,   
 you know him as MaRo,   
 or "Mark" to be finer.


I managed a win,   
 a feat quite indeed,   
 and for it he gave me,   
 a [Gifts Given](#) promo: I squeed.

 and every year since,   
 we've made a promo card,   
 and likely every year hence.


My poem ends soon,   
 with its rhymes quite slant,   
 I try as I might,   
 But my rhythm is scant.


This isn't for pain,   
 nor to cause any fear,   
 but actually to share,   
 the new promo for this year.

The above poem is a true story. I went (as a fan and member of the media) to the 2007 World Championships in New York City. While I was there I sat down and spellslung against Mark. I managed to beat him, for which I got one of that year's holiday promo: Gifts Given. I regret not holding onto the card; at the time I traded it away. I have since come to treasure each of the holiday promos I own.

Here's hoping that whenever your own Stocking Tiger enters the battlefield, under it will be an exciting booster pack!
