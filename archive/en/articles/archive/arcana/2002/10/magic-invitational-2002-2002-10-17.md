Unless you've been living under a rock, you know that the 2002 **Magic** Invitational starts tomorrow. So this is for those few of you under said rock.


The Invitational is a special invite-only tournament for sixteen of the top professional Magic players from around the globe. They play fifteen rounds of five unique formats, and the winner gets to design his own card! Past winners' cards include:

This year the tournament will be held using ***Magic** Online* from right here in Renton, Washington, which means it is more accessible that ever. Besides traditional event coverage on the [Sideboard](http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=sideboard/events/mi02), you can replay the games themselves or even challenge the contestants in a "gunslinging" match if you have the ***Magic** Online* software.


So download the software [here](http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=magic/magiconline/downloadlinks), and check the [Sideboard](http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=sideboard/events/mi02) tomorrow for this exciting and historic event!
