The morph mechanic came back in a big way in *Time Spiral*. Many morph creatures have a visual cue in their art that represents the mysteriously uniform “morph shell” from which the morph creature emerges. It’s that spider-shaped creature shell represented in *Onslaught’s* expansion symbol (![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/exp_sym_onslaught.gif)).

You can find lots of these “morph spiders” throughout the art of *Time Spiral* morph cards:
