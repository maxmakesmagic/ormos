In the fourth round of Grand Prix Shanghai two national champions faced off. From Malaysia came Raymond Tan and from Singapore came Kelvin Chew. Both players brought Abzan Aggro decks with them this weekend. Using heavy hitters such as [Siege Rhino](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Siege+Rhino) and [Wingmate Roc](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wingmate+Roc) and backed up by powerful spells such as [Abzan Charm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Abzan+Charm) and [Hero's Downfall](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hero%27s+Downfall), both players hoped to make quick work of each other. Coming off of two byes and a win in round 3, only one national champion could escape round 4 unscathed.


The Games
=========


The two players began the first game by developing their boards: Chew with a [Fleecemane Lion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fleecemane+Lion) and [Courser of Kruphix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Courser+of+Kruphix) and Tan with a [Fleecemane Lion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fleecemane+Lion) and [Rakshasa Deathdealer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rakshasa+Deathdealer).


Chew's land situation was a little suspect; he quickly fell to 12 life thanks to [Llanowar Wastes](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Llanowar+Wastes) and attacks from Tan's creatures, sitting with a pair of uncastable [Hero's Downfall](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hero%27s+Downfall)s in his hand.

When Chew went to trade his lion for Tan's, Tan cast [Abzan Charm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Abzan+Charm)—saving his lion and dropping Chew to 6.


Chew had a pair of [Siege Rhino](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Siege+Rhino)s in his hand, but only 
had access to [Sandsteppe Citadel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sandsteppe+Citadel). This gave Tan the opportunity to cast a Rhino of his own and drop Chew to 3. When Tan cast a [Surrak, the Hunt Caller](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Surrak%2C+the+Hunt+Caller) on his following turn, Chew turned to his sideboard in preparation for game 2.

Both players began the second game with [Fleecemane Lion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fleecemane+Lion)s. Chew found a second lion, and, when he offered a trade, Tan blocked and used [Abzan Charm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Abzan+Charm) to make his lion a 5/5.

Tan removed Chew's second Lion with another copy of [Abzan Charm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Abzan+Charm). Under the pressure of the 5/5 Chew was forced to hard cast a [Den Protector](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Den+Protector).

The two traded blows back and forth; Tan quickly dropped to 4 after he found
 his 5/5 Lion exiled by [Abzan Charm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Abzan+Charm). Tan fought back, however, playing a [Warden of the First Tree](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Warden+of+the+First+Tree) and a [Fleecemane Lion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fleecemane+Lion). After Tan used [Self-Inflicted Wound](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Self-Inflicted+Wound) to drop Chew to 6 and without access to a fifth land for his [Crux of Fate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crux+of+Fate), Chew crumbled to Tan's army.
