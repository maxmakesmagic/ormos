![Legions](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/global/images/magic_expansion_legions_expansionLogo_en.jpg)This FAQ has two sections, each of which serves a different purpose.

The first section ("[General Notes](#generalnotes)") explains the new mechanics and concepts in the set. The second section ("[Card-Specific Notes](#cardspecificnotes)") contains answers to the most important questions players might ask about a given card.

Items in the "Card-Specific Notes" section include full rules text for your reference. Not all cards in the set are listed.

### GENERAL NOTES

### Amplify

The official rules for the amplify ability are as follows:


> 502.27. Amplify
> 
> 
> 502.27a Amplify is a static ability. "Amplify [X]" means "As this card comes into play, reveal any number of cards from your hand that share a creature type with this card. This card comes into play with X +1/+1 counters on it for each card revealed this way. You can't reveal this card or any other cards that are coming into play at the same time as this card."
> 
> 
> 502.27b If a creature has multiple instances of amplify, each one works separately.
> 
> 

\* The player who will control the creature is the one who reveals the cards.

\* Each revealed card must share a creature type with the amplify card. The reminder text reminds you what those types are.

\* Playing the *Onslaught™* card [Artificial Evolution](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Artificial+Evolution) on an amplify spell on the stack can change what types need to be revealed. The card [Conspiracy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Conspiracy) can also change what types need to be revealed.

\* If multiple creatures with amplify are going to come into play under your control at the same time, you're allowed to reveal the same cards for each of them.

\* If you play Clone and choose for it to copy a creature with amplify, you get to reveal cards and get +1/+1 counters.

### Double Strike

The official rules for the double-strike ability and updated rules for the first-strike ability are as follows:


> **502.28 Double Strike**
> 
> 
> 502.28a Double strike is a static ability that modifies the rules for the combat damage step.
> 
> 
> 502.28b During the combat damage step, if at least one attacking or blocking creature has double strike or first strike, creatures without double strike or first strike (see rule 502.2) don't assign combat damage. Instead of proceeding to end of combat, the phase gets a second combat damage step to handle the remaining creatures. Creatures with double strike also assign combat damage during the second combat damage step.
> 
> 
> 502.28c Removing double strike from a creature during the first combat damage step will stop it from assigning combat damage in the second combat damage step.
> 
> 
> 502.28d Giving double strike to a creature after combat damage has been put onto the stack in the first combat damage step will allow the creature to assign combat damage in the second combat damage step, even if it already assigned combat damage in the first combat damage step.
> 
> 
> 502.28e Multiple instances of double strike on the same creature are redundant.
> 
> 
> **502.2. First Strike**
> 
> 
> 502.2a First strike is a static ability that modifies the rules for the combat damage step.
> 
> 
> 502.2b During the combat damage step, if at least one attacking or blocking creature has first strike or double strike, creatures without first strike or double strike (see rule 502.28) don't assign combat damage. Instead of proceeding to end of combat, the phase gets a second combat damage step to handle the remaining creatures.
> 
> 
> 502.2c Adding or removing first strike after the first combat damage step won't prevent a creature from dealing combat damage or allow it to deal combat damage twice.
> 
> 
> 502.2d Multiple instances of first strike on the same creature are redundant.
> 
> 

\* Double strike isn't first strike. Effects that make a creature lose first strike won't make it lose double strike.

\* Creatures with double strike and creatures with first strike deal combat damage in the first combat damage step.

\* All creatures that didn't assign combat damage in the first combat damage step assign combat damage in the second combat damage step. In addition, all creatures with double strike assign combat damage again in the second step.

\* If a creature has both double strike and trample, the combat damage it assigned during the first combat damage step will be considered when determining how much damage can trample through in the second combat damage step.

### Provoke

The official rules for the provoke ability are as follows:


> **502.29. Provoke**
> 
> 
> 502.29a Provoke is a triggered ability. "Provoke" means "Whenever this creature attacks, you may choose to have target creature defending player controls block this creature this combat if able. If you do, untap that creature."
> 
> 
> 502.29b If a creature has multiple instances of provoke, each triggers separately.
> 
> 

\* There's no requirement for the provoked creature to be tapped or to be able to block. 

\* You can choose not to force the creature to block, in which case it won't untap.

\* If the provoked creature becomes tapped before the declare blockers step, it won't be able to block.

\* If a creature is provoked by more than one creature, the controller of the provoked creature chooses which one it blocks.

\* If the provoked creature has any costs to block, those costs don't have to be paid. If the costs are paid, the provoked creature must block the creature with provoke.

### Morph

See the [***Onslaught* FAQ**](http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=mtgcom/feature/faqonslaught) for information about the morph ability.

### Morph Triggered Abilities

\* Many *Legions* cards have abilities that trigger when the cards are turned face up. These abilities work like normal triggered abilities.

[Defender of the Order](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Defender+of+the+Order)  
![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227130050im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless3.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227125855im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/white.gif)  
 Creature -- Cleric  
 2/4  
 Morph ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227125855im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/white.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227125855im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/white.gif)*(You may play this face down as a 2/2 creature for ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227130050im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless3.gif). Turn it face up any time for its morph cost.)*  
 When Defender of the Order is turned face up, creatures you control get +0/+2 until end of turn.

\* Morph triggers will trigger when the card is turned face up either by an effect or if its morph cost is paid.

\* Morph triggers don't trigger when the card is looked at or leaves play.

### Slivers

\* Slivers can grant activated or static abilities to Slivers in play. Not all Slivers grant abilities. Some have abilities that trigger when Slivers do things, and some have static abilities that affect the rules of the game, such as "Any player may play Sliver cards any time he or she could play an instant."

\* You can change creatures of other types into Slivers so they can get the benefits of being a Sliver.

\* You can use [Artificial Evolution](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Artificial+Evolution) on any Sliver to make it affect another creature type (this would also change the type of the Sliver, so it would still affect itself).

\* [Mistform Ultimus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mistform+Ultimus) is a Sliver.

### CARD-SPECIFIC NOTES

[Akroma's Devoted](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Akroma%27s+Devoted)  
![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227130050im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless3.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227125855im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/white.gif)

![](https://web.archive.org/web/20160830042801im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless4.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227125855im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/white.gif)

 2/2  
 Amplify 1 *(As this card comes into play, put a +1/+1 counter on it for each Bird and/or Soldier card you reveal in your hand.)*

 Creature -- Sliver  
 3/3  
 Whenever a Sliver deals combat damage to a player, its controller may put a 1/1 colorless Sliver creature token into play.


\* The triggered ability is controlled by Brood Sliver's controller, but the controller of the Sliver that dealt damage chooses whether to put the token into play (under his or her control).


[Canopy Crawler](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Canopy+Crawler)  
![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227130050im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless3.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20220123123600im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/green.gif)

\* The second ability counts the number of +1/+1 counters on the Crawler when the ability resolves. If that number changes afterward, the bonus granted won't change.


[Celestial Gatekeeper](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Celestial+Gatekeeper)  
![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227130050im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless3.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227125855im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/white.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227125855im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/white.gif)  
 Creature -- Bird Cleric  
 2/2  
 Flying  
 When Celestial Gatekeeper is put into a graveyard from play, remove it from the game, then return up to two target Bird and/or Cleric cards from your graveyard to play.


\* You can target the Gatekeeper in your graveyard with its own ability, but it will be removed from the game before it can be returned to play. The other target will still be returned to play.

Turn it face up any time for its morph cost.)*  
 When Chromeshell Crab is turned face up, you may exchange control of target creature you control and target creature an opponent controls.


\* You don't have to exchange control of the Crab with your opponent's creature. You can exchange one of your other creatures with your opponent's creature.


\* Choose whether or not to make the exchange when the ability resolves.


[Dark Supplicant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dark+Supplicant)

[Daru Stinger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Daru+Stinger)  
![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227130050im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless3.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227125855im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/white.gif)

If you do, that player reveals X cards from his or her hand and you choose one of them. That player discards that card.

\* This Sliver gives the ability to your Slivers and all other players' Slivers.


\* Unlike other type-changing cards, [Mistform Sliver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mistform+Sliver)'s ability adds a creature type to the creature rather than replacing the creature's type.


\* Any number of types may be added by playing this ability multiple times. But if the creature's type is later changed by another spell or ability that replaces rather than adds types, that spell or ability will replace all the creature's previous types, including added types. ([Artificial Evolution](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Artificial+Evolution) would not replace all types this way, however. It replaces only one creature type.)

 Creature -- Illusion Legend  
 3/3  
 Mistform Ultimus is every creature type (even if this card isn't in play).  
 Mistform Ultimus may attack as though it weren't a Wall.


\* The types "Illusion" and "Legend" are printed on the card's type line purely for flavor. The Ultimus has every other creature type as well.


\* It's a Legend, so the Legend rule applies to it. It's also a Wall, so the Wall rule applies to it (although it has an ability that allows it to ignore this rule). It's also a Sliver, and so will gain all Sliver abilities.


\* [Artificial Evolution](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Artificial+Evolution) doesn't affect this creature's types at all, although changing the word "Wall" in the second ability to another type will prevent the Ultimus from attacking because it will still be a Wall.


\* Like any creature, if the Ultimus "becomes" another type as the result of a spell or ability, it will lose all its other creature types. For example, if your opponent uses [Imagecrafter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Imagecrafter) to turn your Ultimus into a Soldier, your Ultimus will be only a Soldier. All its other types will be lost for the rest of the turn.
