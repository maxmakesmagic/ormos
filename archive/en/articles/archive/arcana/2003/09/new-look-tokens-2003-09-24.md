[![Player Rewards program (click for more info)](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/dci/images/Magic_PlayerRewards_Logo.jpg)](http://archive.wizards.com/dci/rewards.asp?x=rewards)Two new tokens have been created for the Magic Player Rewards program, and those of you that have played in several tournaments lately may have gotten some in the mail already. The big news is that there has been a change in the token card frame to match the change in the normal card frames.

The first is an *Eighth Edition* Rukh token by Ed Beard, for use with the [Rukh Egg](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rukh+Egg) card.

The second is a *Mirrodin* Demon token by Pete Venters, for use with the [Promise of Power](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Promise+of+Power) card.
