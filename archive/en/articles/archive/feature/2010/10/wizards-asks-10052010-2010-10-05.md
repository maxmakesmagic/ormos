*What card or mechanic from* Scars of Mirrodin *are you most excited about building around in Constructed?*

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/mtgcom/authorpics/authorpic_kellydigges.jpg)**Kelly Digges:** A quick caveat about my Constructed habits: I don't play competitive Standard, and I never have. My Constructed decks these days are nearly all 100-card singleton EDH decks, and not even particularly competitive by the standards of that famously casual format. So I'm not going to pick whatever card or mechanic is going to tear up Standard or change the face of Extended. I'm going to pick something I think is hilarious. Namely, and appropriately for this week: proliferate.

Has there ever been a more open-ended, Johnny-friendly mechanic than proliferate? In *Scars* Limited, of course, it hooks up with poison counters, charge counters, and -1/-1 counters to make crazy things happen. But when you throw the door wide to the rest of **Magic**, the possibilities are ridiculous.

So many things get tracked with counters! +1/+1 counters. Time counters. Quest counters. Loyalty counters. It's been a few years since anybody [listed out](http://www.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/askwizards/0607#june4) all the various counter types in the game's history, and the list keeps growing. Proliferate misses out on counters that aren't on permanents or players (such as the time counters on suspended cards, or the hilariously weird charge counters on [Lightning Storm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Storm) when it's on the stack), but it interacts with nearly everything else that uses counters.

So what I'm going to do is put all the proliferate cards in an EDH deckâ€”I'm thinking green-black-blue with [Vorosh, the Hunter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vorosh%2C+the+Hunter) as my General, although I might decide that the black isn't needed and go with [Experiment Kraj](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Experiment+Kraj) instead. Throw in [Doubling Season](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Doubling+Season), [Gilder Bairn](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gilder+Bairn), [Clockspinning](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Clockspinning), planeswalkers, and any and every awesome thing I can lay hands on that puts counters on things.
