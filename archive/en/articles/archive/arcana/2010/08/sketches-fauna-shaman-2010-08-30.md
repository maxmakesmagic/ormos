Welcome back once to again to Sketches! Today's card is ***Magic** 2011*'s [Fauna Shaman](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fauna+Shaman), which has been making quite a splash in Standard.


### Artist Portfolio


Artist [Steve Prescott](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?action=advanced&artist=%5B%22Steve%20Prescott%22%5D) has illustrated 72 **Magic** cards. He's been in Sketches before, for [Enlisted Wurm](/en/articles/archive/sketches-enlisted-wurm-2009-06-08) and [Stonehewer Giant](/en/articles/archive/morningtide-sketches-2008-01-28).


### Art Description


The first step of the creation of a card's art is its art description. The art description tells the artist what the card will do, what its flavor is, and what the mood of the illustration should be. Here were the instructions Steve was given for [Fauna Shaman](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fauna+Shaman):



> 
> Color: Green creature
> 
> 
> Action: Show a beautiful female elven shaman in the woods. She's performing a ceremony in sacred garb that has many animal elements -- feathers, claws, bits of fur, and small animal fetishes crafted from these animal elements.
> 
> 
> Mood: She's in touch with the mysteries of the woodland animals 
> 
> 
> 


### Sketch


Armed with that art description, Steve submitted a sketch to **Magic**'s creative team:

Looks great, right? Right! Let's see the final version.


### Final Art

We'd like to be able to claim that the toad is the same one from Lars Grant-West's [Goblin Balloon Brigade](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Balloon+Brigade) ... so we will! So what if it probably wasn't intentional and neither Lars nor Steve (nor anyone in the creative team) has signed off on this claim?


### Finished Card


And here's what the effigy in question looks like in ***Magic** 2011* packs:
