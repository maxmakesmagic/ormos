**Number of Pro Tours played:** 0


**Biggest Magic success:** Member of Alkaatch Team


**Constructed result in this tournament:** 12-1-2


**How did you prepare for the tournament?** I tested this and a few other decks with the rest of the team in our favourite pub called "Hottlek"!


**Which deck did you choose and why?** Faeries is just a good deck. And it is a blast to play and it's fun to ambush people with unexpected flash creatures usually played in limited only.

 [Eyes of the Wisent](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eyes+of+the+Wisent)
 in their sideboards

**Which deck did you choose and why?** G/R Mana Ramp with
 [Tarmogoyf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf)
 s, because it seemed like it bould bring the best threads on the table pretty early. Only real bad matchups are decks with a lot of counterspells in them. The synergy between
 [Fertile Ground](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fertile+Ground)
 ,
 [Garruk Wildspeaker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Garruk+Wildspeaker)

 [Siege-Gang Commander](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Siege-Gang+Commander)

**Residence:** Highlands Ranch, Colorado


**Occupation:** Level 5 Magician

**Constructed result in this tournament:** 12-2-1


**How did you prepare for the tournament?** Played States and built the deck that seemed to have a chance against G/B... but actually it turned out that I can't beat the deck


**Which deck did you choose and why?** Liked Pickles lock as it doesn't take so much to just win. It also has some matchups that it can't lose to. We added white to the deck because I felt
 [Oblivion Ring](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oblivion+Ring)
 was quite strong and a good way to deal with Planeswalkers.
 [Wrath of God](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wrath+of+God)
 is nice too
