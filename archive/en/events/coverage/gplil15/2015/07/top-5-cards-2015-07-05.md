[Molten Vortex](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Molten+Vortex) probably deserves an honorable mention here because it definitely was among the cards most talked about this weekend. But when you get down to what actually mattered the most at Grand Prix Lille and shaped the tournament, there's just no escaping the following five ...


### 5.) Young Pyromancer

While the young'un may not itself have been the most played creature, it surely was responsible for the most creatures we've seen on the tables of the feature match area during the weekend. Thanks to cheap or even free (well, free-ish) spells like [Brainstorm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brainstorm), [Gitaxian Probe](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gitaxian+Probe), and [Force of Will](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Force+of+Will), many a game ended with a whole bunch of Elementals charging across the battlefield.

### 4.) Dark Depths


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Dark+Depths)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dark+Depths)
In a somewhat forced segue, we now go from the most to the most massive. Except for some extreme cases of [Knight of the Reliquary](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Knight+of+the+Reliquary), Marit Lage was undisputedly the biggest creature around. And the token was busy! Players like Branco Neirynck and quarterfinalist Alex Mortimer used the combination of [Dark Depths](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dark+Depths) and [Thespian's Stage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thespian%27s+Stage) to great effect in the feature match area all weekend long.

### 3.) Dig Through Time


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Dig+Through+Time)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dig+Through+Time)
The delve mechanic continues to play a huge role in the format. Lots of different decks, from Delver to Miracles, included [Dig Through Time](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dig+Through+Time), and quarterfinalists Thomas Van der Paelt and Petr Soch≈Ørek listed it as the best card in their respective decks. It may have even been the main reason for the current surge in popularity of Omni-Tell, seeing as the card is both so very good at assembling [Show and Tell](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Show+and+Tell) plus [Omniscience](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Omniscience) and great once [Omniscience](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Omniscience) hits the battlefield.

### 2.) Sensei's Divining Top


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Sensei%27s+Divining+Top)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sensei%27s+Divining+Top)
Miracles had already claimed the top two spots at the previous Legacy Grand Prix, in Kyoto earlier this year. In what can only be described as a miracle, it did the same here. And [Sensei's Divining Top](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sensei%27s+Divining+Top) is the central element that holds the deck together. Not only does it combine perfectly with [Counterbalance](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterbalance) to create a soft lock, it also reliably enables players to empty the board with [Terminus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Terminus) and later fill it via [Entreat the Angels](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Entreat+the+Angels) at bargain prices.

### 1.) Monastery Mentor


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Monastery+Mentor)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Monastery+Mentor)
When all was said and done, though, an unusual version of Miracles took the title. While finalist Olivier Ruel had chosen a stock version of Miracles that he himself described as "not that good," champion Claudio Bonanni put away his [Entreat the Angels](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Entreat+the+Angels) and relied on [Monastery Mentor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Monastery+Mentor) as his main finisher instead. This added another dimension to the strategy: he didn't need to control everything, he could just as well smash face. And [Monastery Mentor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Monastery+Mentor) does so pretty well, especially when your deck can cycle a pair of [Sensei's Divining Top](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sensei%27s+Divining+Top)s between library, hand, stack, and battlefield ...
