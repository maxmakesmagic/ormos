*Time Spiral's* timeshifted cards were reprints, literally snapshots of **Magic**'s past:

*Planar Chaos's* timeshifted cards depicted worlds from bizarre alternate realities:

*Future Sight's* timeshifted cards represent sneak peeks at **Magic**'s possible futures. [Edge of Autumn](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Edge+of+Autumn) is a good example—it's a scene of a beautiful forest composed of thousand-foot-tall trees in a world yet unknown. Although Magic hasn't visited this plane yet—and may never do—it's full of rich detail thanks to the concept and art.


As autumn comes to this forest of skyscraping old-growth, the druids who live there gain a new kind of transportation. A druid rides an enormous falling leaf from one level of the forest to another (a detail symbolic of the "sacrifice a land" cost on the cycling ability). Armed with that concept, the artist came up with this:

The art is by Jean-Sébastien Rossbach, one of the new artists that Art Director Jeremy Jarvis brought on to create the "many worlds" impression of *Future Sight*.
