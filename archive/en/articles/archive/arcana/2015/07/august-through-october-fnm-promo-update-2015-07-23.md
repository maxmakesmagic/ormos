Blake is the content manager for DailyMTG.com, making him the one you should email if you have thoughts on the website, good or less good (or not good). He's a longtime coverage reporter and hasn't turned down a game of Magic in any format ever. 






The month is nearly over, so once again it’s time to take a trip in our Friday Night Magic time machine and see what promos we have in store for the coming months.


**August**



Do you see? Do you see? Your vision of the future will be 20/20 come August, when [Serum Visions](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Serum+Visions)—with art by Dan Scott—comes to an FNM near you.

**September**



The trip back to Standard will be softened with this sturdy Bird Monk, [Orator of Ojutai](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Orator+of+Ojutai)—the Dragoniest [Wall of Omens](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wall+of+Omens) ever. You'll be able to get your copy come September, whether you choose to employ Dragons or some other inferior creatures to do so.

What's in the bag? WHAT'S IN THE BAG?!?!



The spookiest month gets a spooky upgrade to [Ultimate Price](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ultimate+Price) with new art by Scott Murphy. Look away if you're squeamish, because John Doe has the upper hand.
