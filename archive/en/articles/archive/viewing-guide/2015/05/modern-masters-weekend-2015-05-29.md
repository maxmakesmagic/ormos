The live video coverage of *Modern Masters* Weekend begins with Day One, Round 1 of [Grand Prix Chiba](http://magic.wizards.com/en/content/fact-sheet-grand-prix-chiba-2015)'s main event on the [Twitch *Magic* channel](http://www.twitch.tv/magic) at the following times, based on your time zone:



**Friday at 7 p.m. PT**


**Friday at 10 p.m. ET**

**Saturday at 4 a.m. CET**

While Grand Prix Chiba is going on, [Grand Prix Utrecht](http://magic.wizards.com/en/content/fact-sheet-grand-prix-utrecht-2015) coverage will be kicking off over on the [Twitch *Magic*2 channel](http://www.twitch.tv/magic2) at the following times, based on your time zone:



**Saturday at 2 a.m. PT**


**Saturday at 5 a.m. ET**


**Saturday at 9 a.m. UTC**


**Saturday at 11 a.m. Local Time (CET)**


**Saturday at 6 p.m. JST**



Grand Prix Chiba will still be streaming when GP Utrecht coverage begins, giving you double the *Magic* to watch for a few hours.

Double the *Magic* is taken to a new level with Vegas. [Grand Prix Las Vegas](http://magic.wizards.com/en/content/fact-sheet-grand-prix-las-vegas-2015) is of such an epic size that it will consist of *two* main events rather than one! You can catch all of the action from the first main event starting with Round 1 on the [Twitch *Magic* channel](http://www.twitch.tv/magic#_blank) at the following times:



**Saturday at 11 a.m. Local Time (PT)**


**Saturday at 2 p.m. ET**


**Saturday at 6 p.m. UTC**


**Saturday at 8 p.m. CET**


**Sunday at 3 a.m. JST**



Meanwhile, you can catch all of the action of the second GP Vegas main event from our friends at [ChannelFireball](http://www.twitch.tv/channelfireball), where they'll be bringing dedicated coverage of that event all weekend.

**Day Two**



Day Two of the *Modern Masters* Weekend main events will see a bit of a shift of where each event will air, so pay attention!

Day Two of Grand Prix Chiba will stream on the [Twitch *Magic*2 channel](http://www.twitch.tv/magic2) (NOTE: that is different from Day One) at the following times:



**Saturday at 5 p.m. PT**
