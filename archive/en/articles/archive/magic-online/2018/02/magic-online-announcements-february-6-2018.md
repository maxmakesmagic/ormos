Team Modern Super League Kicks Off Tonight
------------------------------------------


The wait is over! (Whew. It's been a long week.) Tonight marks the first episode of Team Modern Super League, which will stream live at [twitch.tv/magic](https://www.twitch.tv/magic) starting at 5 p.m. PT every Tuesday for the next several weeks. Three-person teams, made up of beloved personalities from the *Magic* community, will face off in a "conqueror"-style tournament where both decks *and* players can be eliminated. Even those with a deep well of Modern experience will be tested by the novel format, and we're just about guaranteed to see some wild new lines of play.
