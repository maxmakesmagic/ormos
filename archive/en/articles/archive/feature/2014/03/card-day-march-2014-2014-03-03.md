Card of the Day - March, 2014
=============================



 Posted in **Feature**
 on March 3, 2014

By Mike McArtor




 Mike first played with Ice Age and became the copy editor for DailyMTG.com in December 2011. Before DailyMTG, he was an editor on D&D's Dragon magazine for four years. 









![Sip of Hemlock](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Sip+of+Hemlock)
  
**[Sip of Hemlock](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sip+of+Hemlock)** – *Theros*. As befitting a plane based off Greek mythology, Theros is home to numerous oracles (including the [Oracle of Theros](https://twitter.com/OracleOfTheros)), as mentioned in the flavor text. Part 2 of the "[Planeswalker's Guide to *Theros*](https://www.wizards.com/magic/magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/feature/262c)" talks about Meletian and Setessan oracles, as well as the sphinx, [Medomai](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Medomai). Uncharted Realms also presented a story about Iris, "[The Oracle of Ephara](http://www.wizards.com/magic/magazine/article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/ur/291)." 
 


![Frozen Shade](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Frozen+Shade)
  
**[Frozen Shade](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=3846)** – *Fifth Edition*. Building a Commander deck with all [twenty-six Shades](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&subtype=+%5BShade%5D) will require three colors: [twenty-four Shades are mono-black](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&subtype=+%5BShade%5D&color=+%40%28+%5BB%5D%29), [one is black-red](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=one+is+black-red), and [one is white](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=one+is+white). With [one](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=one) exception, Shades can be pumped up by feeding mana into them. This usually comes in +1/+1 increments until end of turn, but sometimes it's +2/+2, and in [one case](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=one+case) it's +1/+1 counters.
 


![Goblin Snowman](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Goblin+Snowman)
  
**[Goblin Snowman](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Snowman)** – *Ice Age*. This isn't the only *Ice Age* card that features a quote from the goblin tactician, Ib Halfheart. In fact, [there were five](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&flavor=+%5BIb%5D+%5BHalfheart%5D&set=+%5B%22Ice+Age%22%5D) cards he talked on, with [a sixth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=a+sixth) added in *Coldsnap*. Later, in *Time Spiral*, [Goblin Snowman](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Snowman) was reprinted as a "Timeshifted" card—a subset of reprints unique to that set—and was joined by [Ib Halfheart, Goblin Tactician](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ib+Halfheart%2C+Goblin+Tactician), who finally got his own card. 
 


![Winter's Chill](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Winter%27s+Chill)
  
**[Winter's Chill](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Winter%27s+Chill)** – *Ice Age*. At its release in 1995, *Ice Age* was the largest set ever, with 383 cards, and the game's first true standalone expansion. It was also the first set to have an official Prerelease—just one, which took place in Toronto. The set came out before the concept of blocks had formalized into the three-set model, so while *Alliances* made a great sequel, it wasn't until *Coldsnap*, a decade later, that the *Ice Age* block officially gained its third set of the block. 
 


![Hold at Bay](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Hold+at+Bay)
  
**[Hold at Bay](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hold+at+Bay)** – *Born of the Gods*. Odunos is no place for the living—it is a necropolis filled with [greedy, violent, resentful Returned](http://www.wizards.com/magic/magazine/article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/feature/263c) and stands in stark contrast to the dull but generally peaceful Asphodel. The art description emphasizes that by calling for a lone Meletian to be surrounded by Returned. It says: "They stand as if waiting for the spell to disappear so they can strike down the warrior." And of the mood: "Eerie. 'I have to get out of here.'" 
 


![Sisters of Stone Death](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Sisters+of+Stone+Death)
  
**[Sisters of Stone Death](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sisters+of+Stone+Death)** – *Ravnica: City of Guilds*. The sisters were once [the guild leaders of the Golgari](http://www.wizards.com/Magic/TCG/Article.aspx?x=magic/ravnica/golgari), but the elven shaman Savra sought to challenge them for the position. With *Return to Ravnica*, both the sisters and Savra were gone, [replaced in the role by Savra's brother, Jarad](https://www.wizards.com/magic/magazine/article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/feature/211c). 
 


![Spellweaver Helix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Spellweaver+Helix)
  
**[Spellweaver Helix](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spellweaver+Helix)** – *Mirrodin*. The combination of [Worldfire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Worldfire) and [Spellweaver Helix](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spellweaver+Helix) first came up  [during ***Magic** 2013*  previews](http://www.wizards.com/magic/magazine/article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/ftl/202) , and it reappeared in [a Modern-legal deck](http://www.wizards.com/magic/magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/deck/1378) just this past December. The card has been appearing in decks for years, though, including [another From the Labs article](https://www.wizards.com/magic/magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/ftl/119) and [one from House of Cards](/en/articles/archive/triple-helix-2004-04-22). [It even appeared](/en/articles/archive/building-budget/bit-stretch-2009-04-02) in [a couple competitive decks](/en/articles/archive/building-budget/weaving-another-spell-2009-04-09) written about by Jacob Van Lunen. 
 


![87908](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&multiverseid=87908)
  
**[Lightning Helix"](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=87908)** – *Ravnica: City of Guilds*. [Lightning Helix](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Helix) is most famous for its appearance at Pro Tour Honolulu, in 2006. In the Top 8, eventual finalist Craig Jones had to defeat Hall of Famer Olivier Ruel in the semifinals. His victory there came with what is called "[Topdeck of the Century](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vZv7ijdK2g)." In Game 5, Ruel was going to win if he had another turn, but Craig was able to deal lethal damage by drawing a [Lightning Helix](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Helix) right when he needed it most. 
 


![Helix Pinnacle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Helix+Pinnacle)
  
**[Helix Pinnacle](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Helix+Pinnacle)** – *Born of the Gods*. The [eighteen cards](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&text=+%5Bif%5D+%5Byou%5D+%5Bwin%5D+%5Bthe%5D+%5Bgame%5D+!%5Bante%5D+!%5Bcan%27t%5D&format=+!%5BUn-sets%5D%20) like [Helix Pinnacle](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Helix+Pinnacle)—called alternative win conditions—reward players dedicated to their difficult-to-achieve prerequisites with automatic victory. Among tournament-legal cards, [Battle of Wits](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Battle+of+Wits) was the first to include a hundreds-number numeral (in that case, "200") in its text box, and so far, [Helix Pinnacle](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Helix+Pinnacle) is [the only other card to do so](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&text=+%5B00%5D&format=+!%5BUn-sets%5D). 
 


![Warleader's Helix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Warleader%27s+Helix)
  
**[Warleader's Helix](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Warleader%27s+Helix)** – *Dragon's Maze*. The Warleader here is Aurelia, leader of [the Boros guild](http://www.wizards.com/magic/magazine/article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/feature/224). While [her Helix](https://www.wizards.com/magic/magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/td/243) sees [some discussion](/en/articles/archive/latest-developments/breaking-mirrors-2013-04-19), she sees more. Aurelia has been mentioned in numerous Uncharted Realms stories—"[Krenko, Mob Boss](http://www.wizards.com/magic/magazine/article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/ur/204)," "[The Greater Good](http://www.wizards.com/magic/magazine/article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/ur/233)," "[Battle for the Ninth](http://www.wizards.com/magic/magazine/article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/ur/252)," and last week's " [The Gorgon and the *Guildpact*](http://www.wizards.com/magic/magazine/article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/ur/290)"—and Gavin Verhey also previewed her card for Commander in [this ReConstructed article](http://www.wizards.com/magic/magazine/article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/rc/229). 
 


![Retraction Helix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Retraction+Helix)
  
**[Retraction Helix](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Retraction+Helix)** – *Born of the Gods*. The flavor text here mentions "Æther," something in the name of [thirty-six cards](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&name=+%5b%u00c6ther%5d) (including [Witches' Eye](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Witches%27+Eye) – *Born of the Gods*. On Monday, we talked about [Eye Gouge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eye+Gouge), which was designed for *Theros* but moved back to *Born of the Gods*. Today's card went the opposite direction, starting in the design file for the later set but being plucked into the earlier. As Sam Stoddard explains in " [The M Files: *Theros*](/en/articles/archive/latest-developments/m-files-theros-2013-11-08)," it was put into *Theros* to help the blue-red Limited-deck archetype activate [Flamespeaker Adept](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flamespeaker+Adept) more easily. 
 


![Gods' Eye, Gate to the Reikai](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Gods%27+Eye%2C+Gate+to+the+Reikai)
  
**[Gods' Eye, Gate to the Reikai](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gods%27+Eye%2C+Gate+to+the+Reikai)** – *Betrayers of Kamigawa*. Reikai means "spirit world" (霊界). It's a nod to the original name of the block and setting, Inreikai ([as revealed here](/en/articles/archive/latest-developments/creative-side-kamigawa-2005-02-18)), or "World of Shadowy Spirits" (陰霊界). (Special thanks to Ron Foster, premier play TO manager [formerly Japan territory manager], for today's entry.) 
 


![Eye of Ugin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Eye+of+Ugin)
  
**[Eye of Ugin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eye+of+Ugin)** – *Worldwake*. [Eye of Ugin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eye+of+Ugin) – *Worldwake*. Not only was it the first mythic rare land, [Eye of Ugin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eye+of+Ugin) also presented the first mention of Eldrazi in the game... the set before the first [Eldrazi cards](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&subtype=+%5B%22Eldrazi%22%5D) saw print! Read more about the card's creation in "[Commonly Large](/en/articles/archive/latest-developments/commonly-large-2010-04-09)" and about the story of the Eye in "[The Eldrazi Arisen](http://www.wizards.com/magic/magazine/article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/feature/84)." 
 


![Eye of Doom](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Eye+of+Doom)
  
**[Eye of Doom](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eye+of+Doom)** – *Commander* (2013 Edition). [Eye of Doom](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eye+of+Doom)'s "destroy each permanent" effect is similar to, but not as limited as, that of [Oblivion Stone](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oblivion+Stone), from *Mirrodin*—which uses fate counters instead of doom counters. There is one other card that places doom counters. That card? [Armageddon Clock](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Armageddon+Clock), from *Antiquities*, although its effect is quite different from that of the Eye. 
 


![Eye Gouge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Eye+Gouge)
  
**[Eye Gouge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eye+Gouge)** – *Born of the Gods*. For a fairly low-powered common, there is a lot written about this flavorful card. The "[*Born of the Gods* Release Notes](/en/node/633841) " clarify its rules thusly: "If the target creature is a Cyclops, it will get -1/-1 before it's destroyed." Mark Rosewater explains its design in "[Born to be Compiled, Part 1](/en/articles/archive/making-magic/born-be-compiled-part-1-2014-01-27-0)." And Sam Stoddard references the card's Multiverse discussion in " [The M Files: *Born of the Gods*](/en/articles/archive/latest-developments/m-files-born-gods-2014-02-14-0)." 
 


![Reaper King](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Reaper+King)
  
**[Reaper King](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reaper+King)** – *Shadowmoor*. Scarecrows (obviously), Changelings, and [Mistform Ultimus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mistform+Ultimus)—the original "every creature type" creature—are all permanent-destroying enablers that also benefit from the King's +1/+1 buff. As you might imagine, [Reaper King](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reaper+King) sees play in Commander, as [Gavin Verhey has shown](https://www.wizards.com/magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/rc/196) in his column, ReConstructed, but the King *also* saw play in the first Modern Pro Tour—[Philadelphia, 2011](/en/articles/archive/event-coverage/modern-deck-lists-s-z-2011-09-04). 
 


![Altar's Reap](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Altar%27s+Reap)
  
**[Altar's Reap](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Altar%27s+Reap)** – *Innistrad*. Even before Avacyn was drawn into the Helvault, creating the conditions introduced to us in *Innistrad*, the demon-worshipping Skirsdag cult existed on the eponymous plane. Volpaig was a minor bishop in the Church of Avacyn, and as the time of Avacyn's absence lengthened, he became increasingly open about his membership. Read more about Volpaig, the Church, and the Skirsdag in "[A Planeswalker's Guide to Innistrad](http://www.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/stf/157)" and "[The State of the Faith](https://www.wizards.com/Magic/magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/stf/179)." 
 


![373570](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&multiverseid=373570)
  
**[Reaper of the Wilds](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reaper+of+the+Wilds)** – *Theros*. There are currently [thirteen Gorgons](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&subtype=+%5B%22Gorgon%22%5D) in **Magic**. Every Gorgon is at least black, and [five are multicolor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&subtype=+%5B%22Gorgon%22%5D&color=+%5E%28+%5BB%5D%29) in the colors of Golgari (black and green), with one of those five ([Damia, Sage of Stone](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Damia%2C+Sage+of+Stone)) also being blue. Read more about **Magic**'s Gorgons and the creatures of myth in [this Arcana](/en/articles/archive/monster-menagerie-gorgons-2014-02-19-0). 
 


![Reaper of Sheoldred](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Reaper+of+Sheoldred)
  
**[Reaper of Sheoldred](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reaper+of+Sheoldred+)**  – *New Phyrexia*. The reaper is part of Sheoldred's vast network of spies, scouts, blackmailers, and informers. Sheoldred herself is a Praetor of Phyrexia, although her hold is tenuous thanks to the machinations of the other six Steel Thanes. The Seven Steel Thanes rule the Phyrexian faction associated with black mana. Learn more at "[A Planeswalker's Guide to New Phyrexia: The Steel Thanes](http://www.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/stf/138)." 
 


![Reap What Is Sown](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Reap+What+Is+Sown)
  
**[Reap What Is Sown](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reap+What+Is+Sown+)**  – *Born of the Gods*. A few weeks ago, [Trick Jarrett looked closely at this card's art](/en/articles/archive/grain-reaper-2014-02-05-0) and talked a little about the long tradition of farming-related cards in **Magic**. There are enough such pastoral cards in **Magic** to build a Commander deck, as Adam Styborski found out in [this Command Tower article](http://www.wizards.com/magic/magazine/article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/ct/284).
