With approximately a thousand players in the room, there's no chance we could tell you about the whole of the Day 1 metagame. Something we can tell you about, however, are the deck choices of all 10 players who had three byes. Here in Stockholm, this group consists of:




* No. 5 ranked Ivan Floch
* No. 10 ranked Stanislav Cifka
* Platinum pro Patrick Dickmann
* Platinum pro Martin Juza
* Gold pro Valentin Mackl
* Gold pro Pierre Dagen
* Gold pro Christian Seibold
* Gold pro Matej Zatlkaj
* Hall of Famer Olle Rade
* Hall of Famer Nicolai Herzog


Here's the archetype breakdown of what these players are playing:






|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Jeskai | 2 |
| Mardu Midrange | 1 |
| G/B Enchantress | 1 |
| Green Devotion | 1 |
| U/B Control | 1 |
| Temur Aggro | 1 |
| B/W Aggro | 1 |
| Abzan Aggro | 1 |
| Sidisi-Whip | 1 |



There is no consensus at all! With so many different archetypes being represented, the format appears to be appears to be wide open. More on Sunday, when we have a detailed breakdown of all Day 2 decks for you.
