With each new **Magic** set we get to show off a handful of new tokens that we're printing. Usually this is four or maybe five new tokens. For *Modern Masters* we are creating a slew of tokens to support the cards, some of which are token cards that are being made for the first time ever!


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/arcana/arc1244_17_zqtwqisn2i.png)Behold the mighty Giant Warrior! Originally printed for *Morningtide*, it is back again but with all new art!


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/arcana/arc1244_3_zqtwqisn2i.png)There have been two Faerie Rogue tokens made, one as mono-black in *Morningtide*, and the Blue-Black token in *Shadowmoor*. This is the latter brought up to *Modern Masters*.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/arcana/arc1244_16_zqtwqisn2i.png)Another *Lorwyn* token!


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/arcana/arc1244_15_zqtwqisn2i.png)Here are our valiant white Soldier tokens from *Scars of Mirrodin*. I really love this art.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/arcana/arc1244_13_zqtwqisn2i.png)We've made 2/2 Illusion tokens before during *Zendikar* but this is the first time we've done a 1/1.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/arcana/arc1244_12_zqtwqisn2i.png)And here is a completely new token! Bats have been around **Magic** for a while but they've never had a token card printed in any shape. Until now.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/arcana/arc1244_11_zqtwqisn2i.png)Here's a *Lorwyn* token with new art!


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/arcana/arc1244_10_zqtwqisn2i.png)Now here's a brand new token! We've done 1/2 green Spider tokens before but this is the first time we've done one for black and as a 2/4.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/arcana/arc1244_9_zqtwqisn2i.png)We've seen a lot of Zombie tokens over the years; this one comes from ***Magic** 2010* and ***Magic** 2011* and now *Modern Masters*.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/arcana/arc1244_8_zqtwqisn2i.png)Who doesn't love the 4/4 Flying red Dragon? The 1/1 white Soldiers, that's who.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/arcana/arc1244_7_zqtwqisn2i.png)Goblins, goblins, goblins. This Goblin token was introduced in *10th Edition* and has been used quite a few times since then.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/arcana/arc1244_6_zqtwqisn2i.png)There are Elemental tokens of many colors and sizes. This 4/4 green Elemental token comes from *Lorwyn*.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/arcana/arc1244_5_zqtwqisn2i.png)There have been numerous Saproling tokens made over **Magic**'s history, most recently for *Return to Ravnica*. This is the Saproling token art from the *Duel Decks: Phyrexia vs. The Coalition*.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/arcana/arc1244_4_zqtwqisn2i.png)Originally we printed the Treefolk Shaman token in *Morningtide*, but here is some new art for the Treefolk Shaman token!


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/arcana/arc1244_2_zqtwqisn2i.png)This token art was originally released in *Eventide* for [Worm Harvest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Worm+Harvest). However, unlike *Eventide*, [Worm Harvest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Worm+Harvest) is now an uncommon, rather than being a rare.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/arcana/arc1244_1_zqtwqisn2i.png)And we wrap this up with *Modern Masters*'s new [Elspeth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elspeth) emblem card! While she was the first Planeswalker who gave players emblems, we did not make an emblem card until the *Duel Decks: Venser vs. Koth*, which had an emblem for [Venser](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Venser).
