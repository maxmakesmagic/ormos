**Blue-Green Tempo - 11**  

with Red - 10  

no splash - 1


One of the most popular decks in the initial field, it seemed to do just fine on Day 1.


**Blue-Black-Red Control - 10**


This was a distant second behind Go-mar variants as far as popularity, but this was the control archetype that had the best Saturday. Two of the five undefeated players ran it.


**The Solution - 10**  

U-W - 8  

Dark Solution- 2


Here's another deck that seems to have a bigger chunk of the day 2 field than it had of the day 1 field. This results could be skewed, though, by the fact that so many "name" players ran it: Mowshowitz, Benafel, Jensen, et al had three byes and they have mad skills.


**RG Beats - 7**


The Tokyo throwback beatdown deck had a solid, but unspectacular performance on day 1.


**U-W-B (Go-mar) - 5**


This deck was one of the most popular on day 1, but did not get the job done for most of the players who ran it.


**U-W-R Control - 5**


There weren't a lot of these in the initial field, so this might be a deck to keep an eye on. It addition, this is the archetype that won Grand Prix Kobe. Bob Maher is one of the five players taking this deck into battle.


**U-W-R Aggro - 4**


This is the archetype that did so well on day 1 in Kobe, but it's stock is falling rapidly.


**Domain - 3**


Two of these are the only two copies of Brian Kibler's new Dark Domain deck.


**R-B-W Good Stuff - 3**


Two of these abuse Phyrexian Arena, while the third is a much more aggressive, weenie-based build.


**G-W-U Hippo - 3**


Not the most popular deck or the one with the most spectacular performance so far, but the winged hippos just refuse to go away.


UGB control - 1  

WGB Good Stuff - 1  

RGB Good Stuff - 1


The three-color good stuff decks didn't fare very well on day 1.
