The Daily *Magic* Update is a roundup of everything *Magic* you should know on February 15, 2017. Today's Update is brought to you by [Siege Modification](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Siege+Modification) and [the hopes and dreams of Vehicle enthusiasts everywhere](#10).


Today's Must
============


1. [Art Book Reviews: A Review of *Magic* Art in 2016](http://www.gatheringmagic.com/mikelinnemann-02152017-art-book-reviews-a-review-of-magic-art-in-2016/) | Gathering Magic | Mike Linnemann

There's a lot going on in this article, but the primary thrust of it is a review of the book *The Art of Magic: The Gathering—Kaladesh*. Almost no one in the community is as passionate about these things as Linnemann, so if you're curious about the art books, this is a good place to start.


After That, Read, Watch, or Listen to These
===========================================


1. [Commander VS: Random Partners!](http://www.starcitygames.com/article/34563_Commander-VS-Random-Partners.html) | StarCityGames.com | Justin Parnell and Stephen Green

This week's Commander VS. challenge: each player is randomly assigned two commanders with the partner mechanic and makes a deck with them! Some make less sense than others, and one even makes a ton of sense ([Ludevic](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ludevic%2C+Necro-Alchemist) and his [Opus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kraum%2C+Ludevic%27s+Opus)?), but they all make one thing for sure—fun.


That, ladies and gentlemen, is the cheesiest line I've ever written. And that's a high bar to clear.


1. [Straying from Staples with TheMagicManSam](http://collected.company/2017/02/14/straying-staples-themagicmansam-146/) | The Command Zone | Josh Lee Kwai and Jimmy Wong

There have been a recent influx of Commander pieces talking about staying away from certain cards that "always" get played in Commander—your [Sol Ring](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sol+Ring), your [Kodama's Reach](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kodama%27s+Reach), your [Wrath of God](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wrath+of+God)—to try to find new, creative ways to solve the same quandaries. [TheMagicManSam](https://www.youtube.com/user/themagicmansam33), he of the awesome art videos, joins The Command Zone to talk about ditching the staples and getting creative.


1. [More Ways to Play *Magic: The Gathering* In-Store](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuOj5_s1t40) | MTG: Young Mage

Sure, other YouTubers might talk about [Elaine Chase's recent article on new ways to play in local game stores](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/news/whats-store-store-play-2017-02-13), but none of them will be nearly as adorable while doing so. Sorry, Evan Erwin.

Community Spotlight
===================


1. [Twitch.tv/pantheonmagic](https://www.twitch.tv/pantheonmagic)

Since [Pro Tour *Aether Revolt*](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/ptaer), The Pantheon—the group of *Magic* players who, more or less, make up Team D3 Go! and Team Puzzle Quest, including such greats as Jon Finkel and Reid Duke—has started regularly streaming *Magic*. You can see their calendar of [who's streaming and when right here](http://www.powwow.gg/users/pantheonmagic/events). You're going to be hard-pressed to find a collection of more talented players all playing on one channel for your entertainment and education. For example, Reid Duke will be streaming today at 5 p.m. ET/2 p.m. PT.


What to Watch Tonight
=====================


1. Magic Mics | Erin Campbell, Evan Erwin, and Reuben Bresler | [twitch.tv/magicmics](https://www.twitch.tv/magicmics) | 11 p.m. ET/8 p.m. PT

One week after nearly dying of Ebola or something (the flu), Magic Mics returns tonight to talk about all things *Magic*.


Top 25
======


1. Tiu Moves Up. Nelson into the Top 10

While [Grand Prix Pittsburgh](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/gppit17) left the Top 8 in the standings unscathed, there was some jostling throughout the rest of the Top 25.


At the closest to the top we're going to get today, Brad Nelson continues to march upward, moving into the Top 10 players in the world just ahead of Kentaro Yamamoto and No. 11 Alexander Hayne.


A little further down, everyone's kid brother who's better than them at *Magic*, Oliver Tiu, is now up five spots—the biggest move of the week—to No. 15. The next biggest mover was Matt Nass, who slid up three spots to No. 18.

What People Are Talking About
=============================


1. [[Standard] GP Pittsburgh Report—28th with Mardu Vehicles](https://www.reddit.com/r/spikes/comments/5u6xdr/standard_gp_pittsburgh_report_28th_with_mardu/) | Ari Lax

There seems to be a new trend of writing high-level tournament reports on Reddit in r/spikes (a forum dedicated to competitive *Magic*). First we had the winner of Pro Tour *Aether Revolt*, now we have Ari Lax, a former Pro Tour winner, writing a tournament report about a Grand Prix in which he went 12-3. Come for the Mardu Vehicles stories, stay for the old-school props and slops ending.

This is in reference to [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGhek3IXAtM) done by Maria Bartholdi and published yesterday. If you love art, both Maria's video and April's collection are worth checking out.


Deck of the Day
===============


1. [Siege Modification Combo](http://www.mtgmintcard.com/articles/writers/kelvin-chew/4-brews-that-didnt-make-it-to-pt-aether-revolt)

Yesterday, Kelvin Chew shared four brews team MTG Mint Card tried out for Pro Tour *Aether Revolt* that couldn't quite get there. One of the most out-there was a [Siege Modification](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Siege+Modification) deck that sought to suit up a [Consulate Dreadnought](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Consulate+Dreadnought) as early as turn three to attack with a 10/11 first striker.


Ultimately, the abandoned the deck because [Fatal Push](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fatal+Push) is very good against it, as is artifact destruction—but, man, it's really cool. If crashing in with giant Vehicles is your thing, give this one a first, second, and third look.
