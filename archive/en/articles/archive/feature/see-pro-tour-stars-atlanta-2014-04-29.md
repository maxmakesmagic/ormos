Come to Atlanta and witness the culmination of the *Theros* block at Pro Tour *Journey into Nyx*. Held May 16–18 at the Cobb Galleria Centre, the Pro Tour provides the opportunity for **Magic** fans to see the best players in the world up close and personal as they battle on the game's biggest stage. 


 The hall layout for Pro Tour *Journey into Nyx* is configured both with a viewing area to watch the live video stream and with significantly more rail space in the main play area. This allows fans to be able to watch their favorite players every round, getting incredible access to see the full *Theros* block in action in both the *Theros* Block Constructed and *Theros*/*Born of the Gods*/*Journey into Nyx* Booster Draft formats. 


Friday begins with three rounds of Booster Draft followed by five rounds of Block Constructed. Then, the field is cut down to the players with four or more wins and that same schedule is repeated on Saturday before the Pro Tour is reduced to the Top 8, where the players will face off with their Block Constructed decks.


 The event hall features a full slate of activities and access to make this a can't-miss **Magic** experience. A merchandise booth is open Thursday–Sunday, where players and fans alike can purchase the exclusive, limited-edition Pro Tour *Journey into Nyx* playmat. The booth will also be selling current **Magic** booster packs, accessories, single cards, **Magic** t-shirts, and more.

 Popular **Magic** cosplayer Christine Sprankle will be making her return to the Pro Tour scene as Elspeth, Chandra, Liliana, and a special mystery character. She will be available Friday, Saturday, and Sunday for photos and to meet fans. 


Here's a rundown of the scheduled spectator events at the Pro Tour:


* **Friday—R&D Design Panel:** Ethan Fleischer and Ian Duke from **Magic** R&D talk about the design and development of *Journey into Nyx* and answer your questions. This will begin at approximately 2 p.m., starting a few minutes after the end of Round 3.
* **Saturday—VIP Drafting:** Sign up at the Event Host desk for your chance to draft with Pro Tour Hall of Famer Mike Turian, Ethan Fleischer, and Ian Duke. Drafts fire at 2 p.m. and 6 p.m., with space extremely limited!
* **Saturday and Sunday—Tokenize Yourself:** Get your face immortalized on a Minotaur or Snake token creature!
