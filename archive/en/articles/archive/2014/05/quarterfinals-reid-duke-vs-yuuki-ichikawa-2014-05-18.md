 No matter what happens here, no matter if the roof collapses and crushes No. 2 Ranked Reid Duke's perfectly flowing mane, no matter if he walks out of the room without ever slinging a spell, what we already know is that Duke will take over as the leader in the Player of the Year race and, probably, in the rankings as well. That's big game.



It's difficult to believe, given his stature in the game and success over the last few years, but this is actually Duke's first ever Pro Tour Top 8. Not that you'd know from the way he prepares. As other players were elsewhere waiting for their rounds to begin or mentally preparing themselves, Duke was battling, running games against teammates who were more than willing to help test.


On the other end of the spectrum is Yuuki Ichikawa, a PTQ player with 12 lifetime Pro Points also playing in his first Pro Tour Top 8, and just his third Pro Tour overall. He earns two invites to Pro Tours simply by making it this far – thanks to his new-found Silver Pro Club status – but making it all the way to the finals would put him in a new stratosphere entirely.



**The Decks**




 This has easily become the match-up of Pro Tour *Journey into Nyx*.




 On one side you have the established "best deck" prior to the tournament: Red-Green Elspeth. This Naya-flavored deck packs a punch at every stage, playing many of the format's best proactive cards and getting them out quickly with several mana creatures early on. Between [Stormbreath Dragon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stormbreath+Dragon), [Polukranos, World Eater](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Polukranos%2C+World+Eater), [Elspeth, Sun's Champion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elspeth%2C+Sun%27s+Champion), and [Xenagos, the Reveler](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Xenagos%2C+the+Reveler), the deck has no shortage of big plays to go around.




 On the other side, in a match-up most pros this weekend felt was about even, is BUG Control, a new addition to the format with *Journey into Nyx* that ekes out gradual advantages over the course of the game with planeswalkers, [Prognostic Sphinx](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Prognostic+Sphinx), and [Courser of Kruphix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Courser+of+Kruphix). It has been the deck of the tournament so far, with three similar copies in the Top 8 and a ton more doing well over the course of the weekend.






*While No. 2 Ranked Player Reid Duke was on the hunt for his first Pro Tour title in his first Pro Tour Top 8, relative newcomer Ichikawa was looking to go beyond the Silver Pro status that he locked up with his Sunday appearance.*
