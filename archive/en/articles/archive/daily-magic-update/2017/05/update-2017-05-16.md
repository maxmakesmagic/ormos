The May 16, 2017 Update

Blake is the content manager for DailyMTG.com, making him the one you should email if you have thoughts on the website, good or less good (or not good). He's a longtime coverage reporter and hasn't turned down a game of Magic in any format ever. 






The Daily *Magic* Update is a roundup of everything *Magic* you should know on May 16, 2017. Today's Update is brought to you by an all-new Top 25 ranking, thanks to a Pro Tour shakeup.


Top 25
======


1. The Pro Tour Top 25 Makeover

Every Pro Tour brings with it significant changes to the Top 25, and this one shook it to its very core.


Let's start at the top. Márcio Carvalho had a stranglehold on the top spot, and even his lackluster performance at Pro Tour *Amonkhet* hasn't pushed him off his perch. He remains our top player by a significant margin—though slightly less significant than before.


Moving down the list, Shota Yasooka and Owen Turtenwald swapped spots. They're pretty clearly Nos. 2 and 3, so that's unlikely to change for a while.


The biggest mover this week of any previously ranked player is easily Yuuya Watanabe, who turned a second-place finish into a 17-spot leap up the standings, all the way to No. 5. Getting second in a Pro Tour will do that.


Speaking of, Pro Tour *Amonkhet* Champion Gerry Thompson joins the rankings at No. 13. Welcome to the Top 25, Gerry T!


Others joining Gerry in the Top 25 from, well, not the Top 25 are some of his other compatriots in the Top 8. Ken Yukuhiro is the highest-rated player from the area of "previously not on this list," and he comes in at No. 10. Martin Müller and Eric Froehlich, both on the back of their Top 8 appearances, round out that new crew.


That means we also lost four from our previous Top 25. Petr Sochůrek, Ivan Floch, Oliver Tiu, and Ondřej Stráský all failed to garner enough points to hang on in the rankings. All are talented magicians and should be back soon.

Today's Must
============


1. [The State of Standard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PesnGXZbybM) | ChannelFireball | Luis Scott-Vargas

So, the Pro Tour happened. What now?


<https://www.youtube.com/embed/PesnGXZbybM>


After That, Read, Watch, or Listen to These
===========================================


1. [Interview with JC Frenette, designer of *Magic: The Gathering Puzzle Quest*](http://nerdreactor.com/2017/05/15/jc-frenette-designer-magic-gathering/) | Nerd Reactor | Brian Chu

*Puzzle Quest* designer JC Frenette talks about the translation of *Magic* cards to *Puzzle Quest*. Whatever his process, it resulted in me stomping everyone with [Thopter Foundry](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thopter+Foundry) and [Drowner of Secrets](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Drowner+of+Secrets), so I'm pretty happy with what he's got going on there.


1. [Budget Magic: Aristocats vs GB Delirium (Match 1)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KClAvIC_Z5Q) | MTGGoldfish | SaffronOlive

Oh, so this explains why I played against this deck like five times yesterday evening. There were so very many cats in this one. And cat puns.


<https://www.youtube.com/embed/KClAvIC_Z5Q>


1. [The Dangers of A Bigger Ban List](http://www.starcitygames.com/article/35110_The-Dangers-Of-A-Bigger-Ban-List.html) | StarCityGames.com | Sheldon Menery

This one might just generate a bit of discussion, and Menery walks through the dangers of expanding the ban list and making their banning philosophy less conservative.


1. [Tolarian Winds: "Pro Tour Ad Nausea" - A *Magic: The Gathering* Vlog](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uy4BESjEMX8) | Tolarian Community College | The Professor

Prof thinks the Pro Tour *Amonkhet* broadcast was a significant success, but he has some advice for, well, us on a few improvements that could be made.

What to Watch Tonight
=====================


1. Team Draft Super League | 5 p.m. PT/8 p.m. ET | [twitch.tv/magic](https://www.twitch.tv/magic)

The debut of Team Draft Super League is tonight! This first episode features the Peach Garden Oath—Reid Duke, Owen Turtenwald, and William Jensen—versus the Madison Wisconsin crew—Sam Black, Matt Severa, and Justin Cohen. With commentary from Ben Stark and Marshall Sutcliffe, you won't want to miss this showdown.

What People Are Talking About
=============================


1. Is EDHRec ruining Commander?

Two articles posted on Generaldamagecontrol.com raised a conversation among the Commander community that's similar to one that pulses through *Magic* as a whole—when is there too much information? You can read both articles [here](http://generaldamagecontrol.com/edhrec-is-ruining-edh/) and [here](http://generaldamagecontrol.com/edhrec-is-not-ruining-edh/), and much of [the discussion here](https://www.reddit.com/r/EDH/comments/6bbxay/edhrec_is_not_ruining_edh_a_counterpoint_by/).


1. [[Cardboard Crack] When everyone Flips Out about a comic about coin flips...](https://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/6bfu55/cardboard_crack_when_everyone_flips_out_about_a/)

Somehow this actually became a thing. Cardboard Crack made a comic strip where the joke was that [Aetherworks Marvel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aetherworks+Marvel) was like flipping coins. Many players and judges (correctly) made the point that actually flipping coins in a match of *Magic* to determine the outcome was illegal, and that the comic shouldn't spread anything that might make people think it's okay. It turned into a whole deal. Anyway, today Cardboard Crack came back with a comic about coin flipping cards in *Magic*. Because.


I'm dubbing this one Coingate and I'm not resting till we've covered every angle of it. This is serious business.


Deck of the Day
===============


1. [Ken Yukuhiro's Black-Green Energy](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/ptakh/top-8-decklists-2017-05-13)

The lone deck in the Top 8 not to play one of either [Aetherworks Marvel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aetherworks+Marvel) or [Lord of the Accursed](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lord+of+the+Accursed), Yukuhiro's Black-Green Energy is a straight-forward beatdown deck that plays anything but.


First of all, as anyone who watched the Top 8 can attest, it has some incredibly explosive draws, some of them involving the infamous [Bone Picker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bone+Picker). Infamous because Yukuhiro was *the only player* at Pro Tour *Amonkhet* to register any [Bone Picker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bone+Picker)s. All four that were registered for the tournament made their way to the Top 8. I doubt people will overlook this bird much longer, especially after turns where Yukuhiro would put nine power on the board for a mere three mana after something died.


He's also got many of the [Winding Constrictor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Winding+Constrictor) synergies that made the Snake so feared for so long. [Longtusk Cub](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Longtusk+Cub); [Walking Ballista](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Walking+Ballista); [Glint-Sleeve Siphoner](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glint-Sleeve+Siphoner); and [Rishkar, Peema Renegade](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rishkar%2C+Peema+Renegade) are all bananas with the Snake.


And by skipping on larger projects like [Verdurous Gearhulk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Verdurous+Gearhulk), Yukuhiro gets to keep his land-count low, leading to better draws as the game moves on. If opponents live that long, that is.
