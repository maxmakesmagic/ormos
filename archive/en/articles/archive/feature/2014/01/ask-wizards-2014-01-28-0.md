**Q: Tell us more about *Born of the Gods*! —Everybody** 


**A: Mike McArtor, copy editor for DailyMTG:** 


Let's start with the [Card Image Gallery](https://www.wizards.com/Magic/tcg/article.aspx?x=mtg/tcg/bornofthegods/cig), which is now complete. *Born of the Gods* will be up in [Gatherer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Default.aspx) sometime on January 28, 2014. If you're reading this after that date, it's there.


Many questions about *Born of the Gods* are answered in the [Release Notes](http://www.wizards.com/magic/magazine/article.aspx?x=mtg/faq/bng).
