The venue for Grand Prix London is situated in the heart of vibrant East London, where you will find numerous bars, restaurants, and hotels at your doorstep.

 But for those wishing to explore the city, central London and its famous West End are a short tube ride away. Also within easy reach are the Olympic Park and the O2 Arena which is accessible from ExCel London via England's only Cable Car.

**Tournament Structure** 


* Modified Swiss-style (50-minute rounds).

* Where necessary, the standings after the Swiss rounds will still be used to determine final order in the standings.
* For the first game of each match in the Top 8, the player that finished higher in the Swiss rounds chooses either to play first or to play second. For subsequent games in each Top 8 match, the usual Play/Draw rule applies (loser of the previous game decides whether to play first in the next game).
