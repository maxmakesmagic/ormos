If you attended the *Legions* prerelease tournament on the weekend of January 25, then you should have a prerelease card in your possession. If not, here's what you missed out on:


The card is [Feral Throwback](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Feral+Throwback), a rare green creature, and the only card in the set with both amplify and provoke. The card is a special kind of foil, with the focus of the art "cut out" of the foil background. The *Legions* expansion symbol is foiled in the text box, and the date (25 Jan 03) is stamped on the type line in gold leaf.
