WHAT IS A JUDGE?
================





















MAGIC JUDGES
------------


Magic judges are perhaps best known as arbiters of tournament rules, but they are also passionate members of the Magic community who endeavor to ensure that events are fair and players learn the game.


Anyone with a strong enough knowledge of Magic and a desire to give back to the community can become a judge.








THE JUDGE PROGRAM
-----------------


If you're looking for information on the Judge community such as how to become a Magic Judge or Judge exams, or if you would like to submit a Judge review or an investigation report, head over to [JudgeApps](http://apps.magicjudges.org/), an independent website run by the Judge community.

JUDGE LEVELS
------------


Certified judges fall into 3 levels.


Level 1 and 2 judges typically adjudicate hobby store-based event. Colloquially, they are sometimes called "L1" and "L2" judges. Level 2 judges also mentor and test new candidates for Level 1. Over 95% of judges are L1 or L2 and their presence is appreciated by both organizers and players.


Level 3 judges are leaders of premier organized play and judge communities in their regions. They generally operate in large areas, across provinces and countries and are recognized as regional leaders in their communities. Premier play organizers seek L3s to adjudicate fun and fair events and to provide a great player experience. They also mentor L1s and L2s judges and assist with directing portions of the Judge Certification Program.

REGIONAL COORDINATORS
---------------------


Regional Coordinators (often called "RCs") are usually Level 3 judges who act as a region's points-of-contact and coordinator for the judge program. RCs advise store owners operate premier events, facilitate judge mentorship and education in their regions, and help members of their communities by:


* Providing information about the Judge Program;
* Assisting tournament organizers find judges for events;
* Finding judging opportunities;
* Offering store owners advice on best practices for running events; and
* Building a positive community of stores, organizers, and players.

Whatever your question or need, contact your RCs for more information.

REGIONAL COORDINATOR ADVISORY COMMITTEE
---------------------------------------


In an ongoing effort to be responsive to the *Magic* Judge Community, Wizards of the Coast is pleased to announce the formation of the Regional Coordinator Advisory Committee ("RCAC"), an independent group for judges to provide feedback about *Magic* and the Judge Program.


Created last September, the RCAC acts as a sounding board and outlet for judges around the world to voice their ideas, thoughts and concerns about Magic and the Judge Program. 


The RCAC advises Wizards and the leadership of the Judge Program on issues arising from the Judge Program, including education, knowledge management, judge and player sanctions, and judge complaints, and will provide other general recommendations as the need arises. The RCAC is comprised of judges, as well as player representative Jon Finkel, who was elected by the Hall of Fame selection committee, to provide feedback and the perspective of a player to the RCAC. 


Any judge in the Judge Program can contact the RCAC at [judgercac@gmail.com](mailto:judgercac@gmail.com).
