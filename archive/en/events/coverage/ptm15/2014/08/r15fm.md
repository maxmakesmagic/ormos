 Ben Friedman is a rising star in the *Magic* community. Don't be fooled by his ridiculous attire. Friedman, a three-time Grand Prix Top 8 competitor, is a pensive mastermind on the battlefield. His opponent, Ivan Floch, is a Gold-level Pro with four Grand Prix Top 8s to his name.




**What's at Stake?**




 This is it. The final step on the path for greatness. The winner of this match will secure a spot in the Top 8 of Pro Tour *Magic 2015*. Both of these players have probably already locked up Gold for next season, but a win here could catapult either of them to Platinum status with a strong Sunday showing. Waiting for the match to start, both players sat in what would've been complete silence if it weren't for the enormous volume of Friedman's outfit.






*Both Ivan Floch and Ben Friedman were fighting for a Top 8 finish. Who would lock themselves in?*
