The 2010 **Magic** Pro Tour season continued in [San Juan](/en/events/coverage/paulo-celebrates-six-beach-san-juan), and now it's time to see how the dust has settled. The second Pro Tour of the season showcased the full *Zendikar* Block Constructed format, which is always a great place to look for seeds of the upcoming Standard rotationn to Standard. Was there a dominant archetype? How varied was the field? Paul Jordan crunched the numbers for all the major deck archetypes. If you're looking for the hard numbers on what beat what, you won't want to miss it.
