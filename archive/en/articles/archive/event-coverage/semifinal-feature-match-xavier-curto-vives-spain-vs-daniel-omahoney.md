Dan OMS from America played Xavier Curto Vives of Spain in the semi-final. Xavier was the only European left in the competition and battling to prevent an all American Final. Xavier won the coin flip and decided to go first.



**Game 1**


Seeing another red/black/blue deck Xavier made a Crimson Acolyte and then Cloaked it up to administer quick beats. It seemed hasty as OMS removed it with an Exotic Curse the next turn. OMS then made Duskwalker and then Darigaaz's Attendant and charged the Spaniard. Xavier drew nothing to hold back the charge and conceded soon after.



**Game 2**


After losing, Xavier decided this time to make OMS go first. It seemed a good decision as OMS was horribly screwed, not laying a third land until turn 5 and not seeing any swamps at all.



**Game 3**


Game 3 and Xavier got off turn 3 Harrow, turn 4 probe with kicker again. Creatures traded off on the ground. OMS started aggressively and looked to have the advantage despite the probe when he summoned a massive 6/6 Vodalian Serpent. On 13 life Xavier Restrained the Serpent and then dropped 2 shackles on both of OMS's creatures. OMS used Tsabo's Decree to deal with Xavier's Crow and the game was into topdeck mode. Xavier looked to have settled it with a Cloak on a kicked Lancer, but OMS had an Agonizing Demise. Xavier broke the deadlock again a turn later with a Samite Archer and OMS started to die the slow death. A Duskwalker from OMS was excluded and a Griffin sped his demise.



**Final Result:** Xavier Curto Vives beat Dan OMS 2-1
