Two Grand Prix spread across the width of North America have wrought their changes to the *Magic* Top 25 Pro Rankings, so let's take a look. In [Memphis](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/gpmem15), Standard was the format, and nine of our Top 25 made it to the start line. Eight advanced to Day Two, with only No. 7 William Jensen having a rare reversal of form—he's truly one of the giants of the GP scene. Of the eight who advanced, two made it to the elimination rounds in the Top 8. As a result, Chris Fennell is one of two new entries this week, at No. 24, while Ben Stark is now at No. 20 following his run all the way to the final, where Jack Fogle eventually stopped the Hall of Famer's run.



Seth Manfield was the other big winner from Memphis. Although finishing just outside the Top 8 in 13th, he leaps five places, up to No. 14, and continues his impressive run, headlined by a Pro Tour Top 8 in Washington earlier this month. There were no deep Sunday runs for No. 6 Shahar Shenhar, No. 9 Jacob Wilson, No. 10 Sam Black, or No. 21 Andrew Cuneo, while 66th place for Patrick Chapin leaves him the latest player on the trapdoor at No. 25.



Across the continent, [Grand Prix Vancouver](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/gpvan15) brought us Modern, and three more Top 25 players looking for points. Surprisingly, Shaun McLaren couldn't make it out of Day One, mustering a single win before calling it a day. He remains at No. 5. Reid Duke also favored Vancouver, but although he made it to Day Two, he couldn't put a run together. He stays at No. 11. The star of the show, however, was—and not for the first time in Canada—Alexander Hayne. His reward for a terrific weekend that ended in 3rd place is a new entry in the rankings at No. 23, just ahead of the other new entry, Chris Fennell.



Next up is a double header in Miami and Liverpool, but for those we'll have to wait another ten days. Join us again next week for all the latest news from the *Magic* Top 25 Pro Rankings.
