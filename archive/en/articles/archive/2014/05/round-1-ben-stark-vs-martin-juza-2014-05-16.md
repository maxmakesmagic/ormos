 This is what happens at Pro Tours. As longtime teammates, friends, and two of the best Limited players in the world, few players in the room are as familiar with one another as ChannelFireball compatriots Martin Juza and No. 4 Ranked Player Ben Stark. They've tested together, traveled together, and naturally, drafted together.



And it certainly shows this round.


Both Juza and the Hall of Famer across the table have drafted aggressive red-white decks with quick, brutal beaters and a bevy of tricks. The hitch is that only one player is actually happy with his deck. More on that in a moment.


Juza needs a result this weekend a bit more than Stark does, having just fallen off the Top 25 rankings in the past week thanks to, by his standards, a weak season. Juza is also a Hall of Fame candidate that could use another strong Pro Tour to get back in the mind of voters this year and try to regain his footing in the race for the World Championship. In fact, if Juza didn't do well this tournament, he was in danger of missing Platinum entirely this year.


Stark, meanwhile, already has the Hall of Fame, a (so far) strong season, and the inside track to the season's most prestigious tournament. He was doing just fine.





*No. 4 Ranked Player Ben Stark and Martin Juza are ready for a first-round match between teammates.*
