A winning deck is more than just a collection of powerful cards. It is a machine of interlocking parts, each serving a function that strengthens the whole. *Battle for Zendikar* offers players a lot of new parts to play with, some of which are objectively quite powerful and yet still aren’t seeing play in Standard. I asked our Pros for their choice of cards that need a little more help before they’ll be ready for prime time.

**Brian Braun-Duin:** “[Woodland Wanderer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Woodland+Wanderer). Extremely powerful when it’s on the field, but there are no good ways to make sure it survives the turn you play it.”

**Seth Manfield:** “[Blight Herder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blight+Herder). It’s a card I really want to play, but it doesn’t have the support it needs.”

**Jon Stern:** “[Greenwarden of Murasa](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Greenwarden+of+Murasa), although I’m not sure if it needs cards or if it’s just that it has no place in the current format.”

**Alexander Hayne:** “[Part the Waterveil](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Part+the+Waterveil). I brewed up a pretty sweet 37-land [Part the Waterveil](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Part+the+Waterveil) deck with a respectable 40% win percentage.”

**Sam Black:** “[Oblivion Sower](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oblivion+Sower). It’s the perfect card to be [Primeval Titan](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Primeval+Titan), it just needs the right things to [Primeval Titan](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Primeval+Titan) into.”

**Andrew Cuneo:** “[Void Winnower](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Void+Winnower). We just need the next few sets to be all evens.”
