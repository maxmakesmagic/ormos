Let's say you have a foil [Gideon, Champion of Justice](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gideon%2C+Champion+of+Justice). It looks like this, right?

Well, no. Not really. Because the foiling process is applied differently on different parts of the card. Some parts are shiny and some parts aren't. See foiling treatment below.

The white parts get the shiny foiling, then the regular colors are printed on top of that. See how Gideon's eyes are blocked out in white? That's what makes them reflective on the card!


Now that we've established all that, here are a few more cards with keen foily effects.
