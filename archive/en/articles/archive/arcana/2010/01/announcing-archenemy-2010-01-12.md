![Archenemy](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/arcana/362_ARC_logo.jpg)You've played **Magic** one-on-one. You've played it in a free-for-all. But have you ever wanted to just throw down the gauntlet against all your friends at once? Have you ever wanted to take on the whole world and show them who's boss?

Well, now you can! *Archenemy* is the first "One vs. Many" multiplayer product. With a deck of twenty oversized cards to beef up your favorite deck, you'll be ready to face off against as many of your friends as your kitchen table can hold. Two? Three? Twenty? Bring 'em on! Here *you* rule!

On June 18, become the *Archenemy*. There will be four different game packs, each one with a 60-card **Magic** deck featuring eight rares, and a 20-card oversized deck.
