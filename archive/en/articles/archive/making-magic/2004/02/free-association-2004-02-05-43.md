I've often been asked what skills a good game designer needs. A good game designer has to have a good understanding of what makes games tick, particularly the game you're designing. And by tick, I mean they need to know what makes the game a good game and what are the [elements](/en/articles/archive/making-magic/free-association-2004-02-05-18) that the player base enjoys the most. The person needs to have a sense of organization. They need to be able to think holistically (that is, see the big picture rather than just the parts). 


But most importantly, a good game designer needs to have a creative mind. Game designe is rife with mental roadblocks. There are always a hundred reasons why something doesn't work. A good game designer has to find the one reason that makes it work. The best designers don't find the complicated answer. They find the [simple answer](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/daily/mr110-simple). And trust me, the simple answer is the proverbial needle in the haystack. (What would my column be without a few good [metaphors](/en/articles/archive/making-magic/free-association-2004-02-05-42)?)
