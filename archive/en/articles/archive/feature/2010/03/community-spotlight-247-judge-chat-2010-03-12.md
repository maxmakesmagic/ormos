Let's say you're playing **Magic** in the middle of the night. So far, fairly realistic, right? But then you have a rules question. What do you do? *What* ... do you *do?*


Well, thanks to the worldwide DCI Judge community and especially Jason Lemahieu, there's an answer! Twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week, there's someone on the #mtgrules IRC channel waiting for your question. Rules questions in the channel are answered by volunteers from around the world. Certified judges (and other rules experts) just idle until a question comes. The fact that the volunteers are so spread across the globe is what makes it easy to be 24/7.


Now, let's say you don't already know how to set up an IRC client. Well, that's no problem. Because DCI Judges are problem-solvers! There's a convenient web client at <http://dcifamily.org/askthejudge/> where you can ask rules questions. Enjoy!


(Oh, and note that this is *only* for rules questions, not random chatting.)
