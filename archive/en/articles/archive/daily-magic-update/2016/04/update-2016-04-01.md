The Daily *Magic* Update is a roundup of everything *Magic* you should know on April 1, 2016. Today's Update is brought to you by not playing into this April Fools' thing this year. With the Prerelease tomorrow and a lot of our "Gotcha!" capital used up with the *Conspiracy* announcements, we're playing today straight-laced. Sorry to disappoint.


Today's Must
============


1. [The Best Deck in *Shadows over Innistrad* Standard](http://images.onset.freedom.com/ocregister/gallery/m4bprq-b78957529z.120120520063002000g4217pep4.1.jpg) | StarCityGames.com | Patrick Chapin

Patrick "The Innovator" Chapin thinks he's broken Standard in half with his latest deck, and he's not holding back, not even before the Pro Tour. Think he's right? Check out this rare free article from one of the best deck builders around.


After That, Read, Watch, or Listen to These
===========================================


1. [AMA with Mark Gottlieb, Lead Designer of *Shadows over Innistrad*](http://i.imgur.com/bp6qZ.gif) | Reddit

*Shadows over Innistrad* Lead Designer Mark Gottlieb stopped by Reddit for a bit yesterday to answer a bunch of questions. But you could probably tell that from the headline. Not even sure why I'm here.


1. [Using Math to Solve Every Problem Ever](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4V5z2VSMao) | ChannelFireball | Frank Karsten

Frank Karsten is back to MATH YOUR FACE OFF. Got a tricky gameplay decision you can't solve? Math can. A tricky stain you can't remove? Math it away! An ex won't leave you alone and keeps breaking into your house?


You should probably call [the police](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMOGaugKpzs). That's dangerous behavior.


1. [Reviewing every card in Standard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9Uz1icjwrM) | Constructed Resources | Marshall Sutcliffe and Eric Froehlich

This epic multi-day podcast spans all of the cards currently legal in Standard. Just don't plan to eat, sleep, or otherwise interact with humanity while listening to it. There's just too much to cover.


1. [Reviewing *Shadows over Innistrad*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9K18CGEeiI) | Tolarian Community College | The Professor

In some of The Professor's best work, he offers a full review of the latest set—from flavor to story to gameplay to Limited. This video sums it up nicely.

1. [The Problem with Pauper](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HY9qS-qaako) | MTGGoldfish | Saffron Olive

Pauper has been gaining in popularity lately, but Saffron Olive worries for its future. Why?


Why indeed.


What to Watch This Weekend
==========================


1. Nothing. Go Play in a Prerelease.

Prereleases are great. You should play in them. Watching things online is for people who can't go to a Prerelease. And if you can't go to a Prerelease, then I guess [you should watch this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZ5LpwO-An4).


<https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZZ5LpwO-An4>


What People Are Talking About
=============================


1. [My deck makes a lot of people react negatively in MTGO. Should I keep playing it?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZMc9xrehxA)

This one spawned a lot of conversation, both good and bad. If you've ever experienced grumpy opponents—and who hasn't—this one is for you.


1. [If *Magic* Players Were Gymnasts Who Were Ninjas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5keiiLMIuuc)

I think I might be losing the thread here.


Deck of the Day
===============


1. [Screaming Beaver](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iUXAHc-ABoY)

Momir Basic is a *Magic Online* format meant to be random and fun. But sometimes even the most casual formats can be broken.


*Magic Online* user [ScreamingBeaver](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iUXAHc-ABoY) seems to have done just that with this new, innovative take on the format that eschews Plains *entirely*.


That's right, in a format where you can play all five basic lands, [ScreamingBeaver](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iUXAHc-ABoY) chose to play just four, and he's been on a tear ever since.


We're not sure if we'll need to emergency ban some corner of this strategy—it might finally be time for Island to go—but we'll keep you posted.
