I had the best seat in the house a couple weekends ago at Grand Prix Lincoln, where I got to see the latest Modern brews hard at work in a competitive setting. Modern has a massive card pool, so newer players might have difficulty acquiring the cards necessary to build a competitive deck. Today, I'll attempt to build an easily acquired competitive Modern deck.

Melira Pod strategies have proven themselves to be at the upper echelon of the Modern metagame. That deck uses [Melira, Sylvok Outcast](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Melira%2C+Sylvok+Outcast) in conjunction with [Birthing Pod](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Birthing+Pod) and persist creatures like [Murderous Redcap](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Murderous+Redcap) and [Kitchen Finks](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kitchen+Finks) to set up infinite loops with a [Viscera Seer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Viscera+Seer). [Chord of Calling](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chord+of+Calling) is one of the most important tools at the deck's disposal. The deck uses [Chord of Calling](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chord+of+Calling) to find combo pieces and end the game. I noticed a missed opportunity here, though. I'd often see Melira Pod players with a slew of mana creatures and a [Kitchen Finks](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kitchen+Finks) or two on the battlefield. They would have a [Chord of Calling](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chord+of+Calling) in hand, but they would be unable to combo because of a card like [Relic of Progenitus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Relic+of+Progenitus) on the opponent's side or lack of combo pieces on their own side. If the deck simply played one copy of [Mirror Entity](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mirror+Entity), it could use an endstep [Chord of Calling](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chord+of+Calling) to grab [Mirror Entity](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mirror+Entity) and pump all its mana creatures to lethal proportions on the following turn.

| Chord of Calling | Mirror Entity |

The more I thought about it, the more I simply wanted to play a deck that flooded the table with creatures and used an endstep [Chord of Calling](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chord+of+Calling) to KO people with a horde of mana creatures. The logical application for this plan is an Elf deck. [Chord of Calling](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chord+of+Calling) was used with [Mirror Entity](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mirror+Entity) to great success in old Extended Elfball strategies.


Just being able to [Chord of Calling](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chord+of+Calling) for a [Mirror Entity](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mirror+Entity) is pretty narrow, and it loses a lot of its allure once your opponents know it's coming. Elfball lets us take full advantage of [Chord of Calling](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chord+of+Calling) by giving us access to other combos and even letting us tutor up a [Regal Force](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Regal+Force) for massive card draw.


There are a number of combos we can include, but the most obvious is [Devoted Druid](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Devoted+Druid) and [Ezuri, Renegade Leader](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ezuri%2C+Renegade+Leader). If you have two active [Devoted Druid](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Devoted+Druid)s in play you can use them to create six mana with every [Overrun](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Overrun) activation on Ezuri. This will result in infinite mana. You already have an Ezuri in play, so you can just give your elves +10,000,000/+10,000,000, untap your [Devoted Druid](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Devoted+Druid)s, and attack for the win. You'd be surprised how easy it is to assemble this combo when you're playing a play set of [Chord of Calling](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chord+of+Calling) and a few [Summoner's Pact](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Summoner%27s+Pact)s.

| Devoted Druid | Ezuri, Renegade Leader |

[Llanowar Elves](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Llanowar+Elves) and [Arbor Elf](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arbor+Elf) seem like auto-includes here. They're both Elves, so they interact well with Ezuri and whatever other elvish goodies we decide to play with. Our deck will be well equipped to abuse the creature types on these guys.


[Heritage Druid](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Heritage+Druid) lets us explode with optimal draws. If we're lucky enough to have two other one-mana creatures and a three-drop, we can have four bodies in play on the second turn. This type of opening is going to be very difficult for any opponent to keep up with.


[Nettle Sentinel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nettle+Sentinel) is going to be part of any deck that plays with [Heritage Druid](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Heritage+Druid)â€”the interaction between these two cards lets your mana explode. Also, a 2/2 for one mana is a welcome addition simply for its aggressive applications.




|  |  |

| Heritage Druid | Nettle Sentinel |

[Mirror Entity](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mirror+Entity) will win you a huge proportion of your games. You win the game if your opponent taps out when you have a [Chord of Calling](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chord+of+Calling) in your hand. It's really that simple. A horde of unimpressive 1/1s can quickly become a stampede of 7/7s. 


[Viridian Shaman](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Viridian+Shaman) is an excellent card for this type of deck. Cards like [Chalice of the Void](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chalice+of+the+Void), [Engineered Explosives](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Engineered+Explosives), and even [Vedalken Shackles](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vedalken+Shackles) can be major issues for our strategy. Having access to artifact removal with a very small opportunity cost seems like it's worth it.


[Elvish Visionary](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elvish+Visionary) is an excellent creature for this type of strategy. We're attempting to flood the board with dudes; the quality of our creatures is less important than the quantity. [Elvish Visionary](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elvish+Visionary) replaces itself, thins our deck, and helps us find a [Chord of Calling](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chord+of+Calling) to end the game.




|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Elvish Visionary | Elvish Archdruid |

[Elvish Archdruid](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elvish+Archdruid) lets you do some really scary things. You can imagine the amount of mana this thing produces. The pump effect is also really impressive. Remember, it pumps your guys on top of a [Mirror Entity](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mirror+Entity) activation. 


[Regal Force](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Regal+Force) lets the deck draw a ton of cards. All our mana creatures will allow us to empty our hand very quickly, but the weak nature of our creatures will often leave us behind even after we've played most of our hand. [Regal Force](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Regal+Force) lets us refill our hand and find the necessary tools to end the game. 


[Summoner's Pact](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Summoner%27s+Pact) increases the consistency of our deck and makes our combos more readily available. You're usually searching for [Regal Force](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Regal+Force), but there are situations where an [Ezuri, Renegade Leader](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ezuri%2C+Renegade+Leader) or [Elvish Archdruid](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elvish+Archdruid) can win the game on the spot. 


Here's the deck once I put it all together:

I've been asked to talk more about card availability. Right now, one can acquire all the rares for this deck on **Magic Online** pretty easily. The rest of the deck is comprised of commons and uncommons.


I played a few matches with the deck on **Magic Online** to see how it fared against what people were playing in Constructed queues. I hadn't built a sideboard, so I was at a pretty big disadvantage.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/boab/boab184_vsjund.jpg)  
![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/boab/boab184_thought.jpg)I lost the roll. My opponent went down to five cards and I was forced to ship back a hand with no land, but kept a very nice six: [Forest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest), [Brushland](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brushland), [Arbor Elf](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arbor+Elf), [Devoted Druid](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Devoted+Druid), [Elvish Archdruid](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elvish+Archdruid), and [Llanowar Elves](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Llanowar+Elves). My opponent played a fetchland, found an [Overgrown Tomb](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Overgrown+Tomb), and cast [Thoughtseize](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtseize), taking my [Elvish Archdruid](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elvish+Archdruid). I drew [Ezuri, Renegade Leader](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ezuri%2C+Renegade+Leader); played my [Forest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest); and cast [Llanowar Elves](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Llanowar+Elves). My opponent played a land and cast [Terminate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Terminate) on my [Llanowar Elves](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Llanowar+Elves). Now my opponent only had two cards left in hand. 


I drew a [Devoted Druid](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Devoted+Druid) and cast it. My opponent played a third land and cast [Kitchen Finks](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kitchen+Finks). I drew a [Forest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest), played it, and cast [Devoted Druid](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Devoted+Druid) and [Arbor Elf](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arbor+Elf). My opponent cast a [Bloodbraid Elf](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodbraid+Elf) and flipped into a [Tarmogoyf](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf), then attacked for 6. I drew a [Brushland](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brushland) and played it, then cast [Ezuri, Renegade Leader](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ezuri%2C+Renegade+Leader) and used the [Devoted Druid](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Devoted+Druid)s and my last remaining land to activate Ezuri's [Overrun](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Overrun) ability. Then I made fifty mana with the [Devoted Druid](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Devoted+Druid)s and [Ezuri, Renegade Leader](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ezuri%2C+Renegade+Leader), activated Ezuri ten times, untapped both [Devoted Druid](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Devoted+Druid)s, and attacked for 58 trampling damage.

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/boab/boab184_bob.jpg)I went to six cards again and kept [Forest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest), [Devoted Druid](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Devoted+Druid), [Elvish Archdruid](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elvish+Archdruid), [Forest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest), [Nettle Sentinel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nettle+Sentinel), and [Summoner's Pact](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Summoner%27s+Pact).

This matchup is pretty good. When sideboarding, I would want to cut [Summoner's Pact](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Summoner%27s+Pact)s and the [Viridian Shaman](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Viridian+Shaman) to put in [Lead the Stampede](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lead+the+Stampede) and maybe an extra copy of [Regal Force](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Regal+Force).

I drew a forest, played it, and cast [Elvish Archdruid](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elvish+Archdruid). 


My opponent cast a [Pyretic Ritual](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyretic+Ritual) and put a counter on [Pyromancer Ascension](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyromancer+Ascension), cast a [Faithless Looting](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Faithless+Looting) and the [Pyromancer Ascension](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyromancer+Ascension) went to two counters.

A few more card-draw spells led to a few more Rituals and a [Past in Flames](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Past+in+Flames) was enough to make [Grapeshot](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grapeshot) very lethal.

My opponent cast another [Pyromancer Ascension](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyromancer+Ascension); played an [Island](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island); and cast [Serum Visions](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Serum+Visions), putting a counter on both enchantments. I drew [Llanowar Elves](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Llanowar+Elves), cast it, tapped an Archdruid and both my lands to cast [Regal Force](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Regal+Force).

My opponent easily went off with a pair of [Pyretic Ritual](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyretic+Ritual)s to turn on both copies of [Pyromancer Ascension](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyromancer+Ascension). It's difficult to beat that deck when you can't interact.

This match wouldn't be so bad if we had [Ethersworn Canonist](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ethersworn+Canonist) and some type of enchantment removal.


If I were to build a sideboard today it would look something like this.

This deck does an incredible job of staying competitive despite its extreme ease to acquire. I'd strongly recommend this deck to anyone looking to dive into Modern but who doesn't have quite the collection necessary to build one of the tier-one decks. There are a few obvious upgrades that can be made to the mana base, but beyond that, the deck is exactly how you would want it to be even if you had an unlimited budget.
