651 people ended up playing the Grand Prix, and of them a whopping 107 showed up with Psychatog! By and far the most popular deck, the Tog accounted for over 16% of the field. To stress this, one out of every six competitors played this deck! If you add together the totals of the next two most popular deck types, they barely overcome the total of the single Psychatog deck.

RUG (also known as Liquid Tempo) finished a distant second in the most played category, with a good-sized chunk of players finding the interaction of Madness, burn and efficient creatures a good choice. Also making strong showings were Goblin Trenches (made popular by Finnish national champion and PT Finalist Tomi Walamies), Mono Black control (making high finishes at the New England regionals this year, based off of the PT Osaka decks), and various Braids decks of all shapes and sizes.
