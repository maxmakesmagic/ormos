[Wizards.COMmunity's](/en/articles/archive/2010-01-28) online convention, [Uncon](http://wizopages.wizards.com/uncon/), featured several **Magic** tournaments and contests. Pete Venters, **Magic** artist since the time of *[Mightstone](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Mightstone)*, was so kind as to autograph and sketch on the back of some artist's proofs for some of the winners. (An artist's proof is like a regular **Magic** card, but has a plain white back instead of a **Magic** card back.) Today's Arcana shows off some samples of those coveted prizes.

***[Spelljack](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spelljack)** sketch won by "Stud Bracelet," first place in the "Tog Block" tourney   
**[Skirk Marauder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skirk+Marauder)** sketch won by "Sim User," first place in the Type 1.5 Highlander tourney*

***[Defiant Elf](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Defiant+Elf)** sketch won by "Wulfgar911," first place in the Type 2 Peasant Magic tourney   
**[Baron Sengir](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Baron+Sengir)** sketch won by "Armadillo King," first place in the Jeopardy Tournament of Champions*

Congratulations to all the winners at [Uncon 2003](http://wizopages.wizards.com/uncon/)!
