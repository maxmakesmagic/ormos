It's the first of two weeks of previews for *Unhinged*, a set that grew out of the ashes of the never-released proto-set, *Unglued 2*. Over the next two weeks Magic Arcana will bring you behind-the-scenes factoids of *Unhinged* and even some peeks at the *Unglued 2* that never was. 

Today, for example, we look at anthropomorphized vegetables. That's right.

One of the running themes of *Unglued 2* was going to be anthropomorphic vegetable creatures that gave [poison counters](http://gatherer.wizards.com/default.asp?term=poison_counter&fields=%7Crules&format=Allsets&color=All&output=summary&sort=name&first=1) (because, you know, vegetables -- poison). Take a look at the art of some of these tough veggies.

The poison-veggie theme was not carried explicitly into *Unhinged*, but you may detect a vegetable here and there in the art of certain *Unhinged*  cards -- which indicates art that was carried over from *Unglued 2*.
