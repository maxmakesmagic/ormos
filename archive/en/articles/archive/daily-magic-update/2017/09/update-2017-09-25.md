The Daily *Magic* Update is a roundup of everything *Magic* you should know on September 25, 2017. Today's Update is brought to you by traveling through Greece for two weeks. Which I did. I might mention it once or twice.


Return of the Reviews
=====================


1. [*Ixalan* Standard Set Review: White](http://www.gatheringmagic.com/aliaintrazi-09252017-ixalan-standard-set-review-white/) | Gathering Magic | Ali Aintrazi

Luis Scott-Vargas's [Limited reviews](https://www.channelfireball.com/articles/ixalan-limited-set-review-gold-artifacts-and-lands/) have already come and gone, but we're just getting started with set reviews. Today's entry is a look at *Ixalan*'s white cards in Constructed. The formatting for the article is clear and easy to parse as well. So parse away. This article is almost as good as the $300 meal I had overlooking the Santorini caldera while fireworks spun overhead. Almost.


After That, Read, Watch, or Listen to These
===========================================


1. [Blue Skies with Favorable Winds](https://www.channelfireball.com/articles/blue-skies-with-favorable-winds/) | ChannelFireball | Frank Karsten

There's a disturbing lack of math in this article. But, hey, at least he goes deep on [Ornithopter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ornithopter). Almost as deep as the clear blue waters of the Mediterranean. Where I swam. Like, five days ago.


1. [*Ixalan* in Modern and Legacy](http://www.hareruyamtg.com/article/en/category/detail/187) | Hareruya English | Javier Dominguez

Dominguez joins the Hareruya crew, which is quickly becoming an international conglomerate of many of the world's best players. Kind of like those "USA vs. the World" *American Ninja Warrior* episodes. But with Pirates instead of Ninjas. Anyway, Dominguez looks at Legacy and Modern implications for *Ixalan*.


If this interests you (the article, not *American Ninja Warrior*, nor global sporting events pitting one country against everyone else), [Sandro Rajalin focuses in on Legacy over on Hipsters of the Coast](https://www.hipstersofthecoast.com/2017/09/mtg-ixalan-legacy-set-review/).


If it doesn't interest you, maybe you'd like to hear stories about Pan's cavern on the way to the ancient city of Delphi? No?


1. [Tropical Fish](http://www.mtgmintcard.com/articles/writers/justin-robb/tropical-fish) | MTG Mint Card | Justin Robb

Robb covers pretty much the entire Merfolk tribe to see what, if anything, they can accomplish in Standard. The result is an eighteen-land tempo deck that might have the goods to knock some people into the water.


Speaking of fish, the fish in Greece is excellent.


1. [Examining *Ixalan*, Part 2](http://www.starcitygames.com/article/35889_Examining-Ixalan-Part-2.html) | StarCityGames.com | Chris Lansdell

Part 1 probably happened while I was sunning myself on a beach in Crete. Or maybe while I was swimming through exquisitely carved shores along Milos during a day-long excursion. Who knows.


1. *Magic: The Gathering Arena* Deck Building Challenge Voting Begins!

Whether you submitted a deck over the weekend or you just like voting on things on the internet, voting on the *MTG Arena* deck building challenge is open today and tomorrow! The deck that gets the most reactions each day on [the *MTG Arena* Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/magicthegatheringarena/posts/393068604442981) will be featured in an October community stream on *MTG Arena*!


What You Might Have Missed This Weekend
=======================================


1. [Commander Clash S3 Episode 25: Seth Week (Season Finale!)](https://www.mtggoldfish.com/articles/commander-clash-s3-episode-25-seth-week-season-finale?src=wizards) | MTGGoldfish

Notable not just for [Panharmonicon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Panharmonicon)'s starring role in the decks, but as a tribute to Seth (probably better known as SaffronOlive), who is bowing out of Commander Clash next season. So now instead of being involved in 99% of MTGGoldfish's content, it'll be more like 97%.


Meanwhile, Greece was 100% amazing.


1. [Gather around for magic: Popular card game, *Magic the Gathering*, releases new set](http://www.redandblack.com/culture/gather-around-for-magic-popular-card-game-magic-the-gathering/article_3593453e-a06b-11e7-8a49-778417cedb6e.html) | *The Red & Black* | Maggie Holland

I'm a huge fan of smaller/college papers "discovering" *Magic* for their readers. This one is fairly typical, but does highlight several local stores in the Athens, Georgia, area—which, admittedly, was very confusing for me to read having literally been in Athens, Greece, four days ago. I couldn't for the life of me figure out why a Georgia newspaper was talking about Greece and why I couldn't find all of these sweet stores while I was there.


What to Watch Today
===================

Joel probably won't be the only one streaming today, as the release of *Ixalan* on *Magic Online* rustles up a higher than normal number of streamers on a Monday. Not sure where to see who's streaming? New to the whole Twitch thing? Start [here](https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Magic:%20The%20Gathering).


Not many streams in Greece, but I did go horseback riding at sunset on a beach with my wife. So there's that.

The Prerelease came and went, and with it came a stream of Prerelease tweets. Hope everyone had fun while I was flying 14 hours from Dubai. In economy. Next to a guy who had no concept of personal space. Or qualms about touching strangers.


Deck of the Day

1. Standard Tezzerator

Hareruya Wayfinder kicked off over the weekend, and, as usual, there's a solid mix of the obvious and the wild. This is closer to the wild side, as the deck looks to churn out Treasure, involve improvise, and even call on Nicol Bolas for help. I have no idea if the deck is good, but I'm certainly going to spend some time trying to find out.

By the way, did I mention I was just in Greece?
