Turn Three, Take Fourteen!
==========================




February 23-24, 2013












Grand Prix Quebec 2013
----------------------


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/gpque13/trophy.jpg)Boston's Nico Christiansen didn't come to Quebec expecting to become a champion. An on-again, off-again player, Christiansen had never so much as made Day 2 of a Grand Prix, let alone won the whole thing. Rather than play one of the established decks from last weekend's Pro Tour *Gatecrash*, Christiansen chose to play Naya Humans, an explosive aggro deck that had shown up on **Magic Online** just that week. After seeing the deck's raw power, he knew what he would be playing.


The field of over eight hundred players showcased a varied metagame. Whatever your playstyle, you could find a viable archetype to play. Jund Midrange was the most widely-played, but Blue-White-Red, Saito Zoo, The Aristocrats, and aggro decks of both Jund and Naya colors were winning. But as Day 2 dawned the big stories were Christiansen's Naya Humans and a new take on Human Reanimator, piloted by team MTGmintcard from Hong Kong and Taiwan. Using [Angel of Glory's Rise](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Angel+of+Glory%27s+Rise) to get back [Fiend Hunter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fiend+Hunter), [Undercity Informer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Undercity+Informer) and [Burning-Tree Emissary](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Burning-Tree+Emissary), it could mill the opponent's library immediately. It caught the tournament without enough graveyard hate, and put Tzu-Ching Kuo, captain of the victorious Taiwanese World **Magic** Cup team, into the Top 8.


There, he and Christiansen joined a mix of decks, including three flavors of Jund (Midrange, Aggro, and Zombies) as well as The Aristocrats and Naya Aggro. Despite the presence of heavy hitters Reid Duke and Thomas Holzinger, it was only fitting that the finals would see a match between Kuo and Christiansen. Unfortunately for Kuo, the matchup on paper was tremendously in Christiansen's favor, and when Christiansen's deciding semifinal game against Duke featured an attack for fourteen on turn three, it started to seem like destiny. Kuo managed to force the finals to a deciding third game, but that put Christiansen on the play. Christiansen held a pair of [Searing Spear](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Searing+Spear)s from the start, and steered the game to force through just enough damage that those six points of damage were exactly enough to finish off Kuo.


Congratulations to Nico Christiansen, Grand Prix Quebec City Champion!
