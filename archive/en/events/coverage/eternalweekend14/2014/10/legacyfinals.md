 Yesterday, 481 hopeful *Magic* players descended on the Pennsylvania Convention Center in Philadelphia with dreams of being crowned Legacy Champion. After ten rounds of swiss and two elimination rounds, only two remain.



Kevin Jones has been on quite the tear recently. After nearly a decade of practice, Jones is finally starting to reap the rewards. Jones won the Star City Games Standard Open in New Jersey earlier this month, won his State Championship two weeks later, and he hasn't lost a single match this weekend. Jones was the only player entering the Top 8 without a single loss. 



 John Grudzina, a research analyst in commodities trading, has been winning and Top 8ing Vintage events for the last few years. He's won a [Black Lotus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Black+Lotus) and [Mox Sapphire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mox+Sapphire) in the last year alone. Grudzina's record this weekend is only tarnished by a single loss at the hands of none other than his finals opponent, Kevin Jones.
