Welcome to day two of Grand Prix Birmingham! The format today is 6 rounds of *Mirrodin*-*Mirrodin*-Darksteel Booster draft cutting to a top 8 eight draft. 63 players managed to survive the 8 rounds of sealed deck, pop concert in the next hall and the switch to British Summer Time (we all lost an hour) to return today at 9am.


Currently leading the pack is the experienced Swedish pro, Mattias Jorstedt, who was helped through the minefield of Sealed deck play yesterday with a white-red monstrosity that featured double [Skullclamp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skullclamp). Keep following here to see which players survive to play on the final table tonight.
