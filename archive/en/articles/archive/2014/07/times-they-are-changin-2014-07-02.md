July 2, 2014
 







If you've been to DailyMTG.com anytime recently like, say, right now as you're reading this sentence, you might have noticed we've done some redecorating. While we're still patching some holes, adjusting some knobs, and futzing with the wiring, we're pretty happy with the website's new look, feel, and functionality. Trick Jarrett already spent some time introducing you to the new website, so I won't be spending any time on the redesign. Instead, I'll be covering a number of changes you'll notice on the site in the coming weeks, many of which I think will improve the reader experience significantly.



The first major change you're going to notice next week is the time that we publish DailyMTG.com articles every day. For years, we've published all of our content at 9 p.m. Pacific/12 a.m. Eastern, and much of the *Magic* publishing world has followed suit. However, *Magic* is a global game, and midnight on the East Coast of America is 1 a.m. in Rio de Janeiro, 5 a.m. in London, and 1 p.m. in Japan—not to mention that midnight isn't exactly prime reading time on the East Coast to begin with.

Additionally, next Monday, July 7, we're launching the first week of a more localized DailyMTG.com. Starting on Monday and going forward, three columns will be translated into Japanese, German, French, Italian, and Spanish and simultaneously published with the English versions:




* Making Magic by Mark Rosewater
* Uncharted Realms, the weekly look into the lore and story of *Magic*
* Latest Developments by Sam Stoddard


We've localized content in the past, but rarely for simultaneous publishing. We're excited to expand our content to *Magic* players in a variety of languages, and it only makes sense to recognize the globalization of our content by reexamining when that content is being published.



Furthermore, when we delved into *why* we updated at 9 p.m. Pacific/12 a.m. Eastern, it became apparent the reason was, more or less, because we always have. *Magic* is never a game to resist change, so we endeavor for our content to be willing to change for the right reasons as well. The globalization of *Magic* and the content here on DailyMTG.com are exactly the right reasons.



So, in recognition of all of that, as of next Monday, July 7, we'll begin publishing at 8 a.m. Pacific/11 a.m. Eastern. Around the world that means we'll be updated at:



Rio de Janeiro—Noon  





We believe this change will give more readers a better opportunity to read our content when it suits them best and, for many of our readers, in the language they're most comfortable with.



But we've also got some exciting additions to what you'll all be reading in the coming months.



Before I made the trip to Renton to take over as editor-in-chief of DailyMTG.com, one of my favorite *Magic* strategy writers was Reid Duke. Reid's clarity, experience, knowledge of the game, and clean writing style made him a favorite of mine, and of many others around the world. When I finally made it up to the Wizards offices, getting in touch with Reid was one of the first things on my list of "big ideas."



So, I'm incredibly pleased to announce that Reid Duke will be taking over Level One in mid-August from the capably nimble fingers of Mike Flores. Duke is one of the best strategy writers and thinkers in the game today—not to mention fighting to be named Player of the Year—so having him teaching the next generation of *Magic* players how the game works is incredibly exciting.

We'll also be introducing new columns in the coming months. The first batch will be centered around organized play, to be launched after Pro Tour *Magic 2015*. We're going to be pushing content that gives more insight into the tournaments that are happening every weekend around the world as well as providing viewing guides for the growing streamed video content that seem to dominate every Saturday and Sunday.



On the other end of the spectrum, we also have a pretty cool project coming in October for multiplayer fans out there during what we're dubbing our official Multiplayer Week. There's not much more I can say about it at this point, except that Bruce Richards and a number of others are working hard behind the scenes to create something you'll want to bookmark for a long time.



That's it for now, although trust me when I say I'm eager to cross more items off my big ideas list over the coming months and years. If you have any comments or thoughts, please feel free to [email me](http://archive.wizards.com/company/emailtoauthor.asp?author=Blake%20Rasmussen&headline=[Times%20they%20are%20a%20changing%20]) or send me a message on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/blakepr). We welcome all feedback.
