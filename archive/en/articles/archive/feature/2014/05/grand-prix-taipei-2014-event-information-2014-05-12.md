Welcome to Taipei! Situated at the northern tip of Taiwan, Taipei is the political, economic, and cultural center of Taiwan. Besides being known for its various thriving shopping and entertainment areas and many night markets featuring gastronomic varieties of local eats, Taipei is rich in beautiful ornate temples and maintains an extensive system of parks, green spaces, and nature preserves. Taipei is also home to Taipei 101, a 101-floor landmark skyscraper that claimed the title of world's tallest building when it opened in 2004, a title it held for six years. 


 Grand Prix Taipei is open to the public and all players are invited to participate. Taking place only a week after the release of **Magic** 2015, there is no better way to 'Hunt Bigger Game' than Grand Prix Taipei! In addition, the side event schedule will be jam-packed with exhilarating events with multiple formats. With Planeswalker Points multipliers of 8x for the main event and 3x for all side events, there is no better way to chalk up those Planeswalker Points!

**Tournament Structure** 


* Modified Swiss-style (50-minute rounds).
* Day One will consist of a maximum of 9 Swiss rounds. Day Two will consist of 6 Swiss rounds and the Top 8 single-elimination finals.
* If 799 or less players register for the event, all players with an X-2-0 record (or better) or the top 64 players – whichever is greater – advance to the second day of competition for prizes and invitations.
* If 800 or more players register for the event, all players with an X-2-0 record (or better) or the top 128 players – whichever is greater – advance to the second day of competition for prizes and invitations.

* Top 8 playoff matches will have no time limit. (Players are still expected to play at a normal pace and complete playoff matches in a reasonable amount of time.)
* The Top 8 players will be seated randomly at the draft table immediately prior to drafting. The Top 8 bracket will be determined using this random seating.
* Standings after the Swiss rounds will be used to determine final order in the standings for losing players in the quarterfinal and semifinal playoff rounds.
* For the first game of each match in the Top 8, the player that finished higher in the Swiss rounds chooses either to play first or to play second. For subsequent games in each Top 8 match, the usual Play/Draw rule applies (loser of the previous game decides whether to play first in the next game).
