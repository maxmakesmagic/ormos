This superdrop has traveled from the far future, or maybe the distant past, to deliver a warning! It lost the sticky note with the warning written on it somewhere in the temporal vortex, so you should probably not worry about it and [just check out the drops instead](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/news/good-times-secret-lairs-out-time-superdrop-2021-08-24).


*Innistrad: Midnight Hunt* and *Innistrad: Crimson Vow*

*Magic* in Store and Beyond in 2021
===================================


With communities and locations around the world establishing in-store play again—Friday Night *Magic* and Prerelease events are two ways to join in the fun already—we know players who can participate are eager for even more opportunities to battle.


Taking place this December, Store Championships are among the first ways you can play for glory and prizes right at your local game store—just compete and you'll receive a promo Arbor Elf, make Top 8 to take home a promo Collected Company, and win it all to claim the one promo Wurmcoil Engine available at your store. Even cooler, the winner and Top 8 promos awarded at WPN Premium stores will have the store name printed on them, confirming your championship victory there every time you play one.

Your play group can join in the storytelling, get a sweet promo card, and enjoy the unique experience your local WPN Premium store provides.


You can look forward to the details for both the first Commander Party weekend, October 30–31, as well as [Store Championships December 4–5](https://magic.gg/news/store-championships-arrive-december-2021).


*Innistrad: Double Feature*, *Pioneer Challenger Decks 2021*, and *Commander Collection: Black*
===============================================================================================


Local game stores aren't just one of the best places to play *Magic*; they're also where you'll find some amazing and exclusive ways to play and expand your collection.

*Magic*'s 2022 Releases
=======================


Four new Standard sets, starting with a return to the far future of Kamigawa and ending with a blast to Dominaria's past, headline *Magic*'s biggest year of releases ever.



![2022 Magic Release Schedule Timeline](https://media.wizards.com/2021/images/daily/CNVBfOJATH.jpg)\*Some logos not final
![Kamigawa: Neon Dynasty logo](https://media.wizards.com/2021/images/daily/DvfP0kSxSs.png)


![Kamigawa: Neon Dynasty Key Art](https://media.wizards.com/2021/images/daily/VxaIUG2u0X.png)


First up, a trip that was years in the making. The feudal past of Kamigawa sets the stage for the far-off future we return to with *Kamigawa: Neon Dynasty*. Filled with high-tech delight and homages to fan favorites, *Kamigawa: Neon Dynasty* comes to stores in the first quarter of 2022.


![Streets of New Capenna logo](https://media.wizards.com/2021/images/daily/OcqyP7ahOU.png)


![Streets of New Capenna Key Art](https://media.wizards.com/2021/images/daily/KqbK507i3L.png)


Trailing after our trip to Kamigawa like a detective with gumption, the following Standard release takes us to the *Streets of New Capenna*—a city with special significance to Elspeth, built by angels now run by three-color demon crime families.


We'll race through the *Streets of New Capenna* in the second quarter of 2022.


*Dominaria United*
------------------


![Dominaria United Key Art](https://media.wizards.com/2021/images/daily/3yv0HotV5S.png)


Dominaria holds a special place in *Magic* across the lore of game and in the hearts of fans around the world. With so much story and decades of *Magic* history packed into one plane, our next visit with *Dominaria United* is the perfect place to kick off our 30th anniversary celebration.


You'll be able to enjoy the original high-fantasy *Magic* setting again in the third quarter of 2022.


*The Brothers' War*
-------------------


![The Brothers' War Concept Art](https://media.wizards.com/2021/images/daily/5I4GcW1WXg.png)


While *Magic*'s history stretches back 30 years, the lore of Dominaria itself is much longer. Returning to a pivotal story of Dominaria's—and *Magic*'s—history, what started as a feud between Urza and Mishra erupted into an all-out war that set into motion the future of the plane and Multiverse itself.


Through the lens of Dominaria's locations, characters, and victims of the conflict, we'll see a plane-spanning conflict escalate with artifacts, giant mechs, and beyond in *The Brothers' War*—arriving to stores everywhere in the fourth quarter of 2022.




---

That covers the four Standard releases for *Magic* next year, but it's far from everything on the way. Fans of Commander, *Jumpstart*, and more have plenty on the way in 2022, too.


![Unfinity logo](https://media.wizards.com/2021/images/daily/1jEtGxz71W.jpg)


![Unfinity Key Art](https://media.wizards.com/2021/images/daily/1jEtGxz71W_2.png)


It's *Magic*. It's in space. It's retro-futuristic fun meets a space carnival you must see to believe. *Unfinity* brings the joy and celebration of combining *Magic*'s mechanics with new characters, plenty of laughs—plus beautiful science fiction-themed full-art basic lands and shock lands—in both Draft and Collector Booster packs releasing in the second quarter of 2022.



![Commander Legends: Battle for Baldur's Gate logo](https://media.wizards.com/2021/images/daily/b9eRbNrKh4.jpg)\*logo not final
![Commander Legends: Battle for Baldur's Gate Concept Art](https://media.wizards.com/2021/images/daily/b9eRbNrKh4_2.png)


The debut of [*Dungeons & Dragons: Adventures in the Forgotten Realms*](https://magic.wizards.com/en/products/forgotten-realms) brought a mix of *Magic* and D&D to life in amazing ways—with many more stories and characters from the Forgotten Realms to share. Focusing on the city of Baldur's Gate and building on the Commander-first gameplay of 2019's *Commander Legends*, our return to Commander Draft with *Commander Legends: Battle for Baldur's Gate* brings in iconic characters, new mechanics, more flavorful spells from D&D, plus *Commander Legends*-style foil-etched legendary creatures—all packed into an even greater social experience.


Be ready when the battle begins in the second quarter of 2022.



![Double Masters 2022 logo](https://media.wizards.com/2021/images/daily/U9gYxWs68O.jpg)\*logo not final

Exploring *Universes Beyond*
============================


![Universes Beyond logo](https://media.wizards.com/2021/images/daily/lkbac98aoiJKDFjhLec_1.png)


Earlier this year [we shared an early peek at some of the incredible *Magic* to come with *Universes Beyond*](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/news/magics-voyages-universes-beyond-2021-02-25). Today, we blew the doors open with new details and exciting artwork: 2022 and beyond sets up *Magic* players to explore even more incredible worlds and stories.

What's Next for *MTG Arena*?
============================


This year's launch of *MTG Arena* on mobile opened the game up to a whole new audience. In 2022, we'll continue adding more experiences that fans enjoy, whether that's practicing and polishing their tabletop Standard decks online or discovering the unique gameplay available with digital play, such as [the August 26 release of *Jumpstart: Historic Horizons*](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/magic-digital/what-mtg-arenas-jumpstart-historic-horizons-2021-07-26).


![2021 Standard rotation graphic](https://media.wizards.com/2021/images/daily/jjgJGDO870jvkg7.png)


Standard rotates soon, and we'll see *Throne of Eldraine*, *Theros Beyond Death*, *Ikoria: Lair of Behemoths*, and *Core Set 2021* move to be legal only in Historic. As we move to playing with sets from *Zendikar Rising* forward, [we'll celebrate a new year of Standard for all players with a renewal egg filled with goodies](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/magic-digital/renewal-mtg-arenas-2021-standard-rotation-2021-07-02)—such as card packs and individual card rewards—when *Innistrad: Midnight Hunt* releases for *MTG Arena* on September 16.


Plus, those sets that rotated out of Standard will continue to shine thanks to the new Historic Brawl queue that arrives today! Pick your favorite legendary creature, build your 100-card Historic deck, and battle anytime, anywhere on *MTG Arena*.


And, if you want more competitive opportunities online, look forward to upcoming Arena Opens for your chance to win up to $2,000. Beyond Standard, Historic, and Sealed Deck, we're also adding Draft to the mix as well—something that will delight players who already battle to Mythic ranks with 40-card decks.


![Jumpstart: Historic Horizons logo](https://media.wizards.com/2021/images/daily/Jdueh727fh.jpg)


As we mentioned above, [*Jumpstart: Historic Horizons* arrives this Thursday, August 26](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/magic-digital/what-mtg-arenas-jumpstart-historic-horizons-2021-07-26)!
