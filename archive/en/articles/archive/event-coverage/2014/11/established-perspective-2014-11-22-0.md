Jacob Van Lunen began playing Magic in 1995. He has participated in organized play at every level of competition and was a member of the winning team at Pro Tour San Diego in 2007, thanks to an innovative draft strategy. As a writer, Van Lunen has had more than three hundred Magic strategy pieces published 





At this point, we've had well over a month to draft and play Sealed Deck with *Khans of Tarkir*. I sat down with some players that have a ton of experience playing or watching the new Limited format at every level of competition. I asked them about card power levels and their own personal preferences in an effort to better understand the pick orders of the new Limited format. Here's what they had to say:
