![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gpmad04/r12fm2_1.jpg)Thomas Gundersen is the only undefeated player in the tournament and they're playing to decide who wins the table. ### Game 1

Thomas started with [Auriok Bladewarden](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Auriok+Bladewarden), [Leonin Battlemage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leonin+Battlemage) and [Razor Golem](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Razor+Golem) to Antoine's [Tanglewalker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tanglewalker), [Tel-Jilad Exile](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tel-Jilad+Exile) and [Fangren Hunter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fangren+Hunter). On his turn Thomas [Arrest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arrest)ed the Fangren and [Electrostatic Bolt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Electrostatic+Bolt)ed the [Tanglewalker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tanglewalker). Antoine looked dazzled and both players agreed that that had been a good hand. Thomas sent the whole team in, and Antoine dropped to seven, and played his [Loxodon Warhammer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Loxodon+Warhammer).

Thomas used the battlemage ability, showed the [Blinding Beam](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blinding+Beam) and attacked thinking he had won the game. Unfortunately (for him) Antoine didn't agree and [Shatter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shatter)ed his hope (the golem in this case) and went to three life. Antoine then played an [Elf Replica](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elf+Replica), which besides being able to block one attack, could also sacrifice himself to remove the [Arrest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arrest).

Thomas, thinking this was the Frenchman's intention, attacked with the battlemage, but Antoine used an [Echoing Courage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Echoing+Courage) and the elf killed the auriok. Thomas then played Klark Clan Grunt. Had he used the battlemage and then played the grunt before the attack, he would have been able to save the mage with his bladewarden.

Antoine equipped the elf and attacked, going back to eight life ant putting Thomas at ten.  
 He then uses the elf to clear the [Arrest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arrest), and on his next turn equips the Hunter, increasing the difference in life points and forcing Thomas to concede...

### Game 2

Once again Thomas began with [Auriok Bladewarden](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Auriok+Bladewarden), but followed it with [Pearl Shard](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pearl+Shard) and [Hematite Golem](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hematite+Golem). Antoine played a [Viridian Longbow](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Viridian+Longbow) and cleared Thomas' artifacts with [Viridian Shaman](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Viridian+Shaman) and [Creeping Mold](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Creeping+Mold), and the warden traded with the shaman in combat. 

Antoine played a [Tangle Golem](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tangle+Golem) and for some turns it was the only creature in play, taking Thomas to eight life. The golem was finally removed with an [Electrostatic Bolt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Electrostatic+Bolt), and replaced with an [Elf Replica](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elf+Replica) and [Tanglewalker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tanglewalker).

Thomas killed both creatures with a [Fireball](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fireball) and played [Loxodon Mystic](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Loxodon+Mystic). Now it was Thomas time to attack, eventually bringing his opponent to seven life. When Antoine used and [Iron Myr](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Iron+Myr) to block the mystic, after two [Echoing Courage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Echoing+Courage)s and an [Razor Barrier](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Razor+Barrier) both creatures continued in play. 

A [Somber Hoverguard](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Somber+Hoverguard) from Thomas didn't seem to be enough for Antoine's [Plated Slagwurm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plated+Slagwurm), but an entwined [Blinding Beam](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blinding+Beam) gave him the turns needed to deal the remaining damage to Antoine.

### Game 3

One of Thomas [Auriok Bladewarden](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Auriok+Bladewarden)s was once more the first creature in play. He cycled a [Sunbeam Spellbomb](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sunbeam+Spellbomb), played [Leonin Battlemage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leonin+Battlemage) and [Hematite Golem](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hematite+Golem). Antoine cast [Tanglewalker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tanglewalker), [Viridian Longbow](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Viridian+Longbow) and for a couple of turns tried to kill the warden, but it was saved with a [Razor Barrier](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Razor+Barrier). Finally Antoine was able to kill him, and also [Deconstruct](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deconstruct)ed the golem, using the mana to play a 5/5 [Wurmskin Forger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wurmskin+Forger).

The players started racing, both bringing more creatures to play, but Antoine's removal ([Barbed Lightning](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Barbed+Lightning) and [Creeping Mold](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Creeping+Mold)) unbalanced the race in his favor and was able to win the match at two life.
