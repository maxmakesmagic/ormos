Reigning Worlds Captain Marcelino Freeman is a popular guy. While it would be stretching the truth to say I had to get in line to speak with him, there were plenty of handshakes and well-wishing done before I managed to steal him away. First up, I asked him about the biggest changes that *Fate Reforged* has brought to the draft format.


"Most importantly, green is a lot better. People didn't like Temur in all-Khans, but now it's very playable. Red-Green, too. You have access to more quality big creatures."


Freeman's draft kicked off with [Mistfire Adept](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mistfire+Adept). "A very powerful card that makes your spells even better. Gives you another way to push through damage." He followed this with [Bathe in Dragonfire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bathe+in+Dragonfire), solid removal, then had his choice of Write Into Being or [Frost Walker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Frost+Walker). He chose the latter, saying "On turn two it is so good, it gives you ferocious, and it doesn't die for free as much as you might think." He got a gift on the following pack, a [Goblin Heelcutter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Heelcutter). "It's a good signal, I've taken this card as high as first-pick."


Fifth pick he decided to spread out, taking [Whisperer of the Wilds](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Whisperer+of+the+Wilds) over [Cunning Strike](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cunning+Strike). "This was another signal. I was blue-red, and hoping to just be straight blue-red or with a small splash, but it was still early in the draft and if green was open I wanted to be green. Next up came [Hunt the Weak](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hunt+the+Weak). "It's a better trick than people think, especially in Temur." [Destructor Dragon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Destructor+Dragon) was proof enough that green was where Freeman wanted to be. "It's expensive but it's still a 4/4 flier." He finished the pack off with a [Feral Krushok](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Feral+Krushok) and a [Mardu Scout](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mardu+Scout).


"Here I was still open to going either Temur or even just red-green. I didn't have any mana fix yet, so that was a concern."

Pack two started with disappointment. It fanned out into a wealth of Abzan goodies, but had only an [Arrow Storm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arrow+Storm) to offer Freeman. Second pick he had his choice of spells between [Force Away](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Force+Away), [Bring Low](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bring+Low), and [Master the Way](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Master+the+Way). He chose the cheapest option. He followed that up with a [Swiftwater Cliffs](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swiftwater+Cliffs), seeming to settle on being Temur. "I'd say I wasn't 100% committed yet, not really until the start of Pack 3."


The middle of the pack gave him a pair of Alpine Grizzlies and a [Longshot Squad](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Longshot+Squad), solid playables but nothing spectacular. He had to take [Thornwood Falls](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thornwood+Falls) over [Temur Charm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Temur+Charm) out of respect for his stretched mana base. There was one glimmer of hope – an eighth-pick [Savage Punch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Savage+Punch). His deck would take as many of those as he could get. "That was crazy, getting it so late. And with two [Alpine Grizzly](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Alpine+Grizzly) already."


Pack three started with another [Arrow Storm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arrow+Storm) ("I love that card") and then [Temur Ascendancy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Temur+Ascendancy), over [Pine Walker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pine+Walker). "Ascendancy is obviously a powerful effect when it works, drawing cards and haste for your creatures. In all-Khans you really had to force it, though, get it early and make sure you had enough ferocious guys. It's much better now."


Third pick had a dilemma for him: [Swiftwater Cliffs](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swiftwater+Cliffs), [Glacial Stalker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glacial+Stalker) or [Canyon Lurkers](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Canyon+Lurkers). Freeman surprised me by taking the [Lurker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lurker)s. "At this point I knew I needed creatures, and especially ones with high power. Also I was only really looking at playing two or three blue cards, so taking the [Lurker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lurker)s helped the mana." The rest of the pack gave him a late [Snowhorn Rider](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snowhorn+Rider), a second [Thornwood Falls](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thornwood+Falls), and third copies of [Arrow Storm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arrow+Storm) and [Alpine Grizzly](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Alpine+Grizzly).


"It's a good deck, not really a 3-0 though, probably 2-1. I don't have a lot of 2's, I'd love another Whisperer or a [Rattleclaw Mystic](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rattleclaw+Mystic). The mana worked out very well, though, all my dual lands are blue, so I didn't need many islands."
