Legacy is a format where there are literally hundreds of decks to choose from and personal preference plays a big part in picking one. We asked some of the players what deck they are piloting and why they decided on that particular deck.

### Andrew Shrout


**Age:** 26  
**Hometown:** Kentucky, USA


 

**Deck:**  

Death and Taxes


**Motivation:**  

"First of all it is a deck that I actually have access to, which isn't always guaranteed in Legacy. Also I think it's the best "fair" deck of the format. And among the non-combo decks it has the best game against combo decks. I don't really have a preference for a certain type of deck. I like to mix it up and if I get a chance to play a new deck, i'll take it."

### Tzu-Ching Kuo


**Age:** 32  
**Hometown:** Taipei,Taiwan


 

**Deck:**  

Sneak and Show


**Motivation:**  

"This is actually my first ever Legacy tournament. And since I don't have any idea about the format or what deck to play I chose a combo deck. That way I could test by playing it solitaire on my own."

### Marc Beckkönig


**Age:** 21  
**Hometown:** Århus, Denmark


 

**Deck:**  

UWR Miracles


**Motivation:**  

"I though about what [True-Name Nemesis](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=True-Name+Nemesis) has done to the format and I think Miracles is the best deck to fight the ones that take advantage of the [Nemesis](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nemesis). Also I've always liked control decks, and playing a game where you are in control after the first critical turns is something I really know how to do."

### Quintus van de Geer


**Age:** 28  
**Hometown:** Zwolle, The Netherlands


 

**Deck:**  

"Blood Delver"


**Motivation:**  

"It's a [Delver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Delver) deck, that is also built around [Death's Shadow](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Death%27s+Shadow). With [Street Wraith](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Street+Wraith), [Gitaxian Probe](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gitaxian+Probe), [Snuff Out](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snuff+Out) and [Watery Grave](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Watery+Grave) I deal damage to myself to make [Death's Shadow](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Death%27s+Shadow) big. I've been playing *Magic* for a very long time, but I always play my own decks. This is the result of over two years of testing the format and the first time I play the deck in a tournament.

### Per Niklasson


**Age:** 31  
**Hometown:** Helsingborg, Sweden


 

**Deck:**  

Reanimator


**Motivation:**  

"I started playing reanimator before Grand Prix Strasbourg last year. I expected a lot of combo decks and it is the best combo deck against other combo decks. If personal preference would be the deciding factor I would play Bant for 15 more years, but this is very much a metagame choice. In a big unknown meta I want to play something that has a strong game plan and that is good against combo. Reanimator does some very unfair things and allows you to draw a crazy amount of cards, and in the end doing that is why we all play *Magic*, isn't it?"

### Anja Rønning


**Age:** 26  
**Hometown:** Trondheim, Norway


 

**Deck:**  

Jund


**Motivation:**  

"It is simply the deck I have played the most. This is my second Grand Prix with Jund, I played it to a 4-3 finish last year in Strasbourg. For me the most important thing when picking a deck is to play something that I feel secure with. And in Legacy that is Jund since I have played it a lot."

### Baptist Matthys


**Age:** 33  
**Hometown:** Ghent, Belgium


 

**Deck:**  

Shardless BUG


**Motivation:**  

"I like control decks, since they are the ones I've had the most success with. I've been playing Shardless BUG for two or three years now and although it might not be the best deck in the format anymore it is certainly in the top 5. It plays only good cards, and for every turn that passes in a game your chances of winning increases. It might not be as good as BUG Delver, but I really dislike tempo decks and I rather aim to beat them than play one myself."
