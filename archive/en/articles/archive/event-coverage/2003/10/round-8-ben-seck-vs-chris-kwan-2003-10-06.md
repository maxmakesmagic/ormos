Ben Seck has two types of Grand Prix's… The ones he wins and the ones that end in tragedy in the final round of Day #1. Today, In the final match of Day 1 he plays Brisbane's Chris Kwan. Chris and Ben are part of elite club with very exclusive membership - both player's have 6-0 the draft portion of the Australian Nationals to follow it with 0-4 on day #2.

TBS opened with a [Gold Myr](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gold+Myr) on the second turn as Kwan follows in kind with a silver. Seck swings for an early point before dropping a [Soldier Replica](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soldier+Replica). This is where Kwan takes full advantage Kwan gets the 4th turn [Flayed Nim](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flayed+Nim) with the mana acceleration. Tapped out, Seck continued to attack with impunity putting Kwan down to 17.

Seck follows with a [Leonin Den-Guard](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leonin+Den-Guard) and a [Leaden Myr](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leaden+Myr). The [Flayed Nim](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flayed+Nim) begins the offensive for Kwan with 2 as on the 5th turn he drops a [Pewter Golem](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pewter+Golem). Not one to be afraid and noting slightly better tempo than Seck he sends in all his men, happy to trade to [Soldier Replica](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soldier+Replica) for the regenerating Golem. Kwan then took to the air with a [Nim Shrieker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nim+Shrieker), coming down as a 1/1. Again with impunity, Seck attacked scoring 1 point of damage 3 times, with Chris countering with a [Myr Enforcer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Myr+Enforcer), and an all-out attack of his own. With the Enforcer [Shatter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shatter)ed in the combat, the damage from Chris dropped Seck to a mere 6 life.

Holding 1 Myr back this time Seck came in for another 2, before summoning a [Pewter Golem](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pewter+Golem) of his own. With a slender lead of 7-6, Kwan deconstructed the golem spilling his extra mana into a [Vulshok Battlegear](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vulshok+Battlegear). The Battlegear landed on the Nim, giving it the 6 power, just enough to put him over the line.

 Kwan 1 - Seck 0

Seck, as the primary gamer, elects to mulligan. After looking at the next 4 land coming to add to the 5 hand he currently was satisfied that that was the correct choice. Shuffling out a new hand of 6 cards he studied them carefully.

Pain….

Just one land…. After much thought he throws in his hand and heads to 5 cards….. 

Kwan doesn't even cut this time - Seck is doing enough. He has a slow hand, but will now happily keep it.

With 2 lands, 2 equipment and a blinding beam, Seck proceeded with a land and a Myr and a [Vulshok Battlegear](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vulshok+Battlegear), with Kwan responding with a Myr of his own. On the third turn, Kwan [Deconstruct](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deconstruct)s the Battlegear, gaining the double green mana needed for [Glissa Sunseeker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glissa+Sunseeker).

With another equipment and a [Goblin War Wagon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+War+Wagon) in hand it seems that all is lost. Off a double mulligan…. The pain… As the consumate showman however, Ben offers a draw….. Hey, you've gotta ask, right?

Cast a [Pewter Golem](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pewter+Golem), stopping to destroy the War Wagon with Glissa - Attack

Cast a [Myr Enforcer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Myr+Enforcer), stopping to destroy the [Vulshok Battlegear](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vulshok+Battlegear) with Gilssa - Attack

The dream of a third Grand Prix for "The Ben Seck" has ended…. Well, at least for this tournament.

Kwan 2 defeats Seck 0.
