Introduction
============


Greetings from Zendikar! It's time to take a brief look at the Comprehensive Rules and Oracle changes (or not, see below) being made with the release of *Battle for Zendikar*. By the time you read this, the Prerelease will be behind us. I had a blast at the employee version and took an Expedition out to game stores near me. Yesterday, R&D checked out photos of game stores around the world and how they celebrated the Prerelease. It was awesome! I saw many of my favorite things in the photos: smiling players, *Magic* cosplay, and mana symbol cupcakes.


Speaking of smiling players and *Magic* cosplay (but sadly, no cupcakes), [PAX happened](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/arcana/pax-prime-retrospective-2015-09-03)! The *Battle for Zendikar* celebration was a sight to behold, with Eldrazi attacking the convention center and an entire building filled with *Magic*. Unfortunately for us here in Rulesland, planning for PAX ingested a lot of time. So much time, in fact, that we didn't really have an opportunity to finalize any Oracle changes this time around. There are a few things on the Oracle agenda for next time, however.


The Comprehensive Rules got their usual allotment of updates. I'll detail those on the next page. Nothing plane-devouring, but we have a few new abilities to incorporate.


As always, if there's a card or rule you think needs a second (or, more likely, fiftieth) look, let me know! You can hit me up on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/TabakRules) or [tumblr](http://tabakrules.tumblr.com/). Sadly, I don't have enough time to respond to everything I get, or to write articles on time apparently . . . but I do try. Until next time, Rulesland out!
