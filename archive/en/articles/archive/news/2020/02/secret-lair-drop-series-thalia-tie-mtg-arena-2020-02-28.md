On March 12, *Magic: The Gathering Arena* will be updating Historic with 25 new cards to add to players' arsenals—and *Secret Lair* is going to get in on some of the action.

Among those 25 new cards, players will discover a powerful two-drop in [Thalia, Guardian of Thraben](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thalia%2C+Guardian+of+Thraben)—a card that has befuddled opponents in nearly every *Magic* format, digitally and in paper. On the same day that Thalia joins Historic, players can order a special *Secret Lair Drop Series* set of four [Thalia, Guardian of Thraben](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thalia%2C+Guardian+of+Thraben) featuring four new depictions of the popular legend with Thalia: Beyond the Helvault. It's a celebration of paper and *MTG Arena* players that unites us all in our hatred of opponents who mess with our stuff.


But what's this we said about 25 new cards for Historic? Well . . .


Historic Anthology II
=====================


On March 12, *MTG Arena* is releasing its second Anthology of new cards going straight into the Historic format, alongside the return of Historic Ranked and Traditional Historic Ranked queues. Both queues will kick off March 12 and run until April 16.


The State of the Game on March 5 will have more information, but you can [read about the new cards here](https://www.destructoid.com/exclusive-magic-arena-is-getting-new-historic-cards-and-a-secret-lair-tie-in-581262.phtml) or just glance down about half an inch:

All 25 cards will be craftable via Wildcards or you can purchase a playset (four copies of each card) for either 4,000 gems or 25,000 gold.


Thalia: Beyond the Helvault
===========================


Just like previous *Secret Lair* drops, Thalia: Beyond the Helvault will be available for 24 hours only at [secretlair.wizards.com](https://secretlair.wizards.com/us). This sale starts at 9 a.m. PT on March 12, and you can pick up your copy of Thalia: Beyond the Helvault for $29.99. Limit of 15 per customer.


Here's what you'll get with each copy of Thalia: Beyond the Helvault—


* Four premium foil copies of [Thalia, Guardian of Thraben](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thalia%2C+Guardian+of+Thraben), each with different art and flavor text
* One code for *MTG Arena* that redeems for a digital sleeve featuring Thalia: Beyond the Helvault art and four cardstyles—one for each *Secret Lair* version of Thalia—for [Thalia, Guardian of Thraben](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thalia%2C+Guardian+of+Thraben). These aren't copies of the card—those come in the bundle or through crafting—but they do make the copies of Thalia you own into something special. \*\*

\*\*[MTG Arena Redemption] is not available in the following regions: China, Hong Kong, Macao, Taiwan, and Vietnam.


Thalia: Beyond the Helvault is being published in English and features new artistic interpretations of Thraben's brave guardian by Johannes Voss and Magali Villeneuve, each depicting the character at a different pivotal moment in her life.


They look a little something like this:
