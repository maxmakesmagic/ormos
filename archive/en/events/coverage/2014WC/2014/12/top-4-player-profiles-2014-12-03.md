**Age:** 34  
**Hometown:** Denver, CO  
**Record by Format:**  
*Vintage Masters* Draft: 3-0  

Modern: 4-0  
*Khans of Tarkir* Draft: 1-2  

Standard: 2-2


At the beginning of the 2014 season, Patrick Chapin famously and publicly set out to make this very tournament. He considered, he said, Pro Tours as something of a PTQ, as the best and most likely way he was going to earn his way back to the World Championship stage. It's the kind of audacious comment that few would dare to make—after all, winning a Pro Tour is something most players can only dream of—but coming from this particular Hall of Famer, it fits.


"It helps me be laser focused," Chapin said of his early season goal. "It let me pick the most popular decks in both Constructed formats rather than be fancy and clever."


But reaching the World Championship was never enough for Chapin. Happy to be here wasn't something on his mind—he wants another win.


"There are two more rounds till there are two more rounds," Chapin said of the tournament. "It's awesome to make the Top 4, but I'm also excited to have a few days to catch up on jet lag."


Chapin certainly put in the work to return to a World Championship Sunday stage for the first time since 2007, when he finished second. He said he played 40 hours a week—at least—and tested every format as thoroughly as possible.


For Standard, Chapin stuck with Abzan, a deck he believes is the best in the format, but which he was also very familiar with. With so many formats to prepare for, he said he wanted to make sure to optimize resources.


Speaking of optimizing resources, Chapin had a strong team helping him test. Paul Rietzl was the only other competitor to test with Chapin, but Kai Budde, Michael Jacob, Matt Sperling, and Allie Brosh also helped Chapin run through all of the prep work he felt he needed to do.


That helped him narrow down his options in Modern, a format he said they spent a huge amount of time testing.


"Modern is wide open, it's new, and there are crazy things happening," he said. "I knew I wanted to play [Treasure Cruise](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treasure+Cruise) and/or [Dig Through Time](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dig+Through+Time), but we had to eliminate a lot of decks to get it down to Delver."


The choice paid off as Chapin aced the Modern portion of the event with his Blue-Red Delver list, spring-boarding him to the only undefeated record on Day One.


And now he has a chance to improve on that 2007 finish, battling with the best of the best for glory, history, and the title of World Champion.

**Age:** 30  
**Hometown:** Tokyo, Japan  
**Record by Format:**  
*Vintage Masters* Draft: 2-1  

Modern: 2-2  
*Khans of Tarkir* Draft: 3-0  

Standard: 1-2-1


How does Kentaro Yamamoto feel about making the Top 4 of the World Championship? "Happy!" he said with smile. "I worked with Yuuya Watanabe and Yuuki Ichikawa. We shared decks for Modern, and we all tested online and shared our results together. We all used the same Modern deck and it played really well. There were a lot of combo decks and out deck played well against Combo. In standard I won one match and lost one, then drew with Watanabe so it's hard to say."


What would it mean to Yamamoto for a win on Sunday? "I would get to come back to play in the World Championship next year," Yamamoto said. "I have been playing *Magic* for ten years, but these past two years I've been playing *Magic Online* a lot. I've been trying to become a better player."


A prior loss is a moment that helped propel Yamamoto forward, and is one of his favored memories. "In 2007, I came in second place at the Two-Headed Giant Pro Tour with Yuuta Takahashi. I wanted to find that success again so I worked on *Magic Online* to become a better player."


When pressed if he was trying to make this Sunday a better memory than his Pro Tour finalist finish his face lit up in a grin. "Of course!"

**Age:** 21  
**Hometown:** Jerusalem, Israel and Sacramento, California  
**Record by Format:**  
*Vintage Masters* Draft: 3-0  

Modern: 2-2  
*Khans of Tarkir* Draft: 2-1  

Standard: 2-2


"It's been too long!" Shenhar didn't hide his grin at being a back-to-back World Championship Top 4 contender. The Top 4 of a tournament filled with some of the greatest *Magic* players in history is quite a feat.


Of course, how does that feel? "It feels absolutely amazing," Shenhar said. "I don't know, it's been such a long tournament. I went 50-50 in Constructed. I felt like every match I won was tough. I wasn't very happy about the Standard deck and the Modern deck. I did very well in Draft, so I basically went 5-1 then went 2-2 and 2-2 in Constructed. I think the Limited rounds were really fun, but I also did well in them."


Does it feel different compared to last year? "Last year was my first time. I felt like this before but it does feel different. It feels great but it's still the second time. Last year was a new experience, and this year is not," he said. "Last year when I made Top 4 I didn't really feel it right away. It'll take another day again."


Like others, Shenhar had some help preparing for the event, and enlisted some more for the Top 4 showdown on Sunday. "I have an awesome team to work with: Tom Martell and three more players, Josh Utter-Leyton, Paulo Vitor Damo da Rosa, and Will Edel," Shenhar shared. "Utter-Leyton's been helping me throughout the Swiss rounds. He talked me through his deck and what I should do against some opponents, and I wanted to give him a shout-out for that."


In his relatively short career, Shenhar has accomplished some of the greatest feats in the game. For him, his favorite moment in *Magic* was straightforward: "Winning the World Championship. Not even remotely close," he said. "Maybe it would have been my favorite if Martell, Damo da Rosa and I won Grand Prix Nashville. It's different when you're with a team. It's bittersweet since Matt Nass and his team—and I like Jacob Wilson too—did beat us then, and now he's qualified for the Pro Tour. We're testing together. It would have taken the bitter out of that if have won since Nass would still be qualified."
