After splitting the "normal" constructed formats (Standard and Online Extended), Sweden's Jens Thoren and Finland's Tomi Walamies turned to the Auction of the People decks to determine who would win the 2002 **Magic** Invitational.


A topdecked [Visara the Dreadful](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Visara+the+Dreadful) from the "V" deck brought it home for Thoren, who now gets the honor of having a card made in his likeness in the next **Magic** block. You can read all about the event on the [Sideboard](http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=sideboard/events/mi02), and can replay all the matches on [***Magic** Online*](http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=magic/magiconline/downloadlinks).
