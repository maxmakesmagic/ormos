He was staring down French Hall of Famer Raphael Levy, who is always a cutthroat competitor and is having a solid if unspectacular weekend so far.

**Game 1**

Kurihara won the die roll after both players agreed to go with the lowest total on the dice, then dropped a first-turn [Akrasan Squire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Akrasan+Squire). What looked to be a blazing start for the Japanese star quickly petered out, as he played nothing for the following two turns while Levy built up a multicolored mana base. When Shingou did finally make a second play, it was a doozy in the form of [Tower Gargoyle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tower+Gargoyle). Raph’s first creature, a [Death Baron](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Death+Baron), paled in comparison, and when Shingou’s 4/4 entered the red zone for the first time, Levy fell to just 9 life.

[Soul’s Fire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soul%E2%80%99s+Fire) from Levy managed to deal with his opponent’s [Akrasan Squire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Akrasan+Squire), saving him a point of damage each turn, but at 9 he was still in a precarious position. The next attack left him at 5, but Levy had a monstrous bomb to turn things around: [Flameblast Dragon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flameblast+Dragon)! Kurihara paused the game to think. Counting up his mana, he carefully tapped ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227125855im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/white.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161115194122im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/blue.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161115194122im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/blue.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227195556im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/black.gif).

“Oh man, [Punish Ignorance](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Punish+Ignorance)?” asked his opponent. When Kurihara revealed the [Absorb](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Absorb) / [Undermine](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Undermine) hybrid counterspell, Raphael just smiled and scooped his cards up.

Kurihara 1, Levy 0

**Game 2**

[Akrasan Squire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Akrasan+Squire) came right out of the gates again for Kurihara in the second game, but Levy had a turn-one play of his own in [Deathgreeter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deathgreeter). The underwhelming 1/1 was a possible sideboard addition to Levy’s deck, and a smart one against Kurihara’s aggro-Esper build. Levy stayed in lock step with Kurihara, playing [Elvish Visionary](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elvish+Visionary) to match the Japanese player’s second-turn [Deft Duelist](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deft+Duelist).

Still, thanks to the bonus from exalted, Levy couldn’t find a profitable way to block and quickly fell behind in the race. When Kurihara played an [Esper Battlemage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Esper+Battlemage), he threatened to wipe Levy’s board entirely. Raphael was prepared, using a [Naturalize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Naturalize) to blow up the 2/2 and gaining a life in the process thanks to his [Deathgreeter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deathgreeter). Still unable to block in a beneficial manner, Levy went on the offensive dealing 2 to his opponent with an attack from both Visionary and [Deathgreeter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deathgreeter).

Kurihara found a fourth mana, just in time for [Tower Gargoyle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tower+Gargoyle). The 4/4 sent Raphael Levy into the tank; the last time he had faced the artifact monster the game hadn’t gone well. Either lacking an immediate solution or not willing to play it, Raph spent his turn using [Blister Beetle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blister+Beetle) to blow up Shingou’s [Akrasan Squire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Akrasan+Squire). The Japanese player simply replaced his exalted 1/1 with a second in the form of [Dawnray Archer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dawnray+Archer), then bashed Raphael to 10.

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/worlds08/r10_levy.jpg)*Raphael Levy of France finds his back to a wall.* Behind but looking to stabilize, Levy played his [Flameblast Dragon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flameblast+Dragon). That left him tapped out, however, and he was unable to block Kurihara’s return swing, putting the score at 17-5 in Kurihara’s favor. The Frenchman was able to attack with his 5/5, using its triggered ability to blow up Shingou’s [Tower Gargoyle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tower+Gargoyle), but Shingou had a [Resounding Silence](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Resounding+Silence) to put an end to the Dragon. When Kurihara followed up with a [Tidehollow Sculler](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tidehollow+Sculler), Raphael Levy shook his head, muttering under his breath. The little 2/2 nabbed a mighty [Jungle Weaver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jungle+Weaver), and Levy’s prospects looked a bit more meager than they had a moment before. Minus his fatty, the game was turning into a stalemate instead of a blowout in his favor.

Kurihara quickly made matters worse using a [Sanctum Gargoyle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sanctum+Gargoyle) to get back [Tower Gargoyle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tower+Gargoyle), and playing a second [Dawnray Archer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dawnray+Archer). That meant his 2/3 [Sanctum Gargoyle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sanctum+Gargoyle) would actually be a 4/5 when attacking alone, and at 6 life Raphael didn’t have long to find a solution. When the top of his deck revealed an Obelisk, Levy found himself down and out of options.

Kurihara 2, Levy 0

After the match the two players revealed their thoughts on their decks.

“My deck is so-so,” said Kurihara. “My mana base is bad, but my cards are good.”

Levy seemed less enthused, despite having some bombs in his deck. “I’m playing 20 mana sources....” he complained.
