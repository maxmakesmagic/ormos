*Got any stories from the New Phyrexia Prerelease?*

I'm so happy that working at Wizards of the Coast hasn't stopped me from attending Prereleases. I meet so many great people at these events, many of whom have eventually become part of my play group, and my friends.

What's different about Wizards' Employee Prereleases? My first three matches were against members of R&D, for starters. Also, they are less structured, since they lack any DCI sanctioning. When you want another match, all you have to do is wait for the next player to walk by and yell, "Challenge!"

The deck I built was white-blue with little or no late game. Sure, I have the awesome [Suture Priest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Suture+Priest) rewarding me for casting creatures and punishing you for casting yours, several [Spined Thopter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spined+Thopter)s to start beating you up on turn two or three, and [Norn's Annex](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Norn%27s+Annex) to, again, punish you for having creatures and actually wanting to attack with them. But when it came to winning games, my deck didn't seem to care.

Then four of us played Two-Headed Giant!

We didn't rebuild any decks. We just rolled to see who was on whose team and started the battle. [Norn's Annex](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Norn%27s+Annex) was an all-star since neither of our opponents were playing white, and casting [Halt Order](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Halt+Order) on their [Moltensteel Dragon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Moltensteel+Dragon) felt incredible. But the best moment of our Two-Headed Giant match (yes, we played three games) was when my teammate and I each slammed a [Thundering Tanadon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thundering+Tanadon) on turn four! Paying 8 life to do so later cost us the game, but having two 5/4 tramplers swinging on turn five felt incredible.

P.S. We won the match!
