DAY 1 COVERAGE



Day 1 of Grand Prix Utrecht 2015, the second leg of our world-spanning Modern Masters Weekend, is in the books. 3,613 players had started the tournament in the morning, but after nine grueling rounds of Sealed Deck play, this number has been reduced to a much more manageable but still impressive 387.


These 387 will return tomorrow when it's time for *Modern Masters 2015 Edition* Booster Draft. So will we. Join us then, when players battle for the fame, the glory, and their chance to Make Magic History!
