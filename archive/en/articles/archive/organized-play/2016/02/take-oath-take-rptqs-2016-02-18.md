This weekend, hundreds of individuals will be competing worldwide for their shot at [Pro Tour *Shadows over Innistrad*](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/premierplay/protour/ptsoi). Regional Pro Tour Qualifiers (RPTQs) for the next Pro Tour start this weekend, giving previous 5th- through 8th-place finishers from the last RPTQ round, Silver-level players in the [Pro Players Club](http://magic.wizards.com/en/protour/playersclub/standings), and Preliminary Pro Tour Qualifier (PPTQ) winners from August 22 to November 22, 2015, a chance to compete on the big stage.


In addition to that, the Player of the Month ([#MTGPOM](https://twitter.com/hashtag/MTGPoM)) has a new home here in Organized Play. We're catching up with January's Player of the Month this week.


RPTQs for Pro Tour *Shadows over Innistrad*
===========================================


Regional Pro Tour Qualifiers for the upcoming Pro Tour begin this weekend and carry through into next weekend as well, giving players a chance at an invitation and a travel award to Pro Tour *Shadows over Innistrad* in Madrid, Spain, on April 22–24, 2016.


All players competing in an RPTQ either this weekend or next will receive this event-exclusive deck box along with a promo [Snapcaster Mage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snapcaster+Mage).

Each Top 16 finisher will earn one of these as well:

And finally:


* If a Regional Pro Tour Qualifier has 128 or fewer players, the Top 4 players will earn an invitation and travel award for Pro Tour *Shadows over Innistrad*.
* If a Regional Pro Tour Qualifier has 129 or more players, the Top 8 players will earn an invitation and travel award for Pro Tour *Shadows over Innistrad*.

Players who are qualified to compete in an RPTQ also have the option to instead compete in one on *Magic Online*! This is the first round in which *Magic Online* RPTQs have been offered. Rather than the in-person swag, online RPTQ competitors will receive a promotional *Magic Online* copy of [Snapcaster Mage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snapcaster+Mage). The Top 8 competitors in each *Magic Online* RPTQ will receive invitations to Pro Tour *Shadows over Innistrad*, along with entries into a Pro Tour Challenge event at the big show in Madrid on Sunday.


Who will find themselves heading to Madrid, Spain, in April to compete in brand new Standard and Booster Draft formats? We'll see who qualifies from 20 of the RPTQs this round starting next week.


The format for this round's Regional Pro Tour Qualifiers is Standard Constructed. Full information on this round of RPTQs can be found on the [RPTQ event information page](http://magic.wizards.com/en/protour/rptq2nd16).


Oh, and one more thing. We'll start posting RPTQ Top 8 Standard decklists in this column starting next Thursday (with special thanks in advance to the stores for providing them!).


Player of the Month (#MTGPOM): January 2016
===========================================


The Player of the Month has a new home in Organized Play, and we're kicking things off with some 2016 catch-up. January featured four Grand Prix Champions, along with a Super Sunday Series Champion.

[Oakland](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/gpoak16) and [Mexico City](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/gpmex16) winners Reid Duke and Fabrizio Anteri, respectively, added an astounding *fourth* Grand Prix title each to their career résumés, and it wouldn't be surprising to see them as the two nominations that will garner the loudest support. Are you on #TeamReid or #TeamFabrizio? Or should the honor go to [Vancouver](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/gpvan16)'s winner, Adam Jansen, [Nagoya](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/gpnag16)'s winner, Tomonori Hirami, or [Super Sunday Series](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/2016SSSC) Champion Sam Black instead? And what of Hall of Famer Ben Rubin, who famously placed second at Grand Prix Oakland with a 64-card deck?


Let us know using the hashtag [#MTGPOM](https://twitter.com/hashtag/MTGPoM), and make your selection for January's Player of the Month! We'll announce the winner next Thursday.
