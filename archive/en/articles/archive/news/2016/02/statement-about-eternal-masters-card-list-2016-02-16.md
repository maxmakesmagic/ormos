We're aware of the rumors that an individual is in possession of the card list for *Eternal Masters*. If true, this is obviously a situation we take extremely seriously. We want to ensure that the entire *Magic* community knows that we DO NOT provide preferential treatment to any card vendor, distributor, or retailer; nor do we disclose detailed card set information prior to preview season.


Once we finish our investigation, we will assess what, if any, steps are needed to ensure fairness for the community.
