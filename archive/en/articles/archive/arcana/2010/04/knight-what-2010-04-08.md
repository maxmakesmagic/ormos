Let's talk for a moment about the *Rise of the Eldrazi* card Knight of Cliffhaven. For those of you who haven't committed it to memory, here it is again.

Well, let's consider this logically. If you were a kor knight in Zendikar and you wanted to find something that could fly you around, maybe something that knew it's way around a +2/+2 boost, what would you look for?

See the answer!
