UPDATED January 27, 2010

PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING CAREFULLY AND IN ITS ENTIRETY. THIS LICENSE DESCRIBES THE TERMS ON WHICH WIZARDS OF THE COAST LLC ("WIZARDS") OFFERS YOU ACCESS TO AN ACCOUNT TO PLAY THE GAME. BY CLICKING "I ACCEPT" AT THE BOTTOM OF THIS LICENSE, YOU ACCEPT ALL TERMS OF THE LICENSE. WIZARDS MAY, AT ANY TIME, ADD, REMOVE, OR MODIFY THIS LICENSE BY POSTING A REVISED LICENSE AND IDENTIFYING THE DATE OF THE UPDATE. YOUR CONTINUED USE OF THE GAME CONSITUTES YOUR AGREEMENT TO ALL SUCH TERMS. SHOULD YOU CHOOSE TO DECLINE, CLICK THE "I DECLINE" BUTTON, AT WHICH POINT YOU WILL BE UNABLE TO DOWNLOAD, USE OR PLAY THE GAME, GAME SERVICE (DEFINED BELOW), OR ACCOUNT (DEFINED BELOW). 

1. Magic: The Gathering Online Description. 

Magic: The Gathering Online is an online game service ("Game Service") that allows you to play the Game when you (a) obtain a copy of the Game either on CD-ROM ("CD") or via download from a Wizards web site or a designated partner site ("Download"), which includes software and associated media, printed materials and/or electronic documentation, (b) set up an account through the Game Service ("Account"), and (c) utilize any software programs provided to you as an Account holder through the Game Service (together with the CD and Download, hereinafter, "Software"). In the Game, you will create a library of licensed digital objects that depict physical Magic: The Gathering® trading cards, avatars, and event tickets that allow one to enter into tournaments, and you will obtain a limited license for the right to use such digital objects. You will not acquire any ownership interest in the digital objects. 

To play the Game, you must have at least the minimum system requirements to operate the Game and an Internet connection to access your Account. You are responsible for paying all taxes and for all hardware, software, service and other costs you incur to access your Account. Wizards may modify features, functions or abilities of any element of the Game, Game Service, Software or any digital objects in its discretion without notice to you.

2. Account Eligibility. 

The Account is personal to you and may not be transferred, sold or used by anyone else. The Game and Game Service are available only to individuals eighteen (18) years of age and older. If you are between the ages of thirteen (13) and eighteen (18), your parent or guardian must complete the registration process, in which case the parent or guardian will take full responsibility for all obligations under this License. By clicking the "I Accept" button and providing us with a credit card number when you register, you represent that you are at least eighteen (18) years of age and are either accepting this License on behalf of yourself or on behalf of your child. You may not transfer, sell, or share your Account with anyone, unless you are a parent or guardian, in which case you may permit one child to use the Account instead of yourself. You are liable for all activities conducted through the Account. 

2.1a Eligibility (United States). 

You must be physically located in a U.S. state in which participation in the tournaments offered on this Site is unrestricted by law. Rules governing sweepstakes, contests, and tournaments with entry fees and/or prizes are established by individual states. Based on those laws, residents of the following states may not participate in fee-based tournaments with prizes through the Site: Arizona, Arkansas, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Iowa, Louisiana, Maryland, Nevada, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont, and Washington. You must be physically located in a U.S. state in which participation in the tournaments offered on the Site is unrestricted by law. 

2.1b Eligibility (Non-U.S.). 

You are subject to all laws of the state, province, and/or country in which you reside and from which you access the Site, and you are solely responsible for obeying those laws. You agree the Site cannot be held liable if laws applicable to you restrict or prohibit your participation. The Site makes no representations or warranties, implicit or explicit, as to your legal right to participate in any tournament offered on the Site, nor shall any person affiliated with or claiming affiliation with the Site have authority to make any such representations or warranties. 

Wizards may require any participant receiving any prize to provide proof that he or she is eligible to participate according to Sections 2.1a and 2.1b. You remain solely responsible for paying all federal and other taxes in accordance with the laws that apply in your state, province, and/or country of residence. 

The Game Service is not directed to children under the age of thirteen (13). As such, if you are under the age of thirteen (13) you may not create an Account and are asked not to provide any personal information to Wizards. 

Game Service users (“Members”) whose Accounts have been previously terminated by Wizards may not access the Game Service in any manner or for any reason without the express written permission of Wizards. Active Members may not allow former Members to use the active Members' Account or User Name. 

3. Security and Passwords. 

Upon registration, you must select a User ID and password. You may not pick a User ID that violates anyone’s trademarks, publicity rights or other proprietary materials, or violates any other policies of the Game Service. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your password and for any harm resulting from your disclosure or from use by any person of your password to gain access to your Account and User Name. You may not disclose your password to any third party. You are responsible for all uses of your user name and password, whether or not authorized by you. Wizards will never ask you for your password; as such you should never disclose your password to anyone. There may be an additional charge to reissue lost passwords. You acknowledge that although we may offer a feature that allows you to "save" or "remember" your password on your hard drive, this feature makes it possible for third parties to access your computer and thus your Account. Should you choose to utilize this password memory feature, it will be at your own risk. Any attempt to deceive another user for the purposes of illicitly obtaining cards, passwords, account information etc. (aka "scamming") is prohibited and may result in the immediate termination of your account and loss of all cards therein. 

4. Privacy. 

You agree to Wizards’ Privacy Policy, which can be found here: <http://www.wizards.com/Company/About.aspx?x=wz_company_about_privacy>. By using the Game Service, you understand that your private communications and other personally identifiable information may be disclosed to third parties. For example, we may disclose information about you to private entities, law enforcement and other government officials as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate to investigate or resolve possible problems or inquires. Third parties may unlawfully intercept our access transmissions or private communications. Furthermore, if you request any technical support, you consent to our remote accessing and review of the computer you load the Software onto for purposes of support and debugging. You agree that we may communicate with you via email and any similar technology for any purpose relating to the Game Service and any other services or software which may in the future be provided by us or on our behalf. You understand that Wizards or its representatives may monitor all communications made by or received by you while using the Game Service. You consent to the extraction of hardware system profile data and any data related to operation of the Software through the Game Service from any computer that logs on to the Game Service using your Account. 

5. Partial License Termination/Exchange. 

The Game Service provides a mechanism whereby players can voluntarily terminate a portion of their limited license to use certain digital Magic: The Gathering cards for a corresponding set of physical Magic: The Gathering cards (“Physical Redemption”). Physical Redemption is only available for certain expansion sets as determined by Wizards in its discretion. To participate in the Physical Redemption program, you must (a) obtain the right to use all of the digital cards in a redeemable set, where such digital cards are in your Account; (b) request Physical Redemption for such redeemable set during its eligibility period as listed here: [http://wizards.custhelp.com/cgi-bin/wizards.cfg/php/enduser/std\_adp.php?...](http://wizards.custhelp.com/cgi-bin/wizards.cfg/php/enduser/std_adp.php?p_faqid=1545;) and (c) pay all shipping and handling costs. The online set of cards will then be removed from your Account. Wizards reserves the right to cancel or modify the Physical Redemption program at any time, including by limiting the number of sets that can be exchanged, limiting the number of online cards that will be released for use, or charging additional fees for this service. A partial license termination of digital Magic Online® cards may only be exchanged for physical Magic™ cards in a full set. A "full set" means one of each card from the expansion or base set to which it relates.

 6. Fees for Product and Service. 

 Fees for Game Product and billing procedures are contained at the billing section at [http://wizards.custhelp.com/cgi-bin/wizards.cfg/php/enduser/std\_adp.php?...](http://wizards.custhelp.com/cgi-bin/wizards.cfg/php/enduser/std_adp.php?p_faqid=81) ("Payment Page") which are incorporated by reference. All fees are stated in U.S. Dollars. All fees must be prepaid and are non-refundable, unless otherwise expressly stated for the product.

There currently are no membership fees for use of the game service. Wizards may change its Game products or fees and/or billing procedures upon notice of the changes that shall be posted on the Payment Page. You are responsible for reviewing the Payment Page to obtain timely notice of such changes. If any such change is unacceptable to you, you may terminate your Account as provided in Section 16. Your continued use of the Game and Game Service fifteen (15) days after posting of the changes on the Payment Page will indicate acceptance of such changes. You are fully liable for all charges under your Account, including any unauthorized charges. When you pay for any charges by credit card, you represent to Wizards that you are the authorized user of such credit card. You agree to promptly notify Wizards of any changes to your credit card account number, its expiration date and/or your billing address, and you agree to promptly notify Wizards if your credit card expires or is canceled for any reason.
