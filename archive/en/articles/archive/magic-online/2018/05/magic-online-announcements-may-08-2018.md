Team Vintage Super League x2
----------------------------


Fans of Team Vintage Super League, rejoice! You get *twice as much* this week, all for the low price of zero dollars! TVSL will go live at its regular time of 6 p.m. PT on Thursday at [twitch.tv/magic](https://www.twitch.tv/magic), but before that, it will also air tonight, Tuesday, at 6 p.m. You don't have to play (or even understand) Vintage to enjoy TVSL—in fact, it's a great way to learn more about *Magic*'s most complicated format!



TVSL will air each Thursday at 6 p.m. on [twitch.tv/magic](https://www.twitch.tv/magic). Learn more about it (and see who's playing) [here](https://vintagesuperleague.com/format-details/).



*Lorwyn* Flashbacks Coming Soon
-------------------------------


Faeries and Kithkin and Elementals, oh my! Sorry. We're just so excited to be visiting one of *Magic*'s most distinctive and flavorful worlds again. Mark your calendars: *Lorwyn* Flashback Drafts will be available on *Magic Online* May 16–23, and will appear in the Limited Leagues section of the Play Lobby.


Two PTQs This Weekend
---------------------


It's a double Pro Tour Qualifier Finals weekend on *Magic Online*. On Saturday, May 12, the format will be Standard, and the event will begin at 9 a.m. PT. Players can enter with 30 Event Tickets or 300 Play Points. Sunday, May 13, the format will be *Dominaria* Sealed Deck, and things will kick off at 7 a.m. PT. A red or blue PTQ Finals Entry Token is required to join this event. The winner of each tournament will qualify for Pro Tour "Spaghetti."
