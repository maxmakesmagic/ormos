Foils are something that catch your eye. Like Wonka's golden ticket you open a booster pack and sometimes you discover one of our premium foils inside the pack. But as you can see, if you look at a premium foil, the card is not uniformly reflective.


We've shown these underlayers a few times before, but now let's look at some of them from ***Magic** 2014 Core Set*. I've picked out a few of my favorites.


With each of the cards below, click on the card image to reveal the foil underlayer.


First up, [Chandra, Pyromaster](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chandra%2C+Pyromaster).

But not to be outdone, here is [Garruk, Caller of Beasts](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Garruk%2C+Caller+of+Beasts).
