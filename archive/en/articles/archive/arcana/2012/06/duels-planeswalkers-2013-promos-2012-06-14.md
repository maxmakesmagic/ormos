Look at these boosters.

They're what await players of **Duels of the Planeswalkers** 2013. When a player first launches the game (or goes into the Extras tab), they'll get their code. And when they enter that code on our website, they'll get a voucher to print out. Then they'll take that voucher to a participating store and get a booster. Here's a better look at them!

Players on PlayStation 3 will get this booster:

Players on XBOX 360 will get this booster:

And people playing on their PCs (via Steam) or on their iPads will get this one:

Each booster contains six **Magic** cards. Five of them are random, but the sixth is a ***Magic** 2013* mythic rare cunningly tied to the art on the booster. So, for example, that PlayStation 3 booster up there will contain this:

Neat, right? And here are the other two cards, which are for XBOX and Steam/iPad users respectively.
