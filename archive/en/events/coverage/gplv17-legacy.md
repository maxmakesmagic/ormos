Grand Prix Las Vegas 2017 Legacy
--------------------------------




* [Day 2 Coverage](#tabs-0)
* [Day 1 Coverage](#tabs-1)


Day 2 Coverage



A Day 1 full of diverse and powerful decks and heated play whittled a field of 2,656 Legacy players down to just 712. At the end of Day 1, ten players stood undefeated, their decks representing a slice of the varied Legacy metagame, including Grixis Delver, Sneak and Show, and a new Miracles deck without the recently banned Sensei's Divining Top.


Today, these 712 remaining players will battle the remaining six rounds of Swiss play, fighting for a coveted spot in the Top 8 and, ultimately, for the first trophy of Grand Prix Vegas 2017. Tune in to [twitch.tv/magic](http://twitch.tv/magic) to catch the exciting conclusion!

 




Day 1 Coverage



The historic, four-day-long *Magic*celebration in Las Vegas has written its first chapter. The Legacy Grand Prix's first day has finished, and was filled to the brim with action from all of *Magic*'s history. Though the format's standard standouts were in full display, decks like Goblins, Dragon Stompy, Atraxa Fit, and many more oddities came out of the woodwork to challenge the status quo.


Out of 2,656 players, only ten have a perfect 9-0 record. Pro Tour *Eldritch Moon* winner (18) Lukas Blohon is joined by Nathan Smith, Sammy Tharmaratnam, Patrick Tierney, Zachary Koch, Jacob Haversat, Sam Roukas, Chris Iaali, Collin Rountree, and Mathew Chung to lead the pack into the second half of the Grand Prix.


But that's not all the action happening tomorrow. In addition to the Legacy Grand Prix's conclusion, and the myriad side events and panels firing all the time, the weekend's second Grand Prix will be starting!


We've only just begun here in Las Vegas. There are three more days of action, starting tomorrow with the exciting conclusion of the Legacy Grand Prix.


Join us bright and early at [twitch.tv/magic](http://twitch.tv/magic)! See you then.
