After last year's humiliating defeat at the hands of the Community Team, the Wizards team has come prepared for vengeance. Their opponents? A bunch of podcasters, streamers, and professional actors. They don't stand a chance.

Robert Schuster
===============

**What do you do at Wizards?**


I'm a Game Designer in Magic R&D. I primarily work on Magic Online creating set specs and implementation guides for how new cards and mechanics should function. I was also a developer on the Legendary Cube that comes to MTGO in November. Oh and a designer on [REDACTED].


**What would your Magic familiar be?**


[Gilder Bairn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gilder+Bairn). It reminds me a lot of my son.


![](https://media.wizards.com/2015/events/cc15/SchusterSon.jpg)


**If you had a keyword mechanic, what would it be?**


Hug. Whenever another player has bad beats, you may offer to hug. If that player accepts, game results stay the same but you both feel a bit better. If they decline, wish them the best in the future.


**What is your Planeswalker ultimate ability?**


Exile all commanders then return your commander to the battlefield. You get an emblem with “Your commander has flying, lifelink, hexproof, flash, and haste.”


**You're playing the last game of the Community Cup, and it's all tied up. Who are you crushing, and how are you winning this game?**


Sweat beads on my opponents' brow. Kenji is behind him crying. Jimmy has defected to the Wizards team but nobody seems to care. Wedge has stopped paying attention and is uploading a youtube video of him frowning for 10 hours. Maria and Meghan are asking Joel “where did this all go so so wrong?” Stybs left to catch an early flight after stating “Family is more important!” after scoring a record low -5 points in the Ironroot Chef event. Mike Turian gasps audibly upon seeing my topdeck. Tapping 10, I cast Ulamog. Somewhere a child screams “WHO WOULD PASS THAT?!?” Doc concedes. Our heroes take home another victory.

Aaron Forsythe
==============

**What do you do at Wizards?** 


Watch wistfully as other people play Magic. Formally, I'm the Senior Director of Magic R&D. You might know me as “Mark Rosewater's boss.”


**What would your Magic familiar be?**


[Reveillark](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reveillark). It is an odd duck to be sure, but the value is unmistakable.


**If you had a keyword mechanic, what would it be?** 


Protection from Humans


**What is your Planeswalker ultimate ability?** 


-6: Put all creature cards from your graveyard onto the battlefield, then draw that many cards.


**You're playing the last game of the Community Cup, and it's all tied up. Who are you crushing, and how are you winning this game?** 


Joel Larsson. I'm decking him while at 235 life.

Sam Stoddard
============


![](https://media.wizards.com/2015/events/cc15/Sam-Stoddard-Portrait.jpg)


**What do you do at Wizards?**


I develop Magic sets.


**What would your Magic familiar be?**


[Woodland Bellower](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Woodland+Bellower) because it's a beast of a bear.


**If you had a keyword mechanic, what would it be?**


[Provoke](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Provoke). Do you really want to know why? Ask me to my face!


**What is your Planeswalker ultimate ability?**


-9: Restart the game. Until the end of this match, all cards are basic.


**You're playing the last game of the Community Cup, and it's all tied up. Who are you crushing, and how are you winning this game?**


Kenji Egashira, and I will win by tricking him into a 24-hour streaming marathon, then replacing all the caffeinated beverages in the building with caffeine-free.

Worth Wollpert
==============

**What do you do at Wizards?**


Executive Producer for Magic Online – the business guy in charge of product management, essentially


**What would your Magic familiar be?**


Probably a Goblin J [Goblin Warchief](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Warchief) & [Siege-Gang Commander](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Siege-Gang+Commander) – my favorite cards that I've made!


**If you had a keyword mechanic, what would it be?**


[Vigilance](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vigilance)


**What is your Planeswalker ultimate ability?**


-6, Exile all Trolls.


**You're playing the last game of the Community Cup, and it's all tied up. Who are you crushing, and how are you winning this game?**


Obviously Kenji, and he's probably punting more than I'm winning.

Allison Medwin
==============


![](https://media.wizards.com/2015/events/cc15/Allison-Medwin-Portrait.jpg)


**What do you do at Wizards?**


I'm an Editor in Magic R&D. I'm also on the Magic Online design team, the rules and templating teams, and a few other smaller teams.


**Which Magic card would be your familiar and why?**


Always and forever the noble [Brushwagg](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brushwagg). Nobody can tell: is [Brushwagg](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brushwagg) the tumbleweed? Is [Brushwagg](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brushwagg) the rodent? Is that thing in the picture even a rodent? I can't resist the adorable enigma.


**If you had a keyword mechanic, what would it be?**


Changeling. I *am* a [Shapeshifter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shapeshifter), after all.


**What is your Planeswalker ultimate ability?**


-7: You get an emblem with “At the beginning of your upkeep, put a token onto the battlefield that's a copy of a face-up creature card in any zone except that it's a white Ally in addition to its other colors and types.”


**You're playing the last game of the Community Cup, and it's all tied up. Who are you crushing, and how are you winning this game?**


Probably Joel, because by the time we get to the last game, the Community team will be so afraid of me that they feel they need to send out their Pro Tour Champion to defeat me.

Mike Turian
===========


![](https://media.wizards.com/2015/events/cc15/Mike-Turian-Portrait.jpg)


**What do you do at Wizards?** 


I'm a Digital Product Manager for Magic Online. I work with the Magic Online team to try and make Magic Online awesome!


**Which Magic card is your spirit animal and why?** 


My familiar would be [Thornscape Familiar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thornscape+Familiar). I would love to be able to make Red and White spells cost 1 less while also being able to attack for 2!


**If you had a keyword mechanic, what would it be?** 


I would give myself Buyback and Convoke. I have heard that is a powerful combination of abilities.


**What is your Planeswalker ultimate ability?** 


-4 For the rest of the game, Cowards cannot block Warriors.


**You're playing the last game of the Community Cup, and it's all tied up. Who are you crushing, and how are you winning this game?** 


I would hope to beat Kenji with a perfect victory, 20 life to 0, having annihilated all of his permanents and made him discard his entire hand.

Ryan Spain
==========


![](https://media.wizards.com/2015/events/cc15/Ryan-Spain-Portrait.jpg)


**What do you do at Wizards?**


I'm the Magic Online Design Manager. My team designs the implementation of new card sets and new features for Magic Online.


**Which Magic card is your spirit animal and why?**


[Kird Ape](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kird+Ape). It was the first creature I cast in a game of Magic, back when Marshall Sutcliffe taught me to play in 1994 with both of us drawing from his “All the Green and Red Cards I Own” deck. (I'm sure Luis Scott-Vargas will be delighted to learn that Marshall's first Magic deck had a prominent ape component.)


**If you had a keyword mechanic, what would it be?**


We actually designed Magic cards for R&D folks recently. Aaron Forsythe designed this Ryan Spain card:


Ryan Spain, MTGO Stalwart


3BGW


Legendary Creature—Human Ally


8/4


[Vigilance](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vigilance)


Whenever an Insect enters the battlefield, destroy it.


Whenever Ryan Spain, MTGO Stalwart or another Ally enters the battlefield under your control, open a sealed Magic booster pack, reveal the cards, and put one of those cards into your hand. *([Remove](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Remove) that card from your deck before beginning a new game.)*


**What is your Planeswalker ultimate ability?**


“Restart the draft. You may pick an additional card during your first pick in each pack.”


**You're playing the last game of the Community Cup, and it's all tied up. Who are you crushing, and how are you winning this game?**


I'm absolutely destroying Kenji in a friends-of-Limited-Resources battle by the three-step plan of ingest, process, and repeat. Go Crushers!

**What do you do at Wizards?**


I'm on the Magic R&D Development Team. One of the main things I do is play FFL (Future Future League, our internal playtesting league). We build decks and try to figure out what the Standard metagame will be like a year and a half from now. We try to make Standard fun and give players lots of options for play.


**Which Magic card is your spirit animal and why?**


[Bear Cub](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bear+Cub) from Portal. He's such a cutie! Portal has some of my favorite art.


**If you had a keyword mechanic, what would it be?**


[Booster Tutor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Booster+Tutor)- A triggered ability that allows you to search for a booster pack from outside the game, open it, select a card from it, and add it to your hand.


**What is your Planeswalker ultimate ability?**


Put 3 1/1 spirit creature tokens with flying onto the battlefield. They have “When this creature enters the battlefield, booster tutor.


I make 1/1 spirits because BW Tokens is one of my favorite decks to play in Modern. I make three of them because that's how many packs you need to draft!
