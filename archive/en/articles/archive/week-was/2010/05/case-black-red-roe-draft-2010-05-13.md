I know that it is Level Up Week here on the mothership, but I am going to be presenting an opposing viewpoint this week—at least from the perspective of the draft table. Since the *Rise of the Eldrazi* Prerelease I have done a lot of drafting and piled up stacks of [Knight of Cliffhaven](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Knight+of+Cliffhaven), [Venerated Teacher](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Venerated+Teacher), and [Enclave Cryptologist](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Enclave+Cryptologist). I have already mentioned in a previous column how much I like the white-blue leveler deck, but in light of a couple of big events—and the increased popularity of the archetype—I may have to look at a different wedge of the color pie for my draft desserts. Over this past weekend Germany's Florian Koch won Grand Prix Lyon and Brazil's Carlos Romao won the fourth seat at the **Magic Online** Championship Series in Chiba. Both players had to draft to win the final three rounds of their *Rise of the Eldrazi* Limited events and both players looked to black-red removal strategies and the rebound mechanic to get them there. I was able to talk with both players about their events, their approach to Limited, and the future.

In fact, the 29-year old from Aachen, Germany got to watch hometown hero Simon Görtzen win [Pro Tour–San Diego](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/eventcoverage/ptsd10/welcome) up close as he came to play in [Grand Prix–Oakland](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/eventcoverage/gpoak10/welcome) and then cover the Pro Tour for the German site the following weekend. While in Oakland, Florian, who has been playing **Magic** for just about as long as you possibly can without being a member of Richard Garfield's inner circle, picked up the first Pro Points of his career with a Top 64 finish. Now, after his win in Lyon, when Pro Tour–Amsterdam rolls around he will be attending as a competitor. Not that he wasn't already attending the event. 

"I have been around the Pro Tour forever, but I was never in it," said the [Grand Prix–Lyon](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/eventcoverage/gplyon10/welcome) Champion. "I went to all the World Championships that were held in Europe and also to PT Berlin. At all these events I was never qualified, instead I came to attend the public events and meet friends." 

It has been over 16 years since the first time Koch laid eyes on people playing a mysterious new card game. 

"A couple of guys were playing **Magic** at the birthday party of a friend back in 1994," he recalled. "It looked very interesting and I asked if I could play a game. I was a bit surprised that they would let me. The game looked so fascinating that I had expected they would rather keep on playing themselves. Hooked from the first second on ... " 

It was not long before he was heading to local Pro Tour Qualifiers for a chance to play more **Magic**—and not long after that he began traveling to every PTQ within reach. In 1998, he took part in his first ever Grand Prix in Antwerp during the 1998 season. Twelve years later he had his first Top 64, then his first ever win and invite to play on the Pro Tour. So what was different about this event than his previous experiences?
