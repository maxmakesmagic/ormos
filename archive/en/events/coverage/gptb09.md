GRAND PRIX TAMPA 2009
---------------------


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/gptam09/victory_blurb.jpg)Backed by the power of [Malakir Bloodwitch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Malakir+Bloodwitch), unrelenting [Crypt Ripper](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crypt+Ripper)s, and a little lift from a [Soaring Seacliff](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soaring+Seacliff)s, Gaudenis Vidugiris took down Conley Woods in a two game match for the title of Grand Prix Tampa Champion. It was the third time that Gaudenis has made the Top 8 of a GP this season but it was the first time -- both geographically and by virtue of winning -- that he could declare, “I am definitely going to Disneyland!” Gaudenis locked up Level 7 for next season with his win and showed that he is a competitor to be reckoned with at Worlds and all next season with a win in a stacked Top 8 that included Gabriel Nassif, Martin Juza, and PT Honolulu Top 8 competitors Tom Ross and Conley Woods.


Almost bigger news than who was in the Top 8 was who was not. After rattling off a string of Top 8 finishes over six events that included Japanese Nationals, four GPs, and last weekend’s PT Austin, Yuuya Watanabe went 0-3 in his first draft of Day Two, ending an impressive streak that no one can recall the likes of in recent memory. With the Top 8 finishes of Juza and Nassif the race for the Player of the Year tightened and should be just as heated next weekend for Grand Prix Kitakyushu and in the remaining weeks counting down to the World Championships in Rome!
