Quarterfinals 1: Chye Yian Hsiang (White Red) vs. Cheung Lap Chung (White Red)
==============================================================================


Chye Yian Hsiang from Malaysia is playing in his very first Top 8 despite having come in at 9-0 in Day 1 many times. He has drafted an aggressive White Red deck, complete with triple [Topan Freeblade](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Topan+Freeblade), double [Grasp of the Hieromancer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grasp+of+the+Hieromancer), double [Enshrouding Mist](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Enshrouding+Mist) and [Iroas's Champion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Iroas%27s+Champion).


His opponent Cheung Lap Chung is also a first-timer and will be playing a mirror match.

### Game One


Chye's triple [Topan Freeblade](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Topan+Freeblade) reared their ugly heads and quickly put Cheung under immense pressure. When Cheung presented [Yoked Ox](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Yoked+Ox) to block, [Grasp of the Hieromancer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grasp+of+the+Hieromancer) paralyzed it. [Suppression Bonds](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Suppression+Bonds) on the enchanted [Topan Freeblade](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Topan+Freeblade) put a stop to that and Cheung was able to counterattack with [Volcanic Rambler](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Volcanic+Rambler).


However, Cheung was at a precarious three life and all Chye had to do was to wait for his 5th land to unleash [Chandra's Fury](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chandra%27s+Fury) for the win.

### Game Two


Cheung's start was pretty nice, curving out with [Mage-Ring Bully](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mage-Ring+Bully), [Cleric of the Forward Order](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cleric+of+the+Forward+Order), and [Iroas's Champion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Iroas%27s+Champion). Chye's board was equally impressive, comprising [Topan Freeblade](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Topan+Freeblade) enchanted with [Grasp of the Hieromancer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grasp+of+the+Hieromancer), [Ghirapur Gearcrafter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ghirapur+Gearcrafter), and [Pia and Kiran Nalaar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pia+and+Kiran+Nalaar).


[Enshrouding Mist](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Enshrouding+Mist) on a blocker took care of the double striking Soldier and Chye seemed to be ahead in the race. Cheung noticed that, and was forced to expend [Swift Reckoning](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swift+Reckoning) and [Fiery Impulse](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fiery+Impulse) on the remaining Thopters.


Thankfully, Chye was able to rearm with [Knight of the Pilgrim's Road](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Knight+of+the+Pilgrim%27s+Road), [Auramancer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Auramancer), and [Anointer of Champions](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Anointer+of+Champions) to clinch the match without even utilizing the [Chandra's Fury](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chandra%27s+Fury) sitting in his hand.

Quarterfinals 2: Liu Yuchen (Black Green) vs. Wu Songwei (Black Red)
====================================================================


Liu Yuchen from China is the most experienced player remaining, having made the Top 8 two previous times. He has a speedy Black Green deck that kickstarts with a quad of [Shambling Ghoul](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shambling+Ghoul)s. Liu will support his beatdown strategy with three [Titanic Growth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Titanic+Growth), two [Wild Instincts](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Instincts) and a pair of [Reave Soul](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reave+Soul)s.


Liu will have to defeat fellow countryman Wu Songwei if he wanted to advance. Wu's deck is highlighted by [Scab-Clan Berserker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scab-Clan+Berserker), [Cruel Revival](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cruel+Revival), and [Exquisite Firecraft](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Exquisite+Firecraft) and also has the nifty combo of a pair of [Returned Centaur](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Returned+Centaur)s to complement [Shadows of the Past](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shadows+of+the+Past).


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Nissa%27s+Revelation)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nissa%27s+Revelation)
### Game 1


The first game was rather one-sided, largely because Wu's deck was a little less streamlined and much clunkier than Liu's. To make matters worse, Wu kept a two Swamp hand on the play and failed to find a third land or his second color.


Oh well! Liu's up one game just like that!


### Game 2


[Eyeblight Assassin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eyeblight+Assassin) from Wu was the perfect foil to Liu's [Deadbridge Shaman](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deadbridge+Shaman). Liu chumped with [Elvish Visionary](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elvish+Visionary), before returning both creatures from the yard via [Macabre Waltz](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Macabre+Waltz).


Unfazed, Wu continued to attack with [Akroan Sergeant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Akroan+Sergeant) and [Eyeblight Assassin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eyeblight+Assassin) before adding [Returned Centaur](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Returned+Centaur) to the board. [Rhox Maulers](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rhox+Maulers) from Liu kept the entire team back.


Using a pair of [Wild Instincts](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Instincts) to clear the way, Liu was able to secure victory with the help of [Pharika's Disciple](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pharika%27s+Disciple), [Deadbridge Shaman](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deadbridge+Shaman) as well as a trio of other bears.


**Liu Yuchen 2 – Wu Songwei 0**

Quarterfinals 3: Lim Victoriano (Blue Green) vs. Yam Wing Chun (Blue Red)
=========================================================================


Lim Victoriano and Yam Wing Chun are two of the three undefeated players in Day 1. [Jace, Vryn's Prodigy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace%2C+Vryn%27s+Prodigy), [Outland Colossus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Outland+Colossus), [Woodland Bellower](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Woodland+Bellower), and [Mizzium Meddler](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mizzium+Meddler) lend strength to Lim's deck.


Gold Pro Yam Wing Chun will need to quickly end games before these bombs overwhelm him. Thankfully Yam's deck was focused, featuring [Thopter Spy Network](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thopter+Spy+Network), [Molten Vortex](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Molten+Vortex), and a trio of each [Faerie Miscreant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Faerie+Miscreant)s and [Aspiring Aeronaut](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aspiring+Aeronaut)s to soar through the skies.


### Game One


[Outland Colossus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Outland+Colossus) made an appearance quickly but Yam was ready with a horde of chump blockers, thanks to [Aspiring Aeronaut](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aspiring+Aeronaut)s and friends. When Yam added [Skaab Goliath](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skaab+Goliath) to the board and attacked with it, Lim did a triple block and both 6-powered monsters hit the bin.


However, Yam ran out of gas and his tiny 1/1 fliers were unable to race Lim's green fatties.


### Game Two


Lim led with [Jace, Vryn's Prodigy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace%2C+Vryn%27s+Prodigy) while offering [Hitchclaw Recluse](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hitchclaw+Recluse) and [Tower Geist](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tower+Geist) to deter Yam's horde of fliers, which included five Thopters thanks to [Thopter Engineer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thopter+Engineer), double [Aspiring Aeronaut](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aspiring+Aeronaut)s, and [Foundry of the Consul](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Foundry+of+the+Consul).


Lim turned up the heat with [Outland Colossus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Outland+Colossus) and Yam quickly found himself in the unfortunate situation where he was unable to attack yet forced to chump-block. To make matters worse, Lim tutored up a second copy of the irritating Spider with the help of [Woodland Bellower](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Woodland+Bellower).


Yam did have [Claustrophobia](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Claustrophobia) to tap down [Outland Colossus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Outland+Colossus) and tried to use [Molten Vortex](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Molten+Vortex) to finish off [Woodland Bellower](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Woodland+Bellower). A timely [Mizzium Meddler](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mizzium+Meddler) foiled the last activation and Yam's bag of tricks was depleted. Despite also having [Thopter Spy Network](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thopter+Spy+Network), he had no way to stop [Jace, Vryn's Prodigy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace%2C+Vryn%27s+Prodigy) from reaching its ultimate ability.

**Lim Victoriano 2 - Yam Wing Chun 0**

**Quarterfinals 4: Ang Jan (Red Green) vs. Kwok Suen Wang (White Green)**


Ang Jan is a former Philippines National Champion and was equipped with a Red Green beatdown deck featuring double [Acolyte of the Inferno](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Acolyte+of+the+Inferno), double [Boggart Brute](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Boggart+Brute) as well as mean monsters such as [Embermaw Hellion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Embermaw+Hellion) and [Zendikar Incarnate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Zendikar+Incarnate).


Kwok Suen Wang will need to find a way to survive the early onslaught if he wanted to take over the game with [Nissa's Revelation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nissa%27s+Revelation), [Zendikar's Roil](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Zendikar%27s+Roil), and [Gideon's Phalanx](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gideon%27s+Phalanx). His White Green midrange deck is a unique take on the format and he has found ways to accelerate into his late game cards with [Leaf Gilder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leaf+Gilder), [Meteorite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Meteorite) and [Nissa's Pilgrimage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nissa%27s+Pilgrimage). Is it possible that this strategy was workable?


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Nissa%27s+Revelation)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nissa%27s+Revelation)[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Gideon%27s+Phalanx)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gideon%27s+Phalanx)
[Embermaw Hellion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Embermaw+Hellion) clinched Game 1 for Ang but Kwok quickly equalized the score by punishing Ang's mana troubles in Game 2.


In the rubber game, [Leaf Gilder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leaf+Gilder), [Acolyte of the Inferno](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Acolyte+of+the+Inferno), and [Zendikar Incarnate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Zendikar+Incarnate) quickly put Kwok under fire. [Meteorite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Meteorite) was Kwok's solution to the renowned [Acolyte of the Inferno](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Acolyte+of+the+Inferno) but sadly found no way to suppress the ballooning [Zendikar Incarnate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Zendikar+Incarnate) and a freshly summoned [Orchard Spirit](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Orchard+Spirit).
