 Brian David-Marshall is a New York–based game designer who has been involved with Magic since 1994, when he started organizing tournaments and ran a Manhattan game store. Since then, he has been a judge, a player, and one of the longest-tenured columnists on DailyMTG.com, as he enters his second decade writing for the site. He is also the Pro Tour Historian and one of the commentators for the Pro Tour. 






Brace yourselves. Necropotence was the best deck choice in a wacky field. Neil Reeves was 3-0 with only a single game loss in this format. Interestingly, it was one of the first times that Necro has seen play with Cabal Coffers in a tournament environment. Even with players restricted to two copies of Necropotence and only Cabal Ritual to accelerate it out the deck continued to win. In addition to all of the other formats the Ice Age enchantment—once dubbed the “Worst Card in Ice Age” by Inquest Magazine—carved another notch in its belt as it ran roughshod through this oddball format.
