The end of Saturday is always a stressful time for players trying to sneak into Day 2, and Grand Prix Portland upped the stakes for the pros playing with each other. With Portland being the first event of the new Premier Play season, any Pro Points earned are magnified as they try to build an strong start early in the marathon race to reach the Silver, Gold or Platinum thresholds.


The first step was being able to play again on Sunday, and that left several notable teams needing a victory in the final round. 


Here's how some of those matches shook out.



**No. 11 Yuuya Watanabe/Kenji Tsumura/Tomoharu Saito vs. Justin Aubertin/Bryan Eleyet/Jeremy Lochridge**




 As Watanabe began his third game with a [Sungrace Pegasus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sungrace+Pegasus) into [Ajani's Pridemate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ajani%27s+Pridemate), things looked up for the world's 11th-ranked player. But a [Razorfoot Griffin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Razorfoot+Griffin) that was soon [Marked by Honor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Marked+by+Honor) with the Pridemate sitting at a critical four power instead of five. That meant the Griffin could play both offense and defense with impunity, and a land-light Watanabe couldn't dig out of the hole.



A Saito win meant that three tight matches would all come down to the final game between hall of famer Kenji Tsumura taking on Jeremy Lochridge. In the end Tsumura's green fatties were just fat enough to break through to give him the win and his team a ticket into Day 2.





*The powerhouse team from Japan squeaked out a close victory to advance to Day 2.*
