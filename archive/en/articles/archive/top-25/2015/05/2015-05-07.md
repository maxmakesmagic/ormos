Two Grand Prix last weekend, both featuring the Standard format, did their best to shake up the *Magic* Top 25 Pro Rankings. In Brazil, two of the game's biggest names from that country—Willy Edel and Paulo Vitor Damo da Rosa—were both in action. Edel's sixteenth place was highly creditable, and he stays in the charts at No. 22. Da Rosa, however, went the distance playing Esper Dragons; first making the Top 8, and then claiming the second Grand Prix title of his career.



Over in Toronto, there were plenty of stars on show. To the surprise of nobody who has been paying attention lately, Brad Nelson became the week's highest climber, up five from No. 17 to No. 12, on the back of yet another Grand Prix Top 8 finish. Toronto 2015, Memphis 2015, Los Angeles 2014, Cincinnati 2014, Louisville 2013, Miami 2013, Atlantic City 2013, Minneapolis 2012—these are Nelson's Grand Prix Top 8 appearances in the 'second half' of his *Magic* career, following his phenomenal run to Player of the Year in 2011. Widely acknowledged as one of the finest Standard players on the planet, Nelson's run in Toronto lasted until the semifinals, but whenever and wherever he shows up, he has as good a chance as anyone of claiming the title. He's a total machine.



Elsewhere in Toronto, Craig Wescoe joined Nelson in the Top 8, advancing him two places to No. 17. Paul Rietzl finished thirteenth, taking him up two to No. 11, with the top 10 now firmly in his sights. Ben Stark (No. 25) finished seventeenth, with GP Krakow champion Alexander Hayne (tied exactly on ranking with Stark) having to make do with 33rd in Toronto. Seth Manfield stays at No. 7 after cashing in 41st place, and there were also cash finishes for No. 5 Ari Lax and No. 10 Shahar Shenhar. Meanwhile, Steve Rubin, who has quietly been amassing a strong reputation this season, is our other new entry this week. He joins the rankings at No. 23, following another strong 12-3 finish.



Next up, the Standard story continues in Paris, while Atlantic City plays host in North America, with Limited the format. Join us again next to see who will lead the way in the *Magic* Top 25 Pro Rankings.
