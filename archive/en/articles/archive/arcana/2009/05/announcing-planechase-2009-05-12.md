### Multiplayer Mayhem

The *Planechase* plane cards introduce a groundbreaking new way to experience planeswalking. Through this innovative new kind of card, two or more players can battle each other across a variety of diverse worlds, each with its own unique effect on the game. These thrilling new conditions add a whole new layer of chaos, meaning the only thing you can count on is unpredictability.

* There will be four *Planechase* Game Packs released on September 4th, 2009: **Elemental Thunder**, **Metallic Dreams**, **Strike Force**, and **Zombie Empire**.
* Each game pack will contain 10 all-new plane cards, a ready-to-play 60-card deck, a six-sided planar die and a *Planechase* strategy insert with multiplayer rules.
* Each of the 60-card decks will include 8 rares, and will be composed of cards from throughout **Magic**'s history - including a preview card from *Zendikar*.
* The 10 oversized plane cards comprise a planar deck. They feature all-new artwork depicting some of the more exotic realms of the **Magic** multiverse.
* Each of the cards in the 60-card decks will be black-bordered and tournament legal. This means that these cards are legal for use in any tournaments where the original printings are still legal.
* *Planechase* release events will be held September 4-6, 2009. Watch **magicthegathering.com** this summer for details.
