This week's "Sketches" looks at the *Onslaught* enchantment, [Aurification](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aurification) by Gary Ruddell. 

### 1. Art Description

These are the instructions given to the artist:

"Color: White  
 Location: Daru Plains  
 Action: A beast changing into a statue of gold. Perhaps, we see other creatures that have been turned into gold in the background."

The card's playtest name was "Petrification," because the original concept was that the enchantment turned creatures into stone, but it was changed because changing things into gold was cooler.

### 2. Sketch

This is the preliminary sketch of "Petrification" submitted by Ruddell. 

### 3. Final Art

Here is a large version of the final piece.

### 4. Card

Finally, here is the card as you'll see it in booster packs.
