**Official Rules**


The **HASBRO** ***Zendikar Rising*** **challenge** (the "Challenge") begins on 25th September 2020 and ends on 2nd October 2020 (Midnight) ("Entry Period"). The sponsor of the Challenge is Hasbro UK Limited (the "Sponsor" or "Hasbro"). Sponsor's servers and clocks shall serve as the official clock for the Challenge and Entrant's proof of submission does not constitute proof of receipt by Sponsor. This Challenge is not sponsored, endorsed or administered by, or associated with Instagram or Facebook. By entering the Challenge, you ("Entrant" or "you") accept and agree to follow these Official Rules.


1. **Who is Eligible**: The Challenge is open only to legal residents of the United Kingdom and Republic of Ireland who are age 18 years or older at the time of entry and who enters the Challenge through the method of entry described in Section 2 below.

Facebook accounts can be obtained by visiting facebook.com and following the onscreen instructions. You will be subject to the applicable platform terms and conditions and privacy policy.
	2. In order for Entrant's entry to be valid, your Twitter or Facebook profile must be "public" and thus viewable by the Sponsor. If the Entrant's account is not set to "public", the Sponsor may not view the entry and the entry may not be eligible.
	3. The Entrant have to message a social media account (Twitter: @zendikarbot\_en, Facebook: <https://www.facebook.com/MagicTheGathering>) and choosing three of the following key words: indoor; outdoor; suburb; rural; city, which in turn automatically responds with a "challenge". Said challenges will be revolving around taking a picture in certain situations, example: "Elementals on Zendikar are known to take the shape of animated plants, treants or shrubs. Share a picture of a plant or flora you could see as an animated elemental."
	4. In addition, to be eligible your entry post must include all of the following:
		1. #Outdoor;
		2. #Suburb; and
		3. #Rural.

Entrant will be contacted on or around 9th October 2020 via **direct message using Entrant's handle used for the** entry notifying them that she/he is the potential winner and providing additional instructions.
