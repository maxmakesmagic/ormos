MTG Arena Announcements, March 30, 2022

20-Pack *Alchemy: Kamigawa* Bundle Coming This Week!
====================================================


Look for a single-purchase 20-pack *Alchemy: Kamigawa* bundle arriving in the Store tomorrow, Thursday, March 31. For 15,000 gold or 3,000 gems, this bundle will give you a boost as you add *Alchemy: Kamigawa* cards to your collection.


[Check out the new *Alchemy: Kamigawa* cards](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/card-image-gallery/alchemy-kamigawa) to see what you can get!


Note: If you haven't picked up the previous one-time purchase 20-pack *Alchemy: Innistrad* bundle, you'll want to do that before March 31—the *Alchemy: Kamigawa* 20-pack bundle will be replacing it!


Mythic Booster Packs Arrive This Week
=====================================


Also coming this week are the Mythic Booster packs discussed in the [*MTG Arena* economy article](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/magic-digital/mtg-arena-economy-2022-03-17) and during the [Weekly MTG broadcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8ZM0HIlJUg). These packs will be available in the Store this Thursday, March 31:


* 1 Mythic Booster pack for 1,300 gold
* 10 Mythic Booster packs for 2,600 gems

Mythic Booster packs ensure that the card in the rare or mythic rare slot is always a mythic rare (unless it is replaced by a wildcard). These should help collectors who have completed their collection of rares for a set but are still missing mythic rare cards.


Upcoming Alchemy Balance Changes
================================


As part of the April 7 game update, we are planning to rebalance a number of cards in Alchemy. Since this is very close to a Qualifier Weekend, we wanted to give players as much notice as possible. Check out [the latest rebalancing changes coming on Thursday, April 7](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/magic-digital/alchemy-rebalancing-april-7-2022).


Arena Open Returns April 16–17
==============================


The next Arena Open kicks off on Saturday, April 16. This two-day event will feature competition in the Historic format, and all participants will receive the Neon Samurai card sleeve:

*Tinkerer's Cube* April 15–28
=============================


The *Tinkerer's Cube*is back beginning Friday, April 15, and continuing through April 28. Draft three 14-card packs for Best-of-One and Best-of-Three matches with a chance to win gold and Historic individual card rewards! This is a Phantom event, so drafted cards are not added to your collection.
