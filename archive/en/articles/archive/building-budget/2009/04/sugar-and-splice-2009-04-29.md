I've got a really exciting and Johnny-riffic Pauper deck to share with you this week. Before I get to that, though, I want to start by apologizing for [last week's article](/en/articles/archive/building-budget/grindin-2009-04-22). I had good intentions. I thought the deck was a budget alternative in Standard. One comment really rang through in the forums for me. A reader brought it to my attention that the deck is significantly weaker than a nearly identical list that runs [Cryptic Command](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cryptic+Command). I didn't know the addition of [Cryptic Command](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cryptic+Command) would change the deck so dramatically. I played a few games with the deck after adding [Cryptic Command](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cryptic+Command) and the deck was astronomically better.

My biggest goal when I took over this column was to create fun, original, and powerful decks without spending too much. You (the reader) deserve much better than a budget version of a popular pet deck. It's one thing to replace [Cryptic Command](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cryptic+Command)s with other [Counterspell](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterspell)s in a control deck that plans to use it as a [Counterspell](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterspell) 90% of the time. In the Grinding deck, the Command is an extremely important survival tool against the midrange decks. I don't want this column to provide bad deck lists of known decks.

This week I'd like to talk to you about my new favorite deck.

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/boab/boab36_puppetrySplash.jpg)  
Earlier this week I received an email from a reader that contained a Pauper deck list. The deck has a number of Arcane spells with [Psychic Puppetry](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psychic+Puppetry). The deck plays *Ravnica* bounce lands in conjunction with [Fertile Ground](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fertile+Ground) and [Dawn's Reflection](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dawn%27s+Reflection). The plan is to enchant a land with multiple enchantments and begin cycling through your deck with card draw spells. While you sift through your deck you splice [Psychic Puppetry](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psychic+Puppetry) onto your Arcane spells and generate enough mana to play an absurd amount of card draw. Once you draw a [Grapeshot](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grapeshot) you cast spells until your storm count gets to 20 and then you fire a 20-point [Grapeshot](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grapeshot) at your opponent. You can even use your [Psychic Puppetry](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psychic+Puppetry) to tap down your opponent and prevent shenanigans like [Prismatic Strands](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Prismatic+Strands).

![Psychic Puppetry](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Psychic+Puppetry)  
I'll start by explaining my card choices.

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/boab/boab36_cross1.jpg)  
**[Fertile Ground](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fertile+Ground) and [Dawn's Reflection](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dawn%27s+Reflection):** I want to enchant one land with as many of these as I can. Once I start "going off" I will be tapping the land for a lot of mana and untapping it repeatedly with a spliced [Psychic Puppetry](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psychic+Puppetry).

**[Psychic Puppetry](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psychic+Puppetry):** This allows me to generate enough mana to play all my spells.

**[Reach Through Mists](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reach+Through+Mists), [Peer Through Depths](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Peer+Through+Depths), and [Ideas Unbound](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ideas+Unbound):** The Arcane draw engine is very important. All of these cards get me through my deck, increase my storm count, and net me mana. [Peer Through Depths](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Peer+Through+Depths) and [Ideas Unbound](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ideas+Unbound) are especially strong because they get me deeper into my deck.

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/boab/boab36_cross2.jpg)  
**[Deep Analysis](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deep+Analysis):** Additional card draw is important. [Deep Analysis](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deep+Analysis) is one of the best card-draw spells available in the format. It's especially strong because it can be discarded on the draw when you play a turn two Karoo.

**[Ponder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ponder) and [Brainstorm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brainstorm):** The cantrips are pretty necessary if you want to go off consistently. I'm not sure if [Brainstorm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brainstorm) is better than [Compulsive Research](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Compulsive+Research). I decided on [Brainstorm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brainstorm) because of its flexibility, but in time I may discover that [Compulsive Research](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Compulsive+Research) is a better card for the slot. 

**[Moment's Peace](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Moment%27s+Peace):** Who likes surviving long enough to actually win? I do! I do!

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/boab/boab36_cross3.jpg)  
**[Grapeshot](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grapeshot):** The deck plays enough spells on its key turn to sling [Grapeshot](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grapeshot)s for 30 plus damage on a somewhat regular basis.

**[Simic Growth Chamber](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Simic+Growth+Chamber):** Karoo lands are always great, but they're especially strong in this deck. It's like a land that comes with a free [Fertile Ground](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fertile+Ground).

**[Terramorphic Expanse](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Terramorphic+Expanse):** Probably the best fixer in the format. Expanse is incredibly strong with [Brainstorm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brainstorm) because it can shuffle away two unnecessary cards.

The deck is pretty elegant on paper.

For testing purposes I'm going to make a quick sideboard:

2 [Echoing Truth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Echoing+Truth)  
 1 [Flaring Pain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flaring+Pain)  
 4 [Gigadrowse](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gigadrowse)  
 1 [Moment's Peace](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Moment%27s+Peace)  
 4 [Muddle the Mixture](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Muddle+the+Mixture)  
 1 [Eye of Nowhere](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eye+of+Nowhere)  
 2 [Counterspell](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterspell)

This sideboard is a bit rough, but it solves most of our problems.

The deck looks like it would be very strong against aggressive decks like Green-White Slivers and White Weenie. It looks like it would struggle with the more dedicated [Grapeshot](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grapeshot) decks when they drew well. This deck is capable of turn-four kills, the selling point of this kind of strategy over normal storm is its resistance to hate and its consistency. The deck will rarely fizzle if you wait until the right moment.

I played in some Pauper tournaments on **Magic Online** to test the deck out.

### Round 1 vs. White Weenie

**Game 1**

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/boab/boab36_whiteShield.jpg)I lose the roll and keep [Deep Analysis](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deep+Analysis), [Island](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island), [Simic Growth Chamber](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Simic+Growth+Chamber), [Reach Through Mists](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reach+Through+Mists), [Ideas Unbound](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ideas+Unbound), [Ponder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ponder), and [Ponder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ponder) on the draw. My opponent plays a [Secluded Steppe](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Secluded+Steppe) and passes. I draw a [Forest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest), play my [Island](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island), and [Ponder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ponder). I see three lands and choose to shuffle my library. I draw [Dawn's Reflection](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dawn%27s+Reflection). My opponent plays a pump Knight and passes. I draw another [Deep Analysis](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deep+Analysis), play my [Simic Growth Chamber](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Simic+Growth+Chamber) and pass, discarding a [Deep Analysis](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deep+Analysis). My opponent attacks for 2 and plays another two-drop. I draw a [Fertile Ground](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fertile+Ground), play my [Island](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island), and enchant my [Simic Growth Chamber](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Simic+Growth+Chamber) with [Fertile Ground](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fertile+Ground). My opponent attacks me and plays yet another two-drop. I draw a [Terramorphic Expanse](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Terramorphic+Expanse), play it, enchant my [Simic Growth Chamber](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Simic+Growth+Chamber) with [Dawn's Reflection](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dawn%27s+Reflection), and pass. My opponent attacks with his team, plays a third land, and passes with three mana open. I draw a [Psychic Puppetry](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psychic+Puppetry).

I can easily go off here, but I'd be asking to have [Prismatic Strands](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Prismatic+Strands) blow me out. Instead I play a land and cast a [Deep Analysis](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deep+Analysis), find a [Moment's Peace](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Moment%27s+Peace), and pass the turn. I [Moment's Peace](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Moment%27s+Peace) during my opponent's combat step, and he passes back. I draw a [Peer Through Depths](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Peer+Through+Depths) and pass. I cast [Moment's Peace](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Moment%27s+Peace) during his combat step again and use my [Peer Through Depths](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Peer+Through+Depths) to splice the [Psychic Puppetry](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psychic+Puppetry) and tap one of his lands. I use it again and tap another land and prevent him from having three mana open on my turn. On my turn I draw another [Fertile Ground](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fertile+Ground). I play it on my [Simic Growth Chamber](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Simic+Growth+Chamber), cast [Ideas Unbound](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ideas+Unbound) and splice my Puppetry to untap the Growth Chamber. I start generating huge amounts of mana by untapping the land and tapping it for mana again. I draw through the majority of my library with my card draw spells and I find a pair of [Grapeshot](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grapeshot)s to safely finish the game.

**Sideboarding:** I take out one [Reach Through Mists](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reach+Through+Mists) and one [Dawn's Reflection](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dawn%27s+Reflection) to bring in one [Flaring Pain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flaring+Pain) and one [Echoing Truth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Echoing+Truth). When I was testing the deck earlier I was caught with my pants down against a White Weenie deck that had [Benevolent Unicorn](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Benevolent+Unicorn). I want the one [Echoing Truth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Echoing+Truth). The [Flaring Pain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flaring+Pain) is obviously and answer to [Prismatic Strands](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Prismatic+Strands).

**Game 2**

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/boab/boab36_prisStrands.jpg)I keep [Island](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island), [Terramorphic Expanse](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Terramorphic+Expanse), [Fertile Ground](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fertile+Ground), [Dawn's Reflection](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dawn%27s+Reflection), [Ideas Unbound](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ideas+Unbound), [Ponder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ponder), and [Reach Through Mists](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reach+Through+Mists). My opponent plays a land and a [Soltari Foot Soldier](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soltari+Foot+Soldier). I draw an [Island](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island), play my Expanse and pass. My opponent plays a two drop and attacks. I get a forest, draw a [Moment's Peace](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Moment%27s+Peace) for my turn, play my [Fertile Ground](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fertile+Ground) on my [Island](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island) and pass. My opponent attacks and plays another creature before passing. On my turn I draw a [Psychic Puppetry](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psychic+Puppetry) and tap out again for my [Dawn's Reflection](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dawn%27s+Reflection) on the [Island](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island). My opponent attacks and passes with three lands open. I draw a [Reach Through Mists](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reach+Through+Mists) and start going through my library, my opponent plays a [Prismatic Strands](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Prismatic+Strands) naming red. I continue to sift through my library and add mana to my mana pool. Eventually I draw [Flaring Pain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flaring+Pain) and a [Grapeshot](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grapeshot). I play the [Flaring Pain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flaring+Pain) and [Grapeshot](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grapeshot) my opponent for a huge amount of damage.

**Match Overview:** This seems to be the easiest match now that I've worked out the kinks. Even if my opponent had a Benevolent Unicorn in play I could have just continued to draw cards until I found my [Echoing Truth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Echoing+Truth). There's little a white weenie opponent can do against this deck, especially post sideboard.

1-0

### Round 2: Green-White Slivers

**Game 1**

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/boab/boab36_virSliver.jpg)I win the roll and keep [Terramorphic Expanse](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Terramorphic+Expanse), [Simic Growth Chamber](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Simic+Growth+Chamber), [Brainstorm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brainstorm), [Fertile Ground](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fertile+Ground), [Peer Through Depths](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Peer+Through+Depths), [Peer Through Depths](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Peer+Through+Depths), and [Moment's Peace](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Moment%27s+Peace). I play my Expanse and pass. My opponent plays a [Virulent Sliver](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Virulent+Sliver) and passes. I pop my Expanse and grab an island. I draw a [Reach Through Mists](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reach+Through+Mists), play my [Simic Growth Chamber](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Simic+Growth+Chamber) and pass. My opponent plays a [Muscle Sliver](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Muscle+Sliver) and attacks for two. I draw another island, play a land, play fertile ground on my [Simic Growth Chamber](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Simic+Growth+Chamber), and pass the turn. My opponent plays a [Sinew Sliver](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sinew+Sliver) and attacks me for six. I draw another [Moment's Peace](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Moment%27s+Peace), play a land, and pass. My opponent plays another [Sinew Sliver](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sinew+Sliver) and attacks, I play [Moment's Peace](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Moment%27s+Peace) off my [Simic Growth Chamber](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Simic+Growth+Chamber) and use the extra mana to [Brainstorm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brainstorm). I find a [Psychic Puppetry](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psychic+Puppetry) and two [Simic Growth Chamber](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Simic+Growth+Chamber), I use [Peer Through Depths](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Peer+Through+Depths) to put those lands on the bottom and find an [Ideas Unbound](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ideas+Unbound). I draw another Fertile ground on my turn. I play it on my Growth Chamber and pass. I fog again. I draw a [Dawn's Reflection](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dawn%27s+Reflection) and it's clear I can go off. I go off and my opponent takes 12 damage from a [Grapeshot](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grapeshot) and 13 damage from a second [Grapeshot](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grapeshot).

**Sideboarding:** I take out one [Dawn's Reflection](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dawn%27s+Reflection) and one [Reach Through Mists](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reach+Through+Mists) and bring in the [Flaring Pain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flaring+Pain) to deal with [Prismatic Strands](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Prismatic+Strands) and the fourth [Moment's Peace](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Moment%27s+Peace).

**Game 2**

I mulligan down to five and keep [Island](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island), [Island](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island), [Fertile Ground](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fertile+Ground), [Moment's Peace](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Moment%27s+Peace), [Ponder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ponder). He plays a [Sidewinder Sliver](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sidewinder+Sliver) and passes. I draw another [Island](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island), play my [Ponder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ponder), I don't see a land that makes green mana so I shuffle, I draw another [Moment's Peace](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Moment%27s+Peace). My opponent plays a pair of Plate Slivers and attacks for one. I draw another [Island](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island), play it, and pass. My opponent plays a forest and a [Muscle Sliver](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Muscle+Sliver) and attacks me for six. I draw a [Dawn's Reflection](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dawn%27s+Reflection), play an [Island](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island) and pass. My opponent plays another [Muscle Sliver](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Muscle+Sliver) and attacks me down to one. I draw another [Fertile Ground](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fertile+Ground) and concede.

I keep the same sideboard plan for Game 3.

**Game 3**

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/boab/boab36_sideSliver.jpg)I mulligan down to six and keep [Forest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest), [Island](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island), [Fertile Ground](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fertile+Ground), [Moment's Peace](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Moment%27s+Peace), [Peer Through Depths](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Peer+Through+Depths), [Reach Through Mists](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reach+Through+Mists), [Ponder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ponder). I ponder on my first turn and keep another [Moment's Peace](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Moment%27s+Peace) and [Fertile Ground](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fertile+Ground) on top and put an [Island](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island) into my hand. My opponent plays a [Tranquil Thicket](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tranquil+Thicket) and passes. I draw the second [Fertile Ground](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fertile+Ground) and enchant my [Island](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island). My opponent plays a [Virulent Sliver](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Virulent+Sliver) and a [Sidewinder Sliver](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sidewinder+Sliver) and passes. I draw the extra [Moment's Peace](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Moment%27s+Peace) and double up the [Island](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island) with enchantments. My opponent plays a [Sinew Sliver](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sinew+Sliver) and attacks. I draw a [Deep Analysis](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deep+Analysis), play it, and draw a [Psychic Puppetry](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psychic+Puppetry) and a land. I play the land and pass. My opponent plays a [Muscle Sliver](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Muscle+Sliver) and attacks. I draw a land, play it, and pass. At this point in the game I am basically stalling with my [Moment's Peace](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Moment%27s+Peace) while I sculpt my hand. I fog my opponent four turns in a row and decide to go off. At this point my hand it pretty much perfect and going off with [Flaring Pain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flaring+Pain) is quite simple.

2-0

**Match Overview:** Slivers is very fast. It's important that we draw a [Moment's Peace](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Moment%27s+Peace) here. A single copy of our double fog will usually give us enough time to win the game. Don't be afraid to aggressively find a copy of [Moment's Peace](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Moment%27s+Peace) with [Peer Through Depths](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Peer+Through+Depths), [Ponder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ponder), or [Brainstorm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brainstorm).

### Round 3 vs. [Momentary Blink](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Momentary+Blink)

**Game 1**

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/boab/boab36_momentaryBlink.jpg)I keep [Forest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest), [Simic Growth Chamber](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Simic+Growth+Chamber), [Island](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island), [Deep Analysis](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deep+Analysis), [Deep Analysis](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deep+Analysis), [Dawn's Reflection](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dawn%27s+Reflection), [Psychic Puppetry](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psychic+Puppetry) on the draw. My opponent plays a land and passes. I draw a [Fertile Ground](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fertile+Ground) and follow suit. My opponent plays a Karoo and passes. Again, I follow suit. I discard a [Deep Analysis](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deep+Analysis). My opponent plays a [Trinket Mage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Trinket+Mage) and fetches up his [Executioner's Capsule](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Executioner%27s+Capsule). He probably assumes I'm playing Blue/Green Threshhold or Madness. I draw a [Reach Through Mists](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reach+Through+Mists), enchant my Karoo, play a land, and pass. My opponent plays an [Aven Riftwatcher](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aven+Riftwatcher) and attacks me for two. I draw another [Reach Through Mists](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reach+Through+Mists), Enchant my land with the [Dawn's Reflection](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dawn%27s+Reflection) and pass. My opponent plays a [Ravenous Rats](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ravenous+Rats) and I discard a [Deep Analysis](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deep+Analysis), he blinks it and I discard a [Reach Through Mists](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reach+Through+Mists). On my turn I draw an Ideas unbound. I tap my Karoo for one green and four blue and play [Ideas Unbound](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ideas+Unbound) Splicing my Puppetry. I draw a [Peer Through Depths](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Peer+Through+Depths) and two lands. I tap the Growth Chamber again and play the [Peer Through Depths](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Peer+Through+Depths) splicing the Puppetry. I find another [Ideas Unbound](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ideas+Unbound). From this point going off is fairly basic. By the time I draw a [Grapeshot](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grapeshot) my Storm Count is well above twenty-two.

**Sideboarding:** I take out three [Moment's Peace](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Moment%27s+Peace) and Bring in two [Echoing Truth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Echoing+Truth) and the [Flaring Pain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flaring+Pain).

**Game 2**

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/boab/boab36_trinketMage.jpg)I keep [Island](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island), [Island](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island), [Forest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest), [Fertile Ground](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fertile+Ground), [Deep Analysis](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deep+Analysis), [Psychic Puppetry](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psychic+Puppetry), [Ideas Unbound](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ideas+Unbound). He just plays a land on the first two turns. I draw into another [Deep Analysis](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deep+Analysis) and a [Peer Through Depths](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Peer+Through+Depths) and enchant my [Island](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island) with the [Fertile Ground](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fertile+Ground). My opponent plays [Aven Riftwatcher](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aven+Riftwatcher) on his third turn. I draw [Dawn's Reflection](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dawn%27s+Reflection) and Enchant my [Island](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island). My opponent plays a [Blind Hunter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blind+Hunter). I draw what seems to be the best card possible in the form of another [Ideas Unbound](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ideas+Unbound). I play [Ideas Unbound](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ideas+Unbound) and splice the Puppetry. I draw into another [Fertile Ground](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fertile+Ground), which I play on my [Island](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island). I draw through the majority of my deck and play a pair of [Grapeshot](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grapeshot)s for the win.

3-0

This deck is extremely exciting and very powerful. It cost less than 10 tickets to build on **Magic Online** and is very capable of winning tournaments. I hope all of you are willing to give this one a try. It's worth the time and effort.

Happy brewing!
