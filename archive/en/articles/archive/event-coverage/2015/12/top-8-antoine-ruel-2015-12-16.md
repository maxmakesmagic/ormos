Q: What made you decide to come to Grand Prix Porto?  

A: I just went for the pleasure and to travel, I love Portugal. And I wanted to participate in a lot of tournaments before starting school.



Q: What were your expectations going into this tournament, and why?  

A: I was here to qualify for PTLA.



Q: Briefly describe your tournament play-wise so far, both day one and day two.
A: Day one I hadn't a very good deck, but my opponents gave me three matches out of four. Day two I had two good decks and reached a 36 points record. Oh and I forgot, I was lucky and lucky and lucky again...



Q: What do you think is the main reason for you making top 8 in this tournament, and why?  

A: I worked a lot, then during the tournament, players gave me a lot of matches (6) and I was lucky.



Q: What does this top 8 performance mean to you?  

A: I'm really happy to reach top 8 with my brother, now, I hope we are going to be called by our names instead of being called "Black-Ops guys".



Q: What are your predictions for the top 8?  

A: I think I'm gonna beat my brother in the final.
