![Feature Match: Osamu Fujita vs. Kai Budde](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/ptno03/891.jpg)Kai Budde needs no introduction. He's largely considered to be the best Magic player of all time and he has the finishes and money winnings to back it up. Osamu Fujita isn't quite as well known, but he's running one of the most talked about decks of the tournament: [Mind's Desire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mind%27s+Desire) powered by [Twiddle](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Twiddle). Kai is running the German version of [Tinker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tinker).

Kai didn't seem to feel confident about his chances against this Japanese concoction. "This doesn't look good for me. I feel like I'm getting goldfished."

Good luck was exchanged, and the players began.

### Game 1

Osamu drew a hand with [Seat of the Synod](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seat+of+the+Synod), [Meditate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Meditate), [Gilded Lotus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gilded+Lotus), [Tinker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tinker), [Dream's Grip](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dream%27s+Grip), [Mystical Tutor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mystical+Tutor), [Tendrils of Agony](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tendrils+of+Agony) and lapsed deep into thought. In the end, he had to send it back for a new six: Sarpazzan Skerry, [Chrome Mox](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chrome+Mox), [Gilded Lotus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gilded+Lotus), [Twiddle](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Twiddle), [Dream's Grip](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dream%27s+Grip), and [Mind's Desire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mind%27s+Desire). He kept. Kai also mulliganed, and also liked his next six.

![Osamu Fujita is up to something sneaky](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/ptno03/894.jpg)Osamu led with the Skerry and passed the turn. Kai had [City of Traitors](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=City+of+Traitors), [Grim Monolith](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grim+Monolith), [Metalworker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Metalworker), which is certainly one of the better [Tinker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tinker) starts. Osamu still hadn't drawn a second land and had to pass the turn back. On his turn Kai tapped his City, played an [Island](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island), tapped that and [Tinker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tinker)ed away [Grim Monolith](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grim+Monolith) for a quick [Clockwork Dragon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Clockwork+Dragon). He then used his [Metalworker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Metalworker) to power out a [Thran Dynamo](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thran+Dynamo).

On his third turn Osamu played [Chrome Mox](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chrome+Mox), imprinted [Twiddle](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Twiddle), and placed down the [City of Traitors](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=City+of+Traitors) he had just drawn to power out a [Gilded Lotus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gilded+Lotus). The [Lotus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lotus) was tapped for blue mana three times (aided by two [Dream's Grip](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dream%27s+Grip)s), leading into a [Mind's Desire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mind%27s+Desire) for five floating one blue mana. It turned up the following cards: [Ancient Tomb](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ancient+Tomb), Sarpazzan Skerry, [Chrome Mox](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chrome+Mox), [Meditate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Meditate), [Diminishing Returns](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Diminishing+Returns). The last one was cast first, so Osamu removed ten cards (including all three of his remaining [Mind's Desire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mind%27s+Desire)s) and they shuffled up then drew new hands of seven.

"I would have preferred to see more [Twiddle](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Twiddle)s go." - Kai Budde, PT New Orleans 2003.

He untapped the [Lotus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lotus) with [Dream's Grip](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dream%27s+Grip) and lapsed into thought. [Meditate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Meditate) was cast for free, then [Gilded Lotus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gilded+Lotus) turned sideways three more times, this time due to two Bursts of Energy. [Brainstorm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brainstorm) found another [Twiddle](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Twiddle) but no business spells, so the [Gilded Lotus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gilded+Lotus) was [Tinker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tinker)ed away for a fresh one (thereby shuffling the library). That was tapped for blue and untapped with [Dream's Grip](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dream%27s+Grip), and then [Trade Secrets](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Trade+Secrets) was cast for four more cards. "Repeat?" Osamu jokingly asked.

Osamu [Brainstorm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brainstorm)ed, still looking for a [Tendrils of Agony](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tendrils+of+Agony). "I guess he fizzled, I don't know," said Kai to Rich Hoaen at a nearby table. Osamu couldn't believe his terrible luck as he looked for a way out of the predicament, but none was forthcoming. He had to enter his discard step and pass the turn back to Kai, with another turn coming after that due to the earlier [Meditate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Meditate).

[Clockwork Dragon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Clockwork+Dragon) entered the red zone for a quick seven damage. [Metalworker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Metalworker) tapped to produce fourteen mana, which was used to pay for [Gilded Lotus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gilded+Lotus), a [Thran Dynamo](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thran+Dynamo), and a [Stroke of Genius](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stroke+of+Genius) for nine cards. This was followed by [Voltaic Key](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Voltaic+Key), which untapped the [Metalworker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Metalworker) for another fourteen mana, then [Grim Monolith](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grim+Monolith) and a [Tinker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tinker) for [Mindslaver](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mindslaver). Shortly after [Mindslaver](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mindslaver) was activated, and Osamu was convinced to scoop.

### Game 2

Osamu kept a hand without blue mana and played a first turn [Ancient Tomb](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ancient+Tomb). Kai repeated his first turn from last game with [Grim Monolith](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grim+Monolith) and [Metalworker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Metalworker). "I am very good," Kai deadpanned in his German accent. This was especially true because his hand was capable of [Tinker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tinker)ing up and using [Mindslaver](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mindslaver) on turn two.

Osamu played a turn two [Chrome Mox](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chrome+Mox), imprinting [Thirst for Knowledge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thirst+for+Knowledge), and [Tinker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tinker)ed it away for a [Gilded Lotus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gilded+Lotus), and we were off to the races again. [Twiddle](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Twiddle) and [Dream's Grip](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dream%27s+Grip) untapped the [Lotus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lotus) twice for seven blue mana, leading into a [Mind's Desire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mind%27s+Desire) for five revealing: [Brainstorm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brainstorm), [Tinker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tinker), [City of Traitors](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=City+of+Traitors), [Ancient Tomb](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ancient+Tomb), and [Tendrils of Agony](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tendrils+of+Agony). [Brainstorm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brainstorm) was cast first, and then [Tinker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tinker) grabbed a fresh [Gilded Lotus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gilded+Lotus). [City of Traitors](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=City+of+Traitors) was played and then tapped along with the [Lotus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lotus) for a new [Mind's Desire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mind%27s+Desire). Eight free cards was too much with a Tendrils already showing, so Kai packed it in.

Even the most proactive [Tinker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tinker) draw isn't fast enough to stop this deck.

### Game 3

![Winning is SUCH a chore](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/ptno03/892.jpg)This time, though, [Tinker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tinker) was playing first. Kai kept his hand, which included a very important [Annul](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Annul), while Osamu kept a hand of Sarpazzan Skerry, [City of Traitors](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=City+of+Traitors), two [Twiddle](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Twiddle)s, two [Mind's Desire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mind%27s+Desire)s, and [Grim Monolith](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grim+Monolith).

Kai led off with [Island](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island), waiting on the [Annul](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Annul) sitting in his hand. Osamu played out a Skerry and passed the turn.

Kai's second turn ended with [Grim Monolith](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grim+Monolith), [Voltaic Key](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Voltaic+Key), and an untapped [Gilded Lotus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gilded+Lotus) on his side of the board. Osamu drew and thought for a good while about the proper play. City came down, then Skerry was tapped for two blue, and untapped with [Twiddle](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Twiddle), then the [City of Traitors](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=City+of+Traitors) was tapped to pay for a [Grim Monolith](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grim+Monolith). Kai tapped [Gilded Lotus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gilded+Lotus) and [Annul](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Annul)ed. Osamu, looking dejecting, used his floating blue mana to cast [Brainstorm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brainstorm), and then was done.

Twiddling the Sarpazzan Skerry before attempting to cast the [Grim Monolith](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grim+Monolith) was almost certainly a mistake, but Kai did such a good job of acting disinterested that Osamu didn't seem to be thinking about the possibility of countermagic.

Kai began his turn with another [Voltaic Key](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Voltaic+Key), then a [Metalworker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Metalworker), and his last card in hand, a [Rishadan Port](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rishadan+Port). He tapped down the [City of Traitors](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=City+of+Traitors) on Osamu's upkeep, sitting with a lot of mana but little action. Osamu played [Seat of the Synod](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seat+of+the+Synod), sacrificing his City, and passed the turn back. [Metalworker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Metalworker) got in for some beatdown and Skerry was tapped. Osamu played another Seat off the top. Kai attacked with [Metalworker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Metalworker) and played a second one.

Kai tapped a Seat on Osamu's upkeep and Osamu shipped the turn back. Kai drew, looked frustrated, and sent with both [Metalworker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Metalworker)s to take the score to 18 to 16. A third [Metalworker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Metalworker) hit the table to laughs from the spectators.

Osamu carefully placed down an [Ancient Tomb](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ancient+Tomb) and sat back to think. Next was [Chrome Mox](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chrome+Mox), imprinted with [Diminishing Returns](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Diminishing+Returns). [Dream's Grip](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dream%27s+Grip) untapped [Ancient Tomb](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ancient+Tomb) and [Twiddle](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Twiddle) untapped a [Seat of the Synod](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seat+of+the+Synod). Could Osamu make the deck work without a [Gilded Lotus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gilded+Lotus)? [Mind's Desire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mind%27s+Desire) resolved for four, showing [Gilded Lotus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gilded+Lotus), [Burst of Energy](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Burst+of+Energy), [Twiddle](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Twiddle) and [Seat of the Synod](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seat+of+the+Synod). [Gilded Lotus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gilded+Lotus) was placed onto the stack, but the only card in Kai's hand again turned out to be a key [Annul](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Annul).

Osamu only had one card in hand, but he thought carefully before sending the turn back. The team of [Metalworker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Metalworker)s swung for three. Osamu drew and had no action. On his next turn, it was evident in Kai's face that he had drawn something good. [Mindslaver](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mindslaver) was quickly cast and activated along with the usual [Metalworker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Metalworker) attack. On Osamu's turn, Kai tapped the [City of Traitors](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=City+of+Traitors), cast [Tinker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tinker) sacrificing the imprinted [Chrome Mox](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chrome+Mox) for a useless one, then cast the [Chrome Mox](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chrome+Mox) in Osamu's hand and imprinted the last card in his hand, [Mind's Desire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mind%27s+Desire), on to it.

After that, the rest of the game was simply a formality. Kai survived a rough game one to take the match from the [Twiddle](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Twiddle) deck.
