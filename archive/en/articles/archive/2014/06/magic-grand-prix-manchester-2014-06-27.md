"This is *Magic*" takes a look at the people and stories behind the cards and the plays. At [Grand Prix Manchester](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/magazine/article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/eventcoverage/gpman14/welcome), players old and new experience a live *Conspiracy* draft, meet a globetrotting rapper and judge program expert, find out about the world of live streams and *Duels of the Planeswalkers*, and explain what they love about the *Magic* community.
