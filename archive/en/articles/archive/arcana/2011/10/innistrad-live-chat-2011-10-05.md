How are you enjoying *Innistrad* so far? Do you have any questions about it? What if you could ask your question directly to **Mark Rosewater** (the design lead), **Erik Lauer** (the development lead), and **Brady Dommermuth** (the creative lead)?


The chat is on October 5 at 2:00 PM PDT. That's 5:00 PM on the East Coast, 9:00 PM GMT, and you'll have to figure it out for yourself for the rest of the world.


You can submit questions ahead of time [in this thread](http://community.wizards.com/go/thread/view/75842/28409153/Innistrad_Live_Chat_with_Mark_Rosewater,_Erik_Lauer,__Brady_Dommermuth_105_2:00pm_PDT?liveView=0), and the chat will be [right here](http://community.wizards.com/go/chat/3).
