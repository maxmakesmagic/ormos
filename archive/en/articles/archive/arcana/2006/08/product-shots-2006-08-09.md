We usually show three of a new set's booster designs, but today we're showing four. But hang on a moment. This is the last one for now. This is the one that will stay with you the rest of your day. 

By the way, *Time Spiral* releases October 6, 2006. Worldwide prerelease events start on September 23. Set previews on **magicthegathering.com** begin in four weeks, on September 4, 2006.

And now, enjoy your day.
