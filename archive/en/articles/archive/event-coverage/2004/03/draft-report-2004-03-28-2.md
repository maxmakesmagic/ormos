![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gpbir04/dr4_1.jpg)Both players 2-1'd their first pod and are still in contention for top 8 even though it will be way easier for Mattias who only needs a win out of the two first rounds to be able to ID into top 8 will Jose probably needs to win both first rounds. Mattias, who was feeding Jose, opened a no-brainer and quickly picked [Neurok Spy](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Neurok+Spy) out of a crappy pack. Jose had to choose between [Broodstar](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Broodstar) and [Viridian Shaman](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Viridian+Shaman). He hesitated way more then I would have before taking the Shaman. Green seems really under-drafted and you really need things to go well to make a [Broodstar](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Broodstar) effective. Unfortunately for him, Mattias second pack was another no-brainer as [One Dozen Eyes](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=One+Dozen+Eyes) was the only really good card left and unfortunately for both, those first bunch of packs were some of the worst I witnessed and Mattias picks after this were in order: [Banshee's Blade](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Banshee%27s+Blade), [Cobalt Golem](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cobalt+Golem), [Thoughtcast](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtcast), [Banshee's Blade](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Banshee%27s+Blade), [Tower of Eons](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tower+of+Eons), [Yotian Soldier](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Yotian+Soldier) and [Lifespark Spellbomb](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lifespark+Spellbomb).


Jose took the only good card left in Mattias's pack as his second pick, a [Skyhunter Cub](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skyhunter+Cub). He then got a Fireshriker that he took over a [Wizard Replica](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wizard+Replica) before the packs quickly dried up. He got in order: [Thoughtcast](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtcast), [Auriok Transfixer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Auriok+Transfixer), [Cobalt Golem](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cobalt+Golem), [Dragon Blood](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragon+Blood), [Nim Replica](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nim+Replica) (over [Annul](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Annul)) and [Razor Barrier](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Razor+Barrier) as his last relevant card.


While I was taking my notes, I could clearly see Mattias's disgusted look as well as Jose's headshakes. I could almost hear Jose's thoughts too, asking for a miracleâ€¦


And if it wasn't a miracle, it was a good start as the last card he discovered in his second pack was a [Pentavus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pentavus). He took a quick look at the rest of the pack before putting the rare on top of his pile while Mattias didn't take too long either before taking a [Quicksilver Elemental](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Quicksilver+Elemental). Jose then got passed another seven casting cost rare, not as good though as he picked [Altar of Shadows](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Altar+of+Shadows) over a [Betrayal of Flesh](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Betrayal+of+Flesh). Mattias Blue/Green deck was falling apart as he took [Spikeshot Goblin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spikeshot+Goblin) out of Jose's booster and [Betrayal of Flesh](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Betrayal+of+Flesh) third. They both got decent cards after that as Jose added the following to his White/Green deck: [Auriok Transfixer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Auriok+Transfixer), [Creeping Mold](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Creeping+Mold), [Wizard Replica](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wizard+Replica), [Leonin Den-Guard](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leonin+Den-Guard) and [Slith Ascendant](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Slith+Ascendant) (8th pick!!). He also took [Cloudpost](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloudpost) over [Tel-Jilad Chosen](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tel-Jilad+Chosen) 6th pick as he already had one (that's the spirit boys). Mattias on the other hand got Shrapnel blast fourth, [Thoughtcast](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtcast) over [Lumengrid Augur](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lumengrid+Augur) fifth, [Lumengrid Sentinel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lumengrid+Sentinel) sixth then Seat of Synod and [Tel-Jilad Chosen](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tel-Jilad+Chosen). He then picked [Tel-Jilad Exile](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tel-Jilad+Exile) ninth with a "I cant believe this" look when he saw a [Skyhunter Cub](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skyhunter+Cub) was still there, staring at Jose probably thinking "what the hell are you drafting" even though he couldn't know Jose had got a gift [Slith Ascendant](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Slith+Ascendant) out of this pack.


Darksteel was ok for Jose. Nothing to get excited about but overall pretty solid. He opened a rather weak pack and took Shikari out of it. He then took [Razor Golem](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Razor+Golem) over [Test of Faith](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Test+of+Faith), which is probably right but probably a very close call too. He got a Nomad Mystic fourth and took a [Razor Golem](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Razor+Golem) over another Mystic fifth. Finally, he rounded up his draft with [Infested Roothold](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Infested+Roothold), Reap and Saw, [Darksteel Pendant](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Darksteel+Pendant) and a late Phteron Ghost. Mattias got decent cards too as he opened and took a Vulshok Morningstar, then got passed [Chromescale Drake](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chromescale+Drake). He had to settle for an [Arcbound Stinger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arcbound+Stinger) third pick. He then got in order [Neurok Prodigy](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Neurok+Prodigy), [Talon of Pain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Talon+of+Pain) (over [Arcbound Stinger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arcbound+Stinger), which he later regretted), [Vedalken Engineer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vedalken+Engineer), which he scooped up very quickly and finally a [Darksteel Ingot](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Darksteel+Ingot) and a [Darksteel Citadel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Darksteel+Citadel) to support his affinitiesque mana base.


Both their decks are unimpressive but they seem like they might get them the record they need to top 8 if the packs were as sub-par for the other players as they were for them. I have the feeling they both made the best out of a bad position. 


It turns out they got paired together and Jose ended up scooping to Mattias as their match ended up in a draw. Jose now has to win out to top 8 while Mattias only has to get fortunate enough to get paired against someone that can afford a draw as well.
