**How did the results from the Pro Tour affect your deck choice?**



We saw a lot of interesting decks at the Pro Tour last weekend, but how did the results rom that tournament affect the deck choices of the Grand Prix competitors this weekend?

***(5) Ivan Floch** - I don't expect many people to play Nykthos decks because none of them were in the Top 8 of the Pro Tour. So, I wanted to play a deck that has a bad matchup against Nytkhos decks and a good matchup against the rest of the field.*

***Alexander Hayne**  - I expected lots of Jeskai and Abzan here today. [Jeskai Ascendancy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jeskai+Ascendancy) combo didn't perform as well at the Pro Tour, so I cut some of my combo hate cards from the sideboard.*
