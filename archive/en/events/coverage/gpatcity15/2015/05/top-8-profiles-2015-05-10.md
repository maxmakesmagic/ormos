Age: 30


  

Hometown: Vilnius / Madison / New York


  

Previous Magic Accomplishments: Three-time Grand Prix champion; Pro Tour Avacyn Restored finalist



What did you play on Saturday, and why?  

Red-White Aggro with [Citadel Siege](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Citadel+Siege) and two Runemarks. My pool wasn't good and [Citadel Siege](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Citadel+Siege) is amazing, so I tried to be as aggro as possible.



What did you draft today?  

Red-Green Aggro and Blue-Red Control


  

What were your best commons or uncommons this weekend? Why?  
[Goblin Heelcutter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Heelcutter): The card is unbeatable in aggro. [Abzan Runemark](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Abzan+Runemark): It was the only way my Sealed pool could win tihout drawing [Citadel Siege](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Citadel+Siege).


  

What do you want open for pack one, pick one? Why?  

A Dragonlord. They are almost unbeatable. (Also, less thinking for the rest of the draft.)

What did you play on Saturday, and why?  

White-Black with [Citadel Siege](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Citadel+Siege) and [Brutal Hordechief](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brutal+Hordechief), because those cards are unbeatable.


  

What did you draft today?  

Blue-Black, 2-1. Black-Red, 2-0-1.


  

What were your best commons or uncommons this weekend? Why?  
[Rakshasa Gravecaller](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rakshasa+Gravecaller) and [Deadly Wanderings](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deadly+Wanderings), because they weren't in the same deck. [Butcher's Glee](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Butcher%27s+Glee) also overperformed.


  

What do you want open for pack one, pick one? Why?  

Any Dragonlord. Failing that, [Rakshasa Gravecaller](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rakshasa+Gravecaller).

Age: 26


  

Hometown: Westmount, Canada


  

Previous Magic Accomplishments: Four Grand Prix wins, three other Top 8s. Pro Tour Avacyn Restored Champion. Rookie of the Year, 2011-2012.


  

What did you play on Saturday, and why?  

I played Blue-Black, splash Kolaghan, the Storm's Fury. I prepared by Skype-ing with Limited master Mike Sigrist, who loves Blue-Black, and it was one of the deeper combinations in my pool.


  

What did you draft today?  

Draft 1: Green-Blue Conifder Strider / [Taigam's Strike](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Taigam%27s+Strike) combo. 2-1. It was awful. I got lucky.  

Draft 2: Red-White Aggro. Good curve, good removal, no cares. 3-0.


  

What were your best commons or uncommons this weekend? Why?  
[Strongarm Monk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Strongarm+Monk). It just makes combat impossible for your opponents.


  

What do you want open for pack one, pick one? Why?  
[Dragonlord Silumgar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragonlord+Silumgar). Blue-Black is great and deep, and having a giant, flying, deathtouch creature, plus your opponent's best creature seems good. Also, I'm a proud Dimir mage.

Age: 30


  

Hometown: Richmond, Virginia


  

Previous Magic Accomplishments: One Pro Tour Top 16. Two or three Pro Tour Top 25s. One Grand Prix Top 8.


  

What did you play on Saturday, and why?  

Blue-Red Unblockable. My deck had no rares, but a bunch of unblockable creatures and flyers. First time I've every played [Dragonrage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragonrage) happily. It killed a lot of people out of nowhere.


  

What did you draft today?  

Draft 1: Red-Green Dudes. I had a Descent of the Dragons; never cast it.  

Draft 2: White-Black, splashing [Boltwing Marauder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Boltwing+Marauder).


  

What were your best commons or uncommons this weekend? Why?  
[Dragonrage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragonrage) won me several games with my Sealed deck that I probably had no business winning. I didn't play it main deck, and I sided it in every game.


  

What do you want open for pack one, pick one? Why?  

Besides an insane rare? [Ultimate Price](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ultimate+Price) or [Rakshasa Gravecaller](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rakshasa+Gravecaller).

Previous Magic Accomplishments: Top 50 at Pro Tour Born of the Gods. Convinced a bunch of people [Nivmagus Elemental](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nivmagus+Elemental) was broken.


  

What did you play on Saturday, and why?  

Blue-Red with no plan. My pool was very bad.


  

What did you draft today?  

Blue-Black Exploit, 3-0. Black-Red Impact Tremors, 3-0.


  

What were your best commons or uncommons this weekend? Why?  

Anything with exploit.


  

What do you want open for pack one, pick one? Why?  

I don't know card names...Probably the uncommon [Grave Titan](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grave+Titan) exploit thingy.

Age: 20


  

Hometown: San Francisco


  

Previous Magic Accomplishments: Two Pro Tour Top 8s. Five Grand Prix Top 8s. Platinum Pro.

Black-Green splashing red (Jund). I put as many rares in my deck as I could.



What did you draft today?  

Black-Red Dash, 3-0. White-Blue Ojutai, 2-1.


  

What were your best commons or uncommons this weekend? Why?  

Qarsi Sadist: high toughness and occasional exploit. [Dragonloft Idol](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragonloft+Idol): fantastic when combined with luck.


  

What do you want open for pack one, pick one? Why?  
[Dragonlord Ojutai](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragonlord+Ojutai).

Age: 26


  

Hometown: New York, NY


  

Previous Magic Accomplishments: Five Grand Prix Top 8s. Two Pro Tour Top 16s.



What did you play on Saturday, and why?  

Blue-Black, splashing white. Black was my best color and blue was my best support color. Had two on-color white duals, so I splashed an extra win condition and removal spell.


  

What did you draft today?  

Blue-Black (3-0) and Black-Red (2-0-1).


  

What were your best commons or uncommons this weekend? Why?  
[Ojutai's Breath](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ojutai%27s+Breath) in the first draft won me multiple games I would've lost otherwise. Second draft: [Qal Sisma Behemoth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Qal+Sisma+Behemoth). A 5/5 for 3 mana is insane.


  

What do you want open for pack one, pick one? Why?  
[Dragonlord Silumgar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragonlord+Silumgar) because it's unfair.

Age: 32


  

Hometown: Oakland


  

Previous Magic Accomplishments: Hall of Fame. Third in Vintage Super League, season two. Second in Vintage Super League, season one.


  

What did you play on Saturday, and why?  

Red-Green Midrange, because I had a bunch of removal and a few finishers.


  

What did you draft today?  

Two Blue-Back Control decks. Both were top-heavy and full of value cards.


  

What were your best commons or uncommons this weekend? Why?  
[Aven Surveyor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aven+Surveyor) and [Reach of Shadows](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reach+of+Shadows) were both great at dealing with opposing anything.


  

What do you want open for pack one, pick one? Why?  
[Dragonlord Silumgar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragonlord+Silumgar), so I can draft Blue-Black.
