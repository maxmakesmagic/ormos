In still more Fujita Action, we find the aging superstar up against another of Japan's National Magic Treasures, the Hat Man himself Satoshi Nakamura. Though he's been on a bit of a hiatus from competitive play, what with his work as a game designer, Nakamura's game is still in fine form. 

Fujita got things started with a [Krosan Avenger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Krosan+Avenger). Nakamura, struggling with awkward mana, refused to [Sonic Seizure](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sonic+Seizure) it, hoping to draw out of his predicament. When he did not find the second black mana to go with his [Crippling Fatigue](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crippling+Fatigue), he had to act. He lost his [Gravedigger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gravedigger) to the Seizure.

Now Fujita turned up the heat with a [Call of the Herd](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Call+of+the+Herd). Nakamura ate some pain and had no answer. A second elephant hit the board. Fujita pitched [Crippling Fatigue](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crippling+Fatigue), [Cabal Surgeon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cabal+Surgeon) and [Mesmeric Fiend](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mesmeric+Fiend) to [Sickening Dreams](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sickening+Dreams), giving Fujita a monstrous 4-1 card advantage, but dispatching his twin elephants.

Nakamura was finally on the offensive with [Pardic Firecat](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pardic+Firecat). Fujita made a pair of tokens with [Chatter of the Squirrel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chatter+of+the+Squirrel), but Nakamura one-upped him with [Angel of Retribution](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Angel+of+Retribution). Unfortunately for him, he was low enough that Fujita could simply drop his hand to his [Sickening Dreams](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sickening+Dreams) and take the game.

In game two, Nakamura's turn-three [Organ Grinder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Organ+Grinder) was answered by Fujita's [Call of the Herd](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Call+of+the+Herd). Nakamura couldn't wait to bring the beats and cleared a path with [Fiery Temper](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fiery+Temper). Fujita went one better with an [Afflict](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Afflict) on his Grinder. Soon it was [Barbarian Lunatic](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Barbarian+Lunatic) holding off a second Call token.

Fujita's [Krosan Restorer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Krosan+Restorer) did little to break the stalemate. Nakamura went to the air with [Aven Fisher](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aven+Fisher). Fujita made a Lunatic of his own. The two stared at each other. [Ghastly Demise](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ghastly+Demise) took down Nakamura's Lunatic, who tag-teamed with [Afflict](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Afflict) to take out the token. Nakamura tapped out for [Gravedigger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gravedigger) and the resurrected Lunatic.

Trying to stay in the game, Fujita used [Flame Burst](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flame+Burst) to take out the Fisher. Nakamura kept the pressure up with [Barbarian Outcast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Barbarian+Outcast). Now it was his turn to force the Lunatic, this time with [Firebolt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Firebolt). It took down the Outcast on the way out. [Mesmeric Fiend](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mesmeric+Fiend) stripped Fujita of his only useful card, [Fiery Temper](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fiery+Temper). Between [Pardic Arsonist](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pardic+Arsonist) and [Sickening Dreams](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sickening+Dreams), it was a short walk to game three.

In the deciding game, Fujita again had turn-three [Call of the Herd](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Call+of+the+Herd). This time it was foiled by [Chainer's Edict](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chainer%27s+Edict), and then [Afflict](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Afflict) and [Firebolt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Firebolt). The [Firebolt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Firebolt) took down Fujita's [Chainflinger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chainflinger) for an encore. [Mesmeric Fiend](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mesmeric+Fiend) took [Afflict](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Afflict), leaving [Anurid Scavenger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Anurid+Scavenger) and [Seton's Desire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seton%27s+Desire), and [Organ Grinder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Organ+Grinder) threatened to bring the beats.

Fujita topdecked [Barbarian Lunatic](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Barbarian+Lunatic). Nakamura swung in with the Grinder, losing it and the Fiend in the process. [Chainflinger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chainflinger) came off the bench. Fujita held it off with [Anurid Scavenger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Anurid+Scavenger). Fortunately for Nakamura, Fujita was short on gas. He could afford to wait out the Scavenger. [Barbarian Outcast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Barbarian+Outcast) made racing a bad idea for Fujita.

The Scavenger ran out of food. Fujita tried a [Krosan Restorer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Krosan+Restorer) and [Seton's Desire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seton%27s+Desire), but [Afflict](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Afflict) and [Chainflinger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chainflinger) stopped that nonsense. Nakamura swung for six. When Fujita had no further offense, Nakamura wrapped it up with [Pardic Arsonist](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pardic+Arsonist) and [Sickening Dreams](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sickening+Dreams).
