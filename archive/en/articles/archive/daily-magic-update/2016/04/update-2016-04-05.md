The Daily *Magic* Update is a roundup of everything *Magic* you should know on April 5, 2016. Today's Update is brought to you by [the first wave of reactions to the banned and restricted announcement](#banned). The first, I'm sure, of many.


Today's Must
============


1. [*Shadows over Innistrad* Constructed Set Review—White](http://www.channelfireball.com/articles/shadows-over-innistrad-constructed-set-review-white/) | ChannelFireball | Luis Scott-Vargas

LSV has made it through the Limited portion of his epically large, epically long set review. Now, it's on to Constructed and white, where everyone is going gaga over [Archangel Avacyn](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Archangel+Avacyn). Spoiler alert: everyone's favorite [Serra Angel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Serra+Angel) with flash is not No. 1 on Luis's list.


Additionally, if you happen to have a StarCityGames.com premium subscription, Patrick Chapin is also walking through his set review color-by-color, [starting with blue](http://www.starcitygames.com/article/32707_Shadows-Over-Innistrad-Review-Blue.html).


After That, Read, Watch, or Listen to These
===========================================


1. [The Decks to Beat at #SCGBALT](http://www.starcitygames.com/article/32705_The-Decks-To-Beat-At-SCGBALT.html) | StarCityGames.com | Ross Merriam

*Shadows over Innistrad* releases this weekend. You know what also happens this weekend? A StarCityGames.com Open Weekend, featuring Standard. There's no telling what people will be bringing to the table with a set that will have been released literally 24 hours before the tournament starts, but we're eager to see. Ross Merriam has some notions on what those things might be.


1. [*Magic: The Gathering* Comedy! "Who are these players?"—MTG](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgvhEDS06mg) | Tolarian Community College | The Professor and Josh Lee Kwai

Josh Lee Kwai from [The Command Zone](http://www.rocketjump.com/podcasts#thecommandzone) joins the Professor to talk about—nothing? It's a *Magic* sendup of that other show about nothing, and it made me giggle at 7:30 a.m., so it's gotta be more than a little funny if you have your wits completely about you.

1. [Eternal Warrior #55: *Shadows over Innistrad* Eternal Set Review](http://www.mtgoacademy.com/eternal-warrior-55-shadows-over-innistrad-eternal-set-review/) | MTGOAcademy | RexDart

There's not a ton of wild speculation or "ifs" in this article. RexDart identifies a few potentially powerful cards in Modern and Legacy and lays out the conditions for them seeing play. It's a tight, informative article worth a look for any Modern or Legacy players.


1. [Top Ten Commander Cards in *Shadows over Innistrad* (Part 1)](http://www.mtggoldfish.com/articles/top-ten-commander-cards-in-shadows-over-innistrad-part-1) | MTGGoldfish | Saffron Olive and Tomer Abramovici

Saffron and Tomer explore the best cards for Commander in *Shadows over Innistrad* in this video review. Look for part two tomorrow.


Banned and Restricted Reactions
===============================


1. [Eye Is Banned. Ancestral Vision and Sword of the Meek Are Unbanned. What Now?](http://www.channelfireball.com/articles/eye-is-banned-ancestral-vision-and-sword-of-the-meek-are-unbanned-what-now/) | ChannelFireball | Reid Duke

Reid Duke, all-world player and all-star hair inspiration, was first on the scene with a major article analyzing the changes wrought by the [banned and restricted announcement yesterday](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/daily-magic-update/update-2016-04-04). The speed at which this was posted was impressive, but the analysis isn't worse for it. Read on for the hottest of hot takes, then you can check out [this Reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/4dc3we/reid_dukes_article_on_the_modern/) for people criticizing said hot take.


1. [Important Modern and Vintage Banned and Restricted Announcement—*Magic: The Gathering* News!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Nx-57NZZeM) | The Mana Source | Wedge

If reading isn't your thing—well, first, what are you doing reading this? Second and more pertinent is that Wedge walks through what happened with the [B&R announcement](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/daily-magic-update/update-2016-04-04). With moving pictures!

Speaking of moving pictures, TCGPlayer was also pretty on top of [the announcement](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/daily-magic-update/update-2016-04-04), dropping some tournament-savvy knowledge on you—in video form!

1. [*Magic: The Gathering* expansion brings madness to game table](http://dailycampus.com/stories/2016/4/4/magic-the-gathering-expansion-brings-madness-to-game-table) | The Daily Campus | Nicholas Shigo

Most days, when I search for *Magic* news, I tend to see content from the places you'd expect—game blogs, "geek"-centered news outlets, and the occasional major outlet doing the "look at how popular this game has gotten" piece. And then today I was greeted by the delightful sight of a college newspaper—The University of Connecticut, to be exact—reviewing *Shadows over Innistrad*. I'm not sure if UConn just has that big of a *Magic*-playing audience, or if Shigo, the associate news editor for the paper, just decided to wield his power to write about something he loves. Either one is cool with me.


Almost as cool as [the notice in the Greenburgh Daily Voice](http://greenburgh.dailyvoice.com/events/greenburgh-library-teaching-magic-the-gathering-card-game/649843/) that *Magic* would be taught at the public library today from 3–8 p.m. So if you live in or near the Greenburgh Public Library in Elmsford, New York, well...


Deck of the Day
===============


1. [Shota Yasooka's Tezzerator](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/gpkob14/deck-tech-shota-yasooka-2014-08-23)

Ever since, well, yesterday, people have been looking for the best place to put the [Thopter Foundry](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thopter+Foundry) / [Sword of the Meek](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sword+of+the+Meek) combo in Modern, and [the most common answer](https://www.reddit.com/r/spikes/comments/4dg490/modern_prime_the_engine_an_introduction_to_ub/) has been to put it in a [Tezzeret, Agent of Bolas](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tezzeret%2C+Agent+of+Bolas) shell. It makes sense—Tezzeret can both search for and utilize each side of the combo, the deck as a whole already has an artifact theme to it, and Tezzeret is a very powerful, likely underplayed card.


So it's no surprise to see people looking back at lists from one of the most innovative deck builders on the planet, Shota Yasooka—even if that list is from 2014.


Not much has changed in the Modern artifact world since then. The metagame is different—main deck [Torpor Orb](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Torpor+Orb) really isn't needed anymore, for example—but the core idea of the deck remains the same: play a lot of artifacts that go well with Tezzeret, play [Thirst for Knowledge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thirst+for+Knowledge), and control the board. And since Tezzeret is both a card advantage machine as well as a quick clock—5/5 [Darksteel Citadel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Darksteel+Citadel)'s are particularly difficult to beat—it serves as an ideal finisher for a control deck.


And now it gets a combo so powerful it has been banned from Modern since Modern existed. Could be something there, don't you think?
