![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gpbar02/a953.jpg)These two are probably a point away from the second day. With 701 players and eight rounds, 6-1-1 should be enough, while 6-2 might not make it. Coming all the way to 6-0 and then losing the last two rounds would be terrible but it might happen.

So far their day has been nothing but joy and a win here could mark the start of a run for the Top 8 tomorrow. One of them will walk away knowing he is in the second day.

### Game 1

Adolfo opened up with a [Wild Mongrel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Mongrel) and [Krosan Archer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Krosan+Archer) while Noah started with a [Millikin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Millikin) followed by a [Dirty Wererat](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dirty+Wererat). When he played [Aven Windreader](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aven+Windreader) Hernandez whistled and dropped his own copy on the following turn.

Boeken used a [Diabolic Tutor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Diabolic+Tutor) to fetch out a game breaker choosing between [Stalking Bloodsucker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stalking+Bloodsucker), [Gravedigger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gravedigger) and [Morbid Hunger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Morbid+Hunger). After some deliberation he settled on the Hunger.

He countered [Puppeteer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Puppeteer), untapped and Hungered away the Windreader. Although the [Krosan Archer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Krosan+Archer) could hold back Noah's Windreader the [Dirty Wererat](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dirty+Wererat) was now in full power and was more than a match for the Mongrel when it came to speed.

Adolfo had enough fight in him to counter the Flashbacked [Morbid Hunger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Morbid+Hunger) but there was little he could do to turn around the creature war. If he had somehow found the second [Swamp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swamp) to power his freshly drawn [Morbid Hunger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Morbid+Hunger) things might have been different.

Noah 1-0 Adolfo

### Game 2

This time the shoe was on the other foot. The Spanish player started out with a turn three [Patchwork Gnomes](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Patchwork+Gnomes) followed by a turn four [Dirty Wererat](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dirty+Wererat) while Noah was forced to discard when he was locked at two lands (although he used the discard to make his [Crippling Fatigue](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crippling+Fatigue) playable on the next turn).

Despite losing his Gnomes Hernandez had enough speed in him yet. He played a Mongrel and bounced a [Cabal Torturer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cabal+Torturer) out of the way for another swing before playing [Aven Windreader](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aven+Windreader).

Boeken tried to fight back with a [Zombify](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Zombify) on his [Grotesque Hybrid](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grotesque+Hybrid). Hernandez had no way around that so he tried to go through it: he attacked with the Mongrel and the Windreader.

Boeken traded the Hybrid for two cards for the Mongrel and a cycled [Refresh](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Refresh) dropping to six life. He needed an answer but the best he could muster on the next turn was a [Dirty Wererat](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dirty+Wererat). Adolfo had a [Repel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Repel) to solve that dropping the last bloody elbow on a game Boeken never had a chance.

Noah 1-1 Adolfo

### Game 3

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gpbar02/a952.jpg)Hernandez kept a very risky and for the third game with only [Island](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island)s and his deck decided not to help him out. By the time he found his fourth land, a [Swamp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swamp) Noah already had a [Millikin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Millikin), Looter and Windreader.

The [Dirty Wererat](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dirty+Wererat) and [Crypt Creeper](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crypt+Creeper) were not quite enough to catch up right away and when Noah Discarded a [Diabolic Tutor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Diabolic+Tutor) to the Looter it was obvious he had a handful of menaces. The first one to come out was a [Nantuko Cultivator](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nantuko+Cultivator) (discarding two lands).

Still the Spanish players refused to lose his good humour, whistling as he [Repel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Repel)led the Cultivator away. Boeken shrugged it of and played a [Aven Fisher](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aven+Fisher) further stretching his control over the skies.

With the Spanish now at nine Boeken played [Aquamoeba](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aquamoeba) and tried to [Zombify](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Zombify) a [Grotesque Hybrid](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grotesque+Hybrid) but Adolfo didn't forget about his Creeper and took the Hybrid out of the game.

The Dutch air force brought Hernandez down to four and Boeken played [Stalking Bloodsucker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stalking+Bloodsucker) to make sure there were no last minute surprises. Hernandez brought him down to six with a Mongrel powered swing and played [Gloomdrifter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gloomdrifter) to kill most of the table away.

All he had now was [Gloomdrifter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gloomdrifter) and Mongrel and Noah was down to Bloodsucker and Windreader. It was too little too late, the flying menace took him out in one swing.

**Final Result:** Noah Boeken 2-1 Adolfo Hernandez
