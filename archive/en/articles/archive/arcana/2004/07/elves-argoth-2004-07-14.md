Today's Magic Arcana sets the Wayback Machine to 1998 for a peek at the *Urza's Saga* style guide, a document designed to gather concepts and illustrations for a new **Magic** block so that artists and card designers can get a sense of the new world.

Today we focus on the Argothian elves. The elves of Argoth lived a peaceful existence in their tropical forest until Urza and his brother Mishra razed huge tracts of their lands to clear a theater for battle. The elves' homeland was devastated, leaving behind few remains of a once-graceful and artistic culture. 

Let's resurrect that culture for a moment with these artist's concept sketches of the lives of the Argothian elves (artist credits: Mark Tedin, Pete Venters, Anthony Waters, Matt Wilson).
