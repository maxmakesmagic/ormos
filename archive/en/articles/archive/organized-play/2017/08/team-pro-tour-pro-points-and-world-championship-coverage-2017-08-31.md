Hey everyone! Before Organized Play goes on a two-week hiatus for *Ixalan* previews, I have two very important bits of news for you today.


Pro Points for Pro Tour 25th Anniversary
========================================


Back in July, we noted that more details regarding the prize payouts for Pro Tour 25th Anniversary—our Team Trios Pro Tour taking place in Minneapolis, Minnesota, August 3–5, 2018—would be revealed in September. However, when it comes to Pro Points awarded at that event, we're going to publish that info a little earlier . . . as in, we're publishing that today.


The reason? Competitors looking to participate in the Pro Tour Team Series are planning their teams now, and the Pro Points awarded at Pro Tour 25th Anniversary are factoring into those decisions. We wanted to get that info out as soon as possible to help teams make the decisions they need to for the 2017–18 season.


It's particularly important for these to get posted since they're different from an individual Pro Tour. After all, Team Trios is a very different format from an individual tournament. It's also not even the same number of rounds of Swiss.


Pro Tour 25th Anniversary will mirror the same number of rounds as the last Team Trios Pro Tour we ran—Charleston in 2006—with a total of fourteen rounds before a cut to the Top 4 teams. There will be no cut for Day Two, so trios may play all fourteen rounds of Swiss if they wish to. The Pro Points for this event will be given out as such to the Top 4 teams.




|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Place | Pro Points (per player) |
| 1st | 20 |
| 2nd | 18 |
| 3rd–4th | 16 |

And for teams that don't finish in the Top 4, Pro Points will be awarded to each player based on their team's match points at the end of the Swiss rounds.




|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Match Points | Pro Points (per player) |
| 33+ | 16 |
| 32 | 14 |
| 31 | 13 |
| 30 | 12 |
| 29 | 10 |
| 28 | 9 |
| 27 | 8 |
| 25–26 | 5 |
| 24 | 4 |
| 0–23 | 3 |
