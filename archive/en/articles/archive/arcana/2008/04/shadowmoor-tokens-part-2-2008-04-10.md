As *Shadowmoor* card previews continue, we thought we'd spend a little more time with card's little brother, the token. Here are the remaining tokens, soon to be appearing in boosters everywhere!

A green *and white* Elf Warrior makes an appearance, cohort of preview cards like [Rhys the Redeemed](http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=magic/shadowmoor/spoiler).

A 1/1 red Elemental token with haste! Let's hope he doesn't bring along too many of his buddies...

Interesting. A 1/1 flying Spirit token, floating through *Shadowmoor*'s eternal night.

What's this? A 1/2 Spider token with reach! Somebody page guest columnist [Jon Becker](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/daily/db30)!

[Oona's](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/daily/db31) Faerie Rogue children seem right at home here in *Shadowmoor*.

Finally, we leave you with something a bit smashier. This 4/4 hasty Giant Warrior means business... and his business is definitely smashing face!
