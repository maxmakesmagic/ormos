The Japanese coverage team here this weekend have undertaken the gargantuan task of typing all three hundred and fifty eight decklists.


That's a lot of [Mountain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mountain)s. However, sometimes enquiring minds want answers on the spot, and that means turning to one of the many 'excellent' free translation software packages available courtesy of the internet.


Let's give you a neat example. Here's a Standard decklist:


12 《山》  



How's that working for you? I must admit, I'm struggling. So now here's the same decklist run through the 'global translator':


12 The Mountain  

4 The Dry Plateau  

4 The Small Lake Which Boils  

4 The Peak Which Is Shaken  

4 The Precursor Of Goburin  

4 The Patriarch Of The Toge Shooting  

4 The Lava Of The Tannin Surface To Use  

4 Sudden Attack Party Of Goburin  

4 The Cinders To Carry  

2 Game Of Goburin It Fans  

4 Lightning  

4 The Grenade Of Goburin  

1 Devastating Summons  

4 The Shrine Of The Anger Which Burns Up  

1 Kosu Of The Hammer  
  

3 Person Of Crazy  

2 Refugee Of Yuarushiyoku  

2 Incineration  

4 Quarters Cutting  

2 Conduct Of Rebellion  

2 Accomplishing The Bewitchment

*Quarters Cutting* |

And finally the **Sideboard**. Some of these had me puzzling for a while:

Refugee of yuarushiyoku is [Vulshok Refugee](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vulshok+Refugee).  

Incineration is [Combust](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Combust), confusingly.  

Quarters Cutting is [Dismember](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dismember).  

Conduct of Rebellion is [Act of Treason](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Act+of+Treason).  

Accomplishing the Bewitchment is [Manabarbs](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Manabarbs).
