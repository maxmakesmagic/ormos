*Modern Horizons*: *Magic Online* Edition
-----------------------------------------


*Modern Horizons* sales and events start Thursday, June 6, at 10 a.m. PT. You'll be able to play in Draft Leagues, Sealed Leagues, and Phantom Draft Leagues, and we're introducing a new entry option specifically for this set: *Modern Horizons* Tokens. This release will also include Treasure Chest updates, which you can view [here](https://magic.wizards.com/en/MTGO/articles/archive/magic-online/treasure-chest-card-list-info) in the coming weeks.


Check out [Chris's release article](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/magic-online/state-magic-online-modern-horizons-play-lobby-2019-05-23) for additional info on entry options, *Modern Horizons* tokens, and more.

New Play Lobby
--------------


This week, when we come up from downtime on Wednesday, you'll see the new Play Lobby update as part of your client. This update puts a focus on formats over event types. Rather than selecting a bunch of filters and cycling through countless event types, you'll instead click the new Constructed or Limited lobby, choose your format, and be shown everything available in that format.


You can find more information about the new Play Lobby [here](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/magic-online/state-magic-online-modern-horizons-play-lobby-2019-05-23).

Vintage Cube Ends June 6

Vintage Cube will be leaving us when *Modern Horizons* events begin on Thursday. Come play the Cube that started it all for a few more days.

Team Modern Super League
------------------------


The newest Super League season is here with the return of the Team Modern format! Eight teams (including Wizards' Play Design group) will battle over 13 weeks for bragging rights in Modern. The broadcast begins at 6 p.m. PT every Tuesday at [twitch.tv/magic](https://www.twitch.tv/magic).


For more information and team rosters, click [here](https://vintagesuperleague.com/).

Limited MOCS Preliminary Sunday
-------------------------------


On Sunday, June 9, there will be a *Magic Online* Championship Series Preliminary event for 2019 MOCS! The format will be Phantom Sealed, the set will be *Modern Horizons*, and things will kick off at 7 a.m. PT. MOCS Preliminaries are eight rounds of Swiss and require 35 Qualifier Points to enter. Winners will receive (among other prizes) an invitation to the next MOCS Playoff on July 13.
