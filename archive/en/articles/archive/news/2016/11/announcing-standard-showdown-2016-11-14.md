Last month we announced a change to the Standard rotation. This month, we celebrate.


From November 26 through December 17, stores around the world will be able to host Standard Showdown tournaments on Saturdays with special promotional prize boosters earned through undefeated play and other means as determined by each store. The tournaments will be Swiss events meant to showcase the Standard format.


Stores will receive 40 prize boosters—ten for each event—that will contain three cards each. These boosters will contain:


* A premium card from a currently legal Standard set, including *Zendikar Expeditions* and *Kaladesh Inventions*, not including double-faced cards.
* Two non-premium cards that are either a rare or a mythic rare from a set currently legal in Standard\* (*Battle for Zendikar* through *Kaladesh)*.

\*Cards from *Oath of the Gatewatch* and double-faced cards are not included.


*Zendikar Expeditions* and *Kaladesh Inventions* appear in roughly 1 in 33 boosters.


Distributed cards will all be in English.


The Standard Showdown will be available to stores around the world.


Talk to your [local game store](http://locator.wizards.com/) about hosting a Standard Showdown, and prepare your Standard deck for November 26!
