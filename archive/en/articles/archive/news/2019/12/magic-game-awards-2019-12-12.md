The Game Awards 2019 has ended. And Wizards of the Coast brought a number of announcements to the show. Here's everything *Magic*-related that happened today. And even a bit of D&D.


*Theros Beyond Death* Trailer Debut
===================================


We unveiled the new trailer for *Theros Beyond Death*. It includes the return of a fan-favorite character and a clash with an unexpected foe.


A lot of people poured their hearts into bringing the characters of *Magic* to life in this trailer, including Grammy- and Emmy-nominated composer Ramin Djawadi. We hope you enjoy what we've crafted for you.

*MTG Arena*: *The Game Awards After Party* Event
================================================


Why wait a month to play with [*Theros Beyond Death*](https://magic.wizards.com/en/products/TherosBeyondDeath) cards when you can play with them today with no entry fee?


*The Game Awards After Party* is a powerful and crazy **three-day event** in *MTG Arena* that brings together old and new iconic cards. We've never tried anything like this before, combining some of the most iconic cards in *Magic*'s history with brand-new *Theros Beyond Death* cards.

Here are the details:


* No entry fee. And no cards required.
* Choose between two pre-constructed decks; wield Elspeth versus Ashiok.
* Get a *Theros Beyond Death* booster for each of your first three wins. You can open those boosters when *Theros Beyond Death* releases on January 16.
* Decks contain new cards like *Elspeth, Sun's Nemesis* and *Ashiok, Nightmare Muse*.
* Decks also contain iconic cards like *[Black Lotus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Black+Lotus)*, [Mox Pearl](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mox+Pearl), [Ancestral Recall](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ancestral+Recall), and [Sol Ring](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sol+Ring).

*Developer's Note: We're not adding cards like [Black Lotus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Black+Lotus) to Historic. Older cards you haven't seen in-game before will only be playable through this event. As we've started to build cards from* Magic*'s past, we \*had\* to play with cards like The Power Nine.*


*Legal Note: Event decks will not be added to your collection.*
