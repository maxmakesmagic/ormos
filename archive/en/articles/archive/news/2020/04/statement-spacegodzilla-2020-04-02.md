Months ago, when *Ikoria: Lair of Behemoths* was finalized, the world was a very different place. As we all adjust to a world altered by the spread of COVID-19, the word "corona" has taken on a new meaning.


In context, the card we're about to show you made sense when it was originally conceivedâ€”"the Corona Beam" is Spacegodzilla's traditional breath weapon. However, we were unable to change our printing in time to address the new meaning of corona. The initial printing of *Ikoria* will arrive on shelves soon and this card will be part of the set, but we are taking steps to remove or change the card where possible.

First, all reprints of *Ikoria* will remove this card. Second, we'll be renaming the card on *Magic: The Gathering Arena* to Spacegodzilla, Void Invader. Finally, *Magic Online*, which will be offering the special Godzilla Series Monster versions of cards only in Treasure Chests, will not distribute this card.


Note that this is a special version of the card Void Beckoner, which will not be affected by any changes.
