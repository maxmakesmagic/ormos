Richard Bland of England shares his Modern deck from Day Three at the *Magic* World Championships that helped him rally from a slow start to be in Top 8 contention. Bland's Zoo build attacks other Zoo decks with a deck that harkens back to Brian Kibler's Pro Tour Austin-winning creation. A deck list will be posted after the event.
