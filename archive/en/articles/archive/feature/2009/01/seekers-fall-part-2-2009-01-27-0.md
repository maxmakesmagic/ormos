It's time for the second chapter of *The Seeker's Fall*, in which—well, we wouldn't want to spoil the surprise, now would we?


Incidentally, if you want to see more of Tezzeret's adventures, you're in luck: *Agents of Artifice* comes out today. And there's a [special offer](/en/articles/archive/agents-artifice-promo-card-2009-01-27)! That's another story, though. For now, sit back, relax, and enjoy part two of... [*The Seeker's Fall*](/en/node/628166)!
