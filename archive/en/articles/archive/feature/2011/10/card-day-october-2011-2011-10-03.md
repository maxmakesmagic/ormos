![Sakashima the Impostor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Sakashima+the+Impostor)**[Sakashima the Impostor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sakashima+the+Impostor)** – *Saviors of Kamigawa* rare. Kamigawa block was all about legends, both in the sense of "cards that can have only copy in play at a time" and "stories that have achieved mythic status." So in the run-up to the prereleases, the website told the legends behind the Legends. Here's [Sakashima the Impostor's story](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/TCG/Article.aspx?x=magic/sok/sakashima).
 ![129719](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&multiverseid=129719)**[Sea Monster](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=129719)** – *Tenth Edition* common. The *Tenth Edition* version of [Sea Monster](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sea+Monster) is one of the few cards to explicitly declare how heavy it is. So now that you know that a 6/6 Serpent is three hundred thousand pounds and that [getting +4/+4](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=getting+%2B4%2F%2B4) requires 100 pounds, you should be able to triangulate the sizes of other cards, right?
 ![117](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&multiverseid=117)**[Phantom Monster](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=117)** – *Limited Edition Alpha* uncommon. When **Magic** started, flavor text was a mix of original material and (as on [Phantom Monster](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=117)) literary quotes. There are still quotes from the real world, but they appear only in core sets. For example, the ***Magic** 2012* card [Taste of Blood](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Taste+of+Blood) quotes Bram Stoker's *Dracula*.
 ![45411](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&multiverseid=45411)**[Moss Monster](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=45411)** – *Eighth Edition* common. *Eighth Edition* marked the tenth anniversary of **Magic: The Gathering** and it included at least one previously unreprinted card from each previous set. For *Legends*, that selection was difficult, because all the really sensible cards had already been reprinted. And that's why a ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227130050im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless3.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20220123123600im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/green.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20220123123600im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/green.gif) 3/6 got the call!
 ![Frankenstein's Monster](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Frankenstein%27s+Monster)**[Frankenstein's Monster](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Frankenstein%27s+Monster)** – *The Dark* rare. There's no real explanation for why there's a **Magic** card for [Frankenstein's Monster](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Frankenstein%27s+Monster) aside from "They did things differently in the early days of **Magic**."
 ![9780](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&multiverseid=9780)**[B.F.M. (Big Furry Monster)](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=9780)** – *Unglued* rare. The [left side of B.F.M.](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=9780) has an 11/11 [Polar Kraken](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Polar+Kraken) dangling from its horn. The [right side](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=9844) has a 12/12 [Phyrexian Dreadnought](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phyrexian+Dreadnought). At the time, those were the two biggest creatures available; it would be a few years before *Onslaught* would feature the 13/13 [Krosan Cloudscraper](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Krosan+Cloudscraper).
 ![10742](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&multiverseid=10742)**[Lord of the Undead](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=10742)** – *Planeshift* rare. When [Lord of the Undead](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=10742) was printed, its only creature type was "Lord" and it gave all Zombies +1/+1. Since then, it's been changed to being a Zombie itself, so now it gives "other Zombies" +1/+1. But if you have *two* [Lords of the Undead](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lords+of+the+Undead) on the battlefield, they will quite happily give each other the bonus.
 ![244253](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&multiverseid=244253)**[Sengir Vampire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=244253)** – ***Magic** 2012* uncommon. Here's a rules question from the early days of **Magic**. If you have a [Sengir Vampire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sengir+Vampire) with first strike (the original question used [Lance](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lance), but let's update that to [Sharpened Pitchfork](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sharpened+Pitchfork)), how many [Scryb Sprites](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scryb+Sprites) would you have to block it with in order to kill it? Click here for the answer.
 Twelve! The [Sengir Vampire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sengir+Vampire) kills the first four with first strike, gets four +1/+1 counters, then the other eight 1/1 creatures kill it.


![1750](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&multiverseid=1750)**[Drowned](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=1750)** – *The Dark* common. *Innistrad's* blue Zombies aren't new to **Magic**. Even if you don't count [Mistform Ultimus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mistform+Ultimus) and the [blue Changelings](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?action=advanced&name=+%5Bchangeling%5D&color=+%5BU%5D), there's always the strangely-named [Drowned](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=1750) from *The Dark*.
 ![Abattoir Ghoul](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Abattoir+Ghoul)**[Abattoir Ghoul](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Abattoir+Ghoul)** – *Innistrad* uncommon. Most ghouls just shuffle around mindlessly, eating whatever human flesh they run across. However, the [Abattoir Ghoul](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Abattoir+Ghoul) has kept his job at the slaughterhouse, presumably because he's already surrounded by flesh, obviating the need for all that shuffling.
 ![Geist of Saint Traft](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Geist+of+Saint+Traft)**[Geist of Saint Traft](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Geist+of+Saint+Traft)** – *Innistrad* mythic rare. Although Traft died long ago, his geist still appears around Innistrad and fights demonkind. To learn more about him, consult [this article by Doug Beyer](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/stf/160).
 ![Liliana of the Veil](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Liliana+of+the+Veil)**[Liliana of the Veil](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Liliana+of+the+Veil)** – *Innistrad* mythic rare. The Planeswalker Liliana Vess, the ambitious death-mage, has come to Innistrad seeking a demon. She believes that if she can slay it, she'll be one step closer to being free of an infernal bargain and reclaiming her precious soul. Though her purpose here is self-serving, her mission will drive her straight into the heart of Innistrad's mysteries.
 ![Ghoulcaller's Chant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Ghoulcaller%27s+Chant)**[Ghoulcaller's Chant](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ghoulcaller%27s+Chant)** – *Innistrad* common. The necromantically animated corpses of the dead, called "ghouls" or "the unhallowed," shuffle mindlessly in massive hordes, seeking to devour the flesh of the living. The twisted necromancers who raise them are called ghoulcallers, and they crave the power and destruction brought be their shambling minions.
 ![Night Revelers](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Night+Revelers)**[Night Revelers](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Night+Revelers)** – *Innistrad* common. Aristocratic, richly cultured, and cruelly hedonistic, vampires comprise Innistrad's only nonhuman civilization. The four major vampire bloodlines, like noble families, control manor houses, courts, and castles. Distributed across the plane, but concentrated in the province of Stensia, vampires hunt humans for the sustenance they require and the thrill they crave: the blood of the living.
 ![Skaab Goliath](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Skaab+Goliath)**[Skaab Goliath](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skaab+Goliath)** – *Innistrad* uncommon. Some alchemists of questionable sanity create undead by suturing together the mongrel flesh of several cadavers and breathing into them a semblance of alchemical life. These stitched abominations, called skaabs, often inspire [mobs of torch-bearing villagers](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=mobs+of+torch-bearing+villagers) to purge their towns of the unnatural beings—and their creators.
 ![Geistcatcher's Rig](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Geistcatcher%27s+Rig)**[Geistcatcher's Rig](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Geistcatcher%27s+Rig)** – *Innistrad* uncommon. The incorporeal spirits of the dead, called geists, take many forms. They can be harmless, even protective spirits who haunt the living out of a sense of duty, fealty, responsibility, or love. Or they can be specters of revenge and cruelty, appeased only by mortal offerings.
 ![Back from the Brink](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Back+from+the+Brink)**[Back from the Brink](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Back+from+the+Brink)** – *Innistrad* rare. From the [*Innistrad* FAQ](/en/articles/archive/innistrad-frequently-asked-questions-2011-09-16): *Although you're paying the card's mana cost, you aren't casting that card. Abilities that reduce the cost to cast a creature spell won't apply, and additional costs to cast that creature can't be paid.*
![Creepy Doll](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Creepy+Doll)**[Creepy Doll](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Creepy+Doll)** – *Innistrad* rare. From the [*Innistrad* FAQ](/en/articles/archive/innistrad-frequently-asked-questions-2011-09-16): *If the combat damage Creepy Doll deals to a creature is lethal, you'll still flip a coin. If the creature is still on the battlefield (perhaps because it regenerated), it could be destroyed a second time, depending on the coin flip.*
![Ludevic's Test Subject](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Ludevic%27s+Test+Subject)**[Ludevic's Test Subject](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ludevic%27s+Test+Subject)** – *Innistrad* rare. From the [*Innistrad* FAQ](/en/articles/archive/innistrad-frequently-asked-questions-2011-09-16): *It's possible (though not advisable) to activate the ability of [Ludevic's Test Subject](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ludevic%27s+Test+Subject) enough times in response to one another that a resolving ability places a fifth hatchling counter on [Ludevic's **Abomination**](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ludevic%27s+Abomination). If that happens, it'll transform back into [Ludevic's Test Subject](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ludevic%27s+Test+Subject).*
![Sever the Bloodline](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Sever+the+Bloodline)**[Sever the Bloodline](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sever+the+Bloodline)** – *Innistrad* rare. From the [*Innistrad* FAQ](/en/articles/archive/innistrad-frequently-asked-questions-2011-09-16): *A double-faced creature only has the name of the face that's up. For example, if Village Ironsmith is targeted by Sever the Bloodline, Ironfang wouldn't be exiled.*
![Angelic Overseer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Angelic+Overseer)**[Angelic Overseer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Angelic+Overseer)** – *Innistrad* mythic rare. From the [*Innistrad* FAQ](/en/articles/archive/innistrad-frequently-asked-questions-2011-09-16): *If you control a Human, and lethal damage is dealt to *Angelic Overseer*, that damage will remain marked on it that turn. If later in the turn you no longer control a Human, *Angelic Overseer* will be destroyed.*
