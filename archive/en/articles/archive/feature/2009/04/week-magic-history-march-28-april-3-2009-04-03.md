"Mono Artifact" and "Poly Artifact" were gone, and the first core set rotation was in effect: 35 cards from *Unlimited* were removed, ranging from [Black Lotus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Black+Lotus) to [Invisibility](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Invisibility).
