It's been almost two months since we started playing the *Battle for Zendikar* draft format. The nuanced, synergy structure of the format has made some cards wildly change in relative power level, even though there's been no printing change.


What cards in BFZ draft have changed the most in your experience?

Ingest is *much* more critical that I thought [when I first saw the set]. And it's good on turn one, and it's pretty good on turn eight.

Sure you have the times when you get Castigator, [Shadow Glider](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shadow+Glider), *and* something else, but too often you're just like “Ok, six mana, kill your [Kozilek's Sentinel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kozilek%27s+Sentinel).” There's so much toughness in this format, [Rolling Thunder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rolling+Thunder) is not quite what it used to be.


Also, [Boiling Earth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Boiling+Earth) kind of fills in some of its space ... that card has gone way up for me. I used to be, “I definitely want this card in my sideboard;” now I'm like, “I definitely want this card in my main deck.”

I always liked it; now I like it more. Synergy decks were good for a while, but now that everyone's fighting over different synergy decks, the standalone power cards have gone up.

It never tables anymore, and the White-Black Lifegain deck isn't that good without it. I don't like drafting it. I mean, I'm on the deck right now, but still...

I just don't draft a bunch of red decks that have a lot of red guys ... The card's still removal, it's just not a first pick.

I was thinking it's just a [Trumpet Blast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Trumpet+Blast), but it can be much more. When you want that card for your deck you *really* want it. The [Swarm Surge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swarm+Surge) deck can be very powerful.
