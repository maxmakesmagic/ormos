While [Nissa, Vital Force](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nissa%2C+Vital+Force) has yet to make a great impact on the Standard metagame, she did show up at the tables in form of Swiss cosplayer Nadine Grendelmeier. Who has surprised her opponents both by casting [Consulate Skygate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Consulate+Skygate) from her Green-White Delirium deck and by wearing full cosplay suit, complete with a giant staff and contact lenses for a striking resemblance to the Green Planeswalker.

"It's fun to see people's reactions, as most don't expect to play against a cosplayer at a Grand Prix and even less so in the main event with a 4-1 record," said Grendelmeier after her Round 6 match.


It turns out she was piloting a deck that she's designed with Dane Simon Nielsen, who might not be a cosplayer, but at least wears a funny tie to brighten up the mood of his opponent. An approach he shares with Nadine Grendelmeier, who got into cosplaying after picking up *Magic* a few years ago.

"I started playing around the time when Khans of Tarkir was released, and I've been cosplaying since Origins. This is my fifth Grand Prix wearing cosplay, and although it is a bit warm, and I have to get up at six in the morning to get my costume and make-up ready, but it's all worth it when I get to see the nice reactions at the tournament."


And she isn't exaggerating. During our 10 minute interview she's approached by several players who wants to get their picture taken with their favorite Green Planeswalker. Something Grendelmeier has gotten used to ever since she started making her first costume, which all started with her brother opening a pack of *Magic Origins*.

"I remember that my brother opened a Nissa Worldwaker, which really got me into it. I started making my first costume, and found out that there was a convention with a competition for cosplayers in Switzerland that I ended up going to and even winning. I even carved my own staff which I think is what impressed the judges," she says with a smile.


When asked about exciting matches during the rounds she's played so far, Grendelmeier quickly exclaimed that they've all been as exciting, and that cards like [Consulate Skygate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Consulate+Skygate), [Gisela, the Broken Blade](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gisela%2C+the+Broken+Blade) and [Emrakul, the Promised End](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Emrakul%2C+the+Promised+End) has carried her way to victory.

"So far the deck has been good. And I need just a few more wins to make it to Day Two, although if I do I might come as Liliana tomorrow, that doesn't take as long time to do make-up in the morning" she said.


Whereas it's her opponents getting shocked, or her co-conspirator behind the Green-White deck Simon Nielsen who gets to share the decks success Nadine Grendelmeier and her pitch perfect cosplay along with an interesting deck is already an exciting story from Warsaw. Don't be surprised to see her at more European Grand Prix dressed up as one of your favorite Planeswalker or staring you down from the other side of the table.
