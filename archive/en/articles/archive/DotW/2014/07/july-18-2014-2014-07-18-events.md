Last week was highlighted less by the 2013–2014 premier play season and more by the unveiling of [The Chain Veil](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=The+Chain+Veil); [Garruk, Apex Predator](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Garruk%2C+Apex+Predator); and many other amazing cards to come out of *Magic 2015*. The new set's Prereleases took place last weekend, giving Pro Tour Qualifier competitors and Grand Prix globetrotters a week off to play with some new cards.



However, this weekend, the Pro Tour Qualifier season gets right back into its routine. Some new decklists have come in from this season's PTQs. Take a look at what's been winning at PTQs across the globe, prepare your Modern deck, and then find a Pro Tour Qualifier near you. 


And while *Magic 2015* packs were being opened in game stores last weekend, *Magic Online* was in full swing as always, with a plethora of formats spread across a week of Daily Events and Premier Events firing through the week, giving you access to seven days of delectable deck data.
