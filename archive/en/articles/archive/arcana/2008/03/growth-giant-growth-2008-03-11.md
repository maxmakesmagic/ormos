Back in *Alpha*, [Giant Growth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Giant+Growth) was simple: See this rat? It's enormous! Look at those tiny bones next to it!

![Giant Growth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Giant+Growth)Things stayed that way until *Ice Age*, when the spotlight was taken by a dragonfly:

![Giant Growth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Giant+Growth)That wasn't entirely satisfactory, because there wasn't anything to provide scale. Sure, the dragonfly *might* be huge, but it also might be . . . the size of a dragonfly. For *Fifth Edition*, the creature of choice was once more a rat:

![Giant Growth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Giant+Growth)This time, the rat isn't just lurking in the sewers; it's out there menacing small dragony-looking things.

In *Seventh Edition*, the small creatures took a back seat to a good old-fashioned ENORMOUS HUMAN WARRIOR. This time, the art actually showed the moment of transformation, with the puny human (in front) turning into the big one.

![Giant Growth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Giant+Growth)For *Eighth Edition*, the old *Fifth Edition* rat came back in the old *Fifth Edition* art. But he was soon replaced (again) in *Ninth Edition* by what looks like some kind of barbarian out in the sandy wastes:

![Giant Growth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Giant+Growth)Possibly the most popular version arrived in 2006 as a textless Magic Player Rewards card:

**June 7, 2006****Q**: On the textless [Giant Growth](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=magic/images/mtgcom/fcpics/features/327_textlessGG.jpg), what is the giant creature? Is it a gorgon, a dryad, or something else all together?  
 --Richard


**A**: From **Brady Dommermuth**, **Magic** Creative Director:


It is, in fact, a gorgon, Richard. It's a **Magic** gorgon, though, meaning it has strange, motile, segmented-cable hair, rather than actual snakes like the Medusa of Greek mythology.


  
Finally (for now) the *Tenth Edition* [Giant Growth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Giant+Growth) shows a wee [Grizzly Bears](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Grizzly%2BBears) turning into a massive force to be reckoned with.
