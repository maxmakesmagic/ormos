The Daily *Magic* Update is a roundup of everything *Magic* you should know on May 11, 2017. Today's Update is brought to you by Pro Tour *Amonkhet*! Starting tomorrow at, well, I'm stealing the thunder of the first item. Read on.


What To Watch This Weekend
==========================


1. [Pro Tour *Amonkhet*](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/ptakh) | [twitch.tv/magic](https://www.twitch.tv/magic) | 9 a.m. local time (CT)/7 a.m. PT/10 a.m. ET/2 p.m. UTC

It's almost here! Will we see new strategies? Updated versions of known ones? What kind of drafts will dominate? Will anyone open an *Invocation* on camera? Who would win in a pun-off, Luis Scott-Vargas or Rich Hagon? How many glories will be brought? And, most importantly, who will win it all?


You know what to do. I know I'll be watching during work tomorrow. I just won't have to be discrete about it.


Today's Must
============


1. [Against the Odds: New Perspectives Combo (Standard)](https://www.mtggoldfish.com/articles/against-the-odds-new-perspectives-combo-standard?src=wizards) | MTGGoldfish | SaffronOlive

Is this the [break pros are talking about below](#7)? It's not often Seth (probably better known as SaffonOlive) goes 5-0 in matches, let along 10-0 in games with an Against the Odds deck. It's often the opposite of that. But I've been toying around with this one online as well, and it seems to have some real chops. Whether that can translate to a larger stage, well, isn't it intriguing that it's actually a possibility?


After That, Read, Watch, or Listen to These
===========================================


1. [Get To Know Players On The '*Magic: The Gathering*' Pro Tour](https://www.forbes.com/sites/laurenorsini/2017/05/10/get-to-know-players-on-the-magic-the-gathering-pro-tour/#75635daf49d4) | Forbes | Lauren Orsini

Owen Turtenwald and Ben Rubin answer a bunch of questions about Pro Tour *Amonkhet* and being on teams PuzzleQuest and D3 Go! Like, a lot of questions. So if you wondered it and it's about Pro Tour competition, it's probably in there.


1. The Most Overrated and Underrated Cards in *Amonkhet* Draft | ChannelFireball | Luis Scott-Vargas

We're probably going to see all of these on camera at some point this weekend, maybe even with LSV commenting while they're out there. Find out what he really thinks of the [10 most overrated cards](https://www.channelfireball.com/articles/the-10-most-overrated-cards-in-amonkhet-draft/) and the [7 most underrated cards](https://www.channelfireball.com/articles/the-7-most-underrated-cards-in-amonkhet-draft/). Then hold it over him when something goes the other way at the Pro Tour.


1. [Gideon Jura: Seeing and Believing](http://www.gatheringmagic.com/samkeeper-05112017-gideon-jura-seeing-and-believing/) | Gathering Magic | Sam Keeper

[Gideon Jura](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gideon+Jura) is tall, indestructible, beefy—and constantly getting into trouble. Keeper dives into the story to figure out why Beefslab keeps tripping over himself.


1. [Designing *Amonkhet* with Ethan Fleischer pt 2 – Commanderin' MTG Podcast](http://www.commanderinmtg.com/2017/05/11/e093-designing-amonkhet-with-ethan-fleischer-pt-2-commanderin-mtg-podcast.html) | Commanderin' | Phil DeLuca and Sean Whatson

In which we finally get to the end of the Ethan Fleischer design podcast with the Commanderin' crew. Fleischer was the set's lead designer. Commanderin' is a Commander podcast. *Amonkhet* is the latest set in stores now. Those are all the facts you need to know before slipping on your headphones and listening.


What People Are Talking About
=============================


1. > 
> Broke standard at the last possible moment, at great expense
> 
> 
>  — Paul Rietzl (@paulrietzl) [May 11, 2017](https://twitter.com/paulrietzl/status/862518369391706113)

With the Pro Tour starting tomorrow, teams are settling in on their decks, and a few players seem pretty optimistic. Heck, Brad Nelson says [he broke Standard in half](https://twitter.com/fffreakmtg/status/861406770341847040). Guess we'll find out tomorrow who actually broke it, or if anyone even did.


1. [Hi r/MagicTCG! I work for WotC and we're sending 2 teams to play board games for charity on 5/21. Your donations would help people in need and give us power ups.](https://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/6ag9pq/hi_rmagictcg_i_work_for_wotc_and_were_sending_2/)

Want to earn cool prizes and help out a good cause? A bunch of Wizards are playing in The Gauntlet at Mox Boarding House in a charity board game tournament benefitting a local Seattle youth charity. Click above to learn how to donate and what those donations can earn you!


But come on. Giving is its own reward and all that.


1. [Apparently the sun has been moving in the header above the most recent *Magic* Story articles. Looks like we're getting close now...](https://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/6aieky/apparently_the_sun_has_been_moving_in_the_header/)

May his return come quickly and may we be found worthy.


Also, for those wondering about the *Magic* Story schedule coming up, here's what we've got:


May 17—Final *Amonkhet* story


May 24—*Magic* Story Podcast episode with Alison Luhrs and Kelly Digges answering fan questions


May 31—Commander story featuring a familiar character


June 7—First *Hour of Devastation* story


Deck of the Day
===============


1. [Try Hard Humans (White-Red Humans)](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/mtgo-standings/competitive-standard-constructed-league-2017-05-10)

Ah, [Bloodlust Inciter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodlust+Inciter)—somehow the most controversial card in *Amonkhet* Limited has made its way to Standard at the hands of BigBoss5150 on *Magic Online*.


Hm. Big "Boss." White-Red Humans, a style Tom "The Boss" Ross is known for. Probably nothing.


But the deck certainly isn't nothing. It's a bit innovative for the White-Red Humans archetype in a few ways. First, it pushes hard on [Always Watching](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Always+Watching), with exert creatures going up to [Devoted Crop-Mate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Devoted+Crop-Mate) as well as [Town Gossipmonger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Town+Gossipmonger) having its longstanding synergy with the enchantment.


Second is that [Bloodlust Inciter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodlust+Inciter), who happens to be a Human, and two copies of [Hazoret the Fervent](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hazoret+the+Fervent) to provide some reach the deck was often missing.


I also like the use of [Declaration in Stone](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Declaration+in+Stone) as the removal spell of choice. It's always been better in Humans, who are often fast enough not to care about the clue, but also because there are a ton of Ulamogs running around right now that need to be turned into stone.


Someone, somewhere will bring a deck similar to this to the Pro Tour tomorrow. Will [Bloodlust Inciter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodlust+Inciter) be the key? I hope so, if only to listen to the commenters blow a gasket.
