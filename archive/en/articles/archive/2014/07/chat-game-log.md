Ryan Spain has been a digital designer in R&D since 2011. He is involved in all things Magic Online, from new card sets to the new client and everything in between. He likely has more lifetime hours played on Magic Online than anyone at Wizards. 






Let’s take a quick look at chatting with other players in the new client.

To chat with a buddy, you can right-click on a buddy name and select “Private Chat” from the menu.


You can find a list of your online buddies in the Home tab, in the Account tab under “Buddies, Clans, and Chat,” and in the “Buddies” submenu of the Chat option in the upper-right of the main window. A green circle next to a buddy means that user is online, and a red line means the user is offline.

You can also use the Chat drop down to join chat Rooms, chat with Support, and open your Clan chat. The “Join/New Chat Session” option in this menu allows you to find specific users or create your own chat room.

Chats open in their own windows to allow moving them to a second monitor if desired, but each can be docked to the main window. Just drag the chat to one of the dock icons on any edge of the window. The dock icons appear automatically when you begin dragging a chat window.

In games, the chat and game log are tied together. The chat and game log can be docked, just like normal user chat. If you dock your chat, the client will place chat where you had it at the end of your last game when you start a new one.


If you close your game log and chat and want to get it back, just click on the chat icon in the lower-right of your game screen:

You can see the complete list of everyone in your chat or watching your game by clicking on the “person” icon in the upper-right of your chat or game log:

Finally, you can control certain aspects of chat’s functionality in *Magic Online* in the Account tab under “Buddies, Clan, and Chat.”

Right-clicking on these options will bring up a tooltip explaining their function:

Happy chatting!
