If you haven't heard, we're running a feature called "You Make The Card," in which our readers get to vote on all the aspects of a card that will appear in a real expansion set in 2002.


Voting for the card's color has been going on for a week now, and the results may surprise you. As of Tuesday afternoon, blue had a slim lead over green! The totals (in order):




|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  | Blue | 1949 |
|  | Green | 1920 |
|  | Black | 1486 |
|  | White | 1433 |
|  | Red | 1428 |
|  | Total | 8216 |

Voting will run through midnight Sunday night. If you haven't voted yet, do so by clicking the You Make The Card icon at the bottom of our [front page](http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=mtgcom/welcome). Tell your friends to vote as well! Or, [discuss it on our boards](http://boards.wizards.com/tcg-bin/ultimatebb.cgi?ubb=get_topic&amp;f=28&amp;t=007370&amp;p=)! Will blue win, or can green edge it out? Or will one of the other three colors make a late run? Find out next Wednesday right here on MagicTheGathering.com!
