Here is the answer to yesterday's [**Magic**: The Puzzling](http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=mtgcom/arcana/196).


1. Tap all four of your lands for ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161115194122im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/blue.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161115194122im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/blue.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227130159im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/red.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227130159im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/red.gif).
2. Cast [merfolk of the pearl trident](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=merfolk%2Bof%2Bthe%2Bpearl%2Btrident). Your [keldon warlord](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=keldon%2Bwarlord) is now 6/6.
3. Cast [flight](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=flight) on [keldon warlord](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=keldon%2Bwarlord), and use a red mana to activate [crystal rod](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=crystal%2Brod). You are now at 4 life, and the only creature that can stop the Warlord is the 6/5 [sengir vampire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=sengir%2Bvampire).
4. Cast [lightning bolt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=lightning%2Bbolt) on the Vampire, and then activate your [orcish artillery](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=orcish%2Bartillery) on it to kill it. You take three damage, but are still alive at 1 life.
5. Attack with the 6/6 flying [keldon warlord](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=keldon%2Bwarlord). That'll do it!
