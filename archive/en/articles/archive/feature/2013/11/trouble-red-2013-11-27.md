Luis Scott-Vargas plays, writes, and makes videos about Magic. He has played on the Pro Tour for almost a decade, and between that and producing content for ChannelFireball, often has his hands full (of cards). 







Once again, I find myself drawn to Owen's aggressive monocolor lists (although this one does have a splash of a splash). I find it very interesting just how many distinct-feeling mono-red decks can be build in this Standard environment, and I imagine that most people would be surprised at the amount of depth here. I wrote about [Tom Ross's Akroan Crusader Heroic](/en/articles/archive/heroic-red-2013-11-11) deck, and Team CFB tested one for [Pro Tour *Theros*](http://www.channelfireball.com/articles/owens-a-win-trouble-with-standard/), but [the deck Owen's been working on](http://www.channelfireball.com/articles/owens-a-win-trouble-with-standard/) is remarkably different from either. 

![Toil // Trouble](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Toil+%2F%2F+Trouble) It is closer to the "standard" Standard list, with an aggressive curve of early drops backed up by burn spells, a strategy mono-red has employed for more than fifteen years, but a few choices make it noteworthy. First of all, Owen departed from the normal lineup of creatures, choosing to include not only four [Foundry Street Denizen](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Foundry+Street+Denizen)s, but cutting two [Ash Zealot](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ash+Zealot)s, which most people seem to regard as a staple of the archetype. Owen is more interested in maximizing the deck's best draws, most of which involve three or more one-drops and [Burning-Tree Emissary](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Burning-Tree+Emissary), which is why he chose such a low curve of creatures. In fact, [Fanatic of Mogis](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fanatic+of+Mogis) and [Boros Reckoner](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Boros+Reckoner) even live in the sideboard, showing exactly how dedicated Owen is to focusing on one- and two-cost creatures. 

 The other big change Owen credits to Pascal Maynard (who I've had some good matches against on the Pro Tour). [Toil & Trouble](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Toil+%26+Trouble) is a rarely played addition, and explains the [Blood Crypt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Crypt)s in the main deck and sideboard. Even though it's just a sideboard card, [Toil](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Toil) (plus the rest of the sideboard) dramatically changes how the deck plays in the matchups where these cards come in. [As Owen explains in his article](http://www.channelfireball.com/articles/owens-a-win-trouble-with-standard/), [Toil](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Toil) is exactly the kind of burn spell this deck wants post-board, and vastly outpaces [Skullcrack](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skullcrack) when it comes to effectiveness. Instead of sitting around and waiting for opponents to cast [Sphinx's Revelation](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sphinx%27s+Revelation), just get them into Trouble on turn three and enjoy the massive amounts of damage. It's especially funny that a [Revelation](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Revelation) in response does nothing to change how much life an opponent ends up at, assuming the Trouble is lethal to begin with (which isn't much of a stretch). Besides [Toil & Trouble](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Toil+%26+Trouble), [Boros Reckoner](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Boros+Reckoner) and [Fanatic of Mogis](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fanatic+of+Mogis) support the go-big sideboard plan, a type of plan which is often very effective. As control decks board in removal spells, you get to board in massive burn spells, which definitely gives you the edge.
