There are several ways to earn an invitation to a Pro Tour. Invitations are awarded in the following manner:


* The winner of each Pro Tour Qualifier (including each **Magic Online**  Pro Tour Qualifier) that awards invitations to the appropriate Pro Tour.
* The Top 4 finishing players, or Top 2 teams, from each Grand Prix that awards invitations to the appropriate Pro Tour. If the Grand Prix attendance is 1,200 or more, invitations will be given to the Top 8 players or Top 4 teams.
* The Top 25 finishing players from the immediately preceding Pro Tour.
* Players from a Top 4 finishing national team from the World **Magic**  Cup (only for the first Pro Tour immediately following the World **Magic**  Cup.)
* Players with a Pro Tour Players Club Gold or Platinum level. Gold level members do not receive their invitations to a specific Pro Tour until the Thursday prior to that Pro Tour.
* Players that are members of the Pro Tour Hall of Fame. Hall of Fame members do not receive their invitations to a specific Pro Tour until the Thursday prior to that Pro Tour.

(Note: the Pro Tour invitation criteria listed do not generate a pass down of invitations to other players.)


For more information about the Pro Tour and other **Magic** tournaments, consult the [Premier Event Invitation Policy](http://www.wizards.com/wpn/Events/Rules.aspx) in the WPN Rules and Documents page.
