The Daily *Magic* Update is a roundup of everything *Magic* you should know on February 4, 2016. Today's Update is brought to you by, well...


So There's This Pro Tour Thing Happening
========================================


1. [Pro Tour *Oath of the Gatewatch*](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/ptogw)

Get hyped! Pro Tour *Oath of the Gatewatch*, featuring Modern and *Oath of the Gatewatch* drafting, starts tomorrow! Live coverage starts at 9 a.m. EST (6 a.m. PST/2 p.m. UTC) on [twitch.tv/magic](http://www.twitch.tv/magic). You can also find all avenues to coverage—video and text—on the [coverage hub page.](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/ptogw) We're really excited for this one, so we've already got articles on there about prepping for the Pro Tour—including early looks at some teams to watch, interviews with grinders making their way to the tour, and a full preview from Rich Hagon. What more could you want?


Oh? Wall-to-wall video coverage? [We'll have that too](http://www.twitch.tv/magic). And if you want to hold a viewing party for the Pro Tour? Well, check out [item 7 below](#video).


Not Everything Has to Be About the Pro Tour
===========================================


1. [Against the Odds: Hedron Alignment](http://www.mtggoldfish.com/articles/against-the-odds-hedron-alignment) | MTGoldfish | Saffron Olive

Challenge accepted! Saffron Olive goes—ahem—against the odds to try to assemble the [Hedron Alignment](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hedron+Alignment) win *in Standard*. While everyone else was looking at Legacy, Saffron went on hard mode. [Taigam's Scheming](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Taigam%27s+Scheming) indeed.


1. [*Magic: The Gathering* Office Hours—Liliana Vess](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0UNCOMN9gc&feature=youtu.be) | Tolarian Community College | The Professor

She really does keep forgetting to bring a pencil.


Wait, do people still use pencils?

After That, More Pro Tour Content!
==================================


1. [The Next Broken Modern Combo](http://magic.tcgplayer.com/db/article.asp?ID=13105&writer=Adam+Yurchick&articledate=2-4-2016) | TCGPlayer | Adam Yurchick

No, Yurchick hasn't broken it. But he does go over the bevy of combo options available in Modern in the wake of [Splinter Twin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Splinter+Twin) and [Summer Bloom](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Summer+Bloom) getting the axe. Will any of these break out this weekend? The only way to know is to read on.


1. [Channel Cheon—*Oath of the Gatewatch* Draft](http://www.channelfireball.com/videos/channel-cheon-oath-of-the-gatewatch-draft/) | ChannelFireball | Paul Cheon

Get ready for the Pro Tour with some hot, hot Paul (Paul!) drafting action. Cheon's drafting *Oath of the Gatewatch* ahead of this weekend in his typically entertaining fashion, and doing so with aplomb. Aplomb, I say!


If you'd rather get hyped for Modern, Pascal Maynard shares some of his testing, [also on ChannelFireball](http://www.channelfireball.com/videos/channel-pmayne-modern-abzan/), with a Modern take on Abzan. Will Pascal play this at the Pro Tour? Maybe. Maybe not. Find out tomorrow!


1. [My Journey to the Pro Tour](http://manadeprived.com/journey-pro-tour/) | Mana Deprived | Robert Stan

Newly qualified for the Pro Tour, Robert Stan walks through his testing process, from the highs of his initial qualification to the shock of the [Splinter Twin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Splinter+Twin) banning up to the deck he currently plans to play. With no team or testing partners, coming in from the wild world of *Magic Online*, can Stan make a run at the Pro Tour? And will having two first names cause problems for our coverage team if he does make a run? Tune in tomorrow to find out!


What People Are Talking About

I think the answer is that you lose a lot of street cred when you have to be saved by Sarkhan Vol.


Also, Andrew Weisel happens to also have a blog about *Magic*. Now, you could get there by clicking on his Twitter handle and following the link posted on his profile—[or I could just link to it here](http://sarpadianempiresvol-viii.tumblr.com/). Isn't that easier? Also, the [Reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/4422qb/bad_draws_nobody_listens_to_ugin_by_andrew_weisel/) on this comic is pretty amusing, including references to Ugin, the Tech Support Dragon.

This is something that often gets lost for a lot of us. When we first met *Magic* (for me it was actually 20 years ago, because I'm old), we experienced it in a certain way that, later on, seems really foreign. Which is weird, because, above all, *Magic* should be fun. We try to capture as much of that here as we can, but it's easy to lose sight of that. But there are few joys more pure than your first deck, with all of the sweet cards you haven't learned "aren't good enough" yet. Mine had [Skeleton Ship](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skeleton+Ship), which was the best card in the world at the time. These days, it's only really surpassed by [Mulldrifter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mulldrifter). But you never forget your first.


Deck of the Day
===============


1. It Bogles the Mind

Very quietly, Bogles is seeing something of a resurgence online. The deck that seeks to do that one thing we were told never to do—slap a bunch of enchantments on a single creature—has been a mainstay of the Modern format for years, but has definitely seen an uptick now that the mainly sorcery-speed deck doesn't have to battle Splinter Twin (which didn't care about pretty much anything Bogles did) or Amulet Bloom (ditto).


For the uninitiated, Boggles drops one of its typically hexproof one-drops (like the deck's namesake, [Slippery Bogle](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Slippery+Bogle)), and then loads it up with cheap, hard-hitting enchantments, the granddaddy of them all being [Daybreak Coronet](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Daybreak+Coronet). [Path to Exile](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Path+to+Exile) is about the deck's only way to interact before the sideboard, but if you've ever wanted to attack with an 11/11 lifelink, trampling Bogle that draws you a card when it deals damage, this is definitely the deck for you.
