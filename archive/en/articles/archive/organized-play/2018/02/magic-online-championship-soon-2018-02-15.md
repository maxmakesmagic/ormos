Tune in to [twitch.tv/magic](https://www.twitch.tv/magic) to watch all the action live! Coverage of the *Magic Online* Championship begins March 2–4, 2018, at 10 a.m. PT/1 p.m. ET/6 p.m. UTC.


This year's *Magic Online* Championship is coming! The biggest event of the year for *Magic Online* takes place March 2–4, 2018, and will be hosted at Wizards of the Coast headquarters in Renton, Washington. The tournament will feature three days of Modern Constructed and Booster Draft action, 24 competitors, and a total of $200,000 being awarded, with $40,000 going to the winner!


Keep reading to learn a little bit about what to expect from the tournament and its coverage, and then meet the event's 24 competitors.


The Tournament and the Coverage
===============================


Here are the basics you need to know about the *Magic Online* Championship:


* The tournament features 24 players who qualified through either *Magic Online* Championship Series playoff events or *Magic Online* Championship Series Open events on *Magic Online*, or through the *Magic Online* Championship Series Leaderboard. The reigning *Magic Online* Champion joins these competitors to round out the field.
* The format for Friday and Saturday is three rounds of Booster Draft—using two packs of *Rivals of Ixalan* and one pack of *Ixalan*, in that order—followed by four rounds of Modern. All matches are best-two-out-of-three Swiss structure (so players may compete in as many rounds as they wish to on both days), and the field will cut to a Top 4 for Sunday.
* Sunday playoffs are single-elimination and feature best-two-out-of-three matches with players using their Modern Constructed deck from the previous two days. Needless to say, if you like watching games of Modern, Sunday's got you covered!
* The winner receives $40,000 and will gain Platinum Pro Club benefits for the remainder of the *Rivals of Ixalan* cycle, and then the next four cycles of the Pro Club following that.

You'll be able to watch all three days LIVE on [twitch.tv/magic](https://www.twitch.tv/magic). Coverage for this event is managed by Randy Buehler and Athena Froehlich, of [Vintage Super League](https://vintagesuperleague.com/) fame.


They will be joined by Marshall Sutcliffe, Paul Rietzl, Eric Froehlich, and Ben Seck for live remote commentary, as well as Maria Bartholdi, who will be the floor reporter.


Additionally, on Friday, March 2, *Magic* R&D's Play Design team will be doing guest commentary all day, featuring a rotating cast of Paul Cheon, Melissa DeTora, Donald Smith, Michael Majors, Dan Musser, Adam Prosak, and Tom Ross!
