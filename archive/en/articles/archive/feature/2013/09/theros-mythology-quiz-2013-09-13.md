Hello and welcome to another Arcana quiz! This quiz focuses on *Theros* and its top-down mythology influences. To do well on this quiz you should be up to date on the cards we've revealed from *Theros*, so be sure to visit [the card image gallery](http://www.wizards.com/magic/tcg/article.aspx?x=mtg/tcg/theros/cig#) and have some knowledge of ancient Greek and Roman mythology before you dive into this quiz. Good luck!
