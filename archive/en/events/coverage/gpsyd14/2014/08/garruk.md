 I was both excited, and a little intimidated, I admit, to sit down with Garruk, Apex Predator for an interview. I have heard rumors he's been out of sorts lately, perhaps a little surly. Probably because he's been hanging around Liliana a bit, I dunno. Also, in other news, people around here have been going missing and stuff, but I'm sure it's totally unrelated.



Ray "blisterguy" Walkinshaw: "Garruk, let me start by thanking you for agreeing to do this interview with me, it really means a lot."



 Garruk, Apex Predator: \*menacing silence\*



blisterguy: "Ok, um, so. Over the years, you've seen occasional success at the Pro Tour, how did that feel?"


Garruk: \*pulls out whetstone and begins to sharpen axe\*


blisterguy: "...ahh, ok. Um. You're a Planeswalker, uh, do you like to, uh, walk... planes... often?"


Garruk: \*repeated rasping of the axe head\*



 blisterguy: "Not even, not even a little...? Sure, that's cool. [Torture](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Torture)d artist, I get that. Um."



Garruk: \*low, barely audible rumbling in the back of the throat\*


blisterguy: "Oh I, err..."


Garruk: \*looks into the distance\*


blisterguy: "Is that time? Are we done? Well, I'd like to thank you again for..."


Garruk: "BIGGER GAME."


blisterguy: "S-s-sure, ok, uhh, t-t-thanks, I think?"





*No authors were harmed in the making of this interview. Yet.*
