The art for *Fifth Dawn's* artifact-destruction spell **[Granulate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Granulate)**, by Brian Snoddy, was originally a lot greener. The goblins in the art were losing their weapons to a green mold-like effect (see smaller image below), similar in concept to [Oxidize](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oxidize) or [Creeping Mold](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Creeping+Mold).

  
*Brian Snoddy's [Granulate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Granulate) gets a color touchup*

When the art was moved to the card that would become [Granulate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Granulate), the green-colored melting effect became inappropriate; the artifact-destruction effect in the art needed to change to red. So the image was re-colored to become the card you'll see in *Fifth Dawn* booster packs.
