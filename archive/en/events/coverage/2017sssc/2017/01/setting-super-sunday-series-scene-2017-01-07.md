For those that were unable to make it through to Day Two of 2016's Grand Prix, players had a shot at a second event with a sweet prize on the line. That event was the Super Sunday Series, which awarded winners of the event a flight and accommodations to Wizards of the Coast Headquarters in Renton, Washington to compete in a special invitation-only tournament with a $20,000 prize pool. Of course, the Super Sunday Series Championship—the big event that brings all of 2016's Super Sunday Series winners together under one roof—is more than just the tournament. Players who attend also get the chance to tour the Wizards of the Coast offices, are taken out for meals, and get to play *Magic* with Wizards staff.


This year is a bit more special as well, as the Super Sunday Series Championship competitors will also get to participate in a very special *Aether Revolt* Pre-Prerelease Sunday afternoon, as they are some of the few people who get to play with *Aether Revolt* before the official Prereleases!


Who's Here?
===========


In total, 45 players have traveled to Wizards of the Coast HQ to compete in this event and to take part in a weekend of fun.


One of those players is last year's champion, No. 21-ranked Samuel Black, who earned his invitation to this year's tournament thanks to his win in 2016.

*No. 21 Samuel Black, in the featured seat for his draft.*


But Black isn't the only previous winner here this weekend. Argentinian pro Luis Salvatto, winner of 2015's tournament, is back again this weekend thanks to winning the Super Sunday Series event that was hosted at Grand Prix Los Angeles back in May.


Andrea Mengucci, Italian pro and one of 2016's World Championship competitors, was also here this weekend thanks to his win at the Super Sunday Series event from Grand Prix Sydney.


All in all, the field here at the Super Sunday Series Championship represents a wide variety of skill sets, from seasoned globetrotters to local heroes. With trips out to dinner scheduled for both tonight and tomorrow, this I s an event where everyone will be hanging out for a weekend of *Magic* and excitement.

*This year's Super Sunday Series Championship competitors!*


Here is a look at the tournament and activity schedule, and what you'll see on <twitch.tv/magic> this weekend.


**Rounds 1-3: *Kaladesh* Booster Draft** 


The tournament kicks off with a *Kaladesh* Booster Draft, as players show off their Limited skills in the morning and early afternoon to see who emerges with an early lead.


**Rounds 4-7: Modern Constructed**


The first day will wrap up with four rounds of Modern Constructed, as the competitors bring their best Modern brews to battle.


**Top 8: *Eternal Masters* Booster Draft** 


After seven rounds, the tournament will cut to a Top 8, which plays in an *Eternal Masters* Booster Draft on Sunday to determine the Super Sunday Series champion.


Of course, there is one more major *Magic* activity for the weekend after the Top 8…


**Post-Tournament: *Aether Revolt* Pre-Prerelease** 


After a little lunch, players will be building 40-card Sealed pools from *Aether Revolt* Prerelease packs, and will play against each other in some casual league matches. They'll be broadcast on <twitch.tv/magic> so you'll have a chance to watch some of these *Aether Revolt* cards as they are being played!


It's sure to be a fun time for players here this weekend, so tune in to see who emerges at the top, and be sure to follow a long on social media for some of the excitement!
