Have you gotten your hands on any of the [Funko Pop! Planeswalkers](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/magazine/article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/arcana/1431) yet? If not, you really should consider it. If you need any sense of just how awesome and fun these things are, you can, for instance, check out the Tales from the Pit comics Mark Rosewater has been publishing on his [Tumblr](http://www.tumblr.com/tagged/tales-from-the-pit) since picking up his set.

But I'm actually not here to shill for the six adorable Planeswalkers you could have staring at you from your shelf, gaming table, or nightstand. I'm here to show off a special glow-in-the-dark [Hot Topic version of Chandra Nalaar](http://www.hottopic.com/hottopic/Magic+The+Gathering+Pop+Glow-In-The-Dark+Chandra+Nalaar+Vinyl+Figure-10187271.jsp)!

A picture can barely do it justice, especially since it looks so, so great in the dark. You can order this special Chandra Nalaar [online](http://www.hottopic.com/hottopic/Magic+The+Gathering+Pop+Glow-In-The-Dark+Chandra+Nalaar+Vinyl+Figure-10187271.jsp)  or find it at Hot Topic stores all over.
