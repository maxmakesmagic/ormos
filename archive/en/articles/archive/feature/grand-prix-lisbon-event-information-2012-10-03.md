However, the heart of Lisbon comes alive after midnight as it boasts a thriving night life. With a varied mix of restaurants, bars and clubs, Lisbon has something for everyone.


Pavilhão Atlântico is set in the heart of the Parque das Nações grounds and benefits from a privileged location. Car access is excellent thanks to its location in the vicinity of the confluence of major roadways serving the Eastern sector of Lisbon, such as the CRIL ring road, the Vasco da Gama Bridge over the Tagus, and the North-South Highway. In addition, it benefits from the proximity to major, modern public transport infrastructure which includes a River Terminal and the Oriente Station, a public transport hub linking the Lisbon Underground, CP railways services, Carris bus services, Taxi services, and various road transport companies, plus a direct shuttle service to Lisbon International Airport (5 minutes away).



*The **Magic: The Gathering**  Grand Prix tournament series is a great reason to get out into the **Magic** tournament community, catch up with old friends, meet some new ones, and play some great **Magic**. Grand Prix tournaments are world-wide open events that allow all **Magic**  players to participate and experience the thrill of a large-scale competition. In addition to cash prizes, a high Planeswalker Points multiplier, and exclusive foil promo cards for participants, Grand Prix feature a host of other activities, including public events and artist signings (prizes subject to change). Find out more about the Grand Prix [tournament schedule here](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/TCG/Events.aspx?x=grandprix/welcome#2012).*

Minors must have a parent or guardian’s signature on this form. Consent forms will be collected during the player meeting on Saturday morning.


**Tournament Format**
  


* [Day 1: Sealed Deck](/en/node/704561)  (6 packs of *Return to Ravnica*)
* [Day 2 and Top 8: Booster Draft](/en/node/704561) (3 packs of *Return to Ravnica*)
* Deck lists are required.
* If product is not stamped or preregistered, deck registration and deck swap will be performed for the Swiss Sealed Deck.

**Tournament Structure** 


* Modified Swiss-style (50-minute rounds).
* If 799 or fewer players register for the event, all players with an X-2-0 or better record OR the top 64 players—whichever number is greater—will advance to the second day of the event.
* If 800 or more players register for the event, all players with an X-2-0 or better record OR the top 128 players—whichever number is greater—will advance to the second day of the event.
* The Top 8 players after the final Swiss round on Day 2 will advance to the Top 8 single-elimination finals.
* The Top 8 players will be seated randomly at the draft table immediately prior to drafting. The Top 8 bracket will be determined using this random seating.
* Top 8 playoff matches will be best 2 of 3, and have no time limit. (Players are still expected to play at a normal pace and complete playoff matches in a reasonable amount of time.)
* Where necessary, the standings after the Swiss rounds will still be used to determine final order in the standings.
* For the first game of each match in the Top 8, the player that finished higher in the Swiss rounds chooses either to play first or to play second. For subsequent games in each Top 8 match, the usual Play/Draw rule applies (loser of the previous game decides whether to play first in the next game).
