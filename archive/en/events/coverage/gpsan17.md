DAY 1 COVERAGE



Good morning and welcome to Grand Prix Santiago 2017! Nearly 750 players from all over the world have gathered at the Gran Palace in Santiago de Chile to take their shot at a winner's trophy in the Standard format.


Last week, the Pro Tour set the stage. The best Standard results were put up by Temur Aetherworks Marvel decks, in particular versions with Glimmer of Genius or Chandra, Flamecaller, but mono-black Zombies also had a great performance and eventually took the title. This week, diligent deck builders had the time to tackle the format, and this weekend marks their chance to unveil their updates and brews.


The Chilean *Magic* community came out in droves for this event, and we'll surely keep an eye on such local players as Rodrigo Lopez, José Luis Echeverría Paredes, and Patricio Roman. But they face stiff international competition this weekend, as several professional globetrotters have made the trip as well, including (14) Martin Jůza, Ondřej Stráský, Petr Sochůrek, Shuhei Nakamura, and Niels Noorlander.


Today, they and all other competitors here in Santiago will play nine rounds of Swiss, and whoever manages to survive with at least six wins will return tomorrow for another six rounds of Standard, followed by the Top 8 playoffs.
