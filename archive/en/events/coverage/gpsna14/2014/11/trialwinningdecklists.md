Last night, any players in San Antonio at the event site had an opportunity to win themselves a couple byes by winning a Grand Prix Trial. Known to the world as “grinders” (to see if you can make it through the meat grinder), these can go so long into Friday night, they stretch into Saturday morning. But let me tell you, those byes are worth it. Here are the decklists from the Standard grinder winners last night.


In addition to the decklists below, both Brian Ong and Winston Spredley took down a Sealed grinder to have some free wins today.






#### Victor Bitter – Jeskai, Grand Prix San Antonio Trial winner
