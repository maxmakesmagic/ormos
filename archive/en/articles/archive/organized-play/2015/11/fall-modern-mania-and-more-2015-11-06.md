The month of November features a variety of Constructed format Grand Prix, as we wind down 2015 and head toward the final big event of the year: the World *Magic* Cup.


But first, let's talk a bit about last weekend's Regional Pro Tour Qualifiers!


Regional Pro Tour Qualifier Decklists
=====================================


Last weekend, Regional Pro Tour Qualifiers for Pro Tour *Oath of the Gatewatch* took place in North America and Asia, as invited players competed in a Modern Constructed tournament for a shot to play at the next Pro Tour. The Top 4 finishers from each of last weekend's Regional Pro Tour Qualifiers have each earned themselves an invitation and a travel award to Pro Tour *Oath of the Gatewatch*. The exception to this is Japan: With an attendance of 144 players, the Top 8 players from their supersize Regional Pro Tour Qualifier get invitations and a travel award!

Grand Prix Lyon brought Europe's Limited lovers together for two days of *Battle for Zendikar*. The Top 8 featured some prominent names, such as Germany's national champion, Christian Seibold, and Japan's Tomoharu Saito in his 21st Grand Prix Top 8, along with Vincent Lemoine of Belgium and his country's national champion, Branco Neirynck.


In the end, it was an [Ob Nixilis Reignited](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ob+Nixilis+Reignited) in the hands of Damien Bouillot that paved the way to victory, as he bested Christian Seibold in two games in the final match to claim the title.
