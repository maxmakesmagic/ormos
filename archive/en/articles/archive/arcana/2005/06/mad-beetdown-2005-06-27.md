Over a hundred cards were designed for *Unglued 2*, a set that never saw print but that was full of ideas that led to [many actually-printed cards](/en/articles/archive/when-unglued-2-cards-see-print-2004-11-10). We've also seen that one of the running gags in *Unglued 2* was going to be [anthropomorphized vegetables](/en/articles/archive/unglued-2-veggie-creatures-2004-11-09).

In honor of Beatdown Week, today we take a closer look at the **Magic**-slang-slash-angry-veggie-joke card, **Mad Beetdown**.

According to Multiverse, Mad Beetdown was going to be a green card with one of the more aggressive poison abilities.


>  Mad Beetdown  
>  3G   
>  Creature - Vegetable   
>   
>  Poison: 2  
>  Mad Beetdown cannot be the target of spells or effects.   
>  2/2 
> 
> 
> 

The "Poison: 2" in its rules text is a keyworded version of the same ability that [Pit Scorpion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pit+Scorpion) or [Marsh Viper](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Marsh+Viper) have. In other words:


>  Whenever Mad Beetdown deals damage to an opponent, that player gets two poison counters. *(A player with ten or more poison counters loses the game.)*
> 
> 
>

Might *Unglued 2* veggies like Mad Beetdown inspire future **Magic** card designs?
