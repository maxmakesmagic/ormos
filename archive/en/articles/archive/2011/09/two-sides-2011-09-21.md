Have we mentioned that *Innistrad* has double-faced cards? It does, you know. And if you're wondering how they work, there's a [rules page](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/tcg/article.aspx?x=mtg/tcg/innistrad/dfcrules) that should answer most of your questions.


But rules aren't really what we're here for, right? This is Arcana, man. Where we let it all hang out and groove on the *art*. In particular, the art upon which we are going to groove is the art that shows a specific scene on both sides of a double-faced card. In each case, just click on the art to go from day to night and back again.
