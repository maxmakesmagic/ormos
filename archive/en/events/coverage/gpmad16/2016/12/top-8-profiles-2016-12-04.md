**![](https://media.wizards.com/2016/events/gpmad16/t8_gobern.jpg)  

Name:** Luis Gobern


**Age:** 23


**Occupation:** Snake handler


**Hometown:** Lisbon, Portugal


**Previous Magic accomplishments:**


Team Portugal at the 2016 World Magic Cup.


**What deck did you play and why?**


Red-Green Marvel splashing [Nahiri, the Harbinger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nahiri%2C+the+Harbinger), because I initially disliked the format and wasn't skilled enough to play White-Blue mirrors all day.


**What changes would you make to your deck and why?**


I think the deck is really good right now.


**What's the most important card in your deck?**


[Aetherworks Marvel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aetherworks+Marvel) and [Emrakul, the Promised End](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Emrakul%2C+the+Promised+End) of course, but the best card is [Nahiri, the Harbinger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nahiri%2C+the+Harbinger).

Name:** Marco Cammilluzzi


**Age:** 30


**Occupation:** Business analyst


**Hometown:** Rome, Italy


**Previous Magic accomplishments:**


Bomberboss and Matteo Moure's babysitter. [Editor's note: Also, four Grand Prix Top 8s and a Pro Tour Top 8.]


**What deck did you play and why?**


Red-Green Marvel because [Emrakul, the Promised End](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Emrakul%2C+the+Promised+End) is just a nonsense card.


**What changes would you make to your deck and why?**


If it were possible I would like to play five [Aetherworks Marvel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aetherworks+Marvel).


**What's the most important card in your deck?**


[Tireless Tracker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tireless+Tracker) for sure!

Name:** Nicolas Legendre


**Age:** 23


**Occupation:** Not working at the moment, ex-technician


**Hometown:** Nantes, France


**Previous Magic accomplishments:**


None!


**What deck did you play and why?**


I played Black-Red Aggro because I like to play aggro and to use burn spells! Also, I figured that there would be many White-Blue players at the Grand Prix, and the matchup against them is great.


**What changes would you make to your deck and why?**


I'm not sure about the number of [Galvanic Bombardment](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Galvanic+Bombardment)s. Overall fine sideboard, just change some numbers in respect to the expected matchups.


**What's the most important card in your deck?**


[Fiery Temper](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fiery+Temper)!

Name:** Adrian Ramiro Cano


**Age:** 28


**Occupation:** Student of computer science


**Hometown:** Mallorca, Spain


**Previous Magic accomplishments:**


…


**What deck did you play and why?**


White-Blue Flash, because it's the best option against Marvel and Black-Green Delirium.


**What changes would you make to your deck and why?**


I would take out one [Blessed Alliance](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blessed+Alliance) and would ad one [Immolating Glare](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Immolating+Glare). It's very good against [Smuggler's Copter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Smuggler%27s+Copter).


**What's the most important card in your deck?**


[Gideon, Ally of Zendikar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gideon%2C+Ally+of+Zendikar).

Name:** Rafael Sarriegui Hidalgo


**Age:** 24


**Occupation:** English teacher


**Hometown:** Donosti, Spain


**Previous Magic accomplishments:**


Having fun.


**What deck did you play and why?**


Black-Red Zombies. It has a good White-Blue Flash matchup and aggro matchup, too. The bad matchups are winnable thanks to the [Haunted Dead](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Haunted+Dead) and [Prized Amalgam](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Prized+Amalgam) combo.


**What changes would you make to your deck and why?**


Not one.


**What's the most important card in your deck?**


[Cryptbreaker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cryptbreaker)/Voldaren, [Pariah](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pariah)

No one really cares. [Editor cares about Top 8s at Grand Prix Prague and Kraków 2015.]


**What deck did you play and why?**


Red-Green Marvel splashing for [Negate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Negate) and [Linvala, the Preserver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Linvala%2C+the+Preserver) to improve the White-Blue and aggro matchups.


**What changes would you make to your deck and why?**


Try out [Nahiri, the Harbinger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nahiri%2C+the+Harbinger) since she's really good in the mirror.


**What's the most important card in your deck?**


[Aetherworks Marvel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aetherworks+Marvel) for sure.

[Gideon, Ally of Zendikar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gideon%2C+Ally+of+Zendikar), duh. But [Key to the City](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Key+to+the+City) was great all weekend. Thanks for the tech, Rob Catton!
