It has been a little over a month since Pro Tour *Theros*. Two Japanese players made the top eight in Dublin: Makahito Mihara and Kentaro Yamamoto. This weekend they teamed up with friend Jun'ichiro Bandou to form one of the most feared teams of the tournament. After ending day one with a single loss, they powered through day two picking up only a loss and a draw on their way to the top four.


There they faced off against relative unknowns Takayuki Kadono, Toshinori Shigehara, and Hiroki Furukawa. Toshinori is well known in Japan for qualifying for Worlds via **Magic Online** in both 2004 and 2008. They ended day one with a loss and a draw and had to go undefeated on Sunday to make their way into the top 4.

### Kentaro Yamamoto (Green/White) vs. Takayuki Kadono(Red/White)


Yamamoto got off to a quick start with [Leafcrown Dryad](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leafcrown+Dryad) and [Ordeal of Nylea](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ordeal+of+Nylea). Kadono countered with [Minotaur Skullcleaver](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Minotaur+Skullcleaver) and [Ember Swallower](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ember+Swallower). When the [Leafcrown Dryad](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leafcrown+Dryad) hit three +1/+1 counters, Kadono removed it with [Divine Verdict](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Divine+Verdict).


Yamamoto rebuilt by playing [Vulpine Goliath](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vulpine+Goliath), [Nessian Asp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nessian+Asp) and [Chosen by Heliod](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chosen+by+Heliod). A second [Divine Verdict](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Divine+Verdict) came down to deal with the 6/5 while Kadono traded with the Asp.

Yamamoto had a trick of his own—[Divine Verdict](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Divine+Verdict)—which he used to get rid of [Ember Swallower](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ember+Swallower). He followed that up with Agent of Horizon. With both players sitting at 5 life, Yamamoto made the Agent unblockable, cast [Feral Invocation](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Feral+Invocation), and attacked for the win/


### Yamamoto 1 – 0 Kadono

*Kentaro Yamamoto* 

A pair of [Minotaur Skullcleaver](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Minotaur+Skullcleaver)s traded with a pair of [Leafcrown Dryad](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leafcrown+Dryad)s to start the second game. On his fourth turn, Yamamoto cast [Polukranos, World Eater](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Polukranos%2C+World+Eater). After a few pieces of removal hit some of Kadono's creatures, Polukranos became monstrous and Yamamoto took the first match.


### Yamamoto 2 – 0 Kadono


  

 


### Jun'ichiro Bandou (Blue/Black) vs. Toshinori Shigehara (Black/Green)


Play started somewhat slowly between Junichirou Bandou's and Toshinori Shigehara. After a couple turns of back and forth, Shigehara tried to resolve a [Boon Satyr](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Boon+Satyr) during Bandou's combat step. Luckily for Bandou, he had a timely [Dissolve](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dissolve) to shut it down. Bandou then played out a couple of flyers: [Vaporkin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vaporkin) and [Blood-Toll Harpy](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood-Toll+Harpy).


Shigehara was prepared; he cast a [Nessian Asp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nessian+Asp) and a [Baleful Eidolon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Baleful+Eidolon). Facing down an army, Bandou hit eight mana and dropped a [Colossus of Akros](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Colossus+of+Akros).


Shigehara was holding a [Fade into Antiquity](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fade+into+Antiquity) for a situation just like this and exiled the 10/10. Unable to find anything to deal with the Shigehara's army, Bandou conceded and went to the next game.


### Bandou 0 – 1 Shigehara


In the second game, Shigehara got stuck on lands while Bandou amounted a quick army of [Blood-Toll Harpy](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood-Toll+Harpy), [Vaporkin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vaporkin), and [Omenspeaker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Omenspeaker). After discarding for a couple turns, Shigehara attempted to claw his way back into the game with a [Nessian Courser](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nessian+Courser). Bandou destroyed Shigehara's only chance with a [Sip of Hemlock](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sip+of+Hemlock) and sent their match to a third game.

*Jun'ichiro Bandou* 

Bandou 1 – 1 Shigehara


For the third game, things looked hopeful for Bandou as he cast a third turn Ashiok. Unfortunately, that was about all he could cast as he failed to draw another land. Meanwhile, [Nylea's Emissary](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nylea%27s+Emissary) picked up a [Boon Satyr](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Boon+Satyr) on Shigehara's fifth turn, took out Ashiok, and eventually went on to win the match for Shigehara.


Shigehara 2-1 Bandou

*Toshinori Shigehara* 
  

 


Makahito Mihara (Blue/Black) vs. Hiroki Furukawa (Blue/White)


With the matches split, it all came down to Mihara and Furukawa's match.


Game one started with Mihara using Pharika's Curse to two-for-one Furukawa's early [Hopeful Eidolon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hopeful+Eidolon) enchanted with [Ordeal of Heliod](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ordeal+of+Heliod). Furukawa, unphased, cast a [Triton Fortune Hunter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Triton+Fortune+Hunter) and another [Ordeal of Heliod](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ordeal+of+Heliod).


After a couple turns of draw-go, Mihara was a little behind and needed to get something going. He found exactly what he needed in [Abhorrent Overlord](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Abhorrent+Overlord). Though his devotion to black was only three, he followed it up with an [Underworld Cerberus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Underworld+Cerberus) and, finally, a [Sealock Monster](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sealock+Monster). A few attack steps later, Mihara was up a game.

*Makahito Mihara* 

### Mihara 1 -0 Furukawa


In the second game, Furukawa came out of the gates with a [Vaporkin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vaporkin), [Observant Alseid](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Observant+Alseid) and a [Favored Hoplite](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Favored+Hoplite). Mihara, on the backfoot, could only come up with a [Sealock Monster](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sealock+Monster) to attempt to defend.


That was only for a turn, however, as Mihara again found an [Underworld Cerberus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Underworld+Cerberus). After a couple turns the two large creatures proved too much for Furukawa and Mihara won the match to send his team to the finals.
