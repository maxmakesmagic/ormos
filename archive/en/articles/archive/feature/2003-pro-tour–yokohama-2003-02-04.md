### Travel Suggestions

**[Yokohama Travel Information](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=protour/images/yokohama_travel_info.pdf)** (580 KB PDF)

**Note:** ATM machines in Yokohama typically only allow withdraws from Japanese accounts. Many will allow cash-advances from credit cards. It is suggested that players carry some cash funds/ traveler's cheques. Players should contact their banking institution before arriving regarding access to their account in Yokohama if they feel it necessary to do so.

Many Asian countries deny entry to travelers whose passports are valid for less than six months. It is not usually possible to obtain a new passport and foreign visa during a brief stopover while transiting Japan. Make sure you have a signed, valid passport (and visas, if required). Also, before you go, fill in the emergency information page of your passport!

Familiarize yourself with local laws and customs of the countries to which you are traveling. 

Make 2 copies of your passport identification page. This will facilitate replacement if your passport is lost or stolen. Leave one copy at home with friends or relatives. Carry the other with you in a separate place from your passport.

Leave a copy of your itinerary with family or friends at home so that you can be contacted in case of an emergency.

**ELECTRICITY**  
 In Yokohama, the current is 60 hertz and 100 volts. Please be careful in using electrical appliances brought from overseas which may not meet Japanese requirements.

**PUBLIC PHONES**  
 Public telephones can be found throughout the city. There are several types of different colors, which are different in their usage. They take coins and/or telephone cards.

One unit of a card corresponds to 10 yen. If you use coins, for local calls insert 10-yen coins. For local calls you can speak for 1 minute for 10 yen. For domestic long distance calls, prepare many 10 yen coins or use 100-yen coins (no change will be returned if you insert a 100 yen coin and only partly use it).

Gray Public telephones are equipped with ISDN modular jacks and can be connected to both analogue and digital modems. In recent years, telephone booths located in the center of the city usually contain ISDN phones.

**International Calls**  
 International calls can be made through any private telephone or a pay phone with an international mark. For international pay-phone calls, use telephone cards or 100 yen coins (phones with credit card marks can be found in the city center). Calls made using the KDD Super World Card (available in 1,000 yen, 3,000 yen and 5,000 yen units), which can be purchased at most convenience stores, are slightly discounted.

International call access numbers are 001 for KDD, 0061 for IDC, and 0041 for ITJ. For more information, call the following toll-free numbers: KDD: 0057, IDC: 0120-03-0061, ITJ: 0120-44-0041.

She went on to earn her Bachelor of Fine Arts in 1991 from Art Center College of Design in Pasadena, California, graduating with "great distinction" in illustration. Terese began freelancing immediately after Art Center, contributing to everything from theme park design to editorial illustration. In 1992, Terese entered the comic book field illustrating super heroes for numerous collectable card sets. Soon to follow were fully painted comics for Marvel: "Ruins I and II," and "Code of Honor." She also did covers for Topps' "Xena: the Warrior Princess," and Dark Horse's "Star Wars" line. In 1996 Wizards of the Coast caught wind of her work and she emerged within "Magic" through "Alliances." Terese has done work for every major gaming company and illustrated covers for computer and video games. Much of her current work consists of book covers for Del Rey, Harper Collins, Tor and Wizards of the Coast. Terese has received numerous awards, functioned as juror for several art shows, and been showcased in the prestigious annual "Spectrum: The Best in Contemporary Fantastic Art" for the last eight years. She currently resides in Temple City, California with her partner and their four children.
