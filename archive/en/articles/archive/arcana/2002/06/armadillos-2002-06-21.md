With Randy posing questions about [Hibernation](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hibernation) in the base set, the question of the art for the [hibernation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=hibernation) came up. Why are there armadillos in it?


*Urza's Saga*'s design codename was "Armadillo". The art is a tribute to that codename.
