![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/LAC01/842.jpg)The last round of Day 2 is always the most exciting. It's the make-or-break
moment, the round that decides who will be fighting for first place, and who
will watch them do it. 


Ostrovich, the reigning Argentinian National Champion, is running a mono-blue
Orb-Opposition deck, with plenty of ACC countermagic and Masques-Block style
flying beats. Ramirez is playing a version of red-black control, with plenty of
burn for Ostrovich's horde.


Ostrovich won the die roll and opted to play. He came fast out of the gates
with a turn-two [Spiketail Hatchling](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spiketail+Hatchling). Ramirez one upped him by busting a [Plague Spitter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plague+Spitter) via [Dark Ritual](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dark+Ritual), leaving an extra mana open to prevent Spiketail
shenanigans.


However, this cagey opening was wasted on Ostrovich, whose draw had not yielded
a third island. He was forced to pass the turn back. Ramirez gave no quarter,
creating a [Chimeric Idol](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chimeric+Idol) to put him on a short clock. Ostrovich had no
[Counterspell](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterspell). Ostrovich again failed to produce a third land, and soon packed
it in.


He was quick to pull all the land out of his deck and give it a thorough
shuffling. He took great care sideboarding, knowing his back was against the
wall. Ramirez, by contrast, was almost serene.


Game 2 blazed. Ostrovich was exposed by a [Duress](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress), losing a [Foil](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Foil) and showing a
hand of lands, [Thieving Magpie](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thieving+Magpie) and [Thwart](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thwart). He summoned a [Glacial Wall](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glacial+Wall) on Turn
3, and Ramirez came back with a kicked [Phyrexian Scuta](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phyrexian+Scuta).


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/LAC01/841.jpg)Ostrovich thought for a moment, then tapped out for [Thieving Magpie](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thieving+Magpie). Ramirez
did not like the dilemma it presented. He eventually chose his path: He
attacked with his Scuta, and when Ostrovich blocked with his wall, he removed it
with [Urza's Rage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Urza%27s+Rage). This left the Magpie free to fill Ostrovich's hand.


Ostrovich made him pay for his choice, casting [Wash Out](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wash+Out) to send the Scuta home
and save himself a lot of pain. Ramirez gamely recast it, but Ostrovich was
ready with [Thwart](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thwart).


He worked at rebuilding his mana, Porting Ramirez to try to stave off disaster. 
Ramirez got around the problem with a sixth land, dropping a discard-kicked
[Thunderscape Battlemage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thunderscape+Battlemage). Ostrovich chose to lose [Opposition](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Opposition) and Island.


His hand was full of goodies, though, for his Magpie had been working overtime. 
Still, he felt it necessary to double-up. Ramirez played nothing on his turn,
sounding his death knell. With no pressure and no way to remove the birds, he
scooped in short order.


And so after two lightning games, the Top 8 berth would be determined by a
single game.


Ramirez led with land, and Ostrovich followed suit. Neither blinked until
Ostrovich tapped out for [Thieving Magpie](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thieving+Magpie). 
Ramirez tried an [Urza's Rage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Urza%27s+Rage), but Ostrovich [Misdirected](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Misdirected), pitching [Opposition](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Opposition).


Ramirez untapped and tried to [Boil](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Boil). Ostrovich flashed a [Daze](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Daze). He untapped and
added a [Ribbon Snake](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ribbon+Snake) to his squad. Ramirez [Boil](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Boil)ed again, this time
successfully, but the damage was questionable, considering Ostrovich had two
Ports and an eager [Magpie](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Magpie).


Ostrovich swung with his bird and watched Ramirez kick up a Scuta. He locked
Ramirez with his Ports and took five to the stomach, digging for answers with
his Magpie. He found a duplicate, and put it into play.


Ramirez was on the ropes, but had a window of opportunity. He opened with
[Duress](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress). Ostrovich hesitated before picking up three islands for [Thwart](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thwart). This
move put Ramirez into the Think Tank. Ostrovich's hand was primed for [Foil](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Foil), but
did he have one, or was he bluffing it? He needed to act. He was at four,
facing four power of creatures.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/LAC01/844.jpg)He took his time. He played [Dark Ritual](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dark+Ritual), bringing out a second, unkicked,
Scuta. Ostrovich nodded his head once. Ramirez sent the kicked Scuta into the
Red Zone, knocking Ostrovich to ten. He had two mana left to ground the Snake
if need be. It was a precarious position, at best.


It was made even more so when Ostrovich attacked for two and dropped a Chimeric
Idol. Ramirez fought as best he could, making a [Blazing Specter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blazing+Specter) to stop a
Magpie, but the writing was on the wall. Ostrovich showed it to him with
[Opposition](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Opposition), taking the match.
