**Tom Martell vs Ryan Miller**


Tom Martell is currently ranked 13th in the Top 25 Pro Rankings. This weekend is the Pro Tour *Gatecrash* winner's fifth Grand Prix Top 8. His opponent, Ryan Miller, is a California Native in his first Grand Prix Top 8.


**Game 1:**


Miller started things with [Spearpoint Oread](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spearpoint+Oread) and Martell kept up with [Wingsteed Rider](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wingsteed+Rider). Martell's board was further advanced with [Favored Hoplite](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Favored+Hoplite) and [Phalanx Leader](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phalanx+Leader). Miller was drawing a lot of land and couldn't interact much with Martell's board.


Martell sculpted his hand with [Read the Bones](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Read+the+Bones) as he continued to trade blows with Miller, who was falling behind in the race.


Miller eventually found [Magma Jet](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Magma+Jet) to deal with [Wingsteed Rider](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wingsteed+Rider), but Martell was able to follow-up with [Dauntless Onslaught](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dauntless+Onslaught) on his remaining two heroic creatures. Miller, at a lowly 2 life, couldn't find an answer on the top of his deck and was forced to concede after chump blocking for a turn.


**Game 2:**


Miller got off to a decent start in the second game with Fable Hero and [Wingsteed Rider](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wingsteed+Rider). Meanwhile, Martell suffered mana issues and tried to hold onto his life total long enough to stabilize.


Martell's [Heliod's Emissary](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Heliod%27s+Emissary) got in the way of [Fabled Hero](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fabled+Hero) and was saved from a [Magma Jet](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Magma+Jet) with First Strike on the stack with God's Willing.


Miller made another misstep on the following turn when he aimed a [Magma Jet](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Magma+Jet) at one of Martell's creatures while Martell was at 1 life.


Martell tried to stabilize with [Observant Alseid](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Observant+Alseid) and [Lagonna-Band Elder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lagonna-Band+Elder) to gain some life, but two more attacks from Miller were enough to force a third game.


**Game 3:**


Martell led things off with [Scholar of Athreos](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scholar+of+Athreos), but Miller one-upped him with [Fabled Hero](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fabled+Hero).

[![](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Fabled+Hero)](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fabled+Hero)



[Scholar of Athreos](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scholar+of+Athreos) and [Battlewise Valor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Battlewise+Valor) traded with Miller's [Fabled Hero](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fabled+Hero) and [Spark Jolt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spark+Jolt), and the board was cleared except for Martell's [Traveling Philosopher](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Traveling+Philosopher).


Martell turned up the heat the following turn with [Scourgemark](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scourgemark) and [Lagonna-Band Elder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lagonna-Band+Elder), but Miller was able to trade some creatures and leave the board cleared while he had three cards in hand to Martell's one.


Unfortunately for Miller, the last card in Martell's hand was [Scholar of Athreos](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scholar+of+Athreos), and it started draining Miller right away.


Miller played [Fanatic of Mogis](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fanatic+of+Mogis) and started racing, but the Scholar was ahead thanks to Martell's early aggression.


[Heliod's Emissary](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Heliod%27s+Emissary) was found by Martell when Miller tapped out, leaving Miller at only 2 life.


Miller couldn't deal with the [Scholar of Athreos](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scholar+of+Athreos) and found himself drained to death on the following turn.

**Philip Yam vs. Nathannael Maliszekski**


**Game 1:**


Philip Yam came out of the gates quickly with [Vaporkin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vaporkin) and [Blood-Toll Harpy](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood-Toll+Harpy).


Nathannael Maliszekski took a lot of damage without being able to answer the flyers, but [Hero's Downfall](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hero%27s+Downfall) eventually dealt with one of them.


Yam continued to apply pressure, but Maliszekski had [Arbor Colossus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arbor+Colossus) to gum up the board.


Unphased, Yam cast [Breaching Hippocamp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Breaching+Hippocamp) on Maliszekski's endstep and used [Griptide](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Griptide) to put the [Arbor Colossus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arbor+Colossus) on the top of his opponent's deck to attack for lethal.


**Game 2:**


The second game was much slower. Maliszekski used [Burnished Hart](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Burnished+Hart) and [Opaline Unicorn](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Opaline+Unicorn) to massively accelerate his mana. [Bow of Nylea](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bow+of+Nylea) came down and it was clear that Maliszekski would have enough mana to activate it every turn.

[Bow of Nylea](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bow+of+Nylea) is good, but Yam had some bombs of his own. [Thassa, God of the Sea](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thassa%2C+God+of+the+Sea), was soon joined by [Shipbreaker Kraken](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shipbreaker+Kraken) and then [Prognostic Sphinx](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Prognostic+Sphinx).


Maliszekski had [Abhorrent Overlord](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Abhorrent+Overlord), but [Shipbreaker Kraken](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shipbreaker+Kraken) grew to monstrous proportions and it wasn't long before Yam was able to break through for lethal.
