 *Mirrodin* rare.  
 This card is a red version of the *Legends* enchantment Concordant Crossroads. Besides the color change, the only difference between the two cards is that Mass Hysteria is not an "enchant world".

![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Brown%20Ouphe)#### Brown Ouphe

 **Card of the Day - vendredi 10 octobre 2003**


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Liar's%20Pendulum)#### Liar's Pendulum


 *Mirrodin* rare. This card started in design as a Cursed Scroll variant, but was later changed to a card drawer (called "Bluffing Book") as the design team felt it had better flavor.

![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Sunbeam%20Spellbomb)#### Sunbeam Spellbomb


 *Mirrodin* common.  
 The "spellbombs" were initially called "potions" then rejected and changed to "spellbombs" to make them less ordinary. Then "spellbombs" were changed to "phials" for flavor sake but changed back again because what does a "phial" do? We all know what a "spellbomb" does!

 *Mirrodin* rare.
