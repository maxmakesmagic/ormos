Welcome to 2012's first edition of Building on a Budget. Today, I'd like to dive head first into one of the least-explored available constructed formats on **Magic Online**. *Innistrad* Block Constructed is still in its infancy. Normally, single-set block constructed formats become stale quickly. *Innistrad,* however, is very different: the set offers a depth that makes the Constructed format diverse with room for innovation, despite having such a small card pool to work with. Block Constructed is one of the best ways to start playing Constructed on **Magic Online**, as acquiring the cards for a tier-one deck is usually very simple, and *Innistrad* Block Constructed will only become more interesting as more sets are added to the mix. *Dark Ascension* previews are right around the corner, but today I'd like to revisit my preview card from *Innistrad*.

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/boab/boab176_splinterfright.jpg)[Splinterfright](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Splinterfright) | Art by [Eric Deschamps](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&artist=+%5B%22Eric+Deschamps%22%5D)

[Splinterfright](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Splinterfright) was a bit of an oddity when I first previewed it last fall. I didn't have knowledge of the majority of *Innistrad* and I wasn't sure if it was powerful enough for sixty-card decks. Now, with full knowledge of *Innistrad*, we're able to build a [Splinterfright](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Splinterfright) deck that maximizes the value of all of [Splinterfright](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Splinterfright)'s abilities.

![Splinterfright](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Splinterfright)  
I first became interested in *Innistrad* Block Constructed by watching my friend Chris compete in daily events with his Red-White Aggro deck. The format was refreshing and new, and a place where I could be competitive with some very strange kinds of decks.

Initially, I played Chris's red-white deck while I got a feel for the other decks in the format. I found myself playing a lot of mirror matches with the occasional mono-red deck or [Bloodgift Demon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodgift+Demon) control deck thrown into the mix.

I wanted to build a deck that punished players for relying too heavily on burn spells. I wanted big creatures and inevitability. I built a green-blue [Splinterfright](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Splinterfright) deck and played a few games with it. I did exceptionally well against the red-white decks and the mono-red decks. [Gnaw to the Bone](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gnaw+to+the+Bone) was usually enough to buy me a lot of time while I set up a lethal [Splinterfright](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Splinterfright) or [Kessig Cagebreakers](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kessig+Cagebreakers). However, during this period the [Bloodgift Demon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodgift+Demon) control decks became a lot more popular. Some of these decks started packing [Olivia Voldaren](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Olivia+Voldaren) and I found myself losing a lot of my matches to the control decks.

I was lucky enough to play a mirror match during this time and noticed that my opponent was splashing black for [Spider Spawning](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spider+Spawning).

I needed an answer to the bombs of the format and decided it was time to play a few copies of [Sever the Bloodline](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sever+the+Bloodline) between my main deck and sideboard. Playing black also gave me access to [Spider Spawning](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spider+Spawning), which gives the deck a tremendous amount of time to get frighteningly large.

I played some games with the initial green-blue-black version of the deck and had a lot more success. I still wasn't entirely confident with the deck, but I was able to find the glue that could hold it all together when I added a few copies of [Unburial Rites](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Unburial+Rites). I was already playing [Avacyn's Pilgrim](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Avacyn%27s+Pilgrim) and a bunch of [Shimmering Grotto](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shimmering+Grotto)s, so the mana wasn't really an issue. Being able to mill into a [Kessig Cagebreakers](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kessig+Cagebreakers) is definitely worth the potential trouble with your mana.

I'll explain all the card choices before we get to the games.

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/boab/boab176_card01a.jpg)![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/boab/boab176_card01b.jpg)[Armored Skaab](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Armored+Skaab) is perfect in the current metagame. There are a lot of inexpensive creatures that will be stopped in their tracks by an early [Armored Skaab](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Armored+Skaab). [Armored Skaab](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Armored+Skaab)'s real power lies in its enter-the-battlefield trigger. On average, you'll be hitting 1.6 creatures, and there's enough flashback in the deck to turn this into a somewhat reliable source of card advantage. Remember to cast your [Armored Skaab](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Armored+Skaab) before combat when you have a [Splinterfright](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Splinterfright) or [Boneyard Wurm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Boneyard+Wurm) you can attack with. It may seem obvious, but you've probably trained yourself to cast spells after combat and it's important to remember special circumstances.

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/boab/boab176_card02a.jpg)![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/boab/boab176_card02b.jpg)[Boneyard Wurm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Boneyard+Wurm) and [Splinterfright](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Splinterfright) get very large in this deck. These cards are underpowered in your opening hand, but they progressively get better. Don't be afraid to mulligan hands with too many of these. Remember, they're excellent topdecks but poor cards in the opener.

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/boab/boab176_card03a.jpg)![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/boab/boab176_card03b.jpg)[Kessig Cagebreakers](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kessig+Cagebreakers) is your primary win condition. It's not unusual to attack for 20 damage or more with a single swing from these gentlemen. There are many games where you already have a [Splinterfright](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Splinterfright) or [Boneyard Wurm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Boneyard+Wurm) that's dominating the battlefield and you have to decide whether or not you want to cast your [Kessig Cagebreakers](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kessig+Cagebreakers). My advice in these situations is to play cautiously when your opponent has a control deck with access to [Blasphemous Act](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blasphemous+Act). In post-boarded games you might need to worry about [Blasphemous Act](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blasphemous+Act) from all decks with red, so play accordingly.

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/boab/boab176_card04a.jpg)![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/boab/boab176_card04b.jpg)[Avacyn's Pilgrim](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Avacyn%27s+Pilgrim) is a bit lackluster here, but the deck wants to maximize its creature count and [Avacyn's Pilgrim](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Avacyn%27s+Pilgrim) lets you cheat on your mana base a bit. The deck's mana makes it difficult to cast [Avacyn's Pilgrim](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Avacyn%27s+Pilgrim) on the first turn, but the acceleration is relevant for at least the first five turns of the game.

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/boab/boab176_card05a.jpg)![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/boab/boab176_card05b.jpg)[Deranged Assistant](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deranged+Assistant) is everything you want in this deck. It accelerates your mana and gives you a huge advantage by dumping more cards into your graveyard.

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/boab/boab176_card06a.jpg)![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/boab/boab176_card06b.jpg)[Dream Twist](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dream+Twist) is very powerful here. It's important to note its usefulness as a combat trick. I like casting 3/3 [Splinterfright](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Splinterfright)s or [Boneyard Wurm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Boneyard+Wurm)s with a blue mana open against red decks. Your opponent will be happy to cash in a [Brimstone Volley](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brimstone+Volley), but if you're lucky and hit a creature with [Dream Twist](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dream+Twist) you've essentially countered the burn spell and probably gained more virtual card advantage in the process.

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/boab/boab176_card07a.jpg)![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/boab/boab176_card07b.jpg)[Gnaw to the Bone](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gnaw+to+the+Bone) is important in a format full of aggressive decks that intend to finish you off with burn spells. You'll gain a lot of life with this and it will usually make your opponent reconsider an aggressive game plan.

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/boab/boab176_card08a.jpg)![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/boab/boab176_card08b.jpg)[Sever the Bloodline](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sever+the+Bloodline) is a necessary one-of in this deck. You're likely to mill it eventually and it provides an out to cards that can be very difficult to compete with in the late game, like [Olivia Voldaren](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Olivia+Voldaren).

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/boab/boab176_card09a.jpg)![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/boab/boab176_card09b.jpg)[Mulch](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mulch) is another way to cheat on mana that actually produces virtual card advantage in the process. You're usually only hitting one land with your [Mulch](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mulch), but it's important to get some creatures in your graveyard to turn on your [Splinterfright](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Splinterfright)s, [Boneyard Wurm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Boneyard+Wurm)s, and [Kessig Cagebreakers](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kessig+Cagebreakers).

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/boab/boab176_card10a.jpg)![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/boab/boab176_card10b.jpg)[Spider Spawning](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spider+Spawning) is a powerful tool that makes it extremely difficult to profitably attack your life total. A lot of decks will fold to your first casting of this spell. It's like a [Kessig Cagebreakers](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kessig+Cagebreakers) that doesn't need to attack.

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/boab/boab176_card11a.jpg)![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/boab/boab176_card11b.jpg)[Unburial Rites](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Unburial+Rites) is a great way to re-buy your [Kessig Cagebreakers](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kessig+Cagebreakers) or [Splinterfright](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Splinterfright) once you've run out of gas. The flashback is a free splash thanks to [Avacyn's Pilgrim](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Avacyn%27s+Pilgrim) and [Shimmering Grotto](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shimmering+Grotto).

Here's the decklist once we put it all together.

I blocked [Cloistered Youth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloistered+Youth) and it got binned. My opponent tried for a morbid [Brimstone Volley](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brimstone+Volley) on the [Splinterfright](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Splinterfright), but I had [Ranger's Guile](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ranger%27s+Guile) at the ready.

My opponent played [Traveler's Amulet](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Traveler%27s+Amulet) and sacrificed it, finding a [Mountain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mountain), then passed the turn.

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/boab/boab176_olivia.jpg)I mulliganed to five and kept [Forest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest), [Shimmering Grotto](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shimmering+Grotto), [Mulch](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mulch), [Mulch](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mulch), and [Kessig Cagebreakers](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kessig+Cagebreakers).

My opponent played a third land and cast a [Traveler's Amulet](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Traveler%27s+Amulet) before passing. I drew [Sever the Bloodline](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sever+the+Bloodline) and cast [Mulch](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mulch), milling a [Sever the Bloodline](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sever+the+Bloodline) and putting two [Hinterland Harbor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hinterland+Harbor)s and a [Woodland Cemetery](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Woodland+Cemetery) in my hand. I played the [Hinterland Harbor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hinterland+Harbor) and passed the turn, with my opponent cracking the amulet on my endstep. My opponent played a fourth land and cast [Olivia Voldaren](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Olivia+Voldaren). I milled myself with [Dream Twist](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dream+Twist) on my opponent's endstep and revealed [Unburial Rites](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Unburial+Rites), a land, and an [Avacyn's Pilgrim](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Avacyn%27s+Pilgrim). I played [Woodland Cemetery](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Woodland+Cemetery) and cast [Sever the Bloodline](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sever+the+Bloodline), targeting Olivia. My opponent played a fifth land and cast [Curse of Death's Hold](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Curse+of+Death%27s+Hold) (see why I sided out the [Spider Spawning](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spider+Spawning)s? ^\_^). I drew a [Ranger's Guile](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ranger%27s+Guile), cast [Splinterfright](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Splinterfright), played my land, and passed the turn.

I flashbacked the [Unburial Rites](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Unburial+Rites) targeting [Kessig Cagebreakers](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kessig+Cagebreakers).
