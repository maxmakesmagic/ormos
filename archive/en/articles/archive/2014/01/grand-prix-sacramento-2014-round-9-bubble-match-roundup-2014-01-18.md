Grand Prix Sacramento 2014 - Round 9 Bubble-Match Roundup
=========================================================



 Posted in [NEWS](/en/articles)

A number of high profile players found themselves with their backs against the wall in the last round of Day 1 here in Sacramento. Due to this weekend's tremendous turnout, the tournament organizer split Day 1 into two halves: Let's see how the blue side's bubble matches panned out.


**Brian David-Marshall vs. Ron Rasmussen**

We watched Brian David-Marshall emerge victorious in the very first round of the day. After that, he picked up two quick losses and found himself in the precarious 1-2 bracket. Undeterred, BDM battled on. He rattled off five wins in a row and found himself playing for Day 2 against Ron Rasmussen. Rasmussen's deck was rife with bombs like [Abhorrent Overlord](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Abhorrent+Overlord) and [Elspeth, Sun's Champion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elspeth%2C+Sun%27s+Champion). Nonetheless, BDM and his monstrous army were able to emerge victorious, securing a spot in the second day of competition here in Sacramento.


 


**Seth Manfield vs. Peter Huang**

Seth Manfield entered the last round of competition with a 6-1-1 record. Paired up against the 7-1 Peter Huang, Manfield needed a win to make Day 2. A timely [Griptide](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Griptide) on Huang's [Nessian Asp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nessian+Asp) in response to a [Traveler's Amulet](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Traveler%27s+Amulet) activation sent the gigantic snake back into his library and Manfield was able to achieve victory in two games.


 


**Adam Shaw vs. Brandon De Jong**

Adam Shaw is no stranger to high-level **Magic**, but he's certainly had more experience judging than playing. Shaw came out of the gates quickly with an extremely aggressive Red/White deck. Brandon De Jong was able to stave off the early aggression in game two, but a quick start from Shaw in the third game went unanswered and Shaw was able to carve out his place in Day 2.


 


**Jamie Parke vs. Le Lin**

Former Worlds Finalist Jamie Parke needed to win the last round in order to make Day 2 here in Sacramento. Parke had a strong Blue/Green deck splashing Black with a lot of evasion. In the first game, Le Lin was unable to race Parke's flyers. The second game went long, and Parke spent countless turns trying to draw a sixth land. Parke eventually found a land and bestowed a Thass'a Emissary onto his [Vaporkin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vaporkin). Lin had [Artisan's Sorrow](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Artisan%27s+Sorrow), though, and he used it to deal with the Emissary when Parke attacked. This allowed Lin to gobble up Parke's [Vaporkin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vaporkin) with his reach creature and victory wasn't much further away. In the third game, Lin used [Voyaging Satyr](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Voyaging+Satyr) to power out some quick fatties and Parke's hand was unable to keep up.


 


**Eric Mann-Hielscher vs. Michael Schuller**

Eric Mann-Hielscher is new face on the Pro Tour. Eager to do well and constantly improving, Mann-Hielscher needed a win in the final round of swiss to make Day 2. Michael Schuller had mana issues in the third game and quickly found himself facing down a [Celestial Archon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Celestial+Archon) and [Ashen Rider](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ashen+Rider). Mann-Hielscher easily cruised his way into the second day of competition here in Sacramento.
