Siron from Belgium had a good season a couple of years back where he finished 9th at PT Osaka but has been quiet of late. ### Game 1


Siron opened with a [Copper Myr](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Copper+Myr), but couldn't accelerate to anything and played a [Krark-Clan Stoker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Krark-Clan+Stoker) instead. Jorstedt went with a [Pteron Ghost](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pteron+Ghost), but had nothing to follow with.


Siron missed a land drop and summoned a [Goblin Replica](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Replica). Jorstedt copied it with a [Sculpting Steel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sculpting+Steel) and brought out [Skullclamp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skullclamp). [Echoing Decay](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Echoing+Decay) got rid of the bogus Replica and [Lightning Greaves](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Greaves) meant Siron's could be kept safe until it was needed.


Jorstedt made a [Frogmite](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Frogmite) and equipped it with the [Skullclamp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skullclamp). Siron thought for a while and decided to continue to be aggressive. An [Electrostatic Bolt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Electrostatic+Bolt) took down the [Frogmite](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Frogmite) at the cost of giving the Swede two cards. It enabled Siron to attack and drop Jorstedt to 9.


Jorstedt brought out an [Oxidda Golem](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oxidda+Golem), but forewent its haste in favour of leaving it behind on defence with a [Skullclamp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skullclamp).


Siron's mana was giving him problems. He sacc'ed the Greaves to the Stoker just so he could bust out a [Pewter Golem](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pewter+Golem). Jorstedt killed it with [Barbed Lightning](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Barbed+Lightning). Siron had to continue the aggressive option. Another [Echoing Ruin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Echoing+Ruin) got rid of the [Oxidda Golem](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oxidda+Golem), but the card advantage was starting to kick in.


Jorstedt bolted the [Goblin Replica](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Replica) and then dropped a [Razor Golem](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Razor+Golem) for free and made it massive with a [Leonin Scimitar](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leonin+Scimitar), Vulshok Morningstar and [Skullclamp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skullclamp). Siron managed to get rid of it by blocking with a [Nim Replica](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nim+Replica) and an entwined Barbed Lighting that took Jorstedt to 4.


That was as close as he got. A Den Guard came out and was made equally massive and [Blinding Beam](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blinding+Beam) cleared the road for the swede to win the game in a couple of attacks.


**Jorstedt 1 - 0 Siron**


### Game 2


Siron started aggressively with a turn 3 [Scavenging Scarab](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scavenging+Scarab) and followed it with a [Goblin Replica](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Replica) and bolted Jorstedt's Transfixer.


Jorstedt meanwhile had a bunch of Myrs, but then the [Skullclamp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skullclamp) came out again to give those myrs something useful to do. A Spectre's Shroud on a [Pteron Ghost](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pteron+Ghost) took the last card from Siron's hand, a [Dross Golem](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dross+Golem), and then returned again for a [Krark-Clan Stoker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Krark-Clan+Stoker) as Siron was forced to pop the Replica on the [Skullclamp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skullclamp) before things started getting too silly.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gpbir04/fm3_2.jpg)Siron still had the Scarab and the life advantage, but his deck was running out of steam again. Jorstedt brought out a Haematite Golem and gave it a [Leonin Scimitar](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leonin+Scimitar) to hold the pesky bug at bay.


Jorstedt was more interested in attacking and smashed with the Golem.


Realising the game was hopeless Siron scooped.


**Mattias Jorstedt beat Geoffrey Siron 2-0.**
