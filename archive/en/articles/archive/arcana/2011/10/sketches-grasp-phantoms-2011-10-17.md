Welcome back to another edition of Sketches! Today we're looking at a ghostly example from *Innistrad*: Izzy's [Grasp of Phantoms](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grasp+of+Phantoms).

### Artist Portfolio

Artist [Izzy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?action=advanced&artist=+%5B%22Izzy%22%5D) has illustrated 60 **Magic** cards since he made his debut in *Shadowmoor*.

### Art Description

The first step of the creation of a card's art is its art description. The art description tells the artist what the card will do, what its flavor is, and what the mood of the illustration should be. Here's what Izzy was given for the card:


> 
> Color: Blue spell 
> 
> 
> Action: Show a darkened doorway. Countless pale, white, shriveled hands on the ends of impossibly long arms are dragging an unconscious human warrior through the door and into the darkness. 
> 
> 
> Focus: The scene of the human victim being pulled into the dark door
> 
> 
> Mood: The nightmare is just beginning. 
> 
> 
> 

### Sketches

Here's the first sketch that Izzy gave to the creative team:

### Final Art

Sometimes, the creative team takes this opportunity to suggest directions that they'd like the artist to consider. Not this time! They liked it and gave Izzy the go-ahead to finish the piece.
