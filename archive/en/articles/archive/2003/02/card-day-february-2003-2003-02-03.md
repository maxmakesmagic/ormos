![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Ghosthelm%20Courier)#### Ghosthelm Courier


*Onslaught* uncommon.  
The five *Onslaught* Couriers are named after the magical items they are shown carrying in the artwork.


**Card of the Day - Thursday, February 27, 2003**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Goblin%20Goon)#### Goblin Goon


*Legions* rare.  
In early development, the Goon was 8/8. That didn't last very long.


**Card of the Day - Wednesday, February 26, 2003**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Symbiotic%20Elf)#### Symbiotic Elf


*Onslaught* common.  
All the Symbiotic creatures in Onslaught have centipede-like "insects" in their art.


**Card of the Day - Tuesday, February 25, 2003**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Hobble)#### Hobble


*Planeshift* common.  
The "creature" casting the spell in the art of Hobble is Lord Windgrace, one of the Planeswalkers featured in the Invasion block storyline.


**Card of the Day - Monday, February 24, 2003**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Nantuko%20Husk)#### Nantuko Husk


*Onslaught* common.  
The Husk is an exact reprint of *Urza's Saga's* Phyrexian Ghoul, except the Husk has "Insect" as an additional creature type.


**Card of the Day - Friday, February 21, 2003**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Lin%20Sivvi,%20Defiant%20Hero)#### Lin Sivvi, Defiant Hero


*Nemesis* rare.  
*Mercadian Masques*, three years ago, was the last block to have card banned in the Block Constructed Format-Lin Sivvi and Rishadan Port.


**Card of the Day - Thursday, February 20, 2003**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Mox%20Emerald)#### Mox Emerald

 Alpha rare.  
"Mox" is not a real word, but Richard Garfield derived it from "moxie," which means "energy, courage, or determination."


**Card of the Day - Wednesday, February 19, 2003**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Frantic%20Search)#### Frantic Search


*Urza's Legacy* common.  
Tolarian Academy is restricted in Type 1, but it still casts a long enough shadow that cards that combo well with it, such as Frantic Search, are also restricted.


**Card of the Day - Tuesday, February 18, 2003**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Jerrard%20of%20the%20Closed%20Fist)#### Jerrard of the Closed Fist


*Legends* uncommon.  
At one point years ago, all cards with the creature type Legend were restricted, even vanilla behemoths like Jerrard.


**Card of the Day - Monday, February 17, 2003**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Contract%20from%20Below)#### Contract from Below

 Alpha rare.  
Ancestral Recall? Balance? Pathetic! Contract is our pick for the most powerful card everâ€¦ and it's banned in all sanctioned formats because of its ante mechanic.


**Card of the Day - Friday, February 14, 2003**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Envelop)#### Envelop


*Judgment* common.  
Although it doesn't come across well on the card, the art for Envelop depicts a Fireball encased in a shield of energy.


**Card of the Day - Thursday, February 13, 2003**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Derelor)#### Derelor


*Fallen Empires* uncommon.  
One of the better cards to come out of Fallen Empires, Derelor was the grandfather of the *Invasion* "Leech" cycle.


**Card of the Day - Wednesday, February 12, 2003**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Lowland%20Tracker)#### Lowland Tracker


*Legions* common.  
Provoke creatures "hook" other creatures and force them to block. You can see hooks in the art of most provoke creatures.


**Card of the Day - Tuesday, February 11, 2003**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Enslaved%20Scout)#### Enslaved Scout


*Alliances* common.  
No one ever mistook the *Seventh Edition* card Goblin Spelunkers for a powerhouse. Well, take a look at its predecessor. Ugh.


**Card of the Day - Monday, February 10, 2003**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Stangg)#### Stangg


*Legends* rare.  
Because the creature type of tokens matches their names and vice-versa, the type of the token created by Stangg is "Stangg-Twin Legend." Feel free to make your Mistform Wall into a Stangg-Twin!


**Card of the Day - Friday, February 07, 2003**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Brainwash)#### Brainwash


*The Dark* common.  
Brainwash was one of the first white "taxing" cards, back before R&D even decided that taxing should be a primarily white mechanic.


**Card of the Day - Thursday, February 06, 2003**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Wall%20of%20Hope)#### Wall of Hope


*Legions* common.  
Unlike its *Stronghold* predecessor, Wall of Essence, Wall of Hope gives you life from all damage dealt to it, not just combat damage. A great combo with Earthquake!


**Card of the Day - Wednesday, February 05, 2003**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Spectral%20Lynx)#### Spectral Lynx


*Apocalypse* rare.  
Up until the very last days of development, this card was a four-mana 2/2 named "Spirit Lynx."


**Card of the Day - Tuesday, February 04, 2003**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Bandage)#### Bandage


*Stronghold* common.  
When Stronghold was released, rules dictated that you could not play Bandage if damage was not being dealt at the time you played it. Under current rules, it can be played any time you can play an instant, making it much better.


**Card of the Day - Monday, February 03, 2003**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Island%20Sanctuary)#### Island Sanctuary

 Alpha rare.  
Island Sanctuary is the only card with a basic land type in its name that is a different color than the mana that land would produce.
