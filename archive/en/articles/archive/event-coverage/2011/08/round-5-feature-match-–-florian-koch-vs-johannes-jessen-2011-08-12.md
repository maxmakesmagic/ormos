Both players have no loss so far, and obviously want to keep it that way. Jessen had drafted a blue-green deck and you can read all about Koch's draft process in the draft coverage.



### Game One



Both players had two-drops on their third turn: [Runeclaw Bear](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Runeclaw+Bear) for Jessen, [Alabaster Mage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Alabaster+Mage) for Koch. Jessen attacked for two and played [Coral Merfolk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Coral+Merfolk). Koch enchanted his [Alabaster Mage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Alabaster+Mage) with [Divine Favor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Divine+Favor), Jessen summoned [Aven Fleetwing](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aven+Fleetwing).

Koch cast [Auramancer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Auramancer) and attacked with his Mage. Jessen cast [Llanowar Elves](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Llanowar+Elves) and attacked with his flier. Koch dropped his bomb, the stately [Flameblast Dragon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flameblast+Dragon), but Jessen had [Frost Breath](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Frost+Breath) to keep [Alabaster Mage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Alabaster+Mage) and [Flameblast Dragon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flameblast+Dragon) tapped down. He had [Trollhide](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Trollhide) to improve his [Aven Fleetwing](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aven+Fleetwing), but his attack still left Koch at 9. Koch summoned [Goblin Tunneler](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Tunneler) and [Gideon's Lawkeeper](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gideon%27s+Lawkeeper). He still had only one [Plains](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plains), while his opponent only had [Island](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island). Jessen braced himself for the impending impact of [Flameblast Dragon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flameblast+Dragon) and didn't attack at all.


With the help of [Alabaster Mage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Alabaster+Mage) the [Flameblast Dragon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flameblast+Dragon) gained lifelink, attacked, and shot down one of Jessen's creatures. Koch gained 8 life in the process.


Jessen summoned [Giant Spider](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Giant+Spider), but on his next turn, Koch had enough mana to kill the Spider via [Flameblast Dragon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flameblast+Dragon) while also giving it lifelink. Jessen shuffled it up for game 1.


"[Mind Control](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mind+Control) still in hand? Koch asked.


"Let's just say, a second blue mana would have been great." Jessen was left with [Æther Adept](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=%C3%86ther+Adept) stranded in his hand.


Florian Koch 1 – 0 Johannes Jessen



### Game Two



Jessen opened with [Runeclaw Bear](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Runeclaw+Bear), then had [Mana Leak](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak) for Koch's [Blood Ogre](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Ogre). He allowed [Benalish Veteran](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Benalish+Veteran), but immediately returned it to Koch's hand with Æther Adept. The [Runeclaw Bear](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Runeclaw+Bear) brought Koch to 14. [Benalish Veteran](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Benalish+Veteran) made its comeback and received [Divine Favor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Divine+Favor). This stopped further attacks on Jessen's side, who only cast [Garruk's Companion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Garruk%27s+Companion) and passed the turn.

The Veteran attacked for 4, and enabled fully-grown [Gorehorn Minotaurs](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gorehorn+Minotaurs). Jessen just had [Llanowar Elves](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Llanowar+Elves) and more lands, while Koch's fatties attacked and attacked. When his opponent was at 3, he even added another one to his team: [Bonebreaker Giant](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bonebreaker+Giant). Jessen had [Stingerfling Spider](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stingerfling+Spider), which finally allowed him some good blocks. He traded away all of his small creatures for [Bonebreaker Giant](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bonebreaker+Giant) and [Gorehorn Minotaurs](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gorehorn+Minotaurs). The board was now: [Benalish Veteran](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Benalish+Veteran) with [Divine Favor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Divine+Favor) versus [Stingerfling Spider](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stingerfling+Spider).


Koch cast [Gorehorn Minotaurs](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gorehorn+Minotaurs), this time as a lowly 3/3. Jessen had [Coral Merfolk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Coral+Merfolk), but had to block both attackers. He lost his Merfolk and didn't draw another blocker.


**Florian Koch 2 – 0 Johannes Jessen**
