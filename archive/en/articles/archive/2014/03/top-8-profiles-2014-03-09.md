*Grand Prix Richmond Top 8* 

  
![](https://media.wizards.com/legacy/mtg/images/daily/events/gprich14/lsv.jpg)**Luis Scott-Vargas** **Age:** 31 **Hometown:** Oakland, CA **Occupation:** Vice President, ChannelFireball.com 


**Previous **Magic** Accomplishments:**   5 Pro Tour Top 8s, 11 Grand Prix Top 8, Pro Tour Hall of Fame Class of 2013, US National Champion 2007 


**What deck are you playing, and why?**  Melira Pod because it's powerful and versatile against and open field. Also can't get hated easily. 


**If you were playing Modern tomorrow, what would you change about your deck?**  The main deck [Thrun, the Last Troll](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thrun%2C+the+Last+Troll) wasn't good. Maybe play a fourth [Noble Hierarch](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Noble+Hierarch) instead. 


**What was the best card in your sideboard, and why?** [Thoughtseize](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtseize), because it comes in against a ton of decks (though maybe [Kataki, War's Wage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kataki%2C+War%27s+Wage) since I played five Affinity decks).

**Previous **Magic** Accomplishments:**   Played in some Pro Tours, Top 8 Pro Tour Boston 2003 


**What deck are you playing, and why?**  Affinity. It loses to cards, not decks. 


**If you were playing Modern tomorrow, what would you change about your deck?**  Gut a [Rule of Law](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rule+of+Law) for [Grafdigger's Cage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grafdigger%27s+Cage) in the sideboard. 


**What was the best card in your sideboard, and why?** [Grafdigger's Cage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grafdigger%27s+Cage). It won a couple of games that were of out reach otherwide.

**Previous **Magic** Accomplishments:**   Sacrificing [Linvala, Keeper of Silence](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Linvala%2C+Keeper+of+Silence) with [Birthing Pod](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Birthing+Pod) to lose the finals of a PTQ against an opponent playing [Splinter Twin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Splinter+Twin) 


**What deck are you playing, and why?**  Kiki-Pod, since it has game against most of the Modern Field and attacks from multiple angles. 


**If you were playing Modern tomorrow, what would you change about your deck?**  Nothing 


**What was the best card in your sideboard, and why?** [Fiery Justice](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fiery+Justice). It sets my opponent's very far deck.

**Previous **Magic** Accomplishments:**   3 StarCityGames Invitations Top 8s, 2 Grand Prix Top 8s, Stole Jacob Wilson from Kea

**Melira Pod.

**If you were playing Modern tomorrow, what would you change about your deck?**  Fewer sleeves. More dice in the front pocket, and a few more Day1MTG tokens. 


**What was the best card in your sideboard, and why?**  The $5 scratch-off ticket Joe gave me. Very lucky!

**Previous **Magic** Accomplishments:**   1st at Grand Prix Detroit; 2nd at Grand Prix Miami; 11th at Pro Tour *Born of the Gods*. 


**What deck are you playing, and why?**  Melira Pod. I've been playing the deck for over a year and am very comfortable with it. It's also one of the hardest decks to hate out. 


**If you were playing Modern tomorrow, what would you change about your deck?**  If the mirror gets more popular, I think I might re-add the second [Viscera Seer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Viscera+Seer). I didn't play against Storm once, so the [Ethersworn Canonist](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ethersworn+Canonist) was pretty bad. 


**What was the best card in your sideboard, and why?** [Entomber Exarch](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Entomber+Exarch). It gives you so much game against the combo decks, while also being good against control decks.

**Oscar Jones** **Age:** 16 **Hometown:** Salt Lake City, UT **Occupation:** Student 


**Previous **Magic** Accomplishments:**   2012 **Magic Online** Championship Series Finalist, Winner of Oasis Games' Tuesday Night Draft 


**What deck are you playing, and why?**  Melira Pod because it's the best deck if you have experience with it. 


**If you were playing Modern tomorrow, what would you change about your deck?**  I could see adding a second [Slaughter Pact](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Slaughter+Pact) to the sideboard, but I would know for sure what card ot cut for it. 


**What was the best card in your sideboard, and why?** [Entomber Exarch](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Entomber+Exarch). It drastically improves your worst matchups.

**Previous **Magic** Accomplishments:**   1st place at FNM. 


**What deck are you playing, and why?**  Affinity. I've been playing it for almost a year. I know the deck in and out. 


**If you were playing Modern tomorrow, what would you change about your deck?**  Absolutely nothing. 


**What was the best card in your sideboard, and why?** [Thoughtseize](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtseize), because of its versatility and its power against combo decks

**Jamie Parke** **Age:** 32 **Hometown:** NYC, New York **Occupation:** Miser 


**Previous **Magic** Accomplishments:**   2 Worlds Top 8s (1999, 2008)2 Grand Prix Top 8s (New Orleans 2000, Indianapolis 2008)1 Junior Worlds Finalist (1997) 


**What deck are you playing, and why?**  Tempo Twin, because I was the most comfortable with it. There are so many decks to choose from and no clear best deck, so familiarity won out. (PS - Josh Ravitz has a different name for this particular build; ask him about it next time you see him.) 


**If you were playing Modern tomorrow, what would you change about your deck?**  Maybe make a few tweaks here and there, but nothing big. 


**What was the best card in your sideboard, and why?**  Probably the second [Flame Slash](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flame+Slash) or the second [Dispel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dispel). Both were very impactful and efficient spells.
