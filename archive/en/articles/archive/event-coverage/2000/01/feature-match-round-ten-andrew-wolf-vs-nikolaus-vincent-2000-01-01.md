### THE MATCHUP


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/GPMINN01/949.jpg)While neither of these players have made Top 8 at a major DCI event, both of them have stormed through the Minneapolis Grand Prix using decks without [Desolation Angel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Desolation+Angel), [Blurred Mongoose](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blurred+Mongoose), [Spiritmonger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spiritmonger), [Dromar's Charm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dromar%27s+Charm), or [Mystic Snake](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mystic+Snake). 


Andrew Wolf, from Atlanta, was playing R-W-U with [Lightning Angel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Angel) as the primary win condition, and [Goblin Trenches](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Trenches) as backup. Nikolaus Vincent, from Green Bay, was playing R-B-w with [Shivan Zombie](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shivan+Zombie)s as a metagame to [Spectral Lynx](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spectral+Lynx)...and his own [Spectral Lynx](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spectral+Lynx)es, as well. Oh, he also had [Skizzik](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skizzik)s and [Urza's Rage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Urza%27s+Rage).


Both decks had [Flametongue Kavu](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flametongue+Kavu), who were all probably quite relieved to have something to do for once.


### THE MATCH


This match was 100% mulligan free, and approved for your enjoyment.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/GPMINN01/947.jpg)An amusing situation arose early in the first game as Andrew, going first, played a second turn [Meddling Mage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Meddling+Mage), stared at his opponent's swamp...and had no idea what to call. Eventually, he decided that "[Recoil](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Recoil)" was a safe choice. It was a good guess; but it was incorrect, as he learned when Nikolaus dropped a [Battlefield Forge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Battlefield+Forge), and then a [Shivan Zombie](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shivan+Zombie).


Lots of creatures died this game, which always makes this reporter happy. The Zombie was fired, the Mage was [Terminate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Terminate)d, the next Mage (calling, somewhat unsurprisingly, [Terminate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Terminate)) saw a bit of [Urza's Rage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Urza%27s+Rage), a [Blazing Specter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blazing+Specter) was burned by a [Flametongue Kavu](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flametongue+Kavu), who in turn enjoyed the heat of another [Flametongue Kavu](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flametongue+Kavu)...


...who then watched a [Lightning Angel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Angel) come out on Andrew's side, who flew over three times before a [Ghitu Fire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ghitu+Fire) on turn eight sealed the win for the peachy guy from Georgia. (Do you folks in Georgia hear that a lot? Sorry. Tell you what, we'll slam Wisconsin down below.)


Game two also saw a lot of creature action. A [Shivan Zombie](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shivan+Zombie) and [Goblin Legionnaire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Legionnaire) faced down two [Galina's Knight](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Galina%27s+Knight)s; the [Galina's Knight](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Galina%27s+Knight)s appeared to have the upper hand, until two consecutive [Skizzik](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skizzik)s (one on turn four without kicker, the next on turn five with happy feet) came storming across the board.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/GPMINN01/945.jpg)Unfortunately, the kicked [Skizzik](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skizzik) and [Shivan Zombie](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shivan+Zombie) ran into Andrew's [Jilt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jilt), which he had sided in for just such an occasion. This excellent tempo card made all the difference in the match; with both players at nine life, a [Flametongue Kavu](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flametongue+Kavu) scorched Nikolaus's Legionnaire (no mana left to activate for anything), and the Green Bay player, not unlike Brett Favre on every other play, fumbled as he re-kicked the [Skizzik](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skizzik) and sent it in. This brought Andrew down to four but left no blockers; and a turn six [Lightning Angel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Angel) joined forces with the two Knights and [Flametongue Kavu](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flametongue+Kavu) to finish the hapless Wisconsinites off. Go Vikings! Ahem.


Sideboard decisions for the players: Andrew pulled out his late-game [Goblin Trenches](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Trenches) and a [Prophetic Bolt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Prophetic+Bolt) or two to make room for [Jilt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jilt) and [Dodecapod](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dodecapod). He felt the [Dodecapod](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dodecapod)s would still be useful, even if Nikolaus sided out the [Blazing Specter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blazing+Specter)s. In fact, the Specters did come out, in favor of two [Pure Reflection](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pure+Reflection)s, one [Obliterate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Obliterate), and another [Flametongue Kavu](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flametongue+Kavu).
