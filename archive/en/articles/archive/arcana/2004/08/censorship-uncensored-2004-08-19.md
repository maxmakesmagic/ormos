In Mark Rosewater's [*Unglued* Week feature article](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/feature/225), he mentions that the art of the card [Censorship](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Censorship) was made from a cropped piece of art from [Keeper of the Mind](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Keeper+of+the+Mind). 


"Matt Wilson, the card's illustrator, was then **Magic**'s art director and thought the use of censored art on [Censorship](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Censorship) would be funny."


 Here are the two cards in question. You can definitely see the similar color scheme going on in each.

| Keeper of the Mind | Censorship |

The art was cropped for [Keeper of the Mind](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Keeper+of+the+Mind) because the pose of Matt Wilson's female wizard was just a little on the risqu√© side. There was no nudity or anything, just a bit too much [Sex Appeal](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Sex%2BAppeal) for a [Miss Demeanor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Miss%2BDemeanor) (which are two other Matt Wilson *Unglued* cards, get it?):






With the black bars removed (but the pixellation preserved), you can see how the original art might have lined up.
