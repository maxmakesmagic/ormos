![repel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=repel)The first pack opened seemed very mediocre with Brett Shears taking [Repel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Repel) followed by Maher taking [Rampant Elephant](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rampant+Elephant), and Turian taking [Gravedigger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gravedigger). Everyone staggers their colors, being polite and aware of the people around them.

Things seem to go well for the first couple of packs, all the players seem to be friendly, but then in pack three Turian opens and takes [Painbringer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Painbringer), Louis Boileau follows with [Savage Firecat](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Savage+Firecat) and Walter "Goochie" Egli takes [Firebolt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Firebolt) (putting players four and five both in red for the rest of the draft). McKenna is seen shaking his head when he has to take [Morbid Hunger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Morbid+Hunger) in pack six when Pikula cuts him off from green.


Players pretty much stuck to their colors when they finally got established, and didn't hate draft. 


Here's a break down of what colors each player drafted:


![psychatog](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Psychatog)**Brett Shears:** Blue/White with Three [Mystic Zealot](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mystic+Zealot)s and two [Shelter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shelter)s  
**Bob Maher:** Red/Green with [Kamahl, Pit Fighter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kamahl%2C+Pit+Fighter)  
**Michael Turian:** Blue/Black with three [Psychatog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psychatog)s, [Aboshan, Cephalid Emperor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aboshan%2C+Cephalid+Emperor), and [Repentant Vampire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Repentant+Vampire)  
**Louis Boileau:** Red/White with [Savage Firecat](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Savage+Firecat)  
**Walter "Goochie" Egli:** Green/Red with two [Wild Mongrel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Mongrel)s with an [Overrun](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Overrun)  
**Timothy McKenna:** White/Black with two [Ghastly Demise](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ghastly+Demise)s and [Hallowed Healer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hallowed+Healer)  
**Christopher Pikula:** Blue/Green with [Stone-Tongue Basilisk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stone-Tongue+Basilisk)  
**Dustin Stern:** Black/Red with [Shower of Coals](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shower+of+Coals) and [Ghastly Demise](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ghastly+Demise)Michael Turian has an obviously strong deck and is a favorite for making top eight. For the other players in this draft it pretty much depends on pairings for who will make top eight.
