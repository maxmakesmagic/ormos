 *Mercadian Masques* rare.  
 This card was originally designed for *Urza's Destiny* but was pushed off to *Mercadian Masques* as it was too close to Treachery. Treachery remained as it used a mechanic (the "free" mechanic) unique to *Urza's Saga* block.

![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Two-Headed%20Dragon)#### Two-Headed Dragon


 *Mercadian Masques* rare.  
 When designing Two-Headed Dragon, R&D decided that the flavor of each head being able to block a different creature (the same flavor as the original Two-Headed Giant of Foriys) was too good to pass up, so the "block two creatures" ability made a comeback cameo in red.

![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Two-Headed%20Giant%20of%20Foriys)#### Two-Headed Giant of Foriys

 Alpha rare.  
 This card was the first card to allow a creature to block an additional creature. Foriys is a play on "four eyes" as the Two-Headed Giant has four eyes.
