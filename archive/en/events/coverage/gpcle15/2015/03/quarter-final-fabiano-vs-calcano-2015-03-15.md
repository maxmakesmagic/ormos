 Stybs has played Magic the world over, writing and drafting as part of the event coverage team and slinging Commander everywhere his decks will fit. 






With his recent success at other high level tournaments, it was little surprise to see Gerard Fabiano earning another Top 8. Already demonstrating success with *Khans of Tarkir* Limited earlier at Grand Prix Baltimore, Fabiano didn’t seem to miss a beat adding *Fate Reforged* to the mix.



Christian Calcano, too, had success this year on the Grand Prix circuit. His Top 8 appearance at Grand Prix Manilla was in Constructed, but Calcano’s other top finishes included Limited at both Washington D.C. and Philadelphia last year.



Calcano was the type of player you could never truly count out.



**The Decks**



Fabiano, like so many of his other drafts in the format, wielded a Sultai creation that pushed the fourty-card decklist to its limits. With numerous ways to both fill up his graveyard and exile it away for effects, like Murderous Cut, Treasure Cruise, and Sultai Scavenger, Fabiano’s plan was to outmuscle his opponent with card advantage before his library emptied out.



Calcano’s deck was dedicated black-green and built to stop opponents cold. Multiple copies of Archer’s Parapet could blockade the early game, while Feral Krushock, [Kin-Tree Invocation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kin-Tree+Invocation) and [Pine Walker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pine+Walker) promised to hit harder in the late game. Removal like [Rite of the Serpent](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rite+of+the+Serpent) could kill nearly any threat his fatties couldn’t overpower alone.



**The Games**



Calcano put the shields up early with Archer’s Parapet after Fabiano used [Despise](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Despise) to rip [Hooting Mandrills](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hooting+Mandrills) from Calcano’s hand. While [Kin-Tree Invocation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kin-Tree+Invocation) gave Calcano a 5/5 Spirit Warrior token, Fabiano’s [Aven Surveyor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aven+Surveyor) handled it neatly.



[Bitter Revelation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bitter+Revelation) pulled Fabiano further into his deck as he began to plink away in the air. [Rakshasa Vizier](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rakshasa+Vizier) promised to give Fabiano a much larger attacker soon.



“I know it’s going to be blowout city. I know you have it,” Calcano said, looking at the lone Swamp and stocked graveyard across the way for Fabiano. Indeed, when Calcano tried for [Pine Walker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pine+Walker) into Savage Punch, Fabiano used the [Murderous Cut](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Murderous+Cut) Calcano predicted but couldn’t really have known to completely upend any chance remaining.

*Christian Calcano had the read on the worst possible outcome but had no choice but to try anyway.*



“Of course I have it,” Fabiano said. “I always have it.” Reid Duke, Matt Sperling, and other onlookers clapped at the set up, call, execution, and exchange throughout the sequence of plays.



“I don’t think you could have won it from there anyway,” Fabiano said, grinning back at Calcano.



“You should change that ‘Best Play of the Weekend you saw’ moment to that,” Calcano said as he waved at the coverage reporters nearby. It was truly among the best moments seen that weekend thus far, and one that seemed fitting for Fabiano’s style.



The second game was a race for Calcano, using Archer’s Parapet and [Feral Krushok](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Feral+Krushok) to try and press in after multiple discard spells had torn his hand apart. [Kin-Tree Invocation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kin-Tree+Invocation) into [Shambling Attendants](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shambling+Attendants) left Calcano with plenty of power after the Krushok traded with the Attendants on Fabiano’s side.



Hooting Mandrill’s joined the 5/5 Spirit Warrior, but Fabiano bought more time with Rite of Undoing to undo the token. Finally clearing the [Hooting Mandrills](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hooting+Mandrills) with some blocks, Fabiano used [Disowned Ancestor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Disowned+Ancestor) and [Sultai Scavenger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sultai+Scavenger) to begin fighting back, and was rewarded when his post-combat [Mardu Skullhunter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mardu+Skullhunter) forced Calcano to discard [Sibsig Muckdraggers](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sibsig+Muckdraggers) – the last card in his hand.

*Gerard Fabiano’s deck had every trick and turn it needed to undo everything Calcano did.*



But Archer’s Parapet was eating away at Fabiano’s life every turn, at least until Fabiano’s [Aven Surveyor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aven+Surveyor) reset the Parapet to hand, and a second Skullhunter knocked it away.



“C’mon man…” Calcano sighed as Fabiano neatly took command of the game.



[Rite of the Serpent](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rite+of+the+Serpent) handled Fabiano’s [Sultai Scavenger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sultai+Scavenger) on Calcano’s next turn and [Ruthless Ripper](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ruthless+Ripper) looked to shore up Calcano’s side against Rakshasa Vizier, but [Throttle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Throttle) cleared the Ripper, and Fabiano found enough to push though the last damage with just four cards left in his library.



**Gerard Fabiano defeated Christian Calcano, 2-0.**
