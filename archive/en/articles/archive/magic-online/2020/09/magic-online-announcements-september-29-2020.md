Showcase Challenge Weekend
--------------------------


Players looking to prove their mettle against the best players in *Magic Online* will want to use their QPs to enter *Magic Online* Champions Showcase (MOCS) events such as the returning Showcase Challenges this weekend. These MOCS events are a set of linked events designed to highlight the best players on *Magic Online* each season, culminating in the Champions Showcase and its prize pool of $70,000 and a Split Championship invitation.


First up on Saturday, October 3, we have the Standard (6 a.m. PT), Modern (8 a.m. PT), and Vintage (10 a.m. PT) Showcase Challenges. Then on Sunday, October 4, we finish off with the Pioneer (6 a.m. PT), Legacy (8 a.m. PT), and *Zendikar Rising* Sealed (9 a.m. PT) Showcase Challenges. Each of these events requires 40 QPs to enter. The Top 8 finishers from each event will earn a qualification token to enter the appropriate Showcase Qualifier in December.

Build Notes
-----------


* Players purchasing redemption objects will now be prompted to confirm their shipping address.
* The "other side" reminder on the lower left of modal double-faced cards has been cleaned up and should be easier to read.
* The standard color used for blue text added to cards in the Duel Scene has returned to a darker and easier-to-read shade of blue.
