When sets are put together, art swaps happen all the time. Often a painting does a good job of illustrating the card it was comissioned for, but it does a *better* job of depicting a different card. So the art gets moved around.

The art for *Mirage*'s [Jungle Wurm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jungle+Wurm) and [Barbed-Back Wurm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Barbed-Back+Wurm) make a good example. If we had left the art alone, the cards would have looked like this:

The team felt that the art of Jungle Wurm eating someone seemed more black, and the art of Barbed-Back Wurm crashing through a forest seemed green, so they were switched.
