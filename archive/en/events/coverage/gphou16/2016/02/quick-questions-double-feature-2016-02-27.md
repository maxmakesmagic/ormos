It's a Quick Questions double feature! Grand Prix Houston is well under way, and I accosted a few players between rounds and get their opinions on both the Standard format and the Lone Star State.

**What is the most impactful card in Standard this weekend and why?**


I think maybe [Collected Company](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Collected+Company), because I always get really mad when people cast that card, I feel like I'm going to lose!


**What is the most Texan Magic card ever printed?**


Texan? I don't know. Are there any big hat cards? Or I think there's a card that's barbequing a pig, that's pretty Texan.

**What is the most impactful card in Standard this weekend and why?**


I think [Hardened Scales](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hardened+Scales) got a lot better with the printing of [Nissa, Voice of Zendikar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nissa%2C+Voice+of+Zendikar) so I think that'll have a big impact. We'll see.


**What is the most Texan Magic card ever printed?**


Texan? Maybe [Whirling Dervish](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Whirling+Dervish), because they're all about the horses here.

**What is the most impactful card in Standard this weekend and why?**


[Hardened Scales](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hardened+Scales), for sure. The new Nissa planeswalker, she just makes the card pretty busted.


**What is the most Texan Magic card ever printed?**


Texan card? Judging from outside, I'm going to say [Chaos Orb](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chaos+Orb), because it is chaos outside.

**What is the most impactful card in Standard this weekend and why?**


It's going to be [Reflector Mage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reflector+Mage) or [Sylvan Advocate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sylvan+Advocate), because they're just very good creatures. A 2/3 vigilance for two mana that grows into a sizeable 4/5 later on is just good early and good late, and it's overall a great card.


**What is the most Texan Magic card ever printed?**


Texan Magic card? I guess it depends on what your idea of Texan is, and to me it's one of the frontiers, where people are very traditional. So I would imagine something that goes back to American grassroots, cowboys, maybe some farmers, that sort of thing. Maybe the 1/4 white vigilance creature—[Affa Protector](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Affa+Protector). Something like that.

**What is the most impactful card in Standard this weekend and why?**


[Reflector Mage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reflector+Mage). It's just a really great card and the way Standard is set up there's two really powerful decks that you need to put pressure on, which are Rally and Ramp, and as a result it's not viable to play a deck that doesn't have creatures. [Reflector Mage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reflector+Mage) is so good against creatures, and everyone is forced to play with them because of these two other really powerful decks that are in the format.


**What is the most Texan Magic card ever printed?**


In general? Oh man . . . [Scout the Borders](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scout+the+Borders).

**What is the most impactful card in Standard this weekend and why?**


As I'm eating a Snickers bar here . . . it's got to be [Jace, Vryn's Prodigy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace%2C+Vryn%27s+Prodigy) still. That card is everywhere. Two-drop, comes down early, does everything you want it to, flashes back important spells . . . sorry, still eating Snickers here . . . but yeah, Jace.


**What is the most Texan Magic card ever printed?**


[Hurloon Minotaur](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hurloon+Minotaur). That is totally Texan. Look up the art on [Hurloon Minotaur](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hurloon+Minotaur), that is the embodiment of Texas.

**What is the most impactful card in Standard this weekend and why?**


I have to say that it's probably still Jace. We've had Jace around for a long time, but many, many, many games are still determined by who has the Jace on turn two. So, while there's plenty of new cards that make an impact, Jace is still a huge force.


**What is the most Texan Magic card ever printed?**


Most Texan Magic card ever printed? There's got to be some kind of wild bronco/wild horse/stampeding horse type card that I can't think of, something along those lines.
