**Game One** 


Fazzolari quickly revealed himself to be a Boros Burn player when he wasted no time in pointing [Shock](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shock) at his opponent on Turn 1.


He turned up the heat by curving out perfectly with [Ash Zealot](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ash+Zealot) and [Chandra's Phoenix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chandra%27s+Phoenix), whittling away at Swords' life total. When Swords presented [Courser of Kruphix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Courser+of+Kruphix) to block, [Magma Jet](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Magma+Jet) finished it off after [Ash Zealot](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ash+Zealot) dished out its first strike damage.


Swords could only manage [Xenagos, the Reveler](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Xenagos%2C+the+Reveler), making a Satyr to block. After burning the token with another [Magma Jet](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Magma+Jet), Fazzolari chose to ignore the planeswalker, instead mounting an alpha strike to reduce Swords to just 7 life.


With his death imminent, he decided to summon [Stormbreath Dragon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stormbreath+Dragon), keeping it back to block. While a wise choice, it was inconsequential. Fazzolari had enough burn ([Shock](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shock), [Lightning Strike](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Strike) and [Warleader's Helix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Warleader%27s+Helix)) in his grip to toast his opponent to a crisp.

*Fazzolari takes game one with the help of quick beaters and a flurry of burn spells.* 
**Game Two**
[Satyr Firedancer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Satyr+Firedancer) by Fazzolari was the first creature of the second game. Despite having [Mizzium Mortars](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mizzium+Mortars) in his opening seven, Swords declined to kill it, preferring to drop [Polukranos, World Eater](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Polukranos%2C+World+Eater) two turns later. If Swords could untap the next turn, he would be able to make it monstrous to get rid of the pesky [Satyr Firedancer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Satyr+Firedancer).


However, the entire plan was thrown out of the window when Fazzolari pointed [Shock](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shock) and [Lightning Strike](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Strike) at him, simultaneously dealing 5 damage to the 5/5 monster. [Satyr Firedancer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Satyr+Firedancer) had effectively doubled the output of all his burn spells!


Now realizing how powerful it is, Sword had decided to kill it the next turn, but found himself on the receiving end of a hasty [Spark Trooper](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spark+Trooper). Lurking at a familiarly precarious 7 life once again, Swords mulled over his options and decided on a second [Polukranos](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Polukranos%2C+World+Eater) and hoped for the best. [Warleader's Helix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Warleader%27s+Helix) and [Boros Charm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Boros+Charm) ended things there and then.

*Swords succumbs to the power of [Satyr Firedancer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Satyr+Firedancer) and [Spark Trooper](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spark+Trooper).* 
**James Fazzolari defeats Chester Swords 2-0.**
