 Nine years ago, Roland Chang showed up to The Vintage Championship with a Mishra's Workshop deck that caught everyone unprepared and steamrolled its way to victory. Today, the latest Vintage craze seems to be [Treasure Cruise](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treasure+Cruise), especially in [Delver of Secrets](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Delver+of+Secrets) style strategies. It seems the format has unwittingly moved to a place where Mishra's Workshop could, once again, be a force to be reckoned with. Chang is undefeated going into the eighth round here today, and his chances for Top 8 are looking very good.
