[Pro Tour-Charleston Preview: First Steps](/en/articles/archive/event-coverage/pro-tour-charleston-preview-first-steps-2006-06-12), by Brian David-Marshall


Charleston, South Carolina is nestled deep in Southern history and hospitality. Classic mansions and lush gardens are around every corner. Fort Sumter, where the first shots were fired during the U.S. Civil War, is situated on Charleston Harbor. Virtually unaltered since 1858, the expansive Aiken-Rhett House stands as the most intact urban villa showcasing life in antebellum Charleston. The Pro Tour visits Charleston on June 16-18.


Pro Tour-Charleston is a Team *Ravnica* Block Constructed format event with a last-chance qualifier run the day before the event starts. But you don't have to be a Pro to enjoy the Pro Tour -- there will be wall-to-wall **Magic**  to play in [Side Events](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=protour/charleston06/sideevents) all weekend with amazing prizes.
