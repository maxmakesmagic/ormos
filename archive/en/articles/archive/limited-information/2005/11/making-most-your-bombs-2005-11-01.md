With *Ravnica* only just arriving on ***Magic** Online* and the *Ravnica* beta being lacking in triple *Ravnica* drafts over the last few weeks, my testing of that format has halted somewhat recently. While I've been able to get in an occasional real-life draft, the vast majority of my play normally takes place online. With *Ravnica* draft queues up and running this week I'll soon start having some draft-picks and draft walk-throughs to discuss, but for today I'm going to tackle that other limited format: sealed deck.

With *Ravnica* being released online there'll be a lot of sealed deck play happening this week as both the pre-release events and pre-release leagues will use this format. There's a lot to think about when constructing your *Ravnica* sealed deck and as I've only had one prior *Ravnica* sealed deck article I'm sure we could all use the practice.

So with that in mind I'll kick straight off with the card pool I opened for this week's column.

### The Cardpool

It's one *Ravnica* tournament pack and two *Ravnica* boosters used here, as that'll be the standard used in pre-release tournaments and leagues. 

Before getting to the cards I want to talk a little about the best way to actually sort the cards you open. This might sound silly but you really need to think about this. The guild structure of *Ravnica* makes sealed deck very different from what we'd normally expect.

You still need to separate out the five colours, but you don't want to set them out with allied colours next to each other as you might have in *Invasion* for example. This time you want to arrange them with the dual-guild colours in the middle. The best order is:




|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Blue** | – | **Black** | – | **Green** | – | **White** | – | **Red** |

This allows you to put all of the guild and hybrid cards between their appropriate colours so you basically end up with nine piles of cards:




|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Blue** | – | **Black** | – | **Green** | – | **White** | – | **Red** |
|  | **Dimir** | – | **Golgari** | – | **Selesnya** | – | **Boros** |  |

Sometimes you'll have an odd generic artifact like [Grifter's Blade](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grifter%27s+Blade) or [Terrarion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Terrarion) but you can just make a note of those and put them to one side.

A lot of times you'll have cards that sit in one colour but are actually guild specific cards. For example I might play [Votary of the Conclave](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Votary+of+the+Conclave) in a Selesnya deck, but certainly not in a Boros deck. [Boros Fury-Shield](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Boros+Fury-Shield) is another card that fits in that Guild but that you probably wouldn't play in Selesnya. It's up to you where you put these as you can put them with the appropriate guild cards if you want. I might do that for some cards but in general I don't. There are too many cards like [Mortipede](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mortipede) or [Transluminant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Transluminant) that might actually make the cut even when you aren't able to activate their abilities simply because you need the filler. 

With all of that in mind, the cards opened for this exercise amount to:

I've also saved the cardpool in ***Magic** Online* format so you can download [the .DEC file](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=magic/decks/sw90_ltdinfo.dec), open it up in ***Magic** Online* and try building it yourself if you so desire.

### The Hits

The first thing I look for when first examining a pool like this are any 'bombs' (the very best cards) that might be included. This deck has actually fared well in this area, as there's both [Glare of Subdual](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glare+of+Subdual) and [Plague Boiler](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plague+Boiler). 



|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Glare of Subdual | Plague Boiler |

[Necroplasm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Necroplasm) can be nasty too if you drop it at an opportune moment. For those who are unaware, [Dark Confidant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dark+Confidant) is not normally playable in sealed deck. Drawing an extra card every turn is nice but when you flip up a [Golgari Rotwurm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Golgari+Rotwurm) followed by a [Scatter the Seeds](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scatter+the+Seeds) you probably won't be living to make use of those cards.

There are a few uncommons here that I really like in Sealed too. [Pollenbright Wings](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pollenbright+Wings) and [Overwhelm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Overwhelm) are both capable of outright winning games all by themselves and are both great cards in the slower sealed deck format. 

[Dimir Guildmage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dimir+Guildmage) is another card that's good anytime, but that will win games if it's unanswered in the mid-to-late game. Drawing two cards every turn while ensuring your opponent can't hold on to any tricks is a sure-fire way to swing a game in your favour.

Already looking at those cards we can definitely see that both black and green are well represented. These are two of the most common colours used in sealed deck play but there's no doubt they contain a lot of powerful cards already here.

### Reviewing the cardpool

Once you've noted any particularly powerful cards you then want to go through the rest. It's best to go through the card pool one colour at a time, paying special attention to the guild cards along the way. You should be reviewing each colour as a whole, looking for its strengths and weaknesses, any particularly great cards you have, and how deep each colour is. 

**Blue**

Blue is actually quite deep with only [Muddle the Mixture](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Muddle+the+Mixture) being truly unplayable. Three Dismissers makes for a very heavy top end of the mana curve but they're all still playable. We're missing flyers here unfortunately but there is a sole Entrancer if a Dimir milling deck was something we wanted to go for. There's a lot of playable filler here but nothing to get excited about.

**Black**

This colour is not as deep but it does have more power. The aforementioned [Necroplasm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Necroplasm) is a fine card. I've played with that a few times and being able to instantly wipe out all Saprolings at the end of the turn [Necroplasm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Necroplasm) is played is often relevant enough by itself. On two past occasions I've managed to drop a [Strands of Undeath](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Strands+of+Undeath) on the [Necroplasm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Necroplasm), making myself able to regenerate it from its own effect once it gets three counters. At that point it simply grows and grows over future turns and you soon have a creature that's very difficult for an opponent to manage. With a Strands in this cardpool it's a nice combo to look out for.

There are two solid removal spells here as well, which is definitely another plus. The creature base is weak but that's often the case with black. [Sewerdreg](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sewerdreg) is frequently unblockable in sealed play due to opposing swamps, but other weaker creatures like [Roofstalker Wight](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Roofstalker+Wight) and [Sadistic Augermage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sadistic+Augermage) may well have to be relied on to fill out the creature count.

The Dimir cards are decent enough with the Guildmage being the most powerful by itself. However, we really need to pay attention to the Transmute ability of this guild in this pool. We have a [Plague Boiler](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plague+Boiler) and a [Glare of Subdual](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glare+of+Subdual) in this pool. We also have a [Perplex](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Perplex) which can tutor for the Plagueboiler, and both [Clutch of the Undercity](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Clutch+of+the+Undercity) and [Dimir House Guard](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dimir+House+Guard) which can Transmute into the Glare. All of these cards need extra attention paid to them during the deck building process. If the mana can support it we definitely want to be playing the equivalent of three Glares of Subdual if possible. The [Dimir Aqueduct](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dimir+Aqueduct) may help us do that.

**Green**

There's not a lot in green but what is here is fine. There are three cards that give us some Saprolings and they will be very welcome if we're able to get the Glare into play. It's a shame there are no [Siege Wurm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Siege+Wurm)s to Convoke out but the Saprolings could also help us make the most of the [Overwhelm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Overwhelm). [Farseek](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Farseek) and [Gather Courage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gather+Courage) are both welcome too.

The Golgari cards add a lot here. [Shambling Shell](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shambling+Shell) and [Golgari Rotwurm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Golgari+Rotwurm) are both excellent additions to the creature base of any Golgari deck. [Plague Boiler](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plague+Boiler) is obviously far superior when you can add or remove counters at will, and [Gaze of the Gorgon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gaze+of+the+Gorgon) is a great combat trick. All four of those cards are very good reasons to look at a heavy Golgari theme.

**White**

White has a lot of depth with easily the highest number of cards. Why did they all have to be so bad though?! There's really very little here to write home about. There are two solid flyers, and a few other playable creatures too but nothing that's crying out to be included. It's a shame to have such a deep colour with so few good cards in it, but there's no point in dwelling on that fact. The [Courier Hawk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Courier+Hawk)s may well be playable to help get those [Scatter the Seeds](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scatter+the+Seeds) out a turn earlier, and they can still attack and tap an opposing creature if the [Glare of Subdual](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glare+of+Subdual) is in play. While they aren't great they'd probably get played in that deck.

The Selesnya cards add a lot. [Glare of Subdual](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glare+of+Subdual) is one of the most powerful limited cards in the set and I definitely plan on including it if at all possible. The other two Selesnya cards are both great too, and the Signet may well come in handy to fix the mana of what is sure to be at least a three colour deck.

**Red**

The best two commons ([Galvanic Arc](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Galvanic+Arc) and [Viashino Fangtail](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Viashino+Fangtail)) are missing and there's basically nothing that replaces them. The removal is weak and the creatures are weak. There's no reason here to want to include red in the deck.

The Boros cards add some more playable creatures but they aren't worth including red for. 

### Choosing the colours

It seems quite apparent from the initial overview that black and green are both going to make up a major part of the deck. They have a lot of solid cards, a bomb or two, and our best removal spells as well. 

Red is obviously immediately out and with the best cards being the cheap Boros creatures, it isn't even a colour I'd want to consider splashing as those cards all want to be cast early in the game.

White has about two cards that I really like the look of – [Divebomber Griffin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Divebomber+Griffin) and [Conclave Equenaut](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Conclave+Equenaut) – but that isn't a lot to base a deck around. There are the three excellent Selenya cards here, but to make white one of the base colours of the deck would require playing too many random one-power monsters for my liking. The [Wojek Siren](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wojek+Siren)s aren't terrible but you generally want your spells to do more and I'd rather have a [Gather Courage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gather+Courage) in most situations.

The cards I'd immediately look to include would be:


> 
> **1CC**: [Gather Courage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gather+Courage)  
> **2CC**: [Fists of Ironwood](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fists+of+Ironwood), [Last Gasp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Last+Gasp), [Clinging Darkness](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Clinging+Darkness), [Farseek](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Farseek)  
> **3CC**: [Necroplasm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Necroplasm), [Shambling Shell](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shambling+Shell), [Trophy Hunter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Trophy+Hunter), Plagueboiler  
> **4CC**: [Dimir House Guard](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dimir+House+Guard), [Gaze of the Gorgon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gaze+of+the+Gorgon), [Strands of Undeath](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Strands+of+Undeath)  
> **5CC**: [Scatter the Seeds](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scatter+the+Seeds) x 2, [Golgari Rotwurm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Golgari+Rotwurm), [Sewerdreg](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sewerdreg)  
> **6+CC**: [Overwhelm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Overwhelm)
> 
> 
> 

That's a total of 17 very solid cards. While it's a fine start it also leaves quite a lot of room for manoeuvring. 

If I'm playing green there's absolutely no way I'm ever leaving out [Glare of Subdual](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glare+of+Subdual). The Glare and the [Selesnya Signet](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Selesnya+Signet) to help support it would be my next two automatic inclusions. 

That takes us up to nineteen cards in total and even with the [Farseek](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Farseek) and the [Selesnya Signet](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Selesnya+Signet) I think I'd want to play 17 lands here. The deck has a number of expensive cards and doesn't want to miss any land drops early in the game. 

So that leaves only three cards to decide upon. What are the choices?

### Choosing the final few

I think there are two basic options here really: to either go for a blue splash or not.

![Dimir Aqueduct](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Dimir+Aqueduct)The Dimir splash is helped by the addition of the Aqueduct and the [Farseek](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Farseek) but it'll still hurt the manabase slightly. The Dimir splash would basically give you access to cards that can Transmute into either [Plague Boiler](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plague+Boiler) or [Glare of Subdual](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glare+of+Subdual). Having tutors for those cards is fantastic as they're both extremely powerful cards. This option is very risky though. For it to work you might actually need to draw both splash colours as you'd need to find the blue to search for the Glare and then the white to cast it. With only [Farseek](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Farseek), a land and a Signet fixing the mana here that might not be possible.

The other option is just to fill out the deck with whatever on-colour cards we can find. There's already a [Dimir House Guard](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dimir+House+Guard) in the deck which can Transmute for the [Glare of Subdual](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glare+of+Subdual) and that doesn't require us to find a fourth colour to be able to do that.

The problem with this idea is that there are simply so few cards worth including. We still need to find four more cards to go from the nineteen currently decided upon to the 23 we need.

[Sadistic Augermage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sadistic+Augermage) would be the next probable inclusion, despite its ability hurting both our opponents and us equally. [Roofstalker Wight](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Roofstalker+Wight) could make it in next even though we'd never have access to blue mana. It would at least give us another early drop to help power up the [Scatter the Seeds](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scatter+the+Seeds). I would like to include the good white cards but both the decent flyers require access to double white and that's just as hard to get as the blue is.

[Seeds of Strength](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seeds+of+Strength) and [Pollenbright Wings](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pollenbright+Wings) could both make it in but the nineteen card build only has nine cards that are (or that make) creatures and so we need to improve upon that. 

I think I would again look to the Transmute cards and include one copy of [Shred Memory](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shred+Memory). This can Transmute into [Last Gasp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Last+Gasp) or [Fists of Ironwood](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fists+of+Ironwood) and can also fetch the [Farseek](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Farseek) or [Selesnya Signet](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Selesnya+Signet) to help out with the mana fixing.

![Dimir Guildmage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Dimir+Guildmage)[Dimir Guildmage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dimir+Guildmage) is another possible choice as it can be cast for BB and still has one ability we could activate. [Golgari Thug](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Golgari+Thug) is also a possible inclusion but that card has always been awful for my opponents every time they have cast it and I personally wouldn't want to play it.It's a difficult decision but I think I'd have to pass on the blue cards here. If there was just a [Dimir Signet](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dimir+Signet) (which could be Transmuted for) or another [Farseek](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Farseek) or [Civic Wayfinder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Civic+Wayfinder) then I would include the blue but I don't think it's possible with this deck.

With that in mind I'd go with the on-colour choice and my personal selection would include the following cards:

[Dimir Guildmage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dimir+Guildmage) – A two mana 2/2 is solid and I think I can cast this often enough for it to be useful. The discard ability is nice to have as well. There's one other reason for including it, which I'll get to in a second.  
[Sadistic Augermage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sadistic+Augermage) – An annoying ability but a three mana 3/1 that is easy to cast just can't be ignored in this deck.  
[Shred Memory](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shred+Memory) – This Transmutes into several different options and you never know, it might one day shut down a [Grave-Shell Scarab](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grave-Shell+Scarab) perhaps.   
[Roofstalker Wight](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Roofstalker+Wight) – Another early drop that increases the creature count and could help power out the [Scatter the Seeds](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scatter+the+Seeds).

The hardest card to cut for me was the [Pollenbright Wings](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pollenbright+Wings) but with it being in the splash colour, and with so few decent-sized creatures I just don't think it'd have the impact I wanted in this deck. Several of the above cards are a lot worse but the deck needs its higher creature count. One possible option would be the possibility of dropping the [Strands of Undeath](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Strands+of+Undeath) in place of this. With [Plague Boiler](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plague+Boiler) and [Necroplasm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Necroplasm) in the deck though, I like the regeneration that card offers.

I would also finally include the [Dimir Aqueduct](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dimir+Aqueduct) in place of one of the Swamps. This would give me a chance of activating the Guildmage and Wight and wouldn't really hurt the manabase significantly.

Putting these cards in gives the following final deck:

While it isn't the best 23 cards I've ever seen it's far from being the worst and there are some powerful cards in there. I feel fairly sure this deck would get you either a 3-2 or a 4-1 finish in a pre-release league, with a 5-0 possible if the Glare turned up more often than not.

I hope you've enjoyed today's little exercise. I'm sure this isn't the only possible build so if you think you have a better one I'd encourage you to share it in the forums.
