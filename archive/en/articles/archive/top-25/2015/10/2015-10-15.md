In this Pro Tour week, welcome to our latest look at the *Magic* Top 25 Pro Rankings. We thought that there would be a goodly number of ranked players on show at Grand Prix Madison this past weekend, but even we were surprised to find that the actual number was an amazing *20* out of our Top 25. Of course, not all of them could go the distance, but it's worth noting that, of the 46 players who were still in contention for the Grand Prix title when there were still three rounds left to go, more than half will be competing at the Pro Tour in Milwaukee this coming weekend. *Magic*—a game that takes a not inconsiderable amount of skill, in case you didn't know . . .


When the dust settled, our ranked players were paced by Paul Rietzl, who turned Sunday into a day of Pro Tour Draft preparation. Sunday morning was his first ever *Battle for Zendikar* draft. Sunday afternoon was his second, and booked his place in a third draft—that one being in the Top 8. With a quarterfinal loss, Rietzl moves up two places in the rankings, taking him to No. 2, and now he finds only No. 1-ranked Eric Froehlich ahead of him heading into the huge shakeup that is Pro Tour *Battle for Zendikar*.


In some ways it was a surprise to see Rietzl as the only ranked player in the Top 8 at GP Madison, but that becomes understandable when you consider that the Top 8 also included the likes of Hall of Famer Raphaël Lévy (the eventual winner), *Magic Online* champion Magnus Lantto, former Player of the Year Jérémy Dezani, and US Pro Sam Pardee. Still, outside the Top 8 there were points for many of our Top 25. Eric Froehlich, Owen Turtenwald, and Paulo Vitor Damo da Rosa each picked up 3 points. Ondřej Stráský, Shahar Shenhar, Steve Rubin, Antonio Del Moral León each added 1 point to their early season campaigns, while Alexander Hayne and Andrew Cuneo finished inside the Top 100 but just outside the points.


So, as we head to Milwaukee, Eric Froehlich continues to lead the way in a top half-dozen that is all-American, with Rietzl, Seth Manfield, Mike Sigrist, Owen Turtenwald, and Sam Black leading the chasing pack of outstanding talent. Jason Chung of New Zealand joins the Top 25 thanks to his Top 16 performance at Grand Prix Sydney last weekend. Now he has to defend his place in the standings on the biggest stage of all. Join us next week for all the huge swings we get every time the Pro Tour comes to town, right here at the home of the *Magic* Top 25 Pro Rankings.
