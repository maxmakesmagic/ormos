**Will Craddock:** [Outland Colossus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Outland+Colossus). That card is basically just [The Abyss](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=The+Abyss). This is a low-removal set, and all the removal is expensive. You can just play this and win in one or two turns if they can’t answer it.
