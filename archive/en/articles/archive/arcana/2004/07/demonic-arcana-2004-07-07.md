Although it is Demon Week here on the site, we've shown lots of nifty demonic tidbits previously in Magic Arcana. Here is a compilation of some of the better demonic Arcanas:

* **[Sketches: Grinning Demon](/en/articles/archive/sketches-grinning-demon-2002-09-17)** - See the development of the art of Ol' Grinny.
* **[*Onslaught* wallpaper and screensavers](/en/articles/archive/wallpaper-and-screensavers-2002-10-03)** - A [Grinning Demon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grinning+Demon) desktop wallpaper is featured as one of the goodies linked from the *Onslaught* product page.
* **[Sketches: Havoc Demon](/en/articles/archive/sketches-havoc-demon-2003-01-28)** - Check out how the look of the Thomas Baxa demon came to be.
* **[The new look of tokens](/en/articles/archive/new-look-tokens-2003-09-24)** - A peek at token promo cards in the new card face, featuring the [Promise of Power](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Promise+of+Power) demon token.

And now let's add to the list -- here's a new demonic tidbit for today.


### *Mirrodin* Demon Horns


 Although they were painted by three different artists, the look of demon horns in *Mirrodin* block is very consistent. Compare the jagged, curving horns of [Reiver Demon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reiver+Demon), the [Promise of Power](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Promise+of+Power) token card, and of course, [Demon's Horn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Demon%27s+Horn):
