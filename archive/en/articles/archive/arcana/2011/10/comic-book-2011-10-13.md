Well, now we're prepared to tell you a little more about it. Part of the announcement on [IDW's site](http://idwpublishing.com/news/article/1938) mentioned that select issues will make available exclusive, playable, alternate-art cards. Here's one now!

That's Dack Fayden, the greatest thief in the Multiverse. He's a Planeswalker. To learn more about him, watch for the comic book!
