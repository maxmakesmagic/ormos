Coming into Grand Prix Beijing 2016, there were only a handful of players who were also qualified for Pro Tour *Shadows over Innistrad* next weekend. Among them were Makihito Mihara and Shintaro Ishimura. Coming into the 7th round, both players were undefeated.


Makihito Mihara is one of the greats of the Japanese *Magic* community. After winning the World Championships in 2006, he went on to Top 8 a total of 5 Pro Tours before being inducted to the Hall of Fame. Mihara crafted a Black Green Vampire deck. Along with heavy hitters such as [Markov Dreadknight](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Markov+Dreadknight), Mihara also had a sleeper combo of [Call the Bloodline](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Call+the+Bloodline) and [Sanitarium Skeleton](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sanitarium+Skeleton).


His opponent, Shintaro Ishimura, is no slouch to competitive *Magic*. Better known by his online persona, rizer, Ishimura has three Grand Prix Top 8s to his name and was a quarterfinalist at Pro Tour Paris in 2011. Ishimura constructed a White-Blue-Green Humans deck out of his sealed pool. Filled to the brim with Equipment and synergistic human cards, he looked to end his opponents quickly.


The Games
=========


Ishimura's Humans deck came out of the gates quickly with a [Thraben Inspector](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thraben+Inspector) and [True-Faith Censer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=True-Faith+Censer). On the other side of the table, Mihara's start was slow, with just a [Hinterland Logger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hinterland+Logger).


The Inspector pushed through some damage and when Mihara attacked with his werewolf on the next turn Ishimura used [Strength of Arms](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Strength+of+Arms) to remove the newly transformed 4/2.

The players traded damage back and forth, eventually, Mihara assembled [Call the Bloodline](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Call+the+Bloodline) and [Sanitarium Skeleton](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sanitarium+Skeleton) to power out an army of vampires. He topped it off with [Markov Dreadknight](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Markov+Dreadknight).


Ishimura had a quick answer for the vampire in the form of [Avacynian Missionaries](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Avacynian+Missionaries), which he immediately transformed. When Ishimura went for a lethal attack on his following turn, Mihara used [Murderous Compulsion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Murderous+Compulsion) to take out [Lunarch Inquisitors](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lunarch+Inquisitors), bringing back his [Markov Dreadknight](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Markov+Dreadknight) and giving him lethal damage on his following turn.


**Mihara 1-0 Ishimura**


Ishimura started the second game with [Thalia's Lieutenant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thalia%27s+Lieutenant). The two players traded removal spells: Ishimura's [Rabid Bite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rabid+Bite) to remove Mihara's nealy minted [Deathcap Cultivator](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deathcap+Cultivator), and Mihara's [Dead Weight](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dead+Weight) to remove the Human Soldier.


[Intrepid Provisioner](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Intrepid+Provisioner) and [Solitary Hunter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Solitary+Hunter) were the next plays from Ishimura. Mihara countered with a [Pack Guardian](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pack+Guardian), allowing him to drop Ishimura to 14.


When Ishimura traded his creatures for the [Pack Guardian](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pack+Guardian), Mihara used [Macabre Waltz](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Macabre+Waltz) to bring the 4/3 back to his hand.


From there Ishimura was unable to deal with Mihara's onslaught of creatures and fell a few turns later.
