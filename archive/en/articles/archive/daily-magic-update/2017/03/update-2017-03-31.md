The Daily *Magic* Update is a roundup of everything *Magic* you should know on March 31, 2017. Today's Update is brought to you by [Grand Prix San Antonio](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/gpsa17) and the team experience.


Today's Must
============


1. [The *Magic* Art of John Avon: Light](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76nChQJGMP4&feature=youtu.be) | TheMagicManSam

For many, John Avon basic lands are the pinnacle of the basic land experience (yes, experience—some people are very serious about their basic lands). So it's about time TheMagicManSam reviewed Avon's work in another gorgeously edited video that covers his style, inspirations, and what makes him so popular.

What to Watch This Weekend
==========================


1. [Grand Prix San Antonio](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/gpsa17) | [twitch.tv/magic](https://www.twitch.tv/magic) | 9:15 a.m. CT/7:15 a.m. PT/1:15 p.m. UTC

What has six thumbs, three different Modern decks, and a Grand Prix trophy? The winners of Grand Prix San Antonio, of course. Find out who meets that criteria by watching Saturday and Sunday with full coverage of the unique Team Unified format. I promise the commentators will have better jokes than this one. Mostly.


After Those, Read, Watch, or Listen to These
============================================


1. [GP San Antonio Team Power Rankings](http://www.channelfireball.com/articles/gp-san-antonio-team-power-rankings/) | ChannelFireball | Luis Scott-Vargas

This article is beautiful in its simplicity. LSV ranks known teams for Grand Prix San Antonio based on a "decks in Modern" scale. It's full of beats on his friends, actual information, and even more beats. Highly entertaining and highly worth your time.


1. [*Magic: The Gathering* *Amonkhet* Open House](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3RkQURV9wU) | MTG Young Mage | The Rhino

Saturday, April 15 is the *Amonkhet* Open House, where you can bring a friend to teach them to play *Magic* and get free cards, and the Rhino is excited. In this video, he tells you all about Open House and says he'll be there playing and teaching.

1. [*Magic: The Gathering*'s Head Designer Has a Damn Hard Job](http://compete.kotaku.com/magic-the-gatherings-head-designer-has-a-damn-hard-job-1793792384) | Kotaku | JR Goldberg

This is a lengthy and informative interview with Mark Rosewater by an outlet that doesn't often do lengthy and informative articles on *Magic*, so it offers an interesting perspective on what makes Rosewater's job so very difficult (and it's not answering questions on [Blogatog](http://markrosewater.tumblr.com/)).


1. [Glorybringer, the Gideon-Killer](http://www.toplevelpodcast.com/glorybringer/) | Top Level Podcast | Patrick Chapin and Mike Flores

While typing this out, I accidentally wrote "Top Level Podcats." That has nothing to do with the content of this podcast, I just thought it was a great name for a podcast about top-level cats.


This podcast, however, is not about cats. It's about Glorybringer and the wrath it can bring to [Gideon, Ally of Zendikar](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gideon%2C+Ally+of+Zendikar) and basically everyone else, too.


Top 25
======


1. Larsson moves on up

Ten spots is a *huge* leap forward, and two players made jumps at or nearly at that many places this week. Joel Larsson, who just, you know, [won a Grand Prix](http://edit.magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/gporl17), jumped up ten spots to No. 11, while Eduardo Sajgalic went from No. 23 to 14, a monumental nine places up. Meanwhile, Martin Jůza re-joined the rankings after a bit of a hiatus.

I'm guessing my invite was lost in the mail with that signed copy of [Panharmonicon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Panharmonicon). But, hey, I'm super happy for everyone else going.


Deck of the Day
===============


1. [The\_Gunslinger's Modern Green-White Aggro Lands](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/mtgo-standings/competitive-modern-constructed-league-2017-03-30)

Originally, my plan for this slot was to look for examples of the three decks [Frank Karsten recommended](http://www.channelfireball.com/articles/the-ideal-3-deck-configuration-for-san-antonio/) for this weekend's Grand Prix San Antonio, but while looking for decks I came across this beauty that I'm calling Green-White Aggro Lands, because all of those are adjectives that describe part of the deck. Hey, creative deck naming isn't really my shtick.


At first glance, this looks like a normal, aggressive green and white deck. You've got [Noble Hierarch](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Noble+Hierarch), [Knight of the Reliquary](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Knight+of+the+Reliquary), [Tarmogoyf](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf), [Scavenging Ooze](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scavenging+Ooze), and [Voice of Resurgence](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Voice+of+Resurgence)—pretty much your stock green-white gang. But then you see [Tireless Tracker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tireless+Tracker) and [Renegade Rallier](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Renegade+Rallier), and you start to think maybe something is up. Then you see [Azusa, Lost but Seeking](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Azusa%2C+Lost+but+Seeking); [Crucible of Worlds](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crucible+of+Worlds); and [Courser of Kruphix](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Courser+of+Kruphix) and you *know* something is up.


So basically you have a mostly aggressive green-white deck that looks to get equally aggressive with [Ghost Quarter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ghost+Quarter)s while utilizing [Horizon Canopy](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Horizon+Canopy) as well, tying it all together with [Collected Company](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Collected+Company).


It's creative and, apparently, competitive, as The\_Gunslinger went 5-0 in a Competitive Modern League with the deck. I don't expect to see it at Grand Prix San Antonio, but I imagine the surprise factor would be high.
