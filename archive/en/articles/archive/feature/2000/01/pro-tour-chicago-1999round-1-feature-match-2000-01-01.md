| Raphael Levy |
| Jakub Slemr |

**Game 1**


Slemr got a quick start by playing a turn 2 Tinker for a Phyrexian Processor, paying ten life for the ability to make 10/10 creatures, while Levy played out a Bird of Paradise and a Survival of the Fittest. Slemr then made a token with City of Traitors tricks while Levy survivaled for Squee, then for an Uktabi Orangutan to kill the processor.


The 10/10 Processor Beast then ate the monkey, and Slemr followed it up with two Mana Vaults and a Phyrexian Colossus.


Levy then started to abuse Squee by going to get a Peacekeeper, eventually getting a second Squee, then a Gilded Drake. Levy Arcane Denialed Slemr's Masticore, then a turn later, stopped a crumbling sanctuary with 2 Arcane Denials to one. With Levy up 19 to 5 life due to the processor, Mana Vault and mana burn damage, with the Colussus impending, Slemr conceded.


LEVY 1 - SLEMR 0


**Game 2**


Slemr got a quick start with a Mana Vault, Grim Monolith, Phyrxian Furnace, and Thran Dynamo in the first 2 turns while Levy played a couple nonbasic lands and a Wall of Roots. Slemr then tossed down a turn 3 Back to Basics as Levy tries to run on Undiscovered Paradise and creature mana, playing a Quirion Ranger. Slemr brought out a Masticore until Levy had enough mana to Survival for a Gilded Drake, then let the Masticore drop. While Levy choked on his mana, Slemr pushed through a tinker through an Arcane Denial, then dropped a Phyrexian Colossus for 11, and a Masticore. Levy Conceded.


LEVY 1 - SLEMR 1


**Game 3**


Levy started with a Llanowar Elves and land as Slemr played a Turn 2 Mana Vault and sat. Levy Vampiric Tutored, then played a Null Rod on his third turn, with Slemr's Mana Leak being Force of Willed. When Levy played a Devout Witness on turn 4, Slemr conceded.


Levy 2-1
