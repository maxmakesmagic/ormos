We're still more than a week away from the start of ***Magic** 2015* previews, but we always get a little antsy around preview time, eager to show off some of the seriously cool cards and art that await you.


We also happen to be getting really close to the release of ***Magic** 2015—Duels of the Planeswalkers*, a seriously cool game we, well, just really can't wait to start showing you.


Why not tackle both in one Arcana?


You see, when you purchase *Duels of the Planeswalkers*, you get this cool six-card promotional booster featuring one of two alternative-art promo cards. Those promo cards just happen to also be in ***Magic** 2015*, and just happen to also be pretty awesome.


You've already scrolled past this to see them, haven't you? We don't blame you.

If you purchase *Duels of the Planeswalkers* for Xbox 360 or Xbox One, you'll receive exclusive access to the alternative-art Soul of Ravnica. Access to the truly beastly Soul of Zendikar, on the other hand, comes exclusively with purchases for all of the other available platforms, including iPad, PC via Steam, Android tablet via the Amazon App Store, and Google Play.


If you just can't wait and need to get a little bit more *Duels of the Planeswalkers*, be sure to check out the [gameplay trailer](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/arcana/1512)!
