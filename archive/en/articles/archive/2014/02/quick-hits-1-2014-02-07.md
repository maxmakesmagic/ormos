***Reid Duke (No. 4-ranked player, Grand Prix Miami winner)**: Either a late-game bomb, or removal is really good. I really like opening Bile Blight*

So in the later packs you can grab all the Griptide and Journey's End that you see.* 



![](https://media.wizards.com/legacy/mtg/images/daily/events/sss14/qh_verhey.jpg)***Gavin Verhey (Magic R&D Designer)**: The Archetypes really allow you to 'go wide' early. The Archetype of Courage is really aggressively costed; you can slam it and move in.*
