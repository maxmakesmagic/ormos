The *Gatecrash* card [Rapid Hybridization](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rapid+Hybridization) shows a human in the process of turning into a Frog Lizard.

And now, here's the process of turning the concept of "a human in the process of turning into a Frog Lizard" into card art!


The first step was the art description. This is what was sent to artist Jack Wang:



> Color: Blue spell (Simic Guild)
> 
> 
> Location: In the middle of a Ravnican square.
> 
> 
> Action: Show us a mage who is being mutated into a creature with the head of something resembling a goliath tiger fish with the neck flaps from a frilled lizard (or that frilled dinosaur from Jurassic Park) mixed in, the body of a bullfrog that is more proportioned like a gorilla. He is ripping out of his mage robes as he mutates. These are guidelines. Have fun with it. If there's room, show a horrified onlooker.
> 
> 
> Focus: The mutated former mage.
> 
> 
> Mood: Freakish monster unleashed.
> 
> 
> 

Next, the artist turns in a sketch to the **Magic** Creative Team to make sure things are going in the right direction. Here's Jack's sketch:

That looked great, so Jack was given the thumbs-up to proceed to the final art. Which looks like this!

So that's what a human in the *process* of turning into a Frog Lizard looks like. But what about the final result? Well, because there's a token card, we happen to have that, too! Here's the art description:



> Color: Blue creature (Simic Guild)
> 
> 
> Location: Unimportant
> 
> 
> Action: Show us a creature with the head of something resembling a goliath tiger fish with the neck flaps from a frilled lizard (or that frilled dinosaur from Jurassic Park) mixed in, the body of a bullfrog that is more proportioned like a gorilla. At the foot of the creature are some crumpled mage robes. These are guidelines. Have fun with it.
> 
> 
> Focus: The mutant creature.
> 
> 
> Mood: Freakish and powerful.
> 
> 
> Notes: This is the final version of the creature that your other piece shows.
> 
> 
> 

Naturally, this assignment also went to Jack Wang. And here's the sketch for the full Frog Lizard:

Again, it looks great. So here's the glorious full-color Frog Lizard, for your enjoyment and nightmares! Note that all the horrified onlookers are gone; they've probably run away in horror. Or been eaten.
