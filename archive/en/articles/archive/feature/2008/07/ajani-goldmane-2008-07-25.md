*Ajani Goldmane is a planeswalker who wields white magic. His specialty is magic of the purification of body and soul: spells that heal and strengthen his allies, and spells that evoke the inner, spiritual essence of others.*


Ajani Goldmane is torn between his leonin ferocity and his sense of justice. He was born as an outcast within his own family, an albino leonin never accepted by the rest of his pride. The only person who cared about him was his brother Jazal, the leader of their pride and Ajani's inspiration. Ajani had always shown potential as a mage and healer, but had assumed his main calling was to be a warrior in Jazal's service. The day that Ajani's brother was assassinated by unknown forces was the day that Ajani's planeswalker spark ignited, and everything changed.


No longer could Ajani worry about his tiny problems of social acceptance. His quest to discover his brother's killer has led him into a tangle of intrigue woven by mysterious forces, forcing him to broaden his skills as a warrior and to unlock new potential within himself. Ajani teeters on the edge between principled justice and bloody revenge as everything he once knew crumbles around him.




*Ajani Goldmane is a planeswalker who wields both white and red magic. His new focus is magic of vengeance: spells that punish wrongdoers and lay waste to his enemies.*


Ajani’s rage has been unleashed. Tempted to shed the pretense of principle and justice, Ajani now thrashes his way through secret after secret in pursuit of the identity of his brother’s killer. His pride, bereft of their leader and shocked by the violence surrounding Jazal’s death, has been scattered all over Naya.


Ajani’s abilities as a planeswalker blossomed during a trip to Jund, during which he encountered the shaman and dragon worshiper Sarkhan Vol. Sarkhan helped Ajani turn his sense of vengeance into a fiery new power, unlocking a torrent of red magic in a volcanic ritual.


Ajani now returns to a Naya that seems alien to him. His family rejects him utterly and the mystery of Jazal’s murderer still eludes him, but even darker threats will soon make themselves known.




Ajani Goldmane is torn between his leonin ferocity and his sense of justice. He was born on Naya and become an outcast within his own family, an albino leonin never accepted by the rest of his pride. The only person who cared about him was his brother Jazal, the leader of their pride and Ajani's inspiration. Ajani had always shown potential as a mage and healer, but had assumed his main calling was to be a warrior in Jazal's service. The day that Ajani's brother was assassinated by unknown forces was the day that Ajani's Planeswalker spark ignited, and everything changed.


No longer could Ajani worry about his problems with his pride. His quest to discover his brother's killer led him into a tangle of intrigue woven by mysterious forces, forcing him to broaden his skills as a warrior and to unlock new potential within himself. After thwarting Nicol Bolas's plans on Alara, Ajani set aside his anger and began to travel the Multiverse. He became a mentor to leonin communities on many planes, including Theros.


Ajani traveled to Theros in search of his old friend, Elspeth. With the help of King Brimaz, he searched the plane for the woman who had become known as The Hydra Killer. Against the backdrop of Xenagos's ascension and increasing instability among the gods, Ajani feared his friend was in danger. When he finally found Elspeth, the situation was far more dangerous than he realized. The gods blame Elspeth for the state of the world.


To set things right, Ajani and Elspeth must embark on a journey into Nyx itself.
