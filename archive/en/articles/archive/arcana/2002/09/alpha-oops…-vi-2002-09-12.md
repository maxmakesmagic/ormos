In the very first **Magic** release, several errors were made. One of which that affected game play was the printing of the wrong card type on [Red Elemental Blast](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Red+Elemental+Blast).

Meant to be an interrupt (as indicated by the card type of its [Blue Elemental Blast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Blue%2BElemental%2BBlast)), the card was printed as an instant. Under the [old game rules](http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=mtgcom/daily/bb27), that meant it could not actually be cast at the right time to counter a blue spell, as only interrupts could be used in such a way.

The type was changed to interrupt for each subsequent printing of the card, from Beta to *Fourth Edition*. Of course, the introduction of Sixth Edition rules forced it to be changed again, via errata…

…back to an instant.
