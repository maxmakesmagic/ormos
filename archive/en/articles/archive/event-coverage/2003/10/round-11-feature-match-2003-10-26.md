Baberowski threatened an affinity style start to the first game as his deck whipped out [Welding Jar](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Welding+Jar) and Aether Spellbomb on turn 1. He unfortunately didn't have any Enforcer to take advantage of it but it did allow him to comfortably [Irradiate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Irradiate) Blech's third turn [Spikeshot Goblin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spikeshot+Goblin).

Baberowski bashed away with a [Neurok Spy](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Neurok+Spy) and [Leaden Myr](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leaden+Myr) while Blech was struggling with only three land. An [Annul](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Annul) on his Myr seemed harsh. Baberowski repeated the trick on a [Serum Tank](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Serum+Tank).

As fast as Blech could put the cards out Baberowski was sending them to the bin. A second [Spikeshot Goblin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spikeshot+Goblin) fell to an [Irradiate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Irradiate) before Blech finally found a fourth land to bring out a [Vulshok Berserker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vulshok+Berserker) on defensive duties.

Blech found another land and brought out a Leadfoot Ogre. Together they brought down the Myr and the 'splitter was passed to the Spy.

Blech went down to 2, drew a card and then conceded the game.

Baberowski 1-0 Blech

Blech had a much better draw in the second game, dropping a [Copper Myr](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Copper+Myr) and then a [Spikeshot Goblin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spikeshot+Goblin). Next turn the Goblin was given some shiny new [Vulshok Gauntlets](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vulshok+Gauntlets) although Blach didn't have the mana to activate him. Baberowski didn't have immediate answers other than swinging with a [Neurok Spy](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Neurok+Spy) and summoning [Yotian Soldier](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Yotian+Soldier)s.

The Spy got blasted by "Spikey" and the troublesome Gauntlets were passed to the Myr to allow him to repeat the trick for next turn. Baberowski brought out a [Pewter Golem](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pewter+Golem). There didn't seem much else to do and Blech would be tied up for a while flipping the Gauntlets around.

"Spikey" shot the Golem and needed a breather to recharge as Blech summoned some Tel-Jihad Chosen. Exiles followed and held the Gauntlets for a while.

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gplyo03/a890.jpg)Baberowski was struggling with some land and not a lot else. Spikey shot his last creature, the Soldier, and Baberowski drew and then conceded as he wasn't coming back into this game.

Baberowski 1-1 Blech

Baberowski came roaring out of the blocks in the third game. A second turn Myr accelerated out a third turn [Nim Shrieker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nim+Shrieker). Blech wasn't hanging around either as his myr ramped him up to a Tel-Jihad Exile. He really would have rather had a [Spikeshot Goblin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spikeshot+Goblin) though and the next turn was brutal as a [Bonesplitter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bonesplitter) and another artifact powered up the Nim. [Pewter Golem](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pewter+Golem) followed the next turn as the Nim took another massive bite out Blech's life total.

Blech drew no answer and the game was over almost as quickly as it started.

**Final Result:** Dirk Baberowski beat Reinhard Blech 2-1
