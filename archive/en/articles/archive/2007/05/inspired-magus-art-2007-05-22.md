The background of [Magus of the Future](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Magus+of+the+Future) shows the Escherian landscape of multidirectional stairs also seen on the Magus's inspiration card, [Future Sight](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Future+Sight). In the art of that enchantment, Ixidor is shown in his castle seeing visions of future actions: pleading with Akroma, battling the furious Kamahl, facing Phage.

Franz Vohwinkel took inspiration from his own *Eighth Edition* [Blood Moon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Moon) art for the background of [Magus of the Moon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Magus+of+the+Moon). The flavor text of [Magus of the Moon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Magus+of+the+Moon) offers an explanation for the look of the *Time Spiral* mountains.
