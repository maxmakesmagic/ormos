 The Release Notes include information concerning the release of a new **Magic: The Gathering** set, as well as a collection of clarifications and rulings involving that set's cards. It's intended to make playing with the new cards more fun by clearing up the common misconceptions and confusion inevitably caused by new mechanics and interactions. As future sets are released, updates to the **Magic** rules may cause some of this information to become outdated. If you can't find the answer you're looking for here, please contact us at [Wizards.com/CustomerService](http://wizards.custhelp.com/). 


The "General Notes" section includes release information and explains the mechanics and concepts in the set.


The "Card-Specific Notes" section contains answers to the most important, most common, and most confusing questions players might ask about cards in the set. Items in the "Card-Specific Notes" section include full card text for your reference. Not all cards in the set are listed.

**New Keyword: Tribute**



 Some monsters demand respect from the denizens of Theros under the threat of terrible consequences. Tribute is a new keyword found on creatures that gives opponents an unfortunate choice: have the creature grow in size, or allow a powerful enters-the-battlefield ability to trigger. 



>

> ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227130050im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless3.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20220123123600im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/green.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20220123123600im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/green.gif)  
>  Creature — Beast   
>  3/3   
>  Tribute 3 *(As this creature enters the battlefield, an opponent of your choice may place three +1/+1 counters on it.)*
>   
>  When Nessian Demolok enters the battlefield, if tribute wasn't paid, destroy target noncreature permanent. 

The official rules for tribute are as follows:



> 
> 702.103. Tribute
> 
> 
> 702.103a Tribute is a static ability that functions as the creature with tribute is entering the battlefield. "Tribute N" means "As this creature enters the battlefield, choose an opponent. That player may have this creature enter the battlefield with an additional N +1/+1 counters on it."
> 
> 
> 702.103b Objects with tribute have triggered abilities that check "if tribute wasn't paid." This condition is true if the opponent chosen as a result of the tribute ability didn't have the creature enter the battlefield with +1/+1 counters as specified by the creature's tribute ability.
> 
> 
> 


* If the opponent pays tribute, the creature will enter the battlefield with the specified number of +1/+1 counters on it. It won't enter the battlefield and then have the +1/+1 counters placed on it.
* The choice of whether to pay tribute is made as the creature with tribute is entering the battlefield. At that point, it's too late to respond to the creature spell. For example, in a multiplayer game, opponents won't know whether tribute will be paid or which opponent will be chosen to pay tribute or not when deciding whether to counter the creature spell.
* If the triggered ability has a target, that target will not be known while the creature spell with tribute is on the stack.
* Players can't respond to the tribute decision before the creature enters the battlefield. That is, if the opponent doesn't pay tribute, the triggered ability will trigger before any player has a chance to remove the creature.
* The triggered ability will resolve even if the creature with tribute isn't on the battlefield at that time.

**New Ability Word: Inspired**



 With creations of the divine, the epic deeds of mortals, and terrifying monsters all around, inspiration is everywhere on Theros. Inspired is an ability word that appears in italics at the beginning of abilities that trigger whenever the creature with the inspired ability becomes untapped. (An ability word has no rules meaning.) 



> 
> ![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/tcg/products/bng/KDJ%29D%28jk2m2389/dYYaz1GoSS_EN.jpg)Aerie Worshippers   
> ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227130050im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless3.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161115194122im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/blue.gif)  
>  Creature — Human Cleric   
>  2/4   
> *Inspired* — Whenever Aerie Worshippers becomes untapped, you may pay ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161225105850im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless2.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161115194122im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/blue.gif). If you do, put a 2/2 blue Bird enchantment creature token with flying onto the battlefield. 



* Inspired abilities trigger no matter how the creature becomes untapped: by the turn-based action at the beginning of the untap step or by a spell or ability.
* If an inspired ability triggers during your untap step, the ability will be put on the stack at the beginning of your upkeep. If the ability creates one or more token creatures, those creatures won't be able to attack that turn (unless they gain haste).
* Inspired abilities don't trigger when the creature enters the battlefield.
* If the inspired ability includes an optional cost, you decide whether to pay that cost as the ability resolves. You can do this even if the creature leaves the battlefield in response to the ability.

**Gods and Devotion to Two Colors**



 The five Gods that appear in the *Born of the Gods* set each have an ability that refers to your devotion to two colors. 



> 
> ![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/tcg/products/bng/KDJ%29D%28jk2m2389/lEBamA6i4h_EN.jpg)Xenagos, God of Revels   
> ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227130050im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless3.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227130159im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/red.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20220123123600im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/green.gif)  
>  Legendary Enchantment Creature — God   
>  6/5   
>  Indestructible   
>  As long as your devotion to red and green is less than seven, Xenagos isn't a creature.   
>  At the beginning of combat on your turn, another target creature you control gains haste and gets +X/+X until end of turn, where X is that creature's power.   
> 



* Your devotion to two colors is equal to the number of mana symbols that are the first color, the second color, or both colors among the mana costs of permanents you control. Specifically, a hybrid mana symbol counts only once toward your devotion to its two colors. For example, if the only nonland permanents you control are Xenagos, God of Revels and [Rubblebelt Raiders](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rubblebelt+Raiders) (whose mana cost is ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20211201201921im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless1.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20210429165527im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/red-green.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20210429165527im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/red-green.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20210429165527im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/red-green.gif)), your devotion to red and green is five.

**Cycle: Archetypes**



 The *Born of the Gods* set includes a cycle of creatures that grant your creatures a keyword while making sure your opponents' creatures can't have that same keyword. 



> 
> ![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/tcg/products/bng/KDJ%29D%28jk2m2389/Z2zVHU0rFN_EN.jpg)Archetype of Courage   
> ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20211201201921im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless1.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227125855im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/white.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227125855im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/white.gif)  
>  Enchantment Creature — Human Soldier   
>  2/2   
>  Creatures you control have first strike.   
>  Creatures your opponents control lose first strike and can't have or gain first strike.   
> 



* The Archetype's second ability applies to each creature controlled by any of your opponents, no matter when it entered the battlefield.
* While you control an Archetype, continuous effects generated by the resolution of spells and abilities that would give the specified ability to creatures your opponents control aren't created. For example, if you control Archetype of Courage, a spell cast by an opponent that gives creatures he or she controls first strike wouldn't cause the creatures to have first strike, even if later in the turn Archetype of Courage left the battlefield. (If the spell has additional effects, such as raising the power of the creatures, those effects will apply as normal.)
* Conversely, continuous effects generated by static abilities (such as an Aura that granted the appropriate ability) would resume applying if the Archetype left the battlefield.
* If you and an opponent each control the same Archetype, no creature controlled by any player will have the appropriate ability.

**Returning *Theros* Themes and Mechanics**



 The *Born of the Gods* set features many mechanics, keywords, and rules introduced in the *Theros* set. For more information on enchantment creatures, the "Nyx" starry sky frame element, bestow, heroic, monstrosity and monstrous creatures, devotion, scry, and Gods, please see the *Theros* Release Notes at [www.wizards.com/Magic/tcg/resources.aspx?x=magic/rules/faqs](http://www.wizards.com/Magic/tcg/resources.aspx?x=magic/rules/faqs).

**Rule Change: The "Planeswalker Uniqueness Rule" and the "Legend Rule"**



 Two rule changes introduced with the ***Magic** 2014* core set impact how cards in the *Born of the Gods* set function. 


Under the previous rules, if there were two or more legendary permanents with the same name on the battlefield or two or more planeswalkers that share a subtype (such as "Jace") on the battlefield, they would all be put into their owners' graveyards as a state-based action. These rules have changed. The new rules are as follows:



> 
> 704.5j If a player controls two or more planeswalkers that share a planeswalker type, that player chooses one of them, and the rest are put into their owners' graveyards. This is called the "planeswalker uniqueness rule."
> 
> 
> 704.5k If a player controls two or more legendary permanents with the same name, that player chooses one of them, and the rest are put into their owners' graveyards. This is called the "legend rule."
> 
> 
>

### CARD-SPECIFIC NOTES



>

> ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20211201201921im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless1.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227125855im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/white.gif)  
>  Instant   
>  Prevent the next X damage that would be dealt to target creature this turn, where X is your devotion to white. If damage is prevented this way, Acolyte's Reward deals that much damage to target creature or player. *(Each ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227125855im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/white.gif) in the mana costs of permanents you control counts toward your devotion to white.)*
>   
> 



* Acolyte's Reward has two targets: the creature that would be dealt damage and the creature or player that Acolyte's Reward will deal damage to. These targets are chosen as you cast Acolyte's Reward.
* The amount of damage the prevention shield will prevent is based on your devotion to white as Acolyte's Reward resolves. That amount won't change later in the turn, even if your devotion to white does.
* You don't choose a source of damage. The prevention shield will apply to the next X damage that would be dealt to the first target, no matter where that damage comes from. It also doesn't matter whether the damage is dealt at the same time. For example, if the shield prevents the next 5 damage to the first target, and that creature would be dealt 3 damage by [Lightning Strike](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Strike), that 3 damage is prevented and Acolyte's Reward deals 3 damage to the second target. The prevention effect will still apply to the next 2 damage the first target would be dealt that turn.
* The effect of Acolyte's Reward isn't a redirection effect. If it prevents damage, Acolyte's Reward (not the source of that damage) deals damage to the second target as part of that prevention effect. Acolyte's Reward is the source of the new damage, so the characteristics of the original source (such as its color or whether it had lifelink) don't apply. The new damage isn't combat damage, even if the prevented damage was. Since you control the source of the new damage, if the second target is an opponent, you may have Acolyte's Reward deal its damage to a planeswalker that opponent controls.
* As Acolyte's Reward tries to resolve, if only the first target is illegal, Acolyte's Reward won't prevent any damage that would be dealt to that creature and, because of this, Acolyte's Reward won't deal damage to the second target. If only the second target is illegal, damage that would be dealt to the first target will be prevented, but Acolyte's Reward won't deal damage. If both targets are illegal, Acolyte's Reward will be countered.
* After Acolyte's Reward resolves, it no longer matters whether either target is still legal. For example, if the second target is a creature controlled by an opponent, and it gains hexproof after Acolyte's Reward resolves but before it prevents damage, Acolyte's Reward will still deal damage to that creature. If Acolyte's Reward can't deal damage to the second target (perhaps because it's a creature that has left the battlefield), Acolyte's Reward will still prevent damage; it just won't deal any damage itself.
* If Acolyte's Reward prevents damage, it deals its damage immediately afterward as part of that same prevention effect. This happens before state-based actions are performed, and before any player can cast spells or activate abilities. If the source of the original damage was a spell or ability, this happens before that spell or ability resumes its resolution.
* If the amount of damage that would be dealt to the first target is in excess of the amount of damage that Acolyte's Reward would prevent, the source deals its excess damage to the first target at the same time that the rest of it is prevented. Then Acolyte's Reward deals its damage.
* The damage will be dealt by Acolyte's Reward as it existed on the stack, not as it exists when the damage is dealt. That is, it's an instant spell that's dealing the damage, in case an ability cares about that (such as Satyr Firedancer's, which includes the phrase "Whenever an instant or sorcery spell you control deals damage to an opponent").
* If the first target would be dealt combat damage by multiple creatures, you choose which of that damage to prevent. (For example, if one of those creatures has deathtouch, you could choose to prevent the damage from that creature specifically.) You don't decide until the point at which the creatures would deal their damage.

> *Heroic* — Whenever you cast a spell that targets Akroan Conscriptor, gain control of another target creature until end of turn. Untap that creature. It gains haste until end of turn. 



* The ability can target any creature except Akroan Conscriptor, including one that's untapped or one you already control.
* Gaining control of a creature doesn't cause you to gain control of any Auras or Equipment attached to it. Notably, if that creature is enchanted by an Aura with bestow and dies while under your control, the Aura's controller will continue to control the creature that Aura becomes.
* If you control a legendary creature and gain control of another legendary creature with the same name, you'll choose one to remain on the battlefield and put the other into its owner's graveyard.

* The manifestation counter is a memory aid only. The permanent will continue to be an enchantment in addition to its other types even if that counter is removed.
* If you choose to not put the card onto the battlefield, or if the card isn't one of the listed types, it will remain on top of your library. (Note that revealing the card is not optional.)

* The last ability is a mana ability. It doesn't use the stack and can't be responded to.

* Bile Blight has only one target. Other creatures with that name are not targeted. For example, a creature with hexproof will still get -3/-3 if it has the same name as the target creature.
* If the target creature is an illegal target as Bile Blight tries to resolve, it will be countered and none of its effects will happen. No creature will get -3/-3.
* The name of a creature token is the same as its creature types, unless the token is a copy of another creature or the effect that created the token specifically gives it a different name. For example, a 1/1 Cat Soldier creature token is named "Cat Soldier."

* For the first triggered ability, you declare which player or planeswalker the token is attacking as you put it onto the battlefield. It doesn't have to be the same player or planeswalker Brimaz is attacking.
* If Brimaz somehow blocks two or more creatures (note it can't naturally do this), its last ability will trigger that many times.
* Although the tokens enter the battlefield attacking or blocking, they were never declared as attacking or blocking creatures. Abilities that trigger whenever a creature attacks or blocks won't trigger.

* Courser of Kruphix doesn't change when you can play lands. You can do so only during your main phase when you have priority and the stack is empty.
* Playing a land with the second ability counts as your land play for the turn. If you play a land from your hand during your turn, you won't be able to play an additional land from the top of your library unless another effect allows you to.
* The last ability triggers whenever a land enters the battlefield under your control for any reason. It triggers whenever you play a land, as well as whenever a spell or ability (such as [Rampant Growth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rampant+Growth)) causes you to put a land onto the battlefield under your control. It will even trigger when a spell or ability causes another player to put a land onto the battlefield under your control (as can happen with [Yavimaya Dryad](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Yavimaya+Dryad)'s ability, for example).
* While playing with the top card of your library revealed, if you draw multiple cards, reveal each one before you draw it.

* The creature blocks only if it's able to do so as the declare blockers step begins. If, at that time, the creature is tapped, it's affected by a spell or ability that says it can't block, or no creatures are attacking its controller or a planeswalker controlled by that player, then it doesn't block. If there's a cost associated with having the creature block, the player isn't forced to pay that cost. If that cost isn't paid, the creature won't block.
* The controller of the creature chooses which attacking creature that creature blocks.
* If there are multiple combat phases in a turn, the creature must block only in the first one in which it's able to.

* Ephara's last ability checks at the beginning of each upkeep whether another creature entered the battlefield under your control last turn. If one did, it will trigger; otherwise, it won't. The ability will trigger only once no matter how many creatures entered the battlefield under your control that turn, as long as at least one did.
* The last ability will trigger regardless of what has happened to the creature that entered the battlefield on the previous turn. It doesn't matter whether it's still under your control or whether it's still on the battlefield.
* If a noncreature permanent you control (such as an Aura with bestow) becomes a creature, it will not cause Ephara's last ability to trigger the following turn. This is true even if that noncreature permanent became a creature the same turn it entered the battlefield.

If you do, put a token onto the battlefield that's a copy of another target creature except it's an enchantment in addition to its other types. It gains haste. Exile it at the beginning of the next end step. 



* The token copies exactly what was printed on the original creature (except that the copy is also an enchantment) and nothing else (unless that permanent is copying something else or is a token; see below). It doesn't copy whether that creature is tapped or untapped, whether it has any counters on it or Auras and Equipment attached to it, or any non-copy effects that have changed its power, toughness, types, color, and so on.
* If the copied creature has ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20160829100442im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/x.gif) in its mana cost, X is considered to be zero.
* If the copied creature is copying something else (for example, if the copied creature is a Clone), then the token enters the battlefield as whatever that creature copied.
* If the copied creature is a token, the token created by Felhide Spiritbinder copies the original characteristics of that token as stated by the effect that put the token onto the battlefield.
* Any enters-the-battlefield abilities of the copied creature will trigger when the token enters the battlefield. Any "as [this permanent] enters the battlefield" or "[this permanent] enters the battlefield with" abilities of the copied creature will also work.
* If another creature becomes or enters the battlefield as a copy of the token, that creature won't have haste and you won't exile it. However, if Felhide Spiritbinder creates multiple tokens due to a replacement effect (like the one [Doubling Season](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Doubling+Season) creates), each of those tokens will have haste and you'll exile each of them.

* Kiora's first ability can target any permanent an opponent controls, not just one that can deal or be dealt damage.
* Once the first ability resolves, the damage prevention continues to apply even if that permanent changes controllers.
* Kiora's second ability allows you to play an additional land during your main phase. Doing so follows the normal timing rules for playing lands. In particular, you won't play a land as that ability resolves. The ability will fully resolve (and you'll draw a card, perhaps a land you'll play later) first.
* The effect of the second ability is cumulative with other effects that let you play additional lands, such as the one from [Rites of Flourishing](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rites+of+Flourishing).
* If Kiora leaves the battlefield after her second ability is activated but before it resolves, you'll still be able to play an additional land after the ability resolves.

* Loyal Pegasus can be declared as an attacker only if another creature is declared as an attacker at the same time. Similarly, Loyal Pegasus can be declared as a blocker only if another creature is declared as a blocker at the same time.
* If you control more than one Loyal Pegasus, they can both attack or block together, even if no other creatures attack or block.
* Although Loyal Pegasus can't attack alone, other attacking creatures don't have to attack the same player or planeswalker. For example, Loyal Pegasus could attack an opponent and another creature could attack a planeswalker that opponent controls.
* In a Two-Headed Giant game (or in another format using the shared team turns option), Loyal Pegasus can attack or block with a creature controlled by your teammate, even if no other creatures you control are attacking or blocking.

For example, if you control a creature with black mana symbols in its mana cost that can be sacrificed for mana, those mana symbols will count toward your devotion to black. You can then sacrifice that creature for mana to pay the reduced total cost.
* If your devotion to black is greater than six, Marshmist Titan will cost ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227195556im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/black.gif) to cast. The colored mana requirement isn't reduced.

* If you want to cast a card this way, you cast it as part of the resolution of the triggered ability. Timing restrictions based on the card's type (such as sorcery) are ignored. Other casting restrictions (such as "Cast [this card] only before attackers are declared") are not.

* If you cast a card "without paying its mana cost," you can't pay alternative costs such as overload costs. You can, however, pay additional costs such as kicker costs. If the card has mandatory additional costs, you must pay those.
* If you choose to cast a split card with fuse without paying its mana cost, you may cast both halves.

>  Enchantment Creature — Chimera   
>  3/3   
>  Whenever an opponent casts a spell, you may exchange control of Perplexing Chimera and that spell. If you do, you may choose new targets for the spell. *(If the spell becomes a permanent, you control that permanent.)*
> 



* You may exchange control of Perplexing Chimera and any spell cast by an opponent, not just one with targets.
* You make the decision whether to exchange control of Perplexing Chimera and the spell as the triggered ability resolves.
* If Perplexing Chimera leaves the battlefield or the spell leaves the stack before the triggered ability resolves, you can't make the exchange.
* Neither Perplexing Chimera nor the spell changes zones. Only control of them is exchanged.
* After the ability resolves, you control the spell. Any instance of "you" in that spell's text now refers to you, "an opponent" refers to one of your opponents, and so on. The change of control happens before new targets are chosen, so any targeting restrictions such as "target opponent" or "target creature you control" are now made in reference to you, not the spell's original controller. You may change those targets to be legal in reference to you, or, if those are the spell's only targets, the spell will be countered on resolution for having illegal targets. When the spell resolves, any illegal targets are unaffected by it and you make all decisions the spell's effect calls for.
* You may change any of the spell's targets. If you change a target, you must choose a legal target for the spell. If you can't, you must leave the target the same (even if that target is now illegal).
* Gaining control of a spell and changing its targets won't cause any heroic abilities of the new targets to trigger.
* If you gain control of an instant or sorcery spell, it will be put into its owner's graveyard as it resolves or is countered.
* In some unusual cases, you may not control Perplexing Chimera when its triggered ability resolves (perhaps because the triggered ability triggered again and resolved while the original ability was on the stack). In these cases, you can exchange control of Perplexing Chimera and the spell that causes the ability to trigger, even if you control neither of them. If you do, you'll be able to change targets of the spell, not the spell's new controller.

* If you activate the ability Phenax grants to creatures you control, the toughness of the creature is calculated as the ability resolves. If the creature is no longer on the battlefield at that time, use its toughness when it was last on the battlefield.
* If Phenax is a creature, it will grant itself the activated ability.
* If you tap Phenax to activate the ability it grants itself, and Phenax is no longer a creature but still on the battlefield as that ability resolves, no cards will be put into the target player's graveyard. Similarly, if Phenax isn't on the battlefield as the ability resolves and wasn't a creature when it left the battlefield, no cards will be put into the graveyard.

* If a replacement effect would try to replace a card that you can't draw, that effect can't apply.

>  Tap up to two target creatures. Those creatures don't untap during their controllers' next untap steps. Scry 1. *(Look at the top card of your library. You may put that card on the bottom of your library.)*
> 



* If a creature affected by Sudden Storm changes controllers before its old controller's next untap step, Sudden Storm will prevent it from becoming untapped during its new controller's next untap step.
* This spell can target tapped creatures. If a targeted creature is already tapped when the spell resolves, that creature remains tapped and doesn't untap during its controller's next untap step.
* If you chose two targets and one is an illegal target when Sudden Storm resolves, that creature won't become tapped and it won't be stopped from untapping during its controller's next untap step. It won't be affected by Sudden Storm in any way.
* If you choose zero targets, you'll just scry 1 when the ability resolves. However, if you choose at least one target and all of Sudden Storm's targets are illegal as it tries to resolve, the spell will be countered and none of its effects will happen. You won't scry in that case.

>  Enchanted creature has "Whenever you gain life, put that many +1/+1 counters on this creature." 



* In some unusual cases, you can gain life even though your life total actually decreases. For example, if you are being attacked by two 3/3 creatures and you block one with a 2/2 creature with lifelink, your life total will decrease by 1 even though you've gained 2 life. You'll put two +1/+1 counters on the enchanted creature.
* In a Two-Headed Giant game, life gained by your teammate won't cause the ability to trigger, even though it causes your team's life total to increase.

>  Tromokratis has hexproof unless it's attacking or blocking.   
>  Tromokratis can't be blocked unless all creatures defending player controls block it. *(If any creature that player controls doesn't block this creature, it can't be blocked.)*
> 



* The defending player may block Tromokratis with each creature he or she controls. If that player can't, perhaps because one of those creatures is tapped, or chooses not to, Tromokratis can't be blocked.
* Tromokratis (like all attacking and blocking creatures) remains an attacking or blocking creature until the end of combat step is over. Notably, it will still be an attacking or blocking creature during the combat damage step, so any abilities an opponent controls that trigger when a creature dies as a result of combat damage could target Tromokratis.

* If the artifact or enchantment is an illegal target as Unravel the Æther tries to resolve, it will be countered and none of its effects will happen. No library will be shuffled.
* If the artifact or enchantment is a token, it will be shuffled into its owner's library when Unravel the Æther resolves, then will cease to exist. For practical purposes, whatever item is representing the token should not actually be put into the library, though the library is still shuffled.

* If no creature is blocking or being blocked by Vortex Elemental as its first ability resolves, it alone will be put on top of its owner's library, and that library will be shuffled. You can activate the first ability outside of combat.
* If Vortex Elemental isn't on the battlefield when its first ability resolves, any creatures blocking or blocked by it when it left the battlefield will be put on top of their owners' libraries and those libraries will be shuffled.
* The creature blocks Vortex Elemental only if it's able to do so as the declare blockers step begins. If, at that time, the creature is tapped, it's affected by a spell or ability that says it can't block, or Vortex Elemental isn't attacking its controller or a planeswalker controlled by that player, then it doesn't block. If there's a cost associated with having the creature block, the player isn't forced to pay that cost. If that cost isn't paid, the creature won't block.

> 



* To choose a pile at random, each pile must have an equal chance of being chosen. There are many ways to do this, including assigning each pile a number and rolling a die.
* You may put Auras or Equipment into one pile and the creatures they were attached to into a different pile.
* If you put all permanents you control into one pile, you'll have a two-thirds chance of not having to sacrifice any permanents, but a one-third chance of having to sacrifice all of them.
