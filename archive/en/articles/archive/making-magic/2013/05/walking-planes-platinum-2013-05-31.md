Why are we losing our minds over the Pro Tour? Why do we care so much? Why do we love it? Is it watching our favorite players handle the pressure of life-altering matches? The stories of memorable games? Or is it the subtle things, like hearing a judge call out "five seconds... draft?" Take a trip with Walking the Planes to [Pro Tour *Dragon's Maze*](/en/events/coverage/voice-raises-wescoe-above-all-pro-tour)  and discover what the excitement is all about. Special appearance by [@day9tv](https://twitter.com/day9tv), aka StarCraft star Sean Plott!
