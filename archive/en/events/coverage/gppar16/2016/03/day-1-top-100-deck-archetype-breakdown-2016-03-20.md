It's once again time for our traditional (est. 2016) look at the decks that finished in the Top 100 on Day 1. This was the final chance for players to exploit the combination of fetch and battle lands in Standard, to go crazy with four or more colors, so labeling decks wasn't easy. Is it Green Mardu oder Red Abzan? Dark Naya? White Jund? More importantly, are the Dragon and Eldrazi decks in various color combinations more defined by their similarities or their differences?


After consulting with my colleague, professional Magic analyst Frank Karsten, I can offer you the following glimpse of the metagame at Grand Prix Paris:




| Archetype | # |
| --- | --- |
| Four-Color Rally | 28 |
| Green Mardu | 14 |
| Dark Jeskai | 10 |
| Bant Company | 5 |
| Eldrazi Ramp\* | 5 |
| Grixis Control | 5 |
| Eldrazi Aggro\* | 5 |
| Bant Planeswalkers | 4 |
| Dragons\* | 4 |
| Four-Color Company | 4 |
| Abzan Planeswalkers/Tokens | 3 |
| Esper Dragons | 3 |
| Abzan Aggro | 2 |
| Blue Abzan | 2 |
| Five-Color Goodstuff | 1 |
| Esper Tokens | 1 |
| Mardu | 1 |
| Narset Mardu | 1 |
| Blue-Black Aristocrats | 1 |
| White-Black Warriors | 1 |
| **Total:** | **100** |

\*Three of the Eldrazi Ramp decks were red-green, one was black-green, and one green-blue. Two Eldrazi Aggro players ran blue-red versions of the deck, the others stayed mono-blue. Dragons were evenly divided between Mardu, Jeskai, Grixis, and all of the aforementioned.


When looking for undefeated decks during the last round yesterday, it came as a surprise that not a single [Rally the Ancestors](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rally+the+Ancestors) deck had even made it to 8-0. The above sets the record straight. Despite failing to reach the very top of the standings, Rally still took the number one spot, and impressively so. Nothing else came close.


The rest may look like a sea of multicolor midrange madness, but there were some interesting developments here as well. Planeswalkers gathering in ever greater numbers in Abzan and Bant shells, for example, is noteworthy in particular because both the Ally and the Voice of Zendikar remain legal in post-rotation Standard.


Even more notable than what's here, though, might be what's missing. One can only marvel at the complete absence of [Hardened Scales](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hardened+Scales). A month ago, the deck had taken Grand Prix Houston by storm, had specifically been the most represented deck in that event's Top 100. Now it was nowhere to be found ...


Stay tuned for a closer look at some of the above decks and to find out what archetypes end up in the Top 8, as we near the conclusion of Grand Prix Paris 2016 as well as the conclusion of *Khans of Tarkir*'s time in Standard.
