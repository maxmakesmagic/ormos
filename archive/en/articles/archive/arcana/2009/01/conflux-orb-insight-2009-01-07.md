[![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/arcana/98_orb.jpg)](http://ww2.wizards.com/magic/Orb/OuAh2RsPk7.aspx)The waiting is over. The *Conflux* Orb of Insight is here! If you already know what that means, [click here](http://ww2.wizards.com/magic/Orb/OuAh2RsPk7.aspx) to launch the Orb and see what you can find!

Don't know what the Orb of Insight is? No problem. It doesn't slice, it doesn't dice, and it's definitely not dishwasher-friendly. What it *does* do is let you know how many times something appears in *Conflux*, a set that hasn't even been released yet! Simply type in what you want to learn about and the Orb will tell you how many times it appears on Conflux cards. Flavor text isn't counted, and you can enter any type of mana costs and activation costs. For example, to search for something crazy like ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227125855im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/white.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227125855im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/white.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161115194122im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/blue.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161115194122im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/blue.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227195556im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/black.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227195556im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/black.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227130159im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/red.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227130159im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/red.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20220123123600im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/green.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20220123123600im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/green.gif), just type "WWUUBBRRGG" in the Orb.

With a little patience (well, ok, a LOT) you could enter every single word in the English language, plus all the words and mana costs in **Magic** to figure out every single word in the set! Of course, there are probably going to be some *Conflux*-specific words making their debut into the **Magic** lexicon this time around, so you'll need to enter every possible string of letters too (just to be safe...). At that point, it's just a simple matter of re-arranging all that data into the exact card text of all the cards in the set. If you hurry, you should be able to finish before the [Prerelease Events](http://www.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/events/prereleases)!

What secrets will you be able to unveil? Only the Orb knows, so get to work! And of course, we'll see you back here on Wednesday, January 14 when the *Conflux* minisite debuts, followed by the official kickoff of *Conflux* previews on Monday, January 19. Ready? [Click here](http://ww2.wizards.com/magic/Orb/OuAh2RsPk7.aspx) to launch the Orb and get started!
