The May 31, 2017 Update
=======================



 Posted in **Daily Magic Update**

Blake is the content manager for DailyMTG.com, making him the one you should email if you have thoughts on the website, good or less good (or not good). He's a longtime coverage reporter and hasn't turned down a game of Magic in any format ever. 






The Daily *Magic* Update is a roundup of everything *Magic* you should know on May 31, 2017. Today's Update, like everything else on the internet, is brought to you by covfefe.


Today's Musts
=============


1. [How Many Lands Do You Need to Consistently Hit Your Land Drops?](https://www.channelfireball.com/articles/how-many-lands-do-you-need-to-consistently-hit-your-land-drops/) | Channel Fireball | Frank Karsten

In the next article in the series of "Frank Karsten does the math to solve every question you ever had about *Magic*," Karsten does the math to solve the question of how many lands you should play.


Give him a few years and he'll have that *Magic*-playing robot up and running.


After That, Read, Watch, or Listen to These
===========================================


1. [Pride of the Kraul](https://unspokenrealms.wordpress.com/2017/05/31/episode-118-pride-of-the-kraul/) | Unspoken Realms | Drew Sitte

Wait, isn't that the title of today's *Magic* Story? How'd he do that so fast? (Wink, wink, nudge, nudge, continue winking until you get that we worked with him to get this up same day.)


Let us know what you think!


1. [People with Moxie: Gerry Thompson](https://blog.cardkingdom.com/people-with-moxie-gerry-thompson/) | Card Kingdom Blog | Hallie Santo

This interview is less about Gerry's strategy for winning the Pro Tour and more about his journey over the past few years through life—from leaving Seattle to coming back and all the *Magic* in between.


Plus, it's a new feature on the Card Kingdom Blog. It's like two reasons to read in one!


1. [[MTG] Karador, Ghost Chieftain—1v1 Commander Deck Tech](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=di1uAF_T_d0&list=PLxg8UAfS2YJaQH0ko2Jo1AKJe1Fj7iHX-&index=1) | TCGPlayer | Corbin Hosler

1v1 Commander is, as the kids these days say, so hot right now (does 2001 count as "these days"?). Check out these gameplay videos as Hosler explores playing with [Karador, Ghost Chieftain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Karador%2C+Ghost+Chieftain) through a blue- and green-infested metagame. There are six videos in total, so there's plenty for you to discretely watch between alt-tabing to a spreadsheet.

1. [The Netdecking Dilemma with Stybs](https://collected.company/2017/05/30/netdecking-dilemma-stybs-160/) | The Command Zone | Jimmy Wong and Josh Lee Kwai

Stybs is Adam Styborski, he of TCGPlayer, DailyMTG, and basically everything *Magic* content for the past umpteen years. He's also an avid Commander player and jumps into the debate about netdecking in Commander.


So everyone doesn't grab a pile of cards they have sitting around and keep cutting until they hit 100? That can't just be me.


1. [PPTQ Queen](http://www.magictheamateuring.com/mta-episode-227-pptq-queen/) | Magic the Amateuring | Maria Bartholdi and Meghan Wolff

Meghan won a PPTQ, so that's a pretty big deal.


1. [*Minecraft* Xbox One & PS4—*Magic: The Gathering* Skin Pack Showcase](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJyzcFCxc7g) | Carnage the Creator

Carnage the Creator is a *Minecraft* content producer, but he dips his toes into *Magic* (and *Magic* character name pronunciation) to show off the skin pack recently released for *Minecraft*. Come to see what the skins look like, stay for Carnage attempting multiple pronunciations of "[Dovin Baan](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dovin+Baan)."

Top 25
======


1. Two Players Enter

While most shifts were a place or three here and there (welcome to the Top 3, Yuuya Watanabe! Nice move, Martin Müller!), the big news is that we get two new entries this week—Carlos Romão and Yuuki Ichikawa!


Of course, if two rise, two others must fall, and those unlucky two this week are Lukas Blohon and Samuel Pardee.


Most of the shifts today are due to points falling off from last year, as point totals remained either relatively flat for those who rose or dropped off around 2 points for everyone else. It's just one of those seasonal shifts that happens now and then. Unfortunately for Blohon and Pardee, it happened just a bit too much to stay in the limelight.

What People Are Talking About
=============================


1. [Soo, uuumm... Something seems off here...](http://watch-woof.tumblr.com/post/161267291495/soo-uuumm-something-seems-off-here-has) | watch-woof

The real conspiracy is that we didn't notice that Nicol Bolas actually has had pliers for horns all these years!


(And, yes, this is just a coincidence.)


Deck of the Day
===============


1. [BSWeitz's Electrostatic Pummeler](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/mtgo-standings/competitive-standard-constructed-league-2017-05-30)

We've seen an uptick lately in [Electrostatic Pummeler](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Electrostatic+Pummeler) decks doing well in Competitive Standard Leagues, and, for once, we can trace exactly the reasons why.


First, the deck is just explosive. It can kill by turn four with some regularity, and even if it's not that fast, it puts players under pretty serious clocks pretty quickly.


But, second, it has to deal with fewer predators these days—namely the Copy Cat combo (which was just as fast, but more disruptive) or [Walking Ballista](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Walking+Ballista) (which is seen far less frequently). Ballista was bad news for the namesake [Electrostatic Pummeler](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Electrostatic+Pummeler) specifically, and often for pump spells generally. But with those two hurdles out of the way, racing [Aetherworks Marvel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aetherworks+Marvel) has become a viable solution. Add in the fact that the deck is very, very fast and punishing, and you've got a winning formula.
