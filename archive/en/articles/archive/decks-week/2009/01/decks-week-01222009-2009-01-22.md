The big news from the past week in the **Magic** world was Luis Scott-Vargas's continued rise to dominance! He won his third premier-level event in as many months by storming Grand Prix–Los Angeles with his take on TEPS. You can read all about the event from the exclusive **Magicthegathering.com** coverage [here](/en/events/coverage/luis-scott-vargas-conquers-la). Of course, we've also got the Top 8 lists here on Decks of the week.


The Pro Tour Qualifier season for Honolulu continues plugging right along. We add three more events to our master list this week, a great place to start when trying to find the hottest Extended deck in the season. To find a PTQ near you, visit [here](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/TCG/Events.aspx?x=mtgcom/protour/honolulu09-qualifiers).


Another spot you can always check for Extended tech is our collection of **Magic Online** Premier Event lists. We've got the usual assortment of Extended, Standard, Classic, and *Shards of Alara* Block Constructed lists this week with a special treat: a Vanguard Standard event too! Daylight is wasting, so get to reading!
