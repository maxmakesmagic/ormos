Modern Masters Weekend is over, and this three—no, wait, four!—Grand Prix festival certainly changed a lot in the *Magic* Top 25 Pro Rankings. Let's take a whirlwind trip around the world to see where all those points went.



Chronologically, Chiba in Japan got the ball rolling. Yuuya Watanabe posted the best finish, his 12-3 record netting three points. Lee Shi Tian also made Day Two, but in such a huge field, he couldn't get enough wins to generate points. He sits at No. 4 this week, having been passed by Watanabe. Neither Shota Yasooka (No. 18, unchanged) nor Yuuki Ichikawa (No. 23, down 2) made it to draft on Sunday.



Surprisingly, we can bypass Grand Prix Utrecht completely. Unexpected absentees were No. 11 Ivan Floch, No. 15 Ondrej Strasky, and No. 22 Antonio Del Moral León. Still, the double header in Las Vegas more than made up for the lack of Top 25 action in Utrecht. At Vegas #1, No. 14 Josh Utter-Leyton set the pace, finishing at 12-3, good for three points. One win behind were Canada's Alexander Hayne (No. 20) and No. 5 Owen Turtenwald. Sam Black made Day Two, but no points, while Shahar Shenhar, William Jensen, and Reid Duke failed to get out of Day One, with Shenhar and Jensen dropping without a win on the scoreboard at all.

At Vegas #2, world No. 1 Eric Froehlich went the same way as Shenhar and Jensen. Froehlich's lead over Sam Black is now a bare two points as we head down the home stretch of the season. One of the big success stories of the weekend was undoubtedly Shaun McLaren. The Canadian isn't a noted Grand Prix traveller, but he sure delivers when he does. This time it was another Top 8 performance, sending him up three to No. 7. Both Paul Rietzl and Craig Wescoe had 12-3 records, and added three points to their total for the season, taking Rietzl up four to No. 9, and Wescoe to No. 21. Paulo Vitor Damo da Rosa also rose four, and is now inside the Top 20 at No. 19. Christian Calcano was the last of the ranked players to earn points this weekend, but by rising one place to No. 24 he now leaves the mighty Reid Duke on the rankings trapdoor.
