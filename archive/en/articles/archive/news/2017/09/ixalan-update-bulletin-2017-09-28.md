Ixalan Update Bulletin
======================

Hello again! As you can see, we've abandoned the Monument of Knowledge and Amonkhet entirely for somewhere a little less dry and Zombie-soaked. Here in the sunken ruins of Azcanta, we're soaked in actual water! These lost hallways have a whole new trove of secrets to explore and rules changes to discover if we can hold our breath long enough. Who needs a city full of gold when you have an infinity of slightly damp forbidden knowledge?


This update bulletin includes the changes from both *Commander (2017 Edition)* and *Ixalan*. You can find the [Comprehensive Rules here](http://magic.wizards.com/en/game-info/gameplay/rules-and-formats/rules) on our website, and Oracle text updated in [Gatherer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/).


While *Commander (2017 Edition)* required a whole lot of new rules to define new things like Portal Mage, *Ixalan* didn't need very much. You've probably seen the biggest one in the [*Ixalan* mechanics article](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/feature/ixalan-mechanics): All planeswalker cards are legendary, and the Planeswalker Uniqueness Rule is going away. There are a few other changes that have a much narrower impact, but if you're a fan of rules (and I assume you are since you're reading this article), you'll want very much to know about them.


Here we go!
