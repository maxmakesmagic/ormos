The quarterfinals at Grand Prix Providence showcased a diverse array of the varying strategies that have been viable in *Dragons of Tarkir* Standard. Red-Green Devotion managed to put two copies into the Top 8, while the remaining six decks ranged from a base black-and-green deck playing five colors worth of Dragons, to a Bant Megamorph deck, to tried-and-true Abzan Aggro.



**Steve Rubin (23) (Red-Green Dragons) vs. Pedro Carvalho (Four-Color Whip)**



![](https://media.wizards.com/2015/events/gpcop15/gpprov15_qfrubin.jpg)  
*Rubin's two [Goblin Rabblemaster](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Rabblemaster)s and [Xenagos, the Reveler](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Xenagos%2C+the+Reveler) made an army of tokens for him in Game 1.*



Rubin got off to an aggressive start in Game 1 with two copies of [Goblin Rabblemaster](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Rabblemaster) and [Xenagos, the Reveler](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Xenagos%2C+the+Reveler) quickly spitting out a horde of tokens. All that work was quickly undone, however, when Carvalho managed to survive to his seventh land drop and cast a [Hornet Queen](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hornet+Queen) with a [Whip of Erebos](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Whip+of+Erebos) in play. Rubin gamely tried to hang in there, but soon enough they were on to Game 2.

*Carvalho's second copy of [Whip of Erebos](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Whip+of+Erebos) sealed the deal in Game 2.*



[Drown in Sorrow](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Drown+in+Sorrow) stymied Rubin's early start in Game 2, and left the Dragons player trying to rebuild with two face-up copies of [Deathmist Raptor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deathmist+Raptor). But Carvalho had yet again survived to cast an expensive threat—this time [Dragonlord Atarka](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragonlord+Atarka)—with a Whip threatening to recur it. Rubin managed to take down the Whip with [Back to Nature](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Back+to+Nature), but a [Courser of Kruphix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Courser+of+Kruphix) from Carvalho soon revealed another waiting atop his library. That proved too much for Rubin and Carvalho was off to the semifinals.



*Carvalho 2 – Rubin 0*



**Josh McClain (Abzan Megamorph) vs. Eric Severson (Bant Megamorph)**



![](https://media.wizards.com/2015/events/gpcop15/gpprov15_qfseverson.jpg)  
*Severson mounted an assault with multiple copies of [Fleecemane Lion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fleecemane+Lion) in Game 1.*



In the battle of megamorphs, Severson was the first to apply serious pressure with a fifth-turn [Dragonlord Ojutai](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragonlord+Ojutai), but McClain had a clean answer with [Crux of Fate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crux+of+Fate), naming Dragons. But Severson soon found his second and third copies of [Fleecemane Lion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fleecemane+Lion) in the game and they managed to chomp away at McClain's life total before the Abzan player could stabilize.

*McClain was able to pounce when Severson couldn't find his fifth or sixth lands in Game 2.*



McClain was able to strike back in the second game, using a [Dromoka's Command](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dromoka%27s+Command) to make [Satyr Wayfinder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Satyr+Wayfinder) a 2/2 and gun down Severson's [Elvish Mystic](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elvish+Mystic). A [Glare of Heresy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glare+of+Heresy) took out Severson's [Mastery of the Unseen](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mastery+of+the+Unseen), and McClain was able to take the game before Severson could find his fifth or sixth lands for the [Dragonlord Ojutai](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragonlord+Ojutai) and [Elspeth, Sun's Champion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elspeth%2C+Sun%27s+Champion) stranded in his hand.



The third game was all about [Disdainful Stroke](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Disdainful+Stroke). Severson used it to counter first a [Siege Rhino](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Siege+Rhino), then a [Wingmate Roc](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wingmate+Roc). A [Den Protector](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Den+Protector) for the Bant player rebought a Stroke and countered yet another spell—[Crux of Fate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crux+of+Fate)—from McClain. It was too much for McClain and Severson was off to the semifinals.



*Severson 2 – McClain 1*



**Oscar Tiu (Five-Color Dragons) vs. Sky Mason (Red-Green Devotion)**



![](https://media.wizards.com/2015/events/gpcop15/gpprov15_qfmason.jpg)  
*Mason got off to an explosive start in Game 1 thanks to [Nykthos, Shrine to Nyx](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nykthos%2C+Shrine+to+Nyx).*



Mason came roaring out of the gates in Game 1 and was able to jump far ahead on mana before Tiu's deck—which can take time to assemble the necessary mana to cast its assorted Dragons—was really able to get going.



![](https://media.wizards.com/2015/events/gpcop15/gpprov15_qfliu.jpg)  
*Tiu struggled to keep Mason's board clear in Game 2.*



In the second game, Tiu managed to keep the board clear for a while, but with [Nissa, Worldwaker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nissa%2C+Worldwaker) Mason finally stuck a resilient threat. When that was soon followed by [Whisperwood Elemental](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Whisperwood+Elemental) and [Dragonlord Atarka](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragonlord+Atarka), Tiu found himself with no board presence, staring down a massive army, and had to extend his hand.



*Mason 2 – Tiu 0*



**Neal Sacks (Abzan Aggro) vs. Raeef Istfan (Red-Green Devotion)**



![](https://media.wizards.com/2015/events/gpcop15/gpprov15_qfsacks.jpg)  
*Sacks was able to drop Istfan to 3 life—just enough for [Siege Rhino](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Siege+Rhino) to finish the job—in Game 1.*



Sacks started attacking early in Game 1, with [Rakshasa Deathdealer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rakshasa+Deathdealer) and [Anafenza, the Foremost](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Anafenza%2C+the+Foremost) quickly munching massive chunks from Istfan's life total. Isftan managed to stabilize behind [Whisperwood Elemental](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Whisperwood+Elemental) and an army of 2/2s but at that point he had alreaday fallen to 3—a critical number in the match-up. He managed to survive one draw step, then a second, but a [Siege Rhino](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Siege+Rhino) finally appeared for Sacks sending the players on to Game 2.



It was a much more reactive hand for the Abzan Aggro player in Game 2, as Sacks didn't commit a threat to the board until Istfan had already begun churning out Satyrs with [Xenagos, the Reveler](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Xenagos%2C+the+Reveler). When Xenagos finally decided to add loyalty—and mana—Sacks let out an “Oh, no.” A [Genesis Hydra](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Genesis+Hydra) for 8 mana followed, digging Istfan to Atarka and evening up the match.



![](https://media.wizards.com/2015/events/gpcop15/gpprov15_qfistfan.jpg)  
*When Istfan ticked up his Xenagos to add mana, Sacks could only mutter, “Oh, no.”*



In Game 3, Sacks cleared away Istfan's early mana creatures with [Drown in Sorrow](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Drown+in+Sorrow) and then set to work creating the largest [Warden of the First Tree](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Warden+of+the+First+Tree) he could. Meanwhile Istfan began rebuilding his board with first one Whisperwood, then another. One of them was flipped up to reveal a [Hornet Nest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hornet+Nest), earning Istfan two deathtouch Insects when the Warden next attacked.



The following turn the Warden was now a 13/13 and threatening to get larger when Sacks attacked. Isftan threw all his creatures—minus his [Whisperwood Elemental](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Whisperwood+Elemental)s—in front of it to take it out. Sacks used Drown to clear away Istfan's remaining blockers and soon there was a lone Whisperwood, a [Hornet Nest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hornet+Nest) and a manifested creature to hold off Sacks's attackers.



The [Hornet Nest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hornet+Nest) died of a [Self-Inflicted Wound](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Self-Inflicted+Wound)—it happens when you're full of angry Insects—and another removal spell took care of the remaining Whisperwood, sending Sacks to the semis.



*Sacks 2 – Istfan 1*
