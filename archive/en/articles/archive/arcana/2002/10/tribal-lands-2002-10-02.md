When the *Onslaught* development process began, there were only three tribal lands in the set: [Goblin Burrows](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Burrows), [Riptide Laboratory](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Riptide+Laboratory), and [Wirewood Lodge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wirewood+Lodge). All three were rare. After another cycle of lands were cut from the set, R&D decided to create five more tribal lands to reinforce the importance of creature types in the set.


Now each major race has a corresponding land, some of which are rare and some of which are uncommon. Some are more powerful than others, so try them out and see which ones you like.
