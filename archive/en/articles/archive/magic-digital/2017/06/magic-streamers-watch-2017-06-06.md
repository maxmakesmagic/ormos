 By night, Gaby streams Magic on Twitch. By day, she's co-founder and VP of Content at Dose, the Chicago-based media company behind Dose.com and OMGFacts.com. 






One of my favorite ways to stay connected with the *Magic* community is by watching *Magic* streams. Watching streamers is one of the best ways to improve your game and learn about different decks, formats, etc. We have a wealth of talented content creators, and below is a list of when and where to find them.


Not all streamers have a set daily schedule, so the best way to catch their streams is to follow the streamer on Twitch and ensure that notifications are turned on so you are notified when the streamer goes live. Another useful tip is to follow the streamer on Twitter as most of them will tweet out their upcoming stream plans and when their stream will begin.
