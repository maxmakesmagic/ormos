The Conflux has brought the shards together in a violent collision, a collision that has shaken not just the physical planes but the cultures and ideologies within them. Today we take a look at how the Conflux has affected one shard's struggle to survive and adapt.


*Interior, chambers of SHARUUM. XORIN, human archmage of the wizard's sect known as the Architects of Will, speaks to SHARUUM, wise sphinx and the Hegemon of all of Esper.*


XORIN  
 It's disaster, Hegemon. Our world is - *melding* with these lesser worlds! We're lost if we don't put a stop to this. Damn that Crucius, whose mad work led to all of this!


SHARUUM  
 Your words contain a contradiction, Xorin.


XORIN  
 Have they? I – I'm sorry, Hegemon.


SHARUUM  
 Let this not be a pattern.


*A human SCOUT enters.*


SCOUT  
 Hegemon – and sir - I have news from the front.


SHARUUM  
 Report.


SCOUT  
 Another spire's been lost. Harborgate.


XORIN *(disgusted)*  
 Another? How many this time?


SCOUT  
 Twenty-seven reported missing. Humans and vedalken, including one officer of the Ethersworn. Plus several homunculi.


SHARUUM  
 Tell me, scout. What's the loss of etherium?


SCOUT  
 The metallurgeon estimates that the equivalent of over 20,000 rods of etherium were lost, all told.


SHARUUM  
 So much...


SCOUT  
 Yes, Hegemon. And fifteen grid-squares of the Inkwell Sea, subsumed in the planar junction.


XORIN  
 Muster an invasion squad. If the other planes see fit to take lives of ours -


SHARUUM  
 Incorrect. First we consult the armillaries.


XORIN  
 But there's little time, Hegemon. The more we wait, the more of Esper's people we lose.


SHARUUM  
 Remember the Etherium Texts. "There are patterns on the breath of stars." Or did you believe that the forces of the Conflux were random? We can find that which we've lost.


XORIN *(bowing slightly)*  
 As you wish, Hegemon. Scout, fetch a diviner.


SHARUUM  
 And bring in the representative of the Seekers.


SCOUT  
 With respect, my lords, I'll do you one better.

The Conflux has meant different things to each of Alara's shards and their denizens. For Esper, it's a disaster to lose so much land and personnel—but the true loss is precious etherium. Quantities of the æther-infused metal are dwindling, which has begun to affect not only the Ethersworn's Noble Work to perfect Esper's life with the metal, but also the prosaic. The prosaic are Esperites who cannot wield magic—definitely a second-class citizen on a world that reveres wizardry. Many of Esper's prosaic citizens earn a living by scavenging etherium from the ugly cesspool quarters of the plane, as [Tezzeret's father did](/en/node/628096). Even those who choose not to scavenge scrap etherium, though, have their lives inextricably linked to the metal, and to the invasion it inspires.


*Harborgate, the spire that was lost to an incursion zone, has emerged off the coast of Jhess, a nation of Bant. Standing at the top of the spire, above the waves of Bant's sea, are two sisters: AGATHA, a prosaic soldier, and CALLIO, an officer of the Ethersworn.*


AGATHA  
 The woods are so green. The coastline looks like emeralds from here.


CALLIO  
 Get your head together, Agatha. Load your crossbow. Help me snare those floaters.


AGATHA  
 Callio – how could you be so callous? They're *dead*.


CALLIO  
 I need them for their etherium. This bulkhead is too solid to cut – I need their lighter filigree.


AGATHA  
 We're not even in Esper anymore. Can't you think of anything besides etherium? The others are dead. Harborgate has - *traveled*. It's part of this world now, and so are we.


CALLIO  
 Quiet. That's *treason*.


AGATHA (*laughing bitterly*)  
 How would *you* know? None of the Texts ever predicted something like this. And you're the one who wants to shoot our own *dead*.


CALLIO  
 Just be practical for a moment, will you? We're stranded in a land beyond our world, thousands of gridlines from home. My retinue and your support homunculi were crushed when the seawater flooded the lower levels. What we need to do is signal someone in Esper that we're alive - and for that we need salvageable etherium.


AGATHA  
 Fine.


*Agatha loads her crossbow with a bolt attached to a long cord. She aims it at one of the bodies floating in the sea below.*


CALLIO  
 Aim for a leg or something – don't damage the neck filigree.


AGATHA  
 I got it.


*Agatha fires.*

Recent years have seen a rise in the popularity of the Seekers of Carmot, the sect of mages dedicated to finding the red stone required to create new etherium. Their dogma is clear: send emissaries into the other shards, seeking that stone at any cost. Some mages have misgivings about the Seekers' zeal and single-mindedness, and deeply distrust their eagerness to leave Esper after the convergence of the shards. In truth, most Seekers have no idea that their quest has been motivated by the dragon planeswalker Nicol Bolas.


*Sharuum's chambers. A blue-skinned vedalken mage, TRAVIUS, now stands before SHARUUM and XORIN. A large ARMILLARY SPHERE sits in the center of the chamber: a partial model of Alara. Glowing motes of energy float in complicated orbits inside the sphere.*


SHARUUM  
 Travius, is it?


TRAVIUS  
 Yes, Hegemon. I'm a mage of Magister rank.


XORIN *(suspiciously)*  
 You're a Seeker.


TRAVIUS  
 Of course. I seek the completion of the Noble Work through the discovery of etherium's constituent elements.


SHARUUM  
 And you can perform divination with an armillary?


TRAVIUS  
 The paths of these spheres have been etched into our minds. We have several agents already infiltrating the adjoining worlds, tracing the paths of Esper's shifting and merging landmasses, and armillaries are crucial to our work.


*SHARUUM casts a significant look at XORIN.*


TRAVIUS  
 You seek the tower of Harborgate, correct?


SHARUUM  
 Yes. Proceed.


*TRAVIUS nods and peers into the armillary sphere for several moments. XORIN barely conceals his disdain. A blue mote of energy floats along the top of the sphere, and TRAVIUS traces its path with a blue-grey finger.*


TRAVIUS  
 Harborgate. It's there, past the Inkwell, past Esper's frontier. It's deep in, but we could guide a squad to it...


XORIN  
 Make it happen.


TRAVIUS  
 But... if I might suggest another strategy?


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/stf/stf28_viewFromAboveSplash.jpg)  
Esper has Bant and Grixis encroaching on its planar flanks. Grixis definitely looks like a hell to those Esperites who've seen it—but from their perspective, even Bant is no heaven. Although Esper shares two colors of mana with Bant, the strange, strong-willed creatures and magics there are bewildering. Most of the Esperites who have experience with the creatures of Bant, in fact, are part of one particular mage sect.


*Back to the two sisters in the lost spire of Harborgate. CALLIO is harvesting etherium from a fallen comrade, a grisly affair.*


AGATHA *(under her breath)*  
 Nothing's worth this.


*There's a cry in the distance. An aven of Bant, scouting their location.*


AGATHA  
 Callio, look. What is that?


CALLIO *(glancing up)*  
 It's seen us. You're going to have to take it down.


AGATHA  
 It's diving down toward us, toward the tower. Maybe it can help us!


CALLIO *(grimly)*  
 It's going to. Shoot it.


AGATHA  
 But - *no*. You're going to *enhance* it.


CALLIO  
 Do you want a horde of them to come back for us, and peck out our eyes? They're even more savage than our unenhanced creatures on Esper. Shoot that thing, now.


AGATHA  
 You've seen these before. You know of this world.


CALLIO  
 I – yes.


AGATHA *(realizing)*  
 You're a Seeker.


CALLIO  
 Give me that thing.


*CALLIO grabs the crossbow out of AGATHA'S hands. Before her sister can react, CALLIO fires at the aven scout, piercing it in the heart. The aven falls into the sea, trailing a long cord back to the spire, and CALLIO's hands.*


AGATHA  
 I thought you were Ethersworn! How long have you *been* with those fearmongers?


CALLIO (*her face hard as ice*)  
 Since... Jaria.


AGATHA  
 That long? Callio, Jaria - she was not your fault.


*CALLIO reels the aven's body toward them slowly, her words even and carefully chosen.*


CALLIO  
 Of course it's my fault. We're an imperfect people, Agatha. We need that metal, and we'll need far more of it than the Ethersworn will ever realize. My daughter was just one of the mistakes - the *errors* that will spread throughout Esper.


AGATHA  
 But - look around us. This whole world functions without etherium. This creature you've *killed*. Listen to yourself. You're a zealot, Callio.


CALLIO  
 And you're a fool! This world has no value other than that red stone, and its service to our mission. It will succeed, or our way of life will die.


AGATHA  
 What - what *mission*?


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/stf/stf28_scornfulAetherLichSplash.jpg)  
Though the Seekers have found no carmot in Bant or Grixis, the encounters with the bizarre, untamed denizens of those shards has only increased their devotion to their cause. Though many curse the name of Crucius the Mad—the brilliant sphinx whose gift of etherium gave rise to overzealous monstrosities like æther-liches—they're the ultimate soldiers for his cause. That Bolas co-opted their mission for his own purposes doesn't change their zeal.


*Sharuum's chambers.*


XORIN  
 You're proposing we do *nothing*?


TRAVIUS  
 Not nothing. Let the mission take its course. It's come at great cost.


SHARUUM  
 I see. Much etherium was spent...


TRAVIUS  
 But in the service of being able to create much more.


XORIN  
 Wait a minute. You're suggesting – the loss of Harborgate was *planned?*


TRAVIUS  
 Not Harborgate in particular. Even with the armillaries, we cannot predict which areas will remain part of Esper – and which will be lost to the other worlds. Dozens of the outlying towers are at risk at all times. 


SHARUUM  
 So each is seeded with a Seeker.


TRAVIUS  
 Yes. Someone to ensure that disaster can be turned into opportunity.


XORIN *(angry)*  
 Twenty-seven, Seeker. Twenty-seven people are missing, presumed dead.


TRAVIUS  
 That is unfortunate. But it's miniscule compared to the losses we face if Esper runs out of etherium. Once our agent sends back a signal of her status, then we can direct her on her mission.


XORIN  
 Hegemon, surely you're not going to allow this?


*The Hegemon SHARUUM crosses her enormous front paws. Her glance jumps from skylight to skylights in the ceiling, as if trying to catch the eye of another sphinx she once knew, high above. But he's gone. Her expression changes, and she faces the others again, her decision made.*


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/stf/stf28_etheriumSculptorSplash.jpg)  
Swept up in the fervor surrounding the Seekers of Carmot are thousands of civilians, some of whom feel little or no allegiance with the Seekers' cause—but who, as part of Esper culture, are inseparable from concerns over the plane's supply of etherium. For good or for ill, life on Esper *means* a life with etherium. 


*CALLIO is using a spell to integrate some of the salvaged etherium into the dead Bant aven. Its torso and part of its spinal column have been replaced with an elegant weave of etherium, which has been soaked in the aven's blood. AGATHA looks on in horror.*


AGATHA  
 You – you endangered the lives of dozens of people. By not telling us. You endangered *me*!


CALLIO  
 The Conflux endangers us. The other worlds endanger us. Everyone in these outlying towers knew the risk. I merely prepared for the danger. Here - help me hold this thing's head.


AGATHA  
 I'm not helping you do anything.


CALLIO  
 You want to get home, don't you? You want to signal Esper that we're alive?


AGATHA  
 Not – not if it means this. Not if it means all these people die for your agenda.


*AGATHA takes the crossbow and snaps a bolt into it, loading it in a flash. She points it at CALLIO.*


CALLIO  
 This world has already sunk its claws into you, sister. Emotions cloud your vision.


AGATHA  
 My vision is finally clear.


CALLIO  
 You're not worth the etherium in your frame.


*AGATHA fires. The bolt slams into CALLIO's chest. CALLIO gasps, grasping the end of the bolt, coughing blood. A few drowning breaths later, she dies.*


*AGATHA touches her sister's pale cheek. Then she takes a few short, bracing breaths and dives off the tower into Bant's sea. She swims toward the shore of Jhess, leaving her weapon behind.*


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/stf/stf28_worldlyCounselSplash.jpg)  
Though it is rare, desertion has affected the populations of every shard of Alara. Where mana flows, so flows a stream of new experiences and perspectives. For a small handful of Alarans, this represents an opportunity for a fresh start—rather than cause for war.


*SHARUUM's chambers, four days later. SHARUUM gives TRAVIUS another audience.*


SHARUUM  
 I see the news in the patterns in your face. No word from Harborgate.


TRAVIUS  
 No, Hegemon. It's disappointing. Our success rate is low.


SHARUUM  
 But... this is the best way?


TRAVIUS  
 It's the only way.


*SHARUUM nods, a bit sadly. Travius bows, and exits.*


### Letter of the Week

But Vorthos? Conflux was about the 5 colors, about Alara being a kind of 'Magic Unleashed' (ala Maelstrom Archangel, or Child of Alara) - creating forces amalgamated from 5 colors and turning out more powerful than the most powerful anything that's ever been before.

> Yes - he's got STORY behind this, but for that matter, SO DOES PROGENITUS, plus Prog is more Vorthos-ly connected to Alara SPECIFICALLY, is ALREADY 5 colors of mana, and has an effect which interacts with all 5 colors as well: Protection from all 5 colors (and Artifacts from Esper) [and everything else - BWAHHAHAHA]
> 
> 
> So basically, I think Prog is way more Vorthos-y than Bolas, b/c he FEELS 'Alara-y' whereas Bolas is just the popular poster-boy for the set, representing the same old 'omnipotent, omniscient' theme he did before. Nothing in Alara is about gaining all knowledge for power, except that Bolas has infiltrated Alara in every shard as part of his plan. But as far as the feel of what the set means for players, the kind of playstyles people will be attracted to, what Alara MEANS, I say Prog has Bolas beat on all counts.

Thanks for your input, Matt! It'd definitely be interesting to see the two of them fight head-to-head in a Vorthos Award Final Battle. 


I MEAN NEVERMIND BOLAS WOULD WIN HANDS DOWN


*Sorry Master please don't wipe my brain*
