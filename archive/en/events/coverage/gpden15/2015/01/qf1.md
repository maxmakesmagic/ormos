 Matt Sperling, the ChannelFireball personality and Pro Tour *Magic 2015* Top 8 competitor, made it to the Top 8 unscathed. He was the last undefeated player, and was able to draw his way into a spot in the here. He was playing the Pro-preferred Abzan Aggro. It's ability to go just under the midrange had worked well all weekend, but now that would be tested.



Lukas Parson was on a Red-Green list that often gets in just as quickly as Abzan Aggro can. Though Sperling has more disruption, he would likely be on the back foot. That is, if Parson could get footing of his own first. This would be fighting turns earlier than the now-standard Standard games are fought.



**The Games**




 Sperling started with a pair of [Thoughtseize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtseize)sâ€”he saw [Heir of the Wilds](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Heir+of+the+Wilds), [Fanatic of Xenagos](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fanatic+of+Xenagos), Crater's Claws, and [Goblin Rabblemaster](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Rabblemaster).
