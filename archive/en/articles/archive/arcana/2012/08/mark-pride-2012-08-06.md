So there are both feline characters associated with a pride. But is it the *same* pride? The answer is yes! First, look at the circlet on [Healer of the Pride](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Healer+of+the+Pride)'s chest.

Now, look at the circlet on [Ajani, Caller of the Pride](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ajani%2C+Caller+of+the+Pride)'s shoulder.

Same circlet? Same pride!
