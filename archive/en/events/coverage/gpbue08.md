Grand Prix Buenos Aires 2008
----------------------------


Braga Outlasts Record Competition in Buenos Aires!
==================================================




June 28-29, 2008











![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gpba08/Final%20Blurb%20Photo.jpg)What a weekend! The largest South American Grand Prix on the history books, and one for the ages. Nearly 600 players showed up from all over the world to take their shot at earning some of the Summer Series’ additional Grand Prix prize support, but only one emerged victorious! To get there Francisco Braga had to face some tough competition in the form of professional players both locally and abroad arriving to rain on his parade.


Of course, the true story of the weekend was the utter dominance of the supposed “pros” at the hands of a contingent of South American players. Only Olivier Ruel survived to the Top 8 where he quickly succumbed in the quarterfinals. It was Damian Buckley who held the honor of being the last member of the home country standing, falling to eventual finalist Felipe Alves Pelligrini in the semifinals to set up a championship match between two Brazilians. Pelligrini’s innovative take on Monored Storm turned heads all weekend, but fancy outside-the-box thinking wasn’t enough to get him through a wall named Francisco Braga. Braga’s black-green Elves list echoed Charlie Gindy’s success from Pro Tour-Hollywood and the little tribe that could did, adding yet another championship title to its already impressive resume.


Francisco Braga is your 2008 Grand Prix-Buenos Aires champion!

Feature Match: Round 9 - Santiago Guzzetti vs Olivier Ruel
----------------------------------------------------------


*by Bill Stark*

Both these players had managed to end the first day of play with perfect records, and Santiago awoke to find himself at the very top of the standings. He opened the game by suspending back-to-back [Ancestral Vision](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ancestral+Vision)s, but a series of [Careful Consideration](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Careful+Consideration)s ensured Olivier would be able to keep up. The Argentinean was representing Faeries, but he wasn't doing much in the form of actually *playing* the pesky critters. Olivier, meanwhile, focused on resolving a [Mulldrifter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mulldrifter). The two players sat in silence, though whether that was from lack of sleep the night before, a language barrier, or simply trying to concentrate under the lights of Day 2 remained to be seen.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gpba08/FM9_Olivier-Ruel.jpg)*Olivier Ruel*When Olivier played a [Kitchen Finks](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kitchen+Finks), Santiago made his first Faerie of the game in the form of [Sower of Temptation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sower+of+Temptation), sneaking the 3/2 onto his side of the board. Olivier didn't seem concerned after playing not one but two [Wall of Roots](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wall+of+Roots), and the two players moved the game along slowly, Santiago trying to make Faeries, Olivier trying to disrupt that.


Eventually the Frenchman decided to "go for it", opting to make a [Cloudthresher](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloudthresher) during his opponent's upkeep. A pair of [Rune Snag](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rune+Snag)s traded, then a surprise [Pact of Negation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pact+of+Negation) sealed the deal for Ruel, allowing him to outmaneuver both his opponent's spells and lands. At 13 life at the start of the turn, Guzzetti fell to 12 from a [Bitterblossom](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bitterblossom), then 10 from [Cloudthresher](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloudthresher). Tapped out from his counters he had no choice but to concede as the [Cloudthresher](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloudthresher) alongside Ruel's re-stolen [Kitchen Finks](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kitchen+Finks) threatened lethal damage. The outcome caught the crowd pressed in to watch off guard, but Santiago revealed no emotions. [insert image align right "FM9\_Santiago Guzzetti" cap: The stoic Santiago Guzzetti]


Olivier Ruel: 1, Santiago Guzzetti: 0


On the play for the second, Santiago came out of the gates with the best second turn his deck could muster in [Bitterblossom](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bitterblossom). Ruel pouted his lip but shrugged, unable to counter the troublesome enchantment on a single land. Guzzetti's third turn brought a suspended [Ancestral Vision](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ancestral+Vision)s, and Olivier could only evoke a [Mulldrifter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mulldrifter) in the hopes of keeping up with his opponent.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gpba08/FM9_Santiago-Guzzetti.jpg)*Santiago Guzzetti*Santiago's army grew incrementally each turn, and Olivier's efforts to stem the bleeding were met with counters. His comes-into-play-tapped lands ensured he couldn't find the spare mana to pay for his opponent's [Rune Snag](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rune+Snag)s, and a [Spellstutter Sprite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spellstutter+Sprite) hopped into play to counter as well. Things weren't looking good for the Frenchman.


Or so it seemed. The wily pro had actually been bleeding his opponent's counters out while building up the manabase to play [Cloudthresher](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloudthresher). The 7/7 hopped into play during Santiago's upkeep, just prior to [Ancestral Vision](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ancestral+Vision)s resolving. Santiago shrugged and scooped up his team, placing them in the graveyard. It was a small victory for Olivier who still had a [Bitterblossom](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bitterblossom) and an opponent who had just netted three additional cards to deal with.


It took two more draw steps for Olivier to realize the inevitable, and he scooped it up to the impending 1/1 Faerie Rogue doom.


Olivier Ruel: 1, Santiago Guzzetti: 1


The crowd of onlookers swelled as the players headed into the rubber game where things started off very slowly for Santiago. He made some early land drops, but had no creatures or pressure to speak of while Olivier quickly jumped ahead on the land front thanks to double copies of [Wall of Roots](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wall+of+Roots) and a [Dreadship Reef](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dreadship+Reef) he was able to repeatedly charge. Ruel put so much value in maintaining that advantage, in fact, that when his opponent attempted to [Cryptic Command](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cryptic+Command) the Reef, Ruel spent a [Rune Snag](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rune+Snag) to keep it on the board.


The next counter battle came just a short time later over Olivier's [Careful Consideration](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Careful+Consideration). Santiago attempted to [Rune Snag](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rune+Snag) for four and while Olivier had the four mana, he opted to play [Cryptic Command](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cryptic+Command) to cantrip the Coldsnap common instead. Santiago simply shrugged and played a second [Rune Snag](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rune+Snag). Olivier considered how important his blue "sorcery" was, then decided to [Pact of Negation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pact+of+Negation) the second Snag, winning the resource battle. Santiago still had yet to play an actual Faerie, though an early attack with a [Mutavault](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mutavault) had put the totals at 20-18 in his favor.


A [Thoughtseize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtseize) from Santiago revealed some trouble: his opponent's hand was total gas featuring two [Cloudthresher](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloudthresher)s, [Slaughter Pact](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Slaughter+Pact), [Careful Consideration](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Careful+Consideration), and [Crovax, Ascendant Hero](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crovax%2C+Ascendant+Hero). Santiago had his hands full, but despite being in his first feature match, his face didn't belie any emotions. Olivier may have been the seasoned pro in the match, but the Argentinean certainly wasn't going to let it bother him.


In the background an announcement was made regarding sign-up for the day's PTQ and the crowd watching the game dwindled.


Santiago was able to counter Ruel's second [Cloudthresher](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloudthresher) after his [Thoughtseize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtseize) had nabbed the first, but Ruel's [Careful Consideration](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Careful+Consideration) resolved and was followed up by Crovax. With no attacking force in play Santiago was not in good shape. He tried to get something going, and a long complicated stack arose over his [Mistbind Clique](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mistbind+Clique) at the end of Olivier's turn. When all was said and done, Olivier had managed to counter the 4/4 (3/3 thanks to Crovax) and both players were nearly out of cards. Guzzetti still had an [Ancestral Vision](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ancestral+Vision)s counting down, but it looked like it would be too little too late as Olivier got to refuel first with a [Mulldrifter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mulldrifter). [insert image left align "FM9\_Olivier Ruel" cap: Globetrotter Olivier Ruel]


Olivier's next play was a wild one as he tapped seven mana to plunk a [Platinum Angel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Platinum+Angel) onto the table. At just 5 life, Santiago seemed to be drawing dead, but a series of fortunate [Cryptic Command](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cryptic+Command)s *might* be able to buy him some time. It was all down to what his [Ancestral Vision](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ancestral+Vision)s could provide. Unfortunately for Guzzetti, Ruel had the [Pact of Negation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pact+of+Negation) and when the top card of the Argentinean's deck wasn't a miracle, he extended his hand.


Olivier Ruel defeats Santiago Guzzetti 2-1.
