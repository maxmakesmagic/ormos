![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/ptosa02/a907.jpg)This round feature two European players that are generally well known for their eclectic and surprising deck construction. Bram Snepvangers complained that he was unable to find a suitable combo deck – his [Confessor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Confessor)-Lich deck has too many problems. So he decided to got for a variant of the most popular deck in the format, Mono Black control. Labarre has also opted for a lesser played mainstay, a Blue Black [Pyschatog](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyschatog)/[Upheaval](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Upheaval) deck.

Game 1 sees the Dutchman mulligan a one swamp hand, but his second hand didn't seem that much better, being forced to keep a one swamp, [Cabal Coffers](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cabal+Coffers) hand with a multitude of expensive spells. He didn't draw a swamp till turn 3, but it did allow him to cast a [Nantuko Shade](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nantuko+Shade) on that turn. Labarre responded with a [Pyschatog](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyschatog), with a blue mana open, trying to represent he had a [Circular Logic](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Circular+Logic). This was confirmed when Bram attempted to [Chainer's Edict](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chainer%27s+Edict) him, and he responded with the expected Logic. He proceeded to [Concentrate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Concentrate) in an attempt to improve his position, but this allowed for more Snepvangers to Edict away the [Psychatog](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psychatog) and begin attacking with his [Nantuko Shade](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nantuko+Shade). Labarre triedto come back in the match by casting his another ![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/ptosa02/a906.jpg)[Psychatog](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psychatog) and a [Shadowmage Infiltrator](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shadowmage+Infiltrator), but the defensive line of the Dutchman was bolstered by a [Shambling Swarm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shambling+Swarm). The Shade kept coming in, for another 6 damage as the Frenchman declined to block, and was soon joined by a twin. Finally the Frenchman decided to block the twin shades with his Infiltrator and Tog, but it became clear that something was afoot when the Frenchman decided to [Compulsion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Compulsion) perfectly good cards into his graveyard. His strategy became clear when he [Upheaval](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Upheaval)ed the next turn as well as casting a [Psychatog](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psychatog). But Bram saw through that plan and had the [Innocent Blood](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Innocent+Blood) at the ready. After that plan failed the match deteriorated with multiple Shade's ending the first game.

Snepvangers 1-0

Bram brings in [Mindslicer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mindslicer)s, [Mesmeric Fiend](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mesmeric+Fiend) and Echoes, with Nicolas bringing in [Divert](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Divert)s, Fiends and more [Compulsion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Compulsion)s.

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/ptosa02/a905.jpg)Game 2 sees Labarre a little more active with a second turn [Zombie Infestation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Zombie+Infestation), with Snepvangers replying with a [Mesmeric Fiend](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mesmeric+Fiend), taking a [Shadowmage Infiltrator](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shadowmage+Infiltrator). The fiend was short lived with an Edict burying it before it held Finkel for any longer. Shadowmage Infiltrator hit he board the next turn, but was held off by a [Nantuko Shade](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nantuko+Shade), but a combination of [Aether Burst](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aether+Burst)s made sure that the Invitational card got in for a few hits. Snepvangers attempt to kill the Mage were continually thwarted by the creation of Zombies from the Infestation, as well as the occasional [Circular Logic](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Circular+Logic). Finally Snepvangers stabilized the board with a [Mindslicer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mindslicer) which held off a ton of Infiltrators, and when a [Laquatus' Champion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Laquatus%27+Champion) hit the table there were not many turs remaining in the match. Snepvangers added insult to injury by casting [Hypnox](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hypnox), which elicited a chuckle and concession from the beaten Frenchman.

**Final Result:** Snepvangers wins 2-0
