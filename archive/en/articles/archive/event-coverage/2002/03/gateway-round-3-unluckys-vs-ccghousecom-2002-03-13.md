CCGHouse.com is The Magic Colony's entry into the Masters Gateway. Everyone's favorite colonists Peter 'PTR' Szigeti and Brian Hegstad join forces with former ABU affiliate Phil Freneau in a bid for the big bucks. After relaxing with a first round bye, they beat Singapore's Slaughter House, and now find themselves facing Unlucky's

One of Japan's long-running teams, Unlucky's features Osamu Fujita of Anchans fame, as well as Ayumi Hidaka and Takayuki Nagaoka. Their best performance was Top 4 at Grand Prix - Nagoya, Japan's first team Grand Prix, but their consistency has earned them a high enough rating to compete this weekend. 

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/mastersosa02/a495.jpg)*Phil Freneau vs. Takayuki Nagaoka*The first match underway was Nagaoka vs. Freneau. While Nagaoka managed only a [Cephalid Scout](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cephalid+Scout) before stalling at two land, Freneau busted out [Wild Mongrel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Mongrel), [Mad Dog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mad+Dog), and [Krosan Avenger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Krosan+Avenger). Nagaoka found his third land, but was well on the back foot.

Next door, Szigeti was ruling the table against Hidaka. [Shambling Swarm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shambling+Swarm) and [Painbringer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Painbringer) meant that Hidaka couldn't keep creatures in the game. Hegstad was also in good shape. His opponent, Fujita, had just a [Crypt Creeper](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crypt+Creeper) and a [Mesmeric Fiend](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mesmeric+Fiend), which he held off with a pair of [Teroh's Faithful](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Teroh%27s+Faithful).

Nagaoka finally found a fourth land and dropped a Faithful of his own. [Seton's Desire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seton%27s+Desire) on the Mongrel convinced Nagaoka to chump, but he came back with a [Blessed Orator](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blessed+Orator) with [Strength of Isolation](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Strength+of+Isolation). Freneau had to wait for cards before he could punch through.

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/mastersosa02/a493.jpg)*Peter Szigeti vs. Ayumi Hidaka*[Gorrila Titan](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gorrila+Titan) was giving Szigeti problems, but he is a patient man. After spilling creatures onto the board, he made an all out assault, and took down the giant with [Afflict](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Afflict) and the [Painbringer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Painbringer). He was way ahead, but a string of land draws kept Hidaka in the game.

Hegstad soon earned CCGHouse their first win. [Balshan Collaborator](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Balshan+Collaborator) and [Aven Smokeweaver](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aven+Smokeweaver) went over the top while Fujita played his tenth consecutive land. And just as he was accepting the handshake, Freneau was attacking for the win. A [Crashing Centaur](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crashing+Centaur) had joined his Desired Mongrel and [Krosan Avenger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Krosan+Avenger), so he just pitched to threshold and swung through for 8. Eventually Szigeti drew a non-land card and, with the [Painbringers](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Painbringers) help, put CCGHouse up a game in every match.

Freneau's opening hand in his second game was insane, but made a little less so by Nagaoka's [Syncopate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Syncopate) on his [Wild Mongrel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Mongrel). Nevertheless, he had [Krosan Avenger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Krosan+Avenger) and a pair of [Muscle Burst](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Muscle+Burst)s to make Nagaoka regret blocking.

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/mastersosa02/a496.jpg)*Brian Hegstad vs. Osamu Fujita*Game 2 for Hegstad looked exactly like the first, with Fujita playing out a substand army and Hegstad outmatching him on the ground and in the air. In a blink of an eye Freneau was turning to his teammates to report his match win. His [Muscle Burst](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Muscle+Burst)s were backed by [Violent Eruption](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Violent+Eruption). When Fujita's draws didn't cooperate, he succumbed to Hegstad's Air Force.

The moral victory went to Hidaka, who dropped [Gorilla Titan](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gorilla+Titan) and [Arrogant Wurm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arrogant+Wurm) to even his match with Szigeti just as Fujita's loss eliminated their team.

**Final Result:** CCGHouse.com defeats Unlucky's
