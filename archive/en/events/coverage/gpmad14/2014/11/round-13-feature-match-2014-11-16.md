At other times these two would work together as teammates, this time Pierre Dagen and Patrick Dickmann were locked in a battle which would eliminate one of them from Top 8 contention. Dagen's previous accomplishments included two Grand Prix and one Pro Tour Top 8, whereas Dickmann could claim one Grand Prix and one Pro Tour Top 8. And, as he did, he could claim the title of being the last undefeated player in the tournament, albeit with a record of 10-0-2, compared to Dagen's 10-1-1. Unfortunately, he also claimed he could never beat Dagen. "I always take at least one mulligan per game when we play," Dickmann said.


The matchup here was [Splinter Twin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Splinter+Twin), Dickmann's trademark deck, versus Dagen's [Birthing Pod](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Birthing+Pod).


Game 1
======


Things began slowly but escalated quickly. Dagen had his first play, a [Noble Hierarch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Noble+Hierarch), only on turn two, but two turns later he was already attacking for 5 with [Siege Rhino](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Siege+Rhino). Meanwhile, Dickmann, after his obligatory mulligan, had cast [Serum Visions](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Serum+Visions), flashed it back via [Snapcaster Mage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snapcaster+Mage), and still had not found a single source of red mana, staring glumly at his two basic Islands and two [Desolate Lighthouse](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Desolate+Lighthouse)s.

Dickmann bought some time with [Deceiver Exarch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deceiver+Exarch), and even more with [Steam Vents](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Steam+Vents) (since now Dagen was forced to keep [Abrupt Decay](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Abrupt+Decay) mana up, for fear of [Splinter Twin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Splinter+Twin) enchanting [Deceiver Exarch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deceiver+Exarch)). But the clock was ticking. [Siege Rhino](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Siege+Rhino) and [Scavenging Ooze](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scavenging+Ooze) soon brought Dickmann to 1 (effectively killing his as-of-yet unused [Polluted Delta](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Polluted+Delta)), and then Dagen cast another [Siege Rhino](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Siege+Rhino). Dickmann checked the top of his deck for answers using [Izzet Charm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Izzet+Charm) and conceded.



**Pierre Dagen 1-0 Patrick Dickmann**


Game 2
======


The second game was even more miserable for Dickmann, with another mulligan and a missed land drop on turn three. Dickmann was able to delay it for a turn via [Remand](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Remand), but the first nonland permanent to enter the battlefield was Dagen's [Choke](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Choke).

At that point, Dickmann controlled but one [Steam Vents](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Steam+Vents) and one Island. Adding insult to injury, his deck then gave him [Flooded Strand](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flooded+Strand) which, again, would only be able to search for another Island. Choking on [Choke](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Choke), Dickmann was not happy with the way things were going. When Dagen resolved a sizable threat in [Siege Rhino](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Siege+Rhino), Dickmann did the math. Bereft of untap steps, his chances of racing the Rhino were next to nil. He frowned and extended his hand in concession.



"Didn't I say so? I just can't beat him."


**Pierre Dagen 2-0 Patrick Dickmann**
