Four New Faces

By Trick Jarrett




Patrick "Trick" Jarrett oversees web content and social media for Magic, and acts as the publisher of DailyMTG.com and Magic content on the web. He's an ardent Commander player and lover of the game he's played since Ice Age. 







It's hard to believe, but it's been just over a year since [I](http://archive.wizards.com/://www.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Archive.aspx?author=Trick%20Jarrett), and [Mike McArtor](http://www.wizards.com/magic/magazine/archive.aspx?author=mike%20mcartor), took over DailyMTG.com from [Kelly Digges](http://www.wizards.com/magic/magazine/archive.aspx?author=kelly%20digges). Oh how time flies when you're having fun! 

I wanted to share with you all the changes to the lineup for DailyMTG.com next year.

### Requisition: 1 Cannon for the Lab

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/features/feat225e_mike_cannon_2.jpg) Mike Cannon, a columnist from GatheringMagic.com, will be taking over as the author behind the beloved Johnny column, From the Lab! Mike and I worked together before I came to Wizards of the Coast and he was one of the people I spoke with as a potential author for From the Lab. After interviews, discussing intentions and ideas for the column, and reviewing his writing, we decided he was the man to bring the Johnny column back into the weekly lineup for DailyMTG! 

### Marshalling Limited Information

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/features/feat225e_marshall_sutcliffe_2.jpg) This week was [Steve's farewell](/en/articles/archive/limited-information/foundations-part-2-playing-game-2012-12-12) as the author behind Limited Information. He's still going to be doing event coverage for Wizards and he might pop back into DailyMTG.com down the road, but for now he will be passing the mantle to a name some of you might have heard of before... 


[Marshall Sutcliffe](http://www.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Archive.aspx?author=Marshall%20Sutcliffe)! 

 Marshall is well known for his podcast, [Limited Resources](http://lrcast.com/), and his work on covering the Pro Tour, and now he'll be well known for putting his wisdom to digital ink on the presses of DailyMTG.com. 

### Rechartering Uncharted Realms

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/features/feat225e_adam_lee.jpg) The creative team is a bunch of busy people. Tasked with worldbuilding, story writing, and character creation for all of **Magic** keeps them all quite busy. They are constantly hard at work on **Magic**'s upcoming sets and other projects. 


[Jenna Helland](https://www.wizards.com/magic/magazine/archive.aspx?author=jenna%20helland), author of Uncharted Realms, has been moved to work on another project, which will take her away from the column. To replace her we have the awesome [Adam Lee](http://www.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Archive.aspx?author=Adam%20Lee) coming to share stories and put his own spin on Uncharted Realms. 

### Sam Black on Daily Decks

Lastly is the change to Daily Decks.

 One of my goals with Daily Decks was to make it a rotating post among **Magic**'s top pros. We started with the past six months having [Conley Woods](http://www.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Archive.aspx?author=Conley%20Woods), Master **Magic** Brewer, sending in decks from around the **Magic** web. He's done phenomenally well and has been a major boon to the website. His time in the post has come to a close, though, and we begin next year anew with another well known **Magic** pro: 

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/features/feat225e_sam_black_2.jpg)Sam Black!

 Sam's a Platinum-level pro, the [2008 World's Team Champion](/en/articles/archive/event-coverage/japanese-coverage-2008-magic-world-championships-2008-12-11) (alongside Paul Cheon and Michael Jacob), and a well-known deck builder at the highest levels of **Magic**. While continuing to write for StarCityGames, he'll provide the Daily Decks for DailyMTG.com. We're very excited to have him aboard! 

### Next Week's Content

 Historically, next week (December 17â€”21) would be the first of two weeks of reruns, or best-ofs, for DailyMTG.com. I wanted to try something new this year, so next week will instead be **Magic Online** Week. We'll be giving all of our weekly authors the week off and instead pulling in new authors, and perhaps a few you already know, to provide content for DailyMTG.com. 

 Feedback 

As with all of these sorts of articles, I urge you to use the email link at the bottom to send me your feedback about these changes and about the site as a whole. I read every feedback email I receive.

Thanks for reading!

//Trick

PS: Be sure to check DailyMTG.com on December 24, 2012, and every day that week. I'm sure you'll find something worth unwrapping.
