PAX Prime is upon us and *Magic* will be there once more! Check out everything we have at PAX, which starts this Friday, August 29 and runs through Monday, September 1 in Seattle, WA.

Playing at PAX
==============


There will be more *Magic* play space than ever before with seating for more than 600 players! We have taken over both lower floors of the atrium business center. Our friends over at Cascade Games will be running *Magic* events all weekend! Be sure to head over to the *Magic* area to play in some of these events.


For more information on these events check out the [Cascade Games website](http://www.cascadegames.com/events/982). And just a reminder, yes, you must have a PAX Badge to play in the events. They are not open to the public.


Booth #1642
===========


We will have a booth on the floor, allowing those of you who haven't had the opportunity yet to play *Magic 2015*—*Duels of the Planeswalkers* to do so on an iPad or an Alienware laptop. You'll also get an opportunity to take a photo with Garruk's helmet and axe, as well as a booth to buy shirts and accessories from our friends at Araca! Additionally, you can also purchase a PAX-exclusive, all-black Funko Pop! Garruk figure.

Pinny Arcade Pin
================


The 2014 PAX Prime Pin features the right side of Garruk's face, which, for those of you who made it to PAX East, will discover is a perfect match for the left side of his face we gave away there. You can get your pin by taking part in the *Magic* booth experience, or possibly by finding one of our community managers as they roam the hall and tweet about the convention.


*Magic* Charging Station
========================


Walking a con is hard work, but *Magic* has you covered. This year we're introducing the *Magic* charging station, which is set up on Level 4 of the South Lobby and will provide outlets and USB sockets for people in need of getting a little juice for their laptops, phones, and tablets.


Party
=====


For the sixth year in a row, *Magic* will be hosting a party to kick off our new block's first set! You'll have to follow a quest to earn your entry to the party, as with every year, and trust me when I say you won't want to miss the party! And yes, we will have several preview cards there to kick off next week's *Khans of Tarkir* preview season!

The party starts at 7 p.m. on Saturday. To start your journey to get your ticket to the party, make your way to the tournament area, where you'll find a booth that is the start and the end of the quest. Keep in mind tickets to the party are limited on both Friday and Saturday.


Panel
=====


Members of the *Magic: The Gathering* creative team will be hosting a panel on Sunday at 1:30 p.m. in the Hedgehog Theater *(Please note this originally said 1 p.m., which was incorrect)*, which will be live streaming on Twitch.tv. On the panel this year is:



* Brian Trunk, *Magic* brand manager
* Colin Kawakami
* Doug Beyer
* Ari Levitch

**Note: This will be live streamed on the PAX stream, not the *Magic* Twitch stream.**
