**viv·i·fy  
 scriv·en·er  
 A·mu·ga·ba**


**[Vivify](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Vivify)**  
 From Merriam-Webster Online:  
Function: transitive verb  
 Inflected Form(s): **-fied; -fy·ing**  
 1 : to endue with life or renewed life : animate (rains that vivify the barren hills)  
 2 : to impart vitality or vividness to (concentrating this union of quality and meaning in a way which vivifies both -- John Dewey)  
 Etymology: Middle French *vivifier*, from Late Latin *vivificare*, from Latin *vivificus* enlivening, from *vivus* alive  
 Date: 1545


**[Scrivener](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Scrivener)**  
 From Merriam-Webster Online:  
Function: noun  
 1 : a professional or public copyist or writer : scribe  
 2 : notary public  
 Etymology: Middle English *scriveiner*, alteration of *scrivein*, from Middle French *escrivein*, from (assumed) Vulgar Latin *scriban-*, *scriba*, alteration of Latin *scriba* scribe  
 Date: 14th century


**[Amugaba](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Amugaba)**  
 From Rei Nakazawa, **Magic** creative text writer:  
Function: noun  
 Etymology: Like many **Magic** card names, Amugaba has its roots in a foreign language - in this case from the Ugandan name *Mugaba*. The naming team thought *Mugaba* meant "one whose animal totem is an eel," and thus would have been very appropriate for the card. However, upon closer inspection of the research source, they realized that they had looked at the wrong entry! *Mugaba* really meant "given by God," and the name that corresponded with eel-totem was actually *Mubiru*. Regardless, they decided that "Amugaba" sounded better than "Amubiru," so the name was kept.
