 These two are the newcomers here today. This particular Top 8 is a home for established Pros who can reach new heights *Magic*offers. No. 5 Ivan Floch can try for back-to-back wins; No. 11 Yuuya Watanabe can reach for a win that has eluded him for so long, and Ari Lax can finally put that well-earned line on his resume. But it's also where players earn their first breakout success. Many competitors hit their stride and stay on top after that first Pro Tour Top 8. Ondrej Strasky of the Czech Republic and Thiago Saporito of Brazil are hoping to be two such players.



Before the tournament, I asked Floch, No. 6 Stanislav Cifka, Martin Jůza, and other Central Europeans about the next rising star. Each year, a new name seems to pop up and become a new household face. Names were thrown around and discussed, but it looks like we have a definitive answer here. Ondrej Strasky, though not the only Central European in the Top 8, is the young gun.



 Thiago Saporito on the other hand, has been getting more and more recognition lately, but under his *Magic Online* handle: bolov0. He crushed a Pro Tour Qualifier to get here; had a four-time Pro Tour Top 8 veteran, fellow Brazilian Willy Edel, help him out with the deck; then he crushed it here too.



One of these players will be catapulted to the next rung on the Top 8 ladder—getting ever-closer to that giant golden cup.




*Thiago Saporito squares off against Ondrej Strasky in the Quarterfinals, the two MTGO-regulars looking for their first big win on the main stage.*
