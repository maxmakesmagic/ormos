Build Notes
-----------


General | [Death Pit Offering](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Death+Pit+Offering) has been reigned in and no longer causes you to sacrifice all of your permanents.


Standard | If [Nullhide Ferox](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nullhide+Ferox) is granted riot and its activated ability is activated, its controller is rightly able to cast noncreature spells.


General | Creatures that are able to transform now have the summoning sickness animation when they are appropriately sick.


General | Vehicles such as [Smuggler's Copter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Smuggler%27s+Copter) are now affected by anthem effects such as [Trostani Discordant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Trostani+Discordant).


Legacy, Modern | [Laboratory Maniac](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Laboratory+Maniac) is no longer able to maniacally end the game with cards in your library and a card with dredge such as [Golgari Thug](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Golgari+Thug) in your graveyard.


General | [The Scarab God](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=The+Scarab+God) now correctly applies Rule 706.9d which means to say that an [Enigma Drake](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Enigma+Drake) will be a 4/4 creature no matter what cards are in your graveyard.
