Two weeks ago, we asked [who was the best guild](/en/articles/archive/whos-best-guild-2012-11-14). And that's from the standpoint of "people who have registered with their guild on [Planeswalker Points](http://www.wizards.com/magic/planeswalkerpoints/guild), not "which guild has the best aesthetics" or something fuzzy like that. We're measuring success here.


Here's how things stood at the time:


### November 14, 2012




 **Guild** | **Points** | **Members** | **Points per Member** |
| Izzet | 1,196,440 | 10,234 | 116.91 |
| Azorius | 1,062,519 | 8,564 | 124.07 |
| Dimir | 716,918 | 6,489 | 110.48 |
| Simic | 687,281 | 5,195 | 132.30 |
| Golgari | 573,337 | 6,687 | 85.74 |
| Selesnya | 426,569 | 5,637 | 75.67 |
| Boros | 409,609 | 4,324 | 94.73 |
| Orzhov | 379,854 | 3,573 | 106.31 |
| Rakdos | 367,086 | 4,511 | 81.38 |
| Gruul | 205,447 | 1,726 | 119.03 |

  
As we discussed at the time, Izzet has the most points, but that's probably because they have the most members. On a points-per-member basis, Izzet is behind Simic, Azorius, and even Gruul!


So let's check in again and see how everyone's doing. This race is far from over!


### November 30, 2012




 **Guild** | **Points** | **Members** | **Points per Member** |
| Izzet | 1,437,914 | 10,679 | 134.65 |
| Azorius | 1,303,014 | 9,075 | 143.58 |
| Dimir | 881,329 | 7,004 | 125.83 |
| Simic | 837,130 | 5,676 | 147.49 |
| Golgari | 688,564 | 6,951 | 99.06 |
| Selesnya | 524,071 | 5,930 | 88.38 |
| Boros | 501,699 | 4,682 | 107.15 |
| Orzhov | 475,963 | 3,904 | 121.92 |
| Rakdos | 454,879 | 4,775 | 95.26 |
| Gruul | 262,272 | 1,933 | 135.68 |

  
So what's changed? Well, each guild has some new members! Here's how that breaks down:




|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Guild** | **New Members** |
| Dimir | 515 |
| Azorius | 511 |
| Simic | 481 |
| Izzet | 445 |
| Boros | 358 |
| Orzhov | 331 |
| Selesnya | 293 |
| Golgari | 264 |
| Rakdos | 264 |
| Gruul | 207 |

  
Izzet is still on top, but it's not pulling in the most new members! So its victory is not at all assured. If you haven't joined a guild at [Planeswalker Points](http://www.wizards.com/magic/planeswalkerpoints/guild), you could be all that stands between your guild and victory!


But the actual metric is "total points." Let's see who's gotten points in the last two weeks!




|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Guild | New Points |
| Izzet | 241,474 |
| Azorius | 240,495 |
| Dimir | 164,411 |
| Simic | 149,849 |
| Golgari | 115,227 |
| Selesnya | 97,502 |
| Orzhov | 96,109 |
| Boros | 92,090 |
| Rakdos | 87,793 |
| Gruul | 56,825 |

  
Well... Izzet got the most. There's not a lot of drama there. But Azorius is right behind! Part of that is because Izzet didn't have any Grand Prix winners in the last two weeks, while Azorius had one:


**Grand Prix Bochum**: Martin Juza (Simic)   
**Grand Prix Taipei**: Makihito Mihara (Azorius) 


That's one win for Simic and one win for Azorius, which matches up well with their excellent points-per-member numbers. If you're thinking about winning a Grand Prix in the near future, make sure you've chosen your guild at [Planeswalker Points](http://www.wizards.com/magic/planeswalkerpoints/guild)!
