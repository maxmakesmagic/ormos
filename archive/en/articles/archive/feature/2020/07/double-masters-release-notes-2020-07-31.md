The Release Notes include information concerning the release of a new *Magic: The Gatherin**g* set, as well as a collection of clarifications and rulings involving that set's cards. It's intended to make playing with the new cards more fun by clearing up the common misconceptions and confusion inevitably caused by new mechanics and interactions. As future sets are released, updates to the *Magic* rules may cause some of this information to become outdated. Go to [Magic.Wizards.com/Rules](http://magic.wizards.com/rules) to find the most up-to-date rules.


The "General Notes" section includes release information and explains the mechanics and concepts in the set.


The "Card-Specific Notes" section contains answers to the most important, most common, and most confusing questions players might ask about cards in the set. Items in the "Card-Specific Notes" sections include full card text for your reference. Not all cards in the set are listed.

GENERAL NOTES
=============


Release Information
-------------------


The *Double Masters* set becomes legal for sanctioned Limited play on its official release date: Friday, August 7, 2020. These cards are legal for Constructed play in any format that already allows those cards. That is, appearing in these packs doesn't change a card's legality in any format. Notably, many of these cards are not legal in the Standard, Pioneer, or Modern formats.


Go to [Magic.Wizards.com/Formats](http://magic.wizards.com/formats) for a complete list of formats and their permitted card sets and banned lists.


Go to [Locator.Wizards.com](http://locator.wizards.com/) to find an event or store near you.




---

Returning Mechanics
-------------------


Over twenty keyword abilities, keyword actions, ability words, and unnamed mechanics return in the *Double Masters* set. The cards with these mechanics have individual notes in the "Card-Specific Notes" section as appropriate. The rules for these mechanics are unchanged in this release, with one notable exception discussed along with the affected card (Oubliette).


In this section you will find notes for some of the mechanics with the most appearances and greatest complexity.




---

Returning Mechanic: Living Weapon
---------------------------------


Some particularly pernicious Equipment from the plane of New Phyrexia are so eager to get into a fight that they come with a token to carry them as soon as they enter the battlefield.


![Flayer Husk](https://media.wizards.com/2020/2xm/en_opUlgOrkFs.png)


Flayer Husk  

{1}  

Artifact — Equipment  

Living weapon *(When this Equipment enters the battlefield, create a 0/0 black Germ creature token, then attach this to it.)*  

Equipped creature gets +1/+1.  

Equip {2}


* The Germ token enters the battlefield as a 0/0 creature and the Equipment becomes attached to it before state-based actions would cause the token to die. Abilities that trigger as the token enters the battlefield see that a 0/0 creature entered the battlefield.
* Like other Equipment, each Equipment with living weapon has an equip cost. You can pay this cost to attach an Equipment to another creature you control. Once the Germ token is no longer equipped, it will be put into your graveyard and subsequently cease to exist, unless another effect raises its toughness above 0.
* If the Germ token is destroyed, the Equipment remains on the battlefield as with any other Equipment.
* If the living weapon trigger causes two Germs to be created (due to an effect such as that of Doubling Season), the Equipment becomes attached to one of them. The other will be put into your graveyard and subsequently cease to exist, unless another effect raises its toughness above 0.



---

Returning Mechanic: Regenerate
------------------------------


Some creatures won't give up so easily. Regenerate is a keyword action that spares a creature from destruction.


![Twisted Abomination](https://media.wizards.com/2020/2xm/en_7MrtQqPtdS.png)


Twisted Abomination  

{5}{B}  

Creature — Zombie Mutant  

5/3  

{B}: Regenerate Twisted Abomination.  

Swampcycling {2} *({2}, Discard this card: Search your library for a Swamp card, reveal it, put it into your hand, then shuffle your library.)*


* When you regenerate a permanent, you're creating a replacement effect "shield" to be used later. That effect means "The next time [that permanent] would be destroyed this turn, instead remove all damage marked on it and tap it. If it's an attacking or blocking creature, remove it from combat."
* A permanent can regenerate even if it's already tapped.
* A permanent that regenerates doesn't leave or enter the battlefield. Abilities that trigger on a creature dying or entering the battlefield won't trigger if a creature regenerates.
* Permanents are destroyed by effects that use the word "destroy." Creatures are also destroyed by having lethal damage marked on them. Sacrificing a permanent doesn't destroy it, nor does reducing a creature's toughness to 0.
* If a permanent would be destroyed in two ways at once, one regeneration shield protects it from both. This will happen, for example, if a creature with deathtouch deals damage to a creature greater than or equal to that creature's toughness.



---

Set Theme: Copying Permanents
-----------------------------


But none of those mechanics are what we're really here for—we're here for the doubling! The *Double Masters* set features many ways to create tokens that are copies of permanents, to turn one permanent into a copy of another permanent, or to have something enter the battlefield as a copy of another permanent.


![Cogwork Assembler](https://media.wizards.com/2020/2xm/en_yateFsaV7f.png)


Cogwork Assembler  

{3}  

Artifact Creature — Assembly-Worker  

2/3  

{7}: Create a token that's a copy of target artifact. That token gains haste. Exile it at the beginning of the next end step.


![Thespian's Stage](https://media.wizards.com/2020/2xm/en_L24koAcRLG.png)


Thespian's Stage  

Land  

{T}: Add {C}.  

{2}, {T}: Thespian's Stage becomes a copy of target land, except it has this ability.


![Sculpting Steel](https://media.wizards.com/2020/2xm/en_V7axlmE7u4.png)


Sculpting Steel  

{3}  

Artifact  

You may have Sculpting Steel enter the battlefield as a copy of any artifact on the battlefield.


* The copy copies exactly what is printed on the object it's copying and nothing else (unless it's copying a permanent that's copying something else or that's a token; see below). It doesn't copy whether a permanent is tapped or untapped, whether it has any counters on it or Auras and/or Equipment attached to it, or any non-copy effects that changed its power, toughness, types, color, and so on. Most notably, if something copies a creature that's not normally a creature, the copy won't be a creature.
* If a copied permanent has {X} in its mana cost, X is 0.
* If a copied permanent is copying something else, the copy copies whatever that permanent is copying.
* If a copied permanent is a token, the copy copies the original characteristics of that token as stated by the effect that created it. If the copy is a nontoken permanent becoming a copy or entering the battlefield as a copy of that token, the copy isn't a token.
* Any enters-the-battlefield abilities of the copied object will trigger if the copy is entering the battlefield. Any "As [this permanent] enters the battlefield" or "[This permanent] enters the battlefield with" abilities of the copied object will also work. If a permanent becomes a copy of another object, these abilities won't apply as that permanent becomes a copy since it's not entering the battlefield.
* If an Aura is put onto the battlefield without being cast, such as by being created as a token copy or a permanent entering the battlefield as a copy of an Aura, the copy's controller-to-be chooses what it will enchant as it enters the battlefield. An Aura put onto the battlefield this way doesn't target anything (so it could be attached to an opponent's permanent with hexproof, for example), but the Aura's enchant ability restricts what it can be attached to. If an Aura token can't legally be attached to anything, it isn't created.
* If a permanent becomes a copy of an Aura, it's put into its owner's graveyard unless it happens to already be attached to something it could legally enchant.
* The effect that creates a copy or has an object enter as or become a copy may state that it's a copy "except" for some modifications to its characteristics, such as abilities or card types. If something copies the copy later, the new copy will also have those modifications.
* If the effect states that the copy "gains" or "has" an ability without stating that it's an exception, that gained ability won't be copied if something else copies the copy.
* If a permanent becomes a copy of a creature, the copy can't attack or pay {T} unless it's been under its controller's control since their most recent turn began.



---

Set Theme: Copying Spells
-------------------------


You're not seeing double—this set doesn't just give you lots of ways to copy permanents, it also encourages you to copy spells.


![Dualcaster Mage](https://media.wizards.com/2020/2xm/en_bO72gYQqwM.png)


Dualcaster Mage  

{1}{R}{R}  

Creature — Human Wizard  

2/2  

Flash  

When Dualcaster Mage enters the battlefield, copy target instant or sorcery spell. You may choose new targets for the copy.


* If an effect instructs you to copy a spell and says that you may choose new targets for the copy, that effect can copy any appropriate spell, not just one with targets.
* The copy is created on the stack, so it's not "cast." Abilities that trigger when a player casts a spell won't trigger. The copy will resolve before the original spell does.
* The copy will have the same targets as the spell it's copying unless the effect allows you to choose new ones. If so, you may change any number of the targets, including all of them or none of them. If, for one of the targets, you can't choose a new legal target, then it remains unchanged (even if the current target is illegal).
* If the spell that's copied is modal (that is, it says "Choose one —" or the like), the copy will have the same mode. A different mode can't be chosen.
* If the spell that's copied has an X whose value was determined as it was cast, the copy will have the same value of X.
* If the spell has damage divided as it was cast, the division can't be changed, although the targets receiving that damage still can. The same is true of spells that distribute counters.
* The controller of a copy can't choose to pay any alternative or additional costs for the copy. However, effects based on any alternative or additional costs that were paid for the original spell are copied as though those same costs were paid for the copy.

*DOUBLE MASTERS* CARD-SPECIFIC NOTES
====================================


![Accomplished Automaton](https://media.wizards.com/2020/2xm/en_Sgin0PEXSo.png)


Accomplished Automaton  

{7}  

Artifact Creature — Construct  

5/7  

Fabricate 1 *(When this creature enters the battlefield, put a +1/+1 counter on it or create a 1/1 colorless Servo artifact creature token.)*


* You choose whether to put a +1/+1 counter on Accomplished Automaton or create a Servo token as the fabricate ability is resolving. No player may take actions between the time you choose and the time that a counter is added or a token is created.
* Fabricate doesn't cause Accomplished Automaton to enter the battlefield with a +1/+1 counter already on it. Accomplished Automaton will enter the battlefield as a 5/7 creature, then its fabricate ability goes on the stack. Players may take actions (such as casting instants) while the ability is waiting to resolve.
* If you can't put a +1/+1 counter on Accomplished Automaton for any reason as fabricate resolves (for instance, if it's no longer on the battlefield), you just create a Servo token.



---

![Ad Nauseam](https://media.wizards.com/2020/2xm/en_HDrzrvczWL.png)


Ad Nauseam  

{3}{B}{B}  

Instant  

Reveal the top card of your library and put that card into your hand. You lose life equal to its converted mana cost. You may repeat this process any number of times.


* If a card in a player's library has {X} in its mana cost, X is considered to be 0.
* Each time you put the revealed card into your hand and lose the appropriate amount of life, you decide whether to continue by revealing another card. You don't decide in advance how many cards to put into your hand this way.
* You may continue to reveal cards with Ad Nauseam even if your life total has been reduced to 0 or less. If you continue, you will continue to lose life, dropping your life total into negative numbers. As soon as you stop, you'll lose the game as a state-based action.



---

![Adaptive Automaton](https://media.wizards.com/2020/2xm/en_gEoXhxmKoD.png)


Adaptive Automaton  

{3}  

Artifact Creature — Construct  

2/2  

As Adaptive Automaton enters the battlefield, choose a creature type.  

Adaptive Automaton is the chosen type in addition to its other types.  

Other creatures you control of the chosen type get +1/+1.


* The choice of creature type is made as Adaptive Automaton enters the battlefield. Players can't take any actions between the time the choice is made and the time the appropriate creatures begin to get +1/+1.
* You must choose an existing creature type, such as Human or Warrior. Card types such as artifact and supertypes such as legendary can't be chosen.
* Even though Adaptive Automaton is a Construct, other Construct creatures you control won't get +1/+1 unless you chose Construct as Adaptive Automaton entered the battlefield.



---

![Alabaster Mage](https://media.wizards.com/2020/2xm/en_tW8EfxRa4J.png)


Alabaster Mage  

{1}{W}  

Creature — Human Wizard  

2/1  

{1}{W}: Target creature you control gains lifelink until end of turn.


* Multiple instances of lifelink on the same creature are redundant.



---

![Ancestral Blade](https://media.wizards.com/2020/2xm/en_xHqWExUaeU.png)


Ancestral Blade  

{1}{W}  

Artifact — Equipment  

When Ancestral Blade enters the battlefield, create a 1/1 white Soldier creature token, then attach Ancestral Blade to it.  

Equipped creature gets +1/+1.  

Equip {1} *({1}: Attach to target creature you control. Equip only as a sorcery.)*


* The Soldier token that you create enters the battlefield as a 1/1 creature. Any abilities that trigger when a creature with a certain power enters the battlefield will see the token enter as a 1/1 creature.
* No player may take any actions between the time you create the Soldier token and the time Ancestral Blade becomes attached to it.
* If the triggered ability causes two Soldiers to be created (due to an effect such as that of Doubling Season), Ancestral Blade becomes attached to one of them.



---

![Ancient Stirrings](https://media.wizards.com/2020/2xm/en_JQUveIIbM5.png)


Ancient Stirrings  

{G}  

Sorcery  

Look at the top five cards of your library. You may reveal a colorless card from among them and put it into your hand. Then put the rest on the bottom of your library in any order.


* Objects with no mana cost, including lands that could produce colored mana, are colorless by default.



---

![Angel of the Dawn](https://media.wizards.com/2020/2xm/en_Q5mTGniybN.png)


Angel of the Dawn  

{4}{W}  

Creature — Angel  

3/3  

Flying  

When Angel of the Dawn enters the battlefield, creatures you control get +1/+1 and gain vigilance until end of turn.


* Angel of the Dawn's triggered ability affects only creatures you control at the time it resolves. Creatures you begin to control later in the turn won't get +1/+1 or gain vigilance.



---

![Archangel of Thune](https://media.wizards.com/2020/2xm/en_dGv2OREaAj.png)


Archangel of Thune  

{3}{W}{W}  

Creature — Angel  

3/4  

Flying, lifelink  

Whenever you gain life, put a +1/+1 counter on each creature you control.


* If a creature you control is dealt lethal damage at the same time that you gain life, it won't receive a counter from Archangel of Thune's ability in time to save it.
* Each creature with lifelink dealing combat damage causes a separate life-gaining event. For example, if two creatures you control with lifelink deal combat damage at the same time, the ability will trigger twice. However, if a single creature you control with lifelink deals combat damage to multiple creatures, players, and/or planeswalkers at the same time (perhaps because it has trample or was blocked by more than one creature), the ability will trigger only once.
* If you gain an amount of life "for each" of something, that life is gained as one event and the ability triggers only once.
* In a Two-Headed Giant game, life gained by your teammate won't cause the ability to trigger, even though it caused your team's life total to increase.



---

![Arcum Dagsson](https://media.wizards.com/2020/2xm/en_FdbIFJSRec.png)


Arcum Dagsson  

{3}{U}  

Legendary Creature — Human Artificer  

2/2  

{T}: Target artifact creature's controller sacrifices it. That player may search their library for a noncreature artifact card, put it onto the battlefield, then shuffle their library.


* Arcum Dagsson's ability targets an artifact creature, not the player who controls it.
* If the target artifact creature is an illegal target by the time Arcum's ability tries to resolve, the ability won't resolve. No player searches their library. If the target is legal but not sacrificed (most likely because of an effect such as that of Sigarda, Host of Herons), its controller does search their library for a noncreature artifact card.
* Any triggered abilities that trigger when the creature is sacrificed will be put onto the stack at the same time as any triggered abilities that trigger when the noncreature artifact enters the battlefield.



---

![Arixmethes, Slumbering Isle](https://media.wizards.com/2020/2xm/en_5ZTKtmTkPF.png)


Arixmethes, Slumbering Isle  

{2}{G}{U}  

Legendary Creature — Kraken  

12/12  

Arixmethes, Slumbering Isle enters the battlefield tapped with five slumber counters on it.  

As long as Arixmethes has a slumber counter on it, it's a land. *(It's not a creature.)*  

Whenever you cast a spell, you may remove a slumber counter from Arixmethes.  

{T}: Add {G}{U}.


* Arixmethes can't be played as a land.
* Arixmethes isn't a land until after it has entered the battlefield. Effects such as that of Blood Moon won't affect its enters-the-battlefield ability. Similarly, replacement effects that modify how creatures you control enter the battlefield will see Arixmethes entering as a creature rather than a land. However, triggered abilities (such as landfall abilities) will see that a land has entered the battlefield and not a creature.
* Arixmethes can tap for mana the turn it enters the battlefield as long as it has slumber counters on it. If you can figure out how to untap it, that is.
* While Arixmethes is a land, it's still green and blue, it's still legendary, and its converted mana cost is still 4.
* Arixmethes's effect causing it to be a land overwrites any earlier effects that gave it additional types. For example, a Phyrexian Metamorph that copies Arixmethes will be a land, not an artifact land, until its slumber counters are removed.
* Arixmethes's triggered ability resolves before the spell that caused it to trigger, but after targets have been chosen for that spell. It resolves even if that spell is countered.
* Once Arixmethes is a creature again, it can attack on the same turn as long as you've controlled it since your most recent turn began.



---

![Atraxa, Praetors' Voice](https://media.wizards.com/2020/2xm/en_qkDjMcFrlR.png)


Atraxa, Praetors' Voice  

{G}{W}{U}{B}  

Legendary Creature — Angel Horror  

4/4  

Flying, vigilance, deathtouch, lifelink  

At the beginning of your end step, proliferate. *(Choose any number of permanents and/or players, then give each another counter of each kind already there.)*


* You can choose any permanent that has a counter, including ones controlled by opponents. You can't choose cards in any zone other than the battlefield, even if they have counters on them.
* You don't have to choose every permanent or player that has a counter, only the ones you want to add another counter to. Since "any number" includes zero, you don't have to choose any permanents at all, and you don't have to choose any players at all.
* Players can respond to the spell or ability whose effect includes proliferating. Once that spell or ability starts to resolve, however, and its controller chooses which permanents and players will get new counters, it's too late for anyone to respond.
* Putting loyalty counters on planeswalkers doesn't cause their loyalty abilities to be activated.



---

![Auriok Salvagers](https://media.wizards.com/2020/2xm/en_Xvd5uSP5uu.png)


Auriok Salvagers  

{3}{W}  

Creature — Human Soldier  

2/4  

{1}{W}: Return target artifact card with converted mana cost 1 or less from your graveyard to your hand.


* If a card in a player's graveyard has {X} in its mana cost, X is considered to be 0.



---

![Austere Command](https://media.wizards.com/2020/2xm/en_RTGaWtcCuM.png)


Austere Command  

{4}{W}{W}  

Sorcery  

Choose two —  

• Destroy all artifacts.  

• Destroy all enchantments.  

• Destroy all creatures with converted mana cost 3 or less.  

• Destroy all creatures with converted mana cost 4 or greater.


* Each of the chosen modes happens sequentially. If a permanent has an ability that triggers whenever it or another permanent is destroyed, it will see permanents destroyed at the same time as it or before it, but not permanents destroyed by later modes.
* If the first and last modes are chosen, an artifact creature with converted mana cost 4 or greater will have to be regenerated twice to survive. This is because the modes happen sequentially, and the regeneration "shield" is used up by the first one. The same is true with any other combination of modes that covers one permanent twice.
* If a card is exiled "until" another permanent leaves the battlefield, the exiled card returns to the battlefield immediately after that permanent leaves the battlefield during Austere Command's resolution, and it may be destroyed by a later mode.



---

![Avacyn, Angel of Hope](https://media.wizards.com/2020/2xm/en_gf9ZpFzz3M.png)


Avacyn, Angel of Hope  

{5}{W}{W}{W}  

Legendary Creature — Angel  

8/8  

Flying, vigilance, indestructible  

Other permanents you control have indestructible.


* Because damage remains marked on a creature until the damage is removed as the turn ends, nonlethal damage dealt to a creature you control may become lethal if Avacyn leaves the battlefield during that turn.
* A planeswalker with indestructible still loses loyalty as it's dealt damage. It is put into its owner's graveyard if its loyalty becomes 0.



---

![Balduvian Rage](https://media.wizards.com/2020/2xm/en_0YMWupTEqY.png)


Balduvian Rage  

{X}{R}  

Instant  

Target attacking creature gets +X/+0 until end of turn.  

Draw a card at the beginning of the next turn's upkeep.


* If the target creature is an illegal target by the time Balduvian Rage tries to resolve, the spell won't resolve. You won't draw a card next turn.



---

![Basalt Monolith](https://media.wizards.com/2020/2xm/en_I3VAvO9TiX.png)


Basalt Monolith  

{3}  

Artifact  

Basalt Monolith doesn't untap during your untap step.  

{T}: Add {C}{C}{C}.  

{3}: Untap Basalt Monolith.


* Basalt Monolith's last ability can untap it as often as you can pay for it. If you believe you've found a way to generate an unbounded amount of mana with it, you're probably right.



---

![Batterskull](https://media.wizards.com/2020/2xm/en_wftgKGDImh.png)


Batterskull  

{5}  

Artifact — Equipment  

Living weapon *(When this Equipment enters the battlefield, create a 0/0 black Germ creature token, then attach this to it.)*  

Equipped creature gets +4/+4 and has vigilance and lifelink.  

{3}: Return Batterskull to its owner's hand.  

Equip {5}


* The ability to return Batterskull to its owner's hand can be activated only if Batterskull is on the battlefield. If Batterskull is no longer on the battlefield when the ability resolves, Batterskull remains in its new zone and isn't returned to its owner's hand.



---

![Beacon of Unrest](https://media.wizards.com/2020/2xm/en_KlLTcCNKMg.png)


Beacon of Unrest  

{3}{B}{B}  

Sorcery  

Put target artifact or creature card from a graveyard onto the battlefield under your control. Shuffle Beacon of Unrest into its owner's library.


* If the target card is an illegal target by the time Beacon of Unrest tries to resolve, the spell won't resolve. You won't shuffle it into your library.
* In a multiplayer game, if a player leaves the game, all cards that player owns leave as well. If you leave the game, the permanent you control from Beacon of Unrest is exiled.



---

![Blasphemous Act](https://media.wizards.com/2020/2xm/en_zosEeZ00iX.png)


Blasphemous Act  

{8}{R}  

Sorcery  

This spell costs {1} less to cast for each creature on the battlefield.  

Blasphemous Act deals 13 damage to each creature.


* To determine the total cost of a spell, start with the mana cost or alternative cost you're paying, add any cost increases, then apply any cost reductions (such as that of Blasphemous Act). The converted mana cost of the spell remains unchanged, no matter what the total cost to cast it was.
* Blasphemous Act's ability can't reduce the total cost to cast the spell below {R}.
* The total cost to cast Blasphemous Act is locked in before you pay that cost. For example, if there are three creatures on the battlefield, including one you can sacrifice to add {C} to your mana pool, the total cost of Blasphemous Act is {5}{R}. Then you can sacrifice the creature when you activate mana abilities just before paying the cost.
* Although players may respond to Blasphemous Act once it's been cast, once it's announced, they can't respond before the cost is calculated and paid.



---

![Blightsteel Colossus](https://media.wizards.com/2020/2xm/en_pBRqP9PVjd.png)


Blightsteel Colossus  

{12}  

Artifact Creature — Golem  

11/11  

Trample, infect, indestructible  

If Blightsteel Colossus would be put into a graveyard from anywhere, reveal Blightsteel Colossus and shuffle it into its owner's library instead.


* Damage that a creature with infect deals doesn't result in damage being marked on a creature or a player losing life. Instead, it results in that many -1/-1 counters being put on that creature or that many poison counters being given to that player. Damage dealt to planeswalkers still results in that planeswalker losing that many loyalty counters.
* A player who has ten or more poison counters loses the game. This is a state-based action.
* The -1/-1 counters remain on the creature indefinitely. They're not removed if the creature regenerates or the turn ends.
* Damage from a source with infect is damage in all respects. If the source with infect also has lifelink, damage dealt by that source also causes its controller to gain that much life. Damage from a source with infect can be prevented or redirected. Abilities that trigger on damage being dealt will trigger if a source with infect deals damage, if appropriate.

![Blinkmoth Nexus](https://media.wizards.com/2020/2xm/en_gowCmRwkWO.png)


Blinkmoth Nexus  

Land  

{T}: Add {C}.  

{1}: Blinkmoth Nexus becomes a 1/1 Blinkmoth artifact creature with flying until end of turn. It's still a land.  

{1}, {T}: Target Blinkmoth creature gets +1/+1 until end of turn.


* A noncreature permanent that turns into a creature can attack, and its {T} abilities can be activated, only if its controller has continuously controlled that permanent since the beginning of their most recent turn. It doesn't matter how long the permanent has been a creature.
* Blinkmoth Nexus can be the target of its last ability after activating its middle ability. Activating it after it has blocked a creature won't remove it from combat or stop it from dealing and being dealt combat damage.

![Blood Moon](https://media.wizards.com/2020/2xm/en_cqCfQJihF5.png)


Blood Moon  

{2}{R}  

Enchantment  

Nonbasic lands are Mountains.


* If a nonbasic land has an ability that triggers "when" it enters the battlefield, it will lose that ability before it can trigger.
* If a nonbasic land has an ability that causes it to enter the battlefield tapped, it will lose that ability before it can apply. The same is also true of any other abilities that modify how a land enters the battlefield or apply "as" a land enters the battlefield, such as the first ability of Cavern of Souls.
* Nonbasic lands will lose any other land types and abilities they had. They will gain the land type Mountain and gain the ability "{T}: Add {R}."
* This effect doesn't affect names or supertypes. It won't turn any land into a basic land or remove the legendary supertype from a legendary land, and the lands won't be named "Mountain."

Bloodbriar  

{2}{G}  

Creature — Plant Elemental  

2/3  

Whenever you sacrifice another permanent, put a +1/+1 counter on Bloodbriar.


* Bloodbriar's ability is a triggered ability, not an activated ability. It doesn't allow you to sacrifice a permanent whenever you want; rather, you need some other way of sacrificing permanents.
* If you sacrifice a permanent as part of casting a spell or activating an ability, Bloodbriar's ability will resolve before that spell or ability.
* A legendary permanent that is put into a graveyard because of the "legend rule" isn't sacrificed.

Bloodshot Trainee  

{3}{R}  

Creature — Goblin Warrior  

2/3  

{T}: Bloodshot Trainee deals 4 damage to target creature. Activate this ability only if Bloodshot Trainee's power is 4 or greater.


* Once Bloodshot Trainee's ability has been activated, it will deal damage even if Bloodshot Trainee's power is less than 4 by the time the ability resolves.

Creature — Lizard  

2/2  

Devour 1 *(As this enters the battlefield, you may sacrifice any number of creatures. This creature enters the battlefield with that many +1/+1 counters on it.)*  

Each other creature you control enters the battlefield with an additional X +1/+1 counters on it, where X is the number of +1/+1 counters on Bloodspore Thrinax.


* If Bloodspore Thrinax enters the battlefield at the same time as other creatures you control, those creatures won't get additional +1/+1 counters from Bloodspore Thrinax's last ability. Those creatures also can't be devoured by Bloodspore Thrinax.

{3}{B}  

Creature — Bird  

3/2  

This spell costs {3} less to cast if a creature died this turn.  

Flying, deathtouch


* In a multiplayer game, a player may lose the game at the same time that their creatures die. If so, Bone Picker's cost reduction applies.



---

![Boon Reflection](https://media.wizards.com/2020/2xm/en_1xGhpKIjMy.png)


Boon Reflection  

{4}{W}  

Enchantment  

If you would gain life, you gain twice that much life instead.


* The effects of multiple Boon Reflections are cumulative. For example, if you control two Boon Reflections, you'll gain four times the original amount of life. If you control three Boon Reflections, you'll gain eight times the original amount, and so on.
* If an effect would set your life total to a specific number that's higher than your current life total, that effect would cause you to gain life equal to the difference. Boon Reflection will then double the amount of life that effect would cause you to gain. For example, if you have 3 life and an effect says that your life total "becomes 10," your life total will actually become 17.
* In a Two-Headed Giant game, only Boon Reflection's controller is affected by it. If that player's teammate gains life, Boon Reflection will have no effect, even when that life gain is applied to the shared team life total.

Trample  

{3}{R}, Sacrifice an artifact: Bosh, Iron Golem deals damage equal to the sacrificed artifact's converted mana cost to any target.

{2}{U}{U}  

Legendary Creature — Human Wizard  

2/2  

At the beginning of each player's upkeep, that player may put an artifact, creature, or land card from their hand onto the battlefield.


* Braids's effect doesn't count as playing a land if you put one onto the battlefield with it. You can still play a land for the turn during your main phase.
* If the permanent you put onto the battlefield has an ability that triggers at the beginning of your upkeep, it won't trigger during that upkeep.

Brudiclad, Telchor Engineer  

{4}{U}{R}  

Legendary Artifact Creature — Artificer  

4/4  

Creature tokens you control have haste.  

At the beginning of combat on your turn, create a 2/1 blue Myr artifact creature token. Then you may choose a token you control. If you do, each other token you control becomes a copy of that token.


* The last effect of Brudiclad's triggered ability affects all tokens you control other than the chosen token, including the token that was just created if that isn't the chosen token.
* All other tokens you control become a copy of the chosen token, even those that aren't of the same type. For example, if you control a Treasure artifact token and choose the Myr token Brudiclad just created, your Treasure will become a copy of the Myr.
* The effect of Brudiclad's triggered ability lasts indefinitely. It continues to apply even if Brudiclad leaves the battlefield.

Cathartic Reunion  

{1}{R}  

Sorcery  

As an additional cost to cast this spell, discard two cards.  

Draw three cards.


* Because discarding two cards is an additional cost, you can't cast Cathartic Reunion if you don't have at least two other cards in hand.



---

![Champion of Lambholt](https://media.wizards.com/2020/2xm/en_lPfsCyMEcY.png)


Champion of Lambholt  

{1}{G}{G}  

Creature — Human Warrior  

1/1  

Creatures with power less than Champion of Lambholt's power can't block creatures you control.  

Whenever another creature enters the battlefield under your control, put a +1/+1 counter on Champion of Lambholt.


* Champion of Lambholt's first ability applies even if it isn't attacking.
* The comparison of power is done only when blockers are declared. Decreasing the power of a blocking creature (or increasing the power of Champion of Lambholt) after this point won't cause any creature to stop blocking or become unblocked.



---

![Chatter of the Squirrel](https://media.wizards.com/2020/2xm/en_iAUCOVDl2z.png)


Chatter of the Squirrel  

{G}  

Sorcery  

Create a 1/1 green Squirrel creature token.  

Flashback {1}{G} *(You may cast this card from your graveyard for its flashback cost. Then exile it.)*


* You must still follow any timing restrictions and permissions, including those based on the card's type. For instance, you can cast a sorcery using flashback only when you could normally cast a sorcery.
* To determine the total cost of a spell, start with the mana cost or alternative cost (such as a flashback cost) you're paying, add any cost increases, then apply any cost reductions. The converted mana cost of the spell remains unchanged, no matter what the total cost to cast it was.
* A spell cast using flashback will always be exiled afterward, whether it resolves, is countered, or leaves the stack in some other way.

![Chief of the Foundry](https://media.wizards.com/2020/2xm/en_ipLbOu2Mp4.png)


Chief of the Foundry  

{3}  

Artifact Creature — Construct  

2/3  

Other artifact creatures you control get +1/+1.


* Because damage remains marked on a creature until the damage is removed as the turn ends, nonlethal damage dealt to an artifact creature you control may become lethal if Chief of the Foundry leaves the battlefield during that turn.

![Chord of Calling](https://media.wizards.com/2020/2xm/en_7524SHLqr2.png)


Chord of Calling  

{X}{G}{G}{G}  

Instant  

Convoke *(Your creatures can help cast this spell. Each creature you tap while casting this spell pays for {1} or one mana of that creature's color.)*  

Search your library for a creature card with converted mana cost X or less and put it onto the battlefield. Then shuffle your library.


* If a card in a player's library has {X} in its mana cost, X is considered to be 0.
* You can tap an untapped creature you haven't controlled continuously since the beginning of your most recent turn to convoke a spell.
* When calculating a spell's total cost, include any alternative costs, additional costs, or anything else that increases or reduces the cost to cast the spell. Convoke applies after the total cost is calculated. Convoke doesn't change a spell's mana cost or converted mana cost.
* Tapping a multicolored creature using convoke will pay for {1} or one mana of your choice of any of that creature's colors.
* When using convoke to cast a spell with {X} in its mana cost, first choose the value for X. Then you can tap creatures you control to help pay the total cost. For example, if you cast Chord of Calling and choose X to be 3, the total cost is {3}{G}{G}{G}. If you tap two green creatures and two white creatures, you'll have to pay {1}{G}.
* If a creature you control has a mana ability with {T} in the cost, activating that ability while casting a spell with convoke will result in the creature being tapped before you pay the spell's costs. You won't be able to tap it again for convoke. Similarly, if you sacrifice a creature to activate a mana ability while casting a spell with convoke, that creature won't be on the battlefield when you pay the spell's costs, so you won't be able to tap it for convoke.

Chrome Mox  

{0}  

Artifact  
*Imprint* — When Chrome Mox enters the battlefield, you may exile a nonartifact, nonland card from your hand.  

{T}: Add one mana of any of the exiled card's colors.


* If no card is imprinted on Chrome Mox, it can't add mana to your mana pool. It can never add {C} to your mana pool, even if the imprinted card has a colorless mana symbol in its mana cost.
* If you imprinted a multicolored card, you choose one of that card's colors each time you tap Chrome Mox for mana.

Clear Shot  

{2}{G}  

Instant  

Target creature you control gets +1/+1 until end of turn. It deals damage equal to its power to target creature you don't control.


* You can't cast Clear Shot unless you choose a creature you control and a creature you don't control as targets.
* As Clear Shot tries to resolve, if either creature is an illegal target, the creature you control won't deal damage. If the creature you control is a legal target but the other creature isn't, your creature will still get +1/+1.

![Clone Shell](https://media.wizards.com/2020/2xm/en_OypfuepSj8.png)


Clone Shell  

{5}  

Artifact Creature — Shapeshifter  

2/2  
*Imprint* — When Clone Shell enters the battlefield, look at the top four cards of your library, exile one face down, then put the rest on the bottom of your library in any order.  

When Clone Shell dies, turn the exiled card face up. If it's a creature card, put it onto the battlefield under your control.


* As Clone Shell's first ability resolves, you must exile one of the cards you look at, even if none of them is a creature card.
* As Clone Shell's second ability resolves, if the exiled card is not a creature card, it simply remains in exile face up.
* If you gain control of another player's Clone Shell, you can't look at the face-down exiled card. However, if Clone Shell dies, you turn that card face up and, if it's a creature card, you put it onto the battlefield under your control.

![Conjurer's Closet](https://media.wizards.com/2020/2xm/en_NA1FuC1nYW.png)


Conjurer's Closet  

{5}  

Artifact  

At the beginning of your end step, you may exile target creature you control, then return that card to the battlefield under your control.


* Once the exiled creature returns, it's considered a new object with no relation to the object that it was. Auras attached to the exiled creature will be put into their owners' graveyards. Equipment attached to the exiled creature will become unattached and remain on the battlefield. Any counters on the exiled creature will cease to exist.
* If a token is exiled this way, it will cease to exist and won't return to the battlefield.
* If you gain control of a creature "until end of turn," you control it during that turn's end step.
* When an effect returns the exiled card "under your control," you control it indefinitely after that. In a multiplayer game, if a player leaves the game, all cards that player owns leave as well. If you leave the game, any creatures you control from Conjurer's Closet effect are exiled.

![Council's Judgment](https://media.wizards.com/2020/2xm/en_6RgZYS02jU.png)


Council's Judgment  

{1}{W}{W}  

Sorcery  
*Will of the council* — Starting with you, each player votes for a nonland permanent you don't control. Exile each permanent with the most votes or tied for most votes.


* Because the votes are cast in turn order, each player will know the votes of players who voted beforehand.
* Each player must vote for one of the candidate permanents. They can't abstain.
* No player votes until the spell or ability resolves. Any responses to that spell or ability must be made without knowing the outcome of the vote.
* None of the candidate permanents are targeted. Players may vote for a permanent with protection from white, for example.
* Players can't do anything after they finishing voting but before the "winning" permanent or permanents are exiled.
* In the unusual case that no permanents have any votes, nothing is exiled.

![Cragganwick Cremator](https://media.wizards.com/2020/2xm/en_qW1rQRJHNB.png)


Cragganwick Cremator  

{2}{R}{R}  

Creature — Giant Shaman  

5/4  

When Cragganwick Cremator enters the battlefield, discard a card at random. If you discard a creature card this way, Cragganwick Cremator deals damage equal to that card's power to target player or planeswalker.


* You choose the target player or planeswalker when the ability is put onto the stack. You won't know how much damage will be dealt until the ability resolves.
* If the target player or planeswalker is an illegal target by the time the ability tries to resolve, the ability won't resolve. You won't discard a card.
* If you have no cards in hand when Cragganwick Cremator's ability resolves, you don't discard anything.
* Cragganwick Cremator deals damage equal to the discarded creature card's power as it exists in your graveyard.

Cranial Plating  

{2}  

Artifact — Equipment  

Equipped creature gets +1/+0 for each artifact you control.  

{B}{B}: Attach Cranial Plating to target creature you control.  

Equip {1}


* Cranial Plating is counted by its own ability, so it gives at least +1/+0.
* Cranial Plating's first activated ability is similar to an equip ability, but it's not an equip ability. Most importantly, it can be activated any time you could cast an instant, even during another player's turn.



---

![Crib Swap](https://media.wizards.com/2020/2xm/en_jX4BjyOzGq.png)


Crib Swap  

{2}{W}  

Tribal Instant — Shapeshifter  

Changeling *(This card is every creature type.)*  

Exile target creature. Its controller creates a 1/1 colorless Shapeshifter creature token with changeling.


* Tribal is a card type (like creature or instant), not a supertype (like legendary).
* Changeling applies in all zones, not just the battlefield.
* If the target creature is an illegal target by the time Crib Swap tries to resolve, the spell won't resolve. No player will create a Shapeshifter token.

Crop Rotation  

{G}

Crusader of Odric  

{2}{W}  

Creature — Human Soldier  

\*/\*  

Crusader of Odric's power and toughness are each equal to the number of creatures you control.


* The ability that defines Crusader of Odric's power and toughness works in all zones, not just the battlefield.
* As long as Crusader of Odric is on the battlefield, its ability will count itself.
* Because damage remains marked on a creature until the damage is removed as the turn ends, nonlethal damage dealt to Crusader of Odric may become lethal if other creatures you control leave the battlefield during that turn.



---

![Cyclonic Rift](https://media.wizards.com/2020/2xm/en_llr7xWY5O1.png)


Cyclonic Rift  

{1}{U}  

Instant  

Return target nonland permanent you don't control to its owner's hand.  

Overload {6}{U} *(You may cast this spell for its overload cost. If you do, change its text by replacing all instances of "target" with "each.")*


* If you don't pay the overload cost of Cyclonic Rift, that spell will have a single target. If you pay the overload cost, the spell won't have any targets.
* Because a spell with overload doesn't target when its overload cost is paid, it may affect permanents with hexproof or with protection from the appropriate color.
* To determine the total cost of a spell, start with the mana cost or alternative cost you're paying (such as an overload cost), add any cost increases, then apply any cost reductions. The converted mana cost of the spell remains unchanged, no matter what the total cost to cast it was.
* If you are instructed to cast a spell with overload "without paying its mana cost," you can't choose to pay its overload cost instead.

2/1

![Dark Depths](https://media.wizards.com/2020/2xm/en_0IbIJYhHHf.png)


Dark Depths  

Legendary Snow Land  

Dark Depths enters the battlefield with ten ice counters on it.  

{3}: Remove an ice counter from Dark Depths.  

When Dark Depths has no ice counters on it, sacrifice it. If you do, create Marit Lage, a legendary 20/20 black Avatar creature token with flying and indestructible.


* Dark Depths really is a land with no mana ability. It doesn't tap for colorless mana.
* The last ability of Dark Depths is a state trigger. It won't trigger again while the ability is on the stack, but if the ability is countered and Dark Depths is still on the battlefield with no ice counters on it, it will trigger again immediately.
* If Dark Depths leaves the battlefield before its triggered ability resolves, you won't be able to sacrifice it, so you won't create Marit Lage.

![Darksteel Forge](https://media.wizards.com/2020/2xm/en_9enObYQnMu.png)


Darksteel Forge  

{9}  

Artifact  

Artifacts you control have indestructible.

Death's Shadow  

{B}  

Creature — Avatar  

13/13  

Death's Shadow gets -X/-X, where X is your life total.


* Death's Shadow's ability applies only while Death's Shadow is on the battlefield. In all other zones, its power and toughness are 13.
* The value of X changes as you gain and lose life. It's not locked in as Death's Shadow enters the battlefield.
* If your life total is negative, X is considered to be 0.
* In a Two-Headed Giant game, your life total is your team's life total.

![Deathreap Ritual](https://media.wizards.com/2020/2xm/en_A4y02puIMM.png)


Deathreap Ritual  

{2}{B}{G}  

Enchantment  
*Morbid* — At the beginning of each end step, if a creature died this turn, you may draw a card.


* If a creature didn't die before a turn's end step begins, Deathreap Ritual's ability doesn't trigger at all. The creature may have died before Deathreap Ritual entered the battlefield, however.
* You draw one card when the ability resolves, not one card per creature that died during the turn.

Deepglow Skate  

{4}{U}  

Creature — Fish  

3/3  

When Deepglow Skate enters the battlefield, double the number of each kind of counter on any number of target permanents.


* You can choose no targets if you don't want to double the counters on any permanents.
* To double the number of each kind of counter on a permanent, put another counter on it for each counter it already has. Effects that interact with counters being put onto permanents apply as appropriate.
* As Deepglow Skate's ability resolves, you must double each kind of counter on the permanents it targets.

![Defiant Salvager](https://media.wizards.com/2020/2xm/en_okSw66Hhrf.png)


Defiant Salvager  

{2}{B}  

Creature — Aetherborn Artificer  

2/2  

Sacrifice an artifact or creature: Put a +1/+1 counter on Defiant Salvager. Activate this ability only any time you could cast a sorcery.


* You can sacrifice Defiant Salvager to pay the cost of its own ability. It won't receive a counter, but it will enable abilities that check when or if a creature dies.
* If you sacrifice an artifact creature to activate Defiant Salvager's ability, you put one +1/+1 counter on Defiant Salvager, not two.



---

![Disciple of Bolas](https://media.wizards.com/2020/2xm/en_JLBqQst0bJ.png)


Disciple of Bolas  

{3}{B}  

Creature — Human Wizard  

2/1  

When Disciple of Bolas enters the battlefield, sacrifice another creature. You gain X life and draw X cards, where X is that creature's power.


* If you control at least one other creature when the ability resolves, you must sacrifice one. If you don't control any other creatures at that time, the ability won't do anything.
* The creature's power as it last existed on the battlefield is the amount of life you gain and the number of cards you draw.

Disciple of the Vault  

{B}  

Creature — Human Cleric

![Dismantle](https://media.wizards.com/2020/2xm/en_XhZ5sABuEr.png)


Dismantle  

{2}{R}  

Sorcery  

Destroy target artifact. If that artifact had counters on it, put that many +1/+1 counters or charge counters on an artifact you control.


* Dismantle targets only the artifact that will be destroyed. When Dismantle resolves, you choose which type of counters you want and choose an artifact you control to put them on. No player make take actions between the time you make this choice and the time counters are on the artifact.
* If the target artifact is an illegal target by the time Dismantle tries to resolve, the spell won't resolve. You won't put any counters on an artifact. If the target is legal but not destroyed (most likely because it has indestructible), you do put counters on an artifact.
* It doesn't matter what kind of counters the destroyed artifact had on it, only how many. If an artifact had five fuse counters and two trap counters on it, you put seven +1/+1 counters or seven charge counters on an artifact.
* You can put +1/+1 counters on a noncreature artifact. They won't do anything unless the artifact becomes a creature, at which time they'll add to the creature's power and toughness.



---

Doomed Necromancer  

{2}{B}  

Creature — Human Cleric Mercenary  

2/2  

{B}, {T}, Sacrifice Doomed Necromancer: Return target creature card from your graveyard to the battlefield.

![Doubling Season](https://media.wizards.com/2020/2xm/en_fBNZkTLAuE.png)


Doubling Season  

{4}{G}  

Enchantment  

If an effect would create one or more tokens under your control, it creates twice that many of those tokens instead.  

If an effect would put one or more counters on a permanent you control, it puts twice that many of those counters on that permanent instead.


* Doubling Season affects permanents that enter the battlefield with a certain number of counters.
* Planeswalkers will enter the battlefield with double the normal number of loyalty counters. However, if you activate an ability whose cost has you put loyalty counters on a planeswalker, the number you put on isn't doubled. This is because those counters are put on as a cost, not as an effect.
* If there are two Doubling Seasons on the battlefield, then the number of tokens or counters is four times the original number. If there are three on the battlefield, then the number of tokens or counters is eight times the original number, and so on.

![Dread Return](https://media.wizards.com/2020/2xm/en_whn4S0skmz.png)


Dread Return  

{2}{B}{B}  

Sorcery  

Return target creature card from your graveyard to the battlefield.  

Flashback—Sacrifice three creatures. *(You may cast this card from your graveyard for its flashback cost. Then exile it.)*


* You must still follow any timing restrictions and permissions, including those based on the card's type. For instance, you can cast a sorcery using flashback only when you could normally cast a sorcery.
* To determine the total cost of a spell, start with the mana cost or alternative cost (such as a flashback cost) you're paying, add any cost increases, then apply any cost reductions. The converted mana cost of the spell remains unchanged, no matter what the total cost to cast it was.
* A spell cast using flashback will always be exiled afterward, whether it resolves, is countered, or leaves the stack in some other way.

![Driver of the Dead](https://media.wizards.com/2020/2xm/en_NIQB6Y6jdO.png)


Driver of the Dead  

{3}{B}  

Creature — Vampire  

3/2  

When Driver of the Dead dies, return target creature card with converted mana cost 2 or less from your graveyard to the battlefield.


* If a card in a player's graveyard has {X} in its mana cost, X is considered to be 0.
* If Driver of the Dead dies at the same time as a creature with converted mana cost 2 or less, you can target that card and return it to the battlefield.
* If a creature card with converted mana cost 2 or less becomes a copy of Driver of the Dead and dies, it can be the target of its own ability.

![Drown in Sorrow](https://media.wizards.com/2020/2xm/en_pG1P7zi8c6.png)


Drown in Sorrow  

{1}{B}{B}  

Sorcery  

All creatures get -2/-2 until end of turn. Scry 1. *(Look at the top card of your library. You may put that card on the bottom of your library.)*


* Drown in Sorrow affects only creatures on the battlefield at the time it resolves. Creatures that enter the battlefield or become creatures later in the turn won't get -2/-2.



---

![Duplicant](https://media.wizards.com/2020/2xm/en_6mBlmBxDM2.png)


Duplicant  

{6}  

Artifact Creature — Shapeshifter  

2/4  
*Imprint* — When Duplicant enters the battlefield, you may exile target nontoken creature.  

As long as a card exiled with Duplicant is a creature card, Duplicant has the power, toughness, and creature types of the last creature card exiled with Duplicant. It's still a Shapeshifter.


* Duplicant's base power and toughness change to the imprinted card's power and toughness. Counters and other effects that modify Duplicant's power and toughness still apply.
* Abilities that define a \* in a creature's power and toughness apply while that card is in exile, but abilities that add or subtract power and toughness don't. For example, the ability of Crusader of Odric applies to determine Duplicant's power and toughness, but the ability of Death's Shadow doesn't.
* Duplicant's power and toughness are constantly updated if the exiled card's power and/or toughness change.
* If a melded permanent or a merged permanent is exiled by Duplicant's triggered ability, that ability's controller chooses the relative timestamp of the exiled cards. Duplicant looks at the information of the one with the latest timestamp.



---

![Eager Construct](https://media.wizards.com/2020/2xm/en_0vEbmZrUbo.png)


Eager Construct  

{2}  

Artifact Creature — Construct  

2/2  

When Eager Construct enters the battlefield, each player may scry 1. *(To scry 1, look at the top card of your library, then you may put that card on the bottom of your library.)*


* If multiple players are instructed to scry at once, such as while resolving Eager Construct's triggered ability, those players each look at the top card of their library at the same time, then they choose in turn order whether to put those cards on the top or bottom of their library.



---

![Engineered Explosives](https://media.wizards.com/2020/2xm/en_4fcWPs9CpU.png)


Engineered Explosives  

{X}  

Artifact  

Sunburst *(This enters the battlefield with a charge counter on it for each color of mana spent to cast it.)*  

{2}, Sacrifice Engineered Explosives: Destroy each nonland permanent with converted mana cost equal to the number of charge counters on Engineered Explosives.


* You can choose any value for X as you cast Engineered Explosives. The value chosen for X doesn't directly affect the number of charge counters Engineered Explosives enters the battlefield with, but it does let you pay more mana and thus spend more colors of mana to cast it.
* Colorless mana won't give Engineered Explosives another charge counter. Colorless is not a color.
* Tokens that aren't a copy of something else don't have a mana cost. Anything without a mana cost normally has a converted mana cost of 0.
* If a permanent has {X} in its mana cost, X is considered to be 0.



---

![Enlarge](https://media.wizards.com/2020/2xm/en_UAXPDCXpBu.png)


Enlarge  

{3}{G}{G}  

Sorcery  

Target creature gets +7/+7 and gains trample until end of turn. It must be blocked this turn if able.


* Only one creature is required to block the affected creature. Other creatures may also block it and are free to block other creatures or not block at all.
* If each creature the defending player controls can't block for any reason (such as being tapped), then the affected creature isn't blocked. If there's a cost associated with blocking the affected creature, the defending player isn't forced to pay that cost, so it doesn't have to be blocked in that case either.



---

![Ensnaring Bridge](https://media.wizards.com/2020/2xm/en_VplqOBkoX3.png)


Ensnaring Bridge  

{3}  

Artifact  

Creatures with power greater than the number of cards in your hand can't attack.


* Ensnaring Bridge's effect checks the number of cards in your hand only while a player (including you) is declaring attackers. Once a creature has legally attacked, changing its power or the number of cards in your hand won't remove it from combat.

![Esperzoa](https://media.wizards.com/2020/2xm/en_tjk2EvvB74.png)


Esperzoa  

{2}{U}  

Artifact Creature — Jellyfish

At the beginning of your upkeep, return an artifact you control to its owner's hand.

Ethersworn Canonist  

{1}{W}  

Artifact Creature — Human Cleric  

2/2  

Each player who has cast a nonartifact spell this turn can't cast additional nonartifact spells.


* Each turn, each player can cast any number of artifact spells plus a maximum of one nonartifact spell.
* Ethersworn Canonist takes into account spells that were cast earlier in the turn before Ethersworn Canonist entered the battlefield, including any spells that are somehow still on the stack. However, any spells on the stack as Ethersworn Canonist enters the battlefield have already been cast by that point, so they're not affected by it.



---

![Everflowing Chalice](https://media.wizards.com/2020/2xm/en_50fpaXJ3l8.png)


Everflowing Chalice  

{0}  

Artifact  

Multikicker {2} *(You may pay an additional {2} any number of times as you cast this spell.)*  

Everflowing Chalice enters the battlefield with a charge counter on it for each time it was kicked.  

{T}: Add {C} for each charge counter on Everflowing Chalice.


* You can cast Everflowing Chalice without kicking it at all if you wish. However, if Everflowing Chalice has no charge counters on it, activating its last ability won't produce any mana.



---

![Exploration](https://media.wizards.com/2020/2xm/en_iomPVSvhqE.png)


Exploration  

{G}  

Enchantment  

You may play an additional land on each of your turns.


* Exploration's ability is cumulative if you control more than one. It's also cumulative with other effects that let you play additional lands, such as the one from Dryad of the Ilysian Grove.

Falkenrath Aristocrat  

{2}{B}{R}  

Creature — Vampire Noble  

4/1  

Flying, haste  

Sacrifice a creature: Falkenrath Aristocrat gains indestructible until end of turn. If the sacrificed creature was a Human, put a +1/+1 counter on Falkenrath Aristocrat.


* Falkenrath Aristocrat's activated ability checks whether the sacrificed creature was a Human as it last existed on the battlefield. It doesn't matter what its creature types are in the graveyard.
* If the sacrificed creature was a Human, Falkenrath Aristocrat gains indestructible and also gets a +1/+1 counter.
* You can sacrifice Falkenrath Aristocrat to pay the cost of its own ability. It won't receive a counter or gain indestructible, but it will enable abilities that check when or if a creature dies.



---

![Fatal Push](https://media.wizards.com/2020/2xm/en_wVZt07fnko.png)


Fatal Push  

{B}  

Instant  

Destroy target creature if it has converted mana cost 2 or less.  
*Revolt* — Destroy that creature if it has converted mana cost 4 or less instead if a permanent you controlled left the battlefield this turn.


* Fatal Push can target any creature, even one with converted mana cost 5 or greater. The creature's converted mana cost is checked only as Fatal Push resolves.
* If a creature on the battlefield has {X} in its mana cost, X is considered to be 0.
* Revolt abilities don't care why the permanent left the battlefield, who caused it to move, or where it moved to. They're equally satisfied by an artifact you sacrificed to pay a cost, a creature you controlled that was destroyed by Cast Down, or an enchantment you returned to your hand with Cyclonic Rift.
* Tokens that leave the battlefield will satisfy a revolt ability.



---

![Fierce Empath](https://media.wizards.com/2020/2xm/en_gnLAQoiDJW.png)


Fierce Empath  

{2}{G}  

Creature — Elf  

1/1  

When Fierce Empath enters the battlefield, you may search your library for a creature card with converted mana cost 6 or greater, reveal it, put it into your hand, then shuffle your library.


* If a card in a player's library has {X} in its mana cost, X is considered to be 0.



---

![Flickerwisp](https://media.wizards.com/2020/2xm/en_QPGpDgkVFI.png)


Flickerwisp  

{1}{W}{W}  

Creature — Elemental  

3/1  

Flying  

When Flickerwisp enters the battlefield, exile another target permanent. Return that card to the battlefield under its owner's control at the beginning of the next end step.


* The exiled card will return to the battlefield at the beginning of the end step even if Flickerwisp is no longer on the battlefield.
* If the permanent that returns to the battlefield has any abilities that trigger at the beginning of the end step, those abilities won't trigger that turn.
* Auras attached to the exiled permanent will be put into their owners' graveyards. Equipment attached to the exiled permanent will become unattached and remain on the battlefield. Any counters on the exiled permanent will cease to exist. Once the exiled permanent returns, it's considered a new object with no relation to the object that it was.
* If a token is exiled this way, it will cease to exist and won't return to the battlefield.



---

![Force of Will](https://media.wizards.com/2020/2xm/en_aFWHeGok86.png)


Force of Will  

{3}{U}{U}  

Instant  

You may pay 1 life and exile a blue card from your hand rather than pay this spell's mana cost.  

Counter target spell.


* To determine the total cost of a spell, start with the mana cost or alternative cost you're paying (such as the alternative cost of Force of Will), add any cost increases, then apply any cost reductions. The converted mana cost of the spell remains unchanged, no matter what the total cost to cast it was.



---

![Frogify](https://media.wizards.com/2020/2xm/en_Xhr2hALK48.png)


Frogify  

{1}{U}  

Enchantment — Aura  

Enchant creature  

Enchanted creature loses all abilities and is a blue Frog creature with base power and toughness 1/1. *(It loses all other card types and creature types.)*


* If the affected creature gains an ability after Frogify becomes attached to it, it will keep that ability.
* Frogify overwrites all colors and creature types the enchanted creature has. It's just a blue Frog. The creature keeps any supertypes (such as legendary) it has, but loses any other card types it has (such as artifact).
* Frogify overwrites all previous effects that set the creature's base power and toughness to specific values. Any power- or toughness-setting effects that start to apply after Frogify becomes attached to a creature will overwrite this effect.
* Effects that modify a creature's power and/or toughness, such as the effect of Dead Weight, will apply to the creature no matter when they started to take effect. The same is true for any counters that change its power and/or toughness.
* Frogify may enchant a permanent that is only temporarily a creature, such as a Vehicle. If this happens, Frogify's effect causes the enchanted permanent to remain a 1/1 blue Frog creature even after the temporary effect expires.
* Because damage remains marked on a creature until the damage is removed as the turn ends, nonlethal damage dealt to a creature may become lethal if Frogify becomes attached to it during that turn.

![Geist of Saint Traft](https://media.wizards.com/2020/2xm/en_2dLE8bQZVW.png)


Geist of Saint Traft  

{1}{W}{U}  

Legendary Creature — Spirit Cleric  

2/2  

Hexproof *(This creature can't be the target of spells or abilities your opponents control.)*  

Whenever Geist of Saint Traft attacks, create a 4/4 white Angel creature token with flying that's tapped and attacking. Exile that token at end of combat.


* You choose which player or planeswalker the Angel token is attacking. It doesn't have to be attacking the same player or planeswalker that Geist of Saint Traft is attacking.
* Although the Angel is an attacking creature, it was never declared as an attacking creature. This means that abilities that trigger whenever a creature attacks won't trigger when it enters the battlefield attacking.
* Any effects that say that the Angel can't attack (such as that of Propaganda) affect only the declaration of attackers. They won't stop the Angel token from entering the battlefield attacking.
* If you create more than one Angel token (most likely due to Doubling Season), both are exiled at end of combat. On the other hand, if something else becomes a copy of the Angel token, the copy isn't exiled.

Gelatinous Genesis  

{X}{X}{G}  

Sorcery  

Create X X/X green Ooze creature tokens.


* For example, if you choose for X to be 1, you pay {2}{G} and create one 1/1 Ooze. If X is 2, you pay {4}{G} and create two 2/2 Oozes. If X is 3, {6}{G} gets you three 3/3 Oozes, and so on.

{4}{B}{B}  

Legendary Creature — Zombie  

5/5  

Intimidate *(This creature can't be blocked except by artifact creatures and/or creatures that share a color with it.)*  

{X}{B}: Put target artifact or creature card with converted mana cost X from an opponent's graveyard onto the battlefield under your control tapped. Then that player mills X cards.


* If a card in a player's graveyard has {X} in its mana cost, X is considered to be 0.
* The target card must have converted mana cost exactly X. You can't overpay to have the player mill more cards.
* In a multiplayer game, if a player leaves the game, all cards that player owns leave as well. If you leave the game, any spells and/or permanents you control from Geth's last ability are exiled.

Whenever another artifact enters the battlefield under your control, Glassdust Hulk gets +1/+1 until end of turn and can't be blocked this turn.  

Cycling {w/u} *({w/u}, Discard this card: Draw a card.)*


* Once a creature has blocked Glassdust Hulk, resolving its triggered ability won't cause it to become unblocked.

![Glint-Sleeve Artisan](https://media.wizards.com/2020/2xm/en_Vsr1F7UYFp.png)


Glint-Sleeve Artisan  

{2}{W}  

Creature — Dwarf Artificer  

2/2  

Fabricate 1 *(When this creature enters the battlefield, put a +1/+1 counter on it or create a 1/1 colorless Servo artifact creature token.)*


* You choose whether to put a +1/+1 counter on Glint-Sleeve Artisan or create a Servo token as the fabricate ability is resolving. No player may take actions between the time you choose and the time that a counter is added or a token is created.
* Fabricate doesn't cause Glint-Sleeve Artisan to enter the battlefield with a +1/+1 counter already on it. Glint-Sleeve Artisan will enter the battlefield as a 2/2 creature, then its fabricate ability goes on the stack. Players may take actions (such as casting instants) while the ability is waiting to resolve.
* If you can't put a +1/+1 counter on Glint-Sleeve Artisan for any reason as fabricate resolves (for instance, if it's no longer on the battlefield), you just create a Servo token.

Godo, Bandit Warlord  

{5}{R}  

Legendary Creature — Human Barbarian  

3/3  

When Godo, Bandit Warlord enters the battlefield, you may search your library for an Equipment card and put it onto the battlefield. If you do, shuffle your library.  

Whenever Godo attacks for the first time each turn, untap it and all Samurai you control. After this phase, there is an additional combat phase.


* Unlike many effects that grant additional combat phases, you don't get an additional main phase with Godo, Bandit Warlord's ability. The additional combat phase happens immediately after the first combat phase.

Golem-Skin Gauntlets  

{1}  

Artifact — Equipment  

Equipped creature gets +1/+0 for each Equipment attached to it.  

Equip {2} *({2}: Attach to target creature you control. Equip only as a sorcery.)*


* The bonus from Golem-Skin Gauntlets is in addition to whatever bonus the other Equipment gives it.
* Golem-Skin Gauntlets is counted by its own ability, so it gives at least +1/+0.



---

![Grand Architect](https://media.wizards.com/2020/2xm/en_chc1aXkKjA.png)


Grand Architect  

{1}{U}{U}  

Creature — Vedalken Artificer  

1/3  

Other blue creatures you control get +1/+1.  

{U}: Target artifact creature becomes blue until end of turn.  

Tap an untapped blue creature you control: Add {C}{C}. Spend this mana only to cast artifact spells or activate abilities of artifacts.


* Because damage remains marked on a creature until the damage is removed as the turn ends, nonlethal damage dealt to a blue creature you control may become lethal if Grand Architect leaves the battlefield during that turn.
* Grand Architect's second ability causes the affected artifact creature to lose any other colors it has, but it doesn't cause it to stop being an artifact.
* You can tap any untapped blue creature you control, including one you haven't controlled continuously since the beginning of your most recent turn, to pay the cost of Grand Architect's mana ability. This includes Grand Architect itself.

Equipped creature gets +2/+0 and has indestructible.  

Equip {4}


* If Hammer of Nazahn enters the battlefield at the same time as other Equipment you control, its ability will trigger for each of those Equipment.
* Because damage remains marked on a creature until the damage is removed as the turn ends, nonlethal damage dealt to the equipped creature may become lethal if you attach Hammer of Nazahn to a different creature during that turn.

Enchantment  

Whenever a player taps a land for mana, that player adds one mana of any type that land produced.


* The types of mana are white, blue, black, red, green, and colorless.
* If you tap a land for more than one mana, you choose one type that was produced and add one mana of that type.
* Heartbeat of Spring doesn't care about any restrictions or riders your lands put on the mana they produce, such as those of Unclaimed Territory and Cavern of Souls. It just produces one mana of the appropriate type, with no restrictions or riders.

Target opponent discards two cards.  
*Raid* — If you attacked this turn, create a Treasure token. *(It's an artifact with "{T}, Sacrifice this artifact: Add one mana of any color.")*

* You create only one Treasure token if you attacked this turn, no matter how many creatures you attacked with beyond the first.

![Hidden Stockpile](https://media.wizards.com/2020/2xm/en_IGzfOWnM3a.png)


Hidden Stockpile  

{W}{B}  

Enchantment  
*Revolt* — At the beginning of your end step, if a permanent you controlled left the battlefield this turn, create a 1/1 colorless Servo artifact creature token.  

{1}, Sacrifice a creature: Scry 1.


* If a permanent you controlled didn't leave the battlefield before your end step begins, Hidden Stockpile's first ability doesn't trigger at all. The permanent may have left before Hidden Stockpile entered the battlefield, however.
* Revolt abilities check only whether a permanent you controlled left the battlefield this turn or not. They don't apply multiple times if more than one permanent you controlled left the battlefield. They don't check whether the permanent that left the battlefield is still in the zone it moved to.
* Revolt abilities don't care why the permanent left the battlefield, who caused it to move, or where it moved to. They're equally satisfied by an artifact you sacrificed to pay a cost, a creature you controlled that was destroyed by Cast Down, or an enchantment you returned to your hand with Cyclonic Rift.
* Tokens that leave the battlefield will satisfy a revolt ability.

![Hinder](https://media.wizards.com/2020/2xm/en_KRjEIlkNAJ.png)

![Invigorate](https://media.wizards.com/2020/2xm/en_JYhEpjUmXs.png)


Invigorate  

{2}{G}  

Instant  

If you control a Forest, rather than pay this spell's mana cost, you may have an opponent gain 3 life.  

Target creature gets +4/+4 until end of turn.


* To determine the total cost of a spell, start with the mana cost or alternative cost you're paying (such as the alternative cost of Invigorate), add any cost increases, then apply any cost reductions. The converted mana cost of the spell remains unchanged, no matter what the total cost to cast it was.
* If an effect says that an opponent can't gain life, you can't have that player gain life to pay Invigorate's alternative cost. If an effect instead replaces life gain, such as that of Sulfuric Vortex, you may choose to pay the cost even though the cost's action is replaced with nothing.

* You choose whether to put a +1/+1 counter on Iron League Steed or create a Servo token as the fabricate ability is resolving. No player may take actions between the time you choose and the time that a counter is added or a token is created.
* Fabricate doesn't cause Iron League Steed to enter the battlefield with a +1/+1 counter already on it. Iron League Steed will enter the battlefield as a 2/2 creature, then its fabricate ability goes on the stack. Players may take actions (such as casting instants) while the ability is waiting to resolve.
* If you can't put a +1/+1 counter on Iron League Steed for any reason as fabricate resolves (for instance, if it's no longer on the battlefield), you just create a Servo token.

Isochron Scepter  

{2}  

Artifact  
*Imprint* — When Isochron Scepter enters the battlefield, you may exile an instant card with converted mana cost 2 or less from your hand.  

{2}, {T}: You may copy the exiled card. If you do, you may cast the copy without paying its mana cost.


* If Isochron Scepter leaves the battlefield while the activated ability is on the stack, the ability can still make a copy. On the other hand, if the imprinted card leaves the exile zone while the activated ability is on the stack, the copy can't be made.
* You cast the copy while the ability is resolving and still on the stack. You can't wait to cast it later in the turn.
* If you don't want to cast the copy, you can choose not to; the copy ceases to exist the next time state-based actions are checked.
* If you cast a spell "without paying its mana cost," you can't choose to cast it for any alternative costs. You can, however, pay additional costs. If the card has any mandatory additional costs, those must be paid to cast the spell.
* If a spell has {X} in its mana cost, you must choose 0 as the value of X when casting it without paying its mana cost.

Choose one —  

• Counter target noncreature spell unless its controller pays {2}.  

• Izzet Charm deals 2 damage to target creature.  

• Draw two cards, then discard two cards.


* If you choose the last mode, you draw two cards and discard two cards all while Izzet Charm is resolving. Nothing can happen between the two, and no player may choose to take actions.

{2}{U}{U}  

Legendary Planeswalker — Jace

+2: Look at the top card of target player's library. You may put that card on the bottom of that player's library.  

0: Draw three cards, then put two cards from your hand on top of your library in any order.  

−1: Return target creature to its owner's hand.  

−12: Exile all cards from target player's library, then that player shuffles their hand into their library.


* You draw three cards and put two cards back all while Jace's second ability is resolving. Nothing can happen between the two, and no player may choose to take actions.
* If the target player for Jace's last ability has no cards in hand, that player shuffles nothing into their library, and that player's library will remain empty. That player won't lose the game until they try to draw from the empty library.

{2}{U}{R}  

Legendary Creature — Human Artificer  

3/3  

Whenever you cast a historic spell, draw a card. *(Artifacts, legendaries, and Sagas are historic.)*


* A spell is historic if it has the legendary supertype, the artifact card type, or the Saga enchantment subtype. Having two of those qualities doesn't make a spell more historic than another or provide an additional bonus—a spell either is historic or it isn't.
* An ability that triggers when a player casts a spell resolves before the spell that caused it to trigger. It resolves even if that spell is countered.

Artifact Creature — Bird  

2/2  

Flying  

Historic spells you cast cost {1} less to cast. *(Artifacts, legendaries, and Sagas are historic.)*


* A spell is historic if it has the legendary supertype, the artifact card type, or the Saga enchantment subtype. Having two of those qualities doesn't make a spell more historic than another or provide an additional bonus—a spell either is historic or it isn't.
* The last ability of Jhoira's Familiar doesn't reduce its own cost while you're casting it.

Kaalia of the Vast  

{1}{R}{W}{B}  

Legendary Creature — Human Cleric  

2/2  

Flying  

Whenever Kaalia of the Vast attacks an opponent, you may put an Angel, Demon, or Dragon creature card from your hand onto the battlefield tapped and attacking that opponent.


* Kaalia's ability doesn't trigger if it attacks a planeswalker.
* Although the creature you put onto the battlefield is an attacking creature, it was never declared as an attacking creature. This means that abilities that trigger whenever a creature attacks won't trigger when it enters the battlefield attacking.
* Any effects that say that the Angel, Demon, or Dragon creature can't attack (such as that of Propaganda or if the creature has defender) affect only the declaration of attackers. They won't stop the creature from entering the battlefield attacking.
* If the opponent Kaalia attacked is no longer in the game when its ability resolves, you may put an Angel, Demon, or Dragon creature card onto the battlefield tapped, but it won't be attacking anyone and it won't be an attacking creature.
* If Kaalia attacks an opponent, the creature enters attacking that player even if Kaalia is somehow attacking a different player or planeswalker as its triggered ability resolves.

![Karn Liberated](https://media.wizards.com/2020/2xm/en_1R5JSIBejz.png)


Karn Liberated  

{7}  

Legendary Planeswalker — Karn  

6  

+4: Target player exiles a card from their hand.  

−3: Exile target permanent.  

−14: Restart the game, leaving in exile all non-Aura permanent cards exiled with Karn Liberated. Then put those cards onto the battlefield under your control.


* A game that restarts immediately ends the preceding game. The players in that game then immediately begin a new game. No player wins, loses, or draws the original game as a result of Karn's ability.
* Players can't move cards between their deck and sideboard before the new game.
* The player who controlled the ability that restarted the game is the starting player in the new game. The new game starts like a game normally does: Each player shuffles their deck (except the cards left in exile by Karn's ability). Each player's life total becomes 20 (or the starting life total for whatever format you're playing). Players draw a hand of seven cards. Players may take mulligans. Players may take actions based on cards in their opening hands, such as those of Leylines.
* Karn's first and third abilities are linked. Similarly, Karn's second and third abilities are linked. Only non-Aura permanent cards exiled by either of Karn's first two abilities will remain in exile when the game restarts.
* After the pregame procedure is complete but before the new game's first turn, Karn's ability finishes resolving and the cards left in exile are put onto the battlefield. If this causes any triggered abilities to trigger, those abilities are put onto the stack at the beginning of the first upkeep step.
* Permanents put onto the battlefield due to Karn's ability will have been under the starting controller's control continuously since the beginning of that player's first turn. Creatures among them can attack and their activated abilities with {T} in the cost can be activated.
* Any permanents put onto the battlefield with Karn's ability that entered the battlefield tapped will untap during their controller's first untap step.
* No actions taken in the game that was restarted apply to the new game. For example, if you were dealt damage by Stigma Lasher in the original game, the effect that states you can't gain life doesn't carry over to the new game.
* Players won't have any counters or emblems they had in the original game.
* In a multiplayer game, any player who left the game before it was restarted with Karn's ability won't be involved in the new game.
* If a player leaves the game, all cards that player owns leave as well. If you leave the game, the permanents you control from Karn's ability are exiled.
* In a Commander game, each player puts their commander into the command zone before shuffling their deck, unless it was exiled with Karn. In that case, the commander remains in exile and will be put onto the battlefield when Karn's ability finishes resolving.
* The number of times a player has cast their commander from the command zone resets to zero. The amount of combat damage dealt to players by each commander is reset to 0.

Legendary Creature — Dragon  

7/7  

Flying, haste  

When Karrthus, Tyrant of Jund enters the battlefield, gain control of all Dragons, then untap all Dragons.  

Other Dragon creatures you control have haste.


* When the triggered ability resolves, you'll untap all Dragons, including the ones you already control.
* The control-change effect of Karrthus's triggered ability lasts indefinitely. It doesn't wear off during the cleanup step, and it doesn't expire if Karrthus leaves the battlefield. In a multiplayer game, it does expire if you leave the game.

2/4  

At the beginning of your upkeep, create a 2/2 white Cat creature token for each Equipment attached to Kemba, Kha Regent.


* The number of Equipment attached to Kemba is determined as the ability resolves. If Kemba is no longer on the battlefield at that time, its last existence on the battlefield is checked to determine the number of Equipment attached to it.

Kuldotha Flamefiend  

{4}{R}{R}  

Creature — Elemental  

4/4  

When Kuldotha Flamefiend enters the battlefield, you may sacrifice an artifact. If you do, Kuldotha Flamefiend deals 4 damage divided as you choose among any number of targets.


* You divide the damage as Kuldotha Flamefiend's triggered ability is put onto the stack, not as it resolves. Each target must be assigned at least 1 damage. You can't choose more than 4 targets and assign 0 damage to a target.
* You may choose zero targets. If you do, Kuldotha Flamefiend deals no damage, but you may sacrifice an artifact.
* If some of the targets become illegal for Kuldotha Flamefiend's ability, the original division of damage still applies, but the damage that would have been dealt to illegal targets isn't dealt at all. If all of the targets become illegal, you can't sacrifice an artifact.
* You don't choose whether to sacrifice an artifact or which artifact you're sacrificing until the ability resolves. Once you decide to sacrifice an artifact (or not), it's too late for players to respond.

Liege of the Tangle  

{6}{G}{G}  

Creature — Elemental  

8/8  

Trample  

Whenever Liege of the Tangle deals combat damage to a player, you may choose any number of target lands you control and put an awakening counter on each of them. Each of those lands is an 8/8 green Elemental creature for as long as it has an awakening counter on it. They're still lands.


* Whether an affected land remains an 8/8 green Elemental creature depends only on whether it still has an awakening counter on it, not on whether Liege of the Tangle is still on the battlefield.
* If an awakening counter is moved from an affected land to another land, this doesn't cause the recipient to be affected by Liege of the Tangle's ability.

Equip {0}


* You can't simply unequip Equipment from a creature. If Lightning Greaves is attached to the only creature you control, you won't be able to attach other equipment to it (or target it with anything else) until you have another creature onto which you can move Lightning Greaves.
* If a creature enters the battlefield under your control and gains haste, but then loses it before attacking, it won't be able to attack that turn. This means that you can't use one Lightning Greaves to allow two new creatures to attack in the same turn.

![Maelstrom Nexus](https://media.wizards.com/2020/2xm/en_4OHvRAHTlL.png)


Maelstrom Nexus  

{W}{U}{B}{R}{G}  

Enchantment  

The first spell you cast each turn has cascade. *(When you cast your first spell, exile cards from the top of your library until you exile a nonland card that costs less. You may cast it without paying its mana cost. Put the exiled cards on the bottom of your library in a random order.)*


* This effect takes into account spells that were cast earlier in the turn before Maelstrom Nexus entered the battlefield, including any spells still on the stack. If you've already cast any spells that turn (including Maelstrom Nexus itself), this ability won't give any of your spells cascade that turn.
* If the first spell you cast in a turn already has cascade, both cascade abilities will trigger separately. Deal with them one at a time: First one cascade ability will resolve, and you'll cast the applicable card if you want. That new spell will resolve. Then the other cascade ability will resolve in the same way. Finally, the original spell will resolve.
* A spell's converted mana cost is determined solely by the mana symbols printed in its upper right corner. If its mana cost includes {X}, take the chosen value of X into account. Ignore any alternative costs, additional costs, cost increases, or cost reductions.
* Cascade triggers when you cast the spell, meaning that it resolves before that spell. If you end up casting the exiled card, it will go on the stack above the spell with cascade.
* When the cascade ability resolves, you must exile cards. The only optional part of the ability is whether or not you cast the last card exiled.
* If a spell with cascade is countered, the cascade ability will still resolve normally.
* You exile the cards face-up. All players will be able to see them.

![Maelstrom Pulse](https://media.wizards.com/2020/2xm/en_iPrIVlRPWc.png)


Maelstrom Pulse  

{1}{B}{G}  

Sorcery  

Destroy target nonland permanent and all other permanents with the same name as that permanent.


* Maelstrom Pulse has only one target. Other permanents with the same name will be destroyed even if they have hexproof or protection.
* If the target permanent is an illegal target by the time Maelstrom Pulse tries to resolve, the spell won't resolve. You won't destroy any permanents at all. If the target is legal but not destroyed (most likely because it has indestructible), you do destroy other permanents with the same name.
* The name of a token is the same as the subtypes it was created with unless the token is a copy of another permanent or the effect that created the token specifically gives it a different name. For example, a 1/1 red Elemental creature token created by Young Pyromancer and a 4/4 green Elemental creature token created by Walker of the Grove are both named "Elemental."

{3}{B}  

Creature — Human Wizard  

4/3  

At the beginning of each player's upkeep, destroy target nonartifact creature that player controls of their choice. It can't be regenerated.


* The triggered ability can target a creature with indestructible. It won't be destroyed.
* Even though the player whose upkeep it is chooses the target creature, you control the ability. An opponent can't target a creature with hexproof they control.

Magus of the Will  

{2}{B}  

Creature — Human Wizard  

3/3  

{2}{B}, {T}, Exile Magus of the Will: Until end of turn, you may play lands and cast spells from your graveyard. If a card would be put into your graveyard from anywhere this turn, exile that card instead.


* Cards that would be put into your graveyard are exiled even if you didn't play them this turn, such as a nontoken creature that would die.
* Tokens are put into your graveyard as normal (and cease to exist soon after). Abilities that trigger when a creature dies can trigger on token creatures being put into your graveyard but won't trigger on nontoken creatures being exiled instead of being put into your graveyard.
* You pay the costs for a card in your graveyard if you cast it. You may pay alternative costs such as overload rather than the card's mana cost.
* You may play a land card from your graveyard only if you have an available land play.
* Magus of the Will doesn't change when you can play the cards in your graveyard. For example, if you have a creature card without flash in your graveyard, you can cast it only during your main phase while the stack is empty.
* If another effect tries to change where a spell is put as it resolves, such as that of a rebound or buyback ability, you may choose whether to exile the card to Magus of the Will's effect or to apply the other effect.

At the beginning of your upkeep, flip a coin. If you lose the flip, Mana Crypt deals 3 damage to you.

![Mana Echoes](https://media.wizards.com/2020/2xm/en_pM8QQFYUd6.png)


Mana Echoes  

{2}{R}{R}  

Enchantment  

Whenever a creature enters the battlefield, you may add an amount of {C} equal to the number of creatures you control that share a creature type with it.


* The amount of mana to add to your mana pool is determined only as the triggered ability of Mana Echoes resolves. The ability isn't a mana ability; players may respond to it.
* The creature entering the battlefield shares a creature type with itself if it has any creature types, so Mana Echoes usually adds at least {C}.
* Mana Echoes counts the number of creatures that share a type, not how many types they share. For example, if a Human Warrior enters while you control two Humans and two other Human Warriors, you'll add five {C} to your mana pool.



---

![Mana Reflection](https://media.wizards.com/2020/2xm/en_fbp7dPs9oU.png)


Mana Reflection  

{4}{G}{G}  

Enchantment  

If you tap a permanent for mana, it produces twice as much of that mana instead.


* You're "tapping a permanent for mana" only if you're activating a mana ability of that permanent that includes the {T} symbol in its cost. A mana ability produces mana as part of its effect.
* If an ability triggers "whenever you tap" something for mana and produces mana, that triggered mana ability won't be affected by Mana Reflection.
* Mana Reflection doesn't produce any mana itself. Rather, it causes permanents you tap for mana to produce more mana. If the mana ability of that permanent puts any restrictions or riders on the mana it produces, that will apply to all the mana it produces this way.
* The effects of multiple Mana Reflections are cumulative. For example, if you have two Mana Reflections on the battlefield, you'll get four times the original amount and type of mana. If you have three, you'll get eight times the mana, and so on.

Master of Etherium  

{2}{U}  

Artifact Creature — Vedalken Wizard  

\*/\*  

Master of Etherium's power and toughness are each equal to the number of artifacts you control.  

Other artifact creatures you control get +1/+1.


* The ability that defines Master of Etherium's power and toughness applies in all zones, not just the battlefield.
* As long as Master of Etherium is on the battlefield, its ability will count itself.
* Because damage remains marked on a creature until the damage is removed as the turn ends, nonlethal damage dealt to Master of Etherium may become lethal if other artifacts you control leave the battlefield during that turn, and damage dealt to other artifact creatures you control may become lethal if Master of Etherium leaves the battlefield during that turn.

When Master Splicer enters the battlefield, create a 3/3 colorless Golem artifact creature token.  

Golems you control get +1/+1.


* Because damage remains marked on a creature until the damage is removed as the turn ends, nonlethal damage dealt to a Golem you control may become lethal if Master Splicer leaves the battlefield during that turn.

{3}{U}  

Artifact Creature — Human Artificer  

1/2  

{U}, {T}, Return an artifact you control to its owner's hand: You may put an artifact card from your hand onto the battlefield.


* Master Transmuter can be returned to its owner's hand to pay the cost of its activated ability.
* The artifact card you put onto the battlefield when the ability resolves may be the same card that you returned to your hand when you paid the cost. If so, it returns to the battlefield as a new object with no relation to its previous existence.

Maze of Ith  

Land  

{T}: Untap target attacking creature. Prevent all combat damage that would be dealt to and dealt by that creature this turn.


* Maze of Ith really is a land with no mana ability. It doesn't tap for colorless mana.
* Maze of Ith can target an untapped attacking creature. It will still prevent the combat damage it would deal and be dealt.
* The creature isn't removed from combat; it just has its damage prevented. It's still an attacking creature until the combat phase is complete.
* You can activate Maze of Ith's ability targeting an attacking creature you control during the combat damage step or the end of combat step. It'll be untapped and the damage it had already dealt won't be undone.

{3}{B}{G}  

Legendary Creature — Insect Shaman  

2/2  

Flying  

Whenever a player sacrifices another permanent, put a +1/+1 counter on each creature you control.


* Mazirek's last ability is a triggered ability, not an activated ability. It doesn't allow you to sacrifice a permanent whenever you want; rather, you need some other way of sacrificing permanents.
* If you sacrifice a permanent as part of casting a spell or activating an ability, Mazirek's last ability will resolve before that spell or ability.
* If you sacrifice Mazirek and other permanents at the same time, Mazirek's last ability triggers for the other permanents.
* A legendary permanent that is put into a graveyard because of the "legend rule" isn't sacrificed.

Meddling Mage  

{W}{U}  

Creature — Human Wizard  

2/2  

As Meddling Mage enters the battlefield, choose a nonland card name.  

Spells with the chosen name can't be cast.


* No one can cast spells or activate abilities between the time a card is named and the time that Meddling Mage's ability begins to apply.
* Spells with the chosen name that somehow happen to already be on the stack when Meddling Mage enters the battlefield aren't affected by Meddling Mage's ability.

Mesmeric Orb  

{2}  

Artifact  

Whenever a permanent becomes untapped, that permanent's controller mills a card. *(They put the top card of their library into their graveyard.)*


* If permanents become untapped during the untap step, Mesmeric Orb's ability will trigger that many times. However, since no player gets priority during the untap step, those abilities wait to be put on the stack until the upkeep starts. At that time, any "beginning of upkeep" triggers will also trigger. Those abilities and Mesmeric Orb's triggers are put onto the stack at the same time.

![Metallic Rebuke](https://media.wizards.com/2020/2xm/en_YkFFTXejvT.png)


Metallic Rebuke  

{2}{U}  

Instant  

Improvise *(Your artifacts can help cast this spell. Each artifact you tap after you're done activating mana abilities pays for {1}.)*  

Counter target spell unless its controller pays {3}.


* When calculating a spell's total cost, include any alternative costs, additional costs, or anything else that increases or reduces the cost to cast the spell. Improvise applies after the total cost is calculated.
* Improvise doesn't change a spell's mana cost or converted mana cost.
* Improvise can't pay for {U} in Metallic Rebuke's total cost.
* If an artifact you control has a mana ability with {T} in the cost, activating that ability while casting a spell with improvise will result in the artifact being tapped when you pay the spell's costs. You won't be able to tap it again for improvise. Similarly, if you sacrifice an artifact to activate a mana ability while casting a spell with improvise, that artifact won't be on the battlefield when you pay the spell's costs, so you won't be able to tap it for improvise.
* Tapping an artifact won't cause its abilities to stop applying unless those abilities say so.
* Equipment attached to a creature doesn't become tapped when that creature becomes tapped, and tapping that Equipment doesn't cause the creature to become tapped.

Target creature gets +1/+1 until end of turn for each creature you control.


* The size of the bonus is determined as Might of the Masses resolves; it won't change if the number of creatures you control changes later in the turn.
* If you target a creature you control with Might of the Masses, remember to count that creature when determining the amount of the bonus.

![Mishra's Factory](https://media.wizards.com/2020/2xm/en_FJ9XbZ2NX5.png)


Mishra's Factory  

Land  

{T}: Add {C}.  

{1}: Mishra's Factory becomes a 2/2 Assembly-Worker artifact creature until end of turn. It's still a land.  

{T}: Target Assembly-Worker creature gets +1/+1 until end of turn.


* A noncreature permanent that turns into a creature can attack, and its {T} abilities can be activated, only if its controller has continuously controlled that permanent since the beginning of their most recent turn. It doesn't matter how long the permanent has been a creature.
* Mishra's Factory can be the target of its last ability after activating its middle ability. Activating it after it has blocked a creature won't remove it from combat or stop it from dealing and being dealt combat damage.

{3}{B}{B}  

Creature — Spirit  

4/4  
*Morbid* — When Morkrut Banshee enters the battlefield, if a creature died this turn, target creature gets -4/-4 until end of turn.


* Morkrut Banshee's morbid ability triggers only once, not once for each creature that has died this turn. If no creatures have died by the time it enters the battlefield, its ability won't trigger at all.
* If there are no other creatures on the battlefield when the morbid ability triggers, the ability must target Morkrut Banshee itself.

Myr Battlesphere  

{7}  

Artifact Creature — Myr Construct  

4/7  

When Myr Battlesphere enters the battlefield, create four 1/1 colorless Myr artifact creature tokens.  

Whenever Myr Battlesphere attacks, you may tap X untapped Myr you control. If you do, Myr Battlesphere gets +X/+0 until end of turn and deals X damage to the player or planeswalker it's attacking.


* You choose the value for X as the last ability resolves. You can't choose a value for X that's greater than the number of untapped Myr you control.
* You can tap any untapped Myr you control as the last ability resolves, not just the Myr tokens you created with the first ability. This includes Myr that haven't been under your control since your most recent turn began.
* As the last ability resolves, you can tap untapped Myr you control even if Myr Battlesphere is no longer on the battlefield by then. If that has happened, Myr Battlesphere won't be able to get the +X/+0 bonus, but it will still deal X damage to the appropriate player or planeswalker.

Myr Retriever  

{2}  

Artifact Creature — Myr  

1/1  

When Myr Retriever dies, return another target artifact card from your graveyard to your hand.


* If Myr Retriever dies at the same time as another artifact you own, its ability can target that other artifact card.

![Myrsmith](https://media.wizards.com/2020/2xm/en_fRYOivC599.png)


Myrsmith  

{1}{W}  

Creature — Human Artificer  

2/1  

Whenever you cast an artifact spell, you may pay {1}. If you do, create a 1/1 colorless Myr artifact creature token.


* An ability that triggers when a player casts a spell resolves before the spell that caused it to trigger. It resolves even if that spell is countered.
* While resolving Myrsmith's ability, you can't pay more than {1} to get more than one Myr.

![Noble Hierarch](https://media.wizards.com/2020/2xm/en_4unwzuAzOV.png)


Noble Hierarch  

{G}  

Creature — Human Druid  

0/1  

Exalted *(Whenever a creature you control attacks alone, that creature gets +1/+1 until end of turn.)*  

{T}: Add {G}, {W}, or {U}.


* If you declare exactly one creature as an attacker, each exalted ability on each permanent you control (including, perhaps, the attacking creature itself) will trigger.
* You must attack with exactly one creature for exalted abilities to trigger. Exalted abilities won't trigger if you attack a player with one creature and a planeswalker with another, for example, or if you attack with two creatures but one is removed from combat.
* Some effects put creatures onto the battlefield attacking. Since those creatures were never declared as attackers, they're ignored by exalted abilities. They won't cause exalted abilities to trigger. If any exalted abilities have already triggered (because exactly one creature was declared as an attacker), those abilities will resolve as normal even though there may now be multiple attackers.
* In a Two-Headed Giant game, a creature "attacks alone" if it's the only creature declared as an attacker by your entire team. If you control that attacking creature, your exalted abilities will trigger but your teammate's exalted abilities won't.

![O-Naginata](https://media.wizards.com/2020/2xm/en_hU9axUY20n.png)


O-Naginata  

{1}  

Artifact — Equipment  

O-Naginata can be attached only to a creature with power 3 or greater.  

Equipped creature gets +3/+0 and has trample.  

Equip {2} *({2}: Attach to target creature you control. Equip only as a sorcery.)*


* O-Naginata can become attached to a creature only if that creature's power is 3 or greater before O-Naginata is attached to it.
* O-Naginata's equip ability can target any creature you control—but if the creature's power is 2 or less, it won't become attached as it resolves.
* O-Naginata becomes unattached if the equipped creature's power is reduced so that its power is 2 or less, including the +3/+0 from O-Naginata's effect, as state-based actions are checked.

![Open the Vaults](https://media.wizards.com/2020/2xm/en_L2lUPIsLsz.png)


Open the Vaults  

{4}{W}{W}  

Sorcery  

Return all artifact and enchantment cards from all graveyards to the battlefield under their owners' control. *(Auras with nothing to enchant remain in graveyards.)*


* If an Aura is put onto the battlefield without being cast, the Aura's controller-to-be chooses what it will enchant as it enters the battlefield. An Aura put onto the battlefield this way doesn't target anything (so it could be attached to an opponent's permanent with hexproof, for example), but the Aura's enchant ability restricts what it can be attached to. If the Aura can't legally be attached to anything, it remains in its current zone.
* If an Aura can be returned to the battlefield with Open the Vaults, it must be, even if its owner doesn't like what it would enchant.
* If multiple players have Auras in their graveyards, the player whose turn it is announces what their Auras will enchant, then each other player in turn order does the same, then all artifacts and enchantments (including both Auras and non-Auras) enter the battlefield at the same time.
* An Aura put onto the battlefield this way can't enchant an artifact or enchantment that's also being put onto the battlefield with Open the Vaults.



---

![Oubliette](https://media.wizards.com/2020/2xm/en_hfhmedXqRb.png)


Oubliette  

{1}{B}{B}  

Enchantment  

When Oubliette enters the battlefield, target creature phases out until Oubliette leaves the battlefield. Tap that creature as it phases in this way. *(Auras and Equipment phase out with it. While permanents are phased out, they're treated as though they don't exist.)*


* If Oubliette leaves the battlefield before its triggered ability resolves, the target creature won't be phased out or tapped.
* While a permanent is phased out, it's treated as though it doesn't exist. It can't be the target of spells or abilities, its static abilities have no effect on the game, its triggered abilities can't trigger, it can't attack or block, and so on.
* Phasing out doesn't cause any "leaves the battlefield" abilities to trigger. Similarly, phasing in won't cause any "enters the battlefield" abilities to trigger.
* Any one-shot effects that are waiting "until [this] leaves the battlefield," such as that of Kitesail Freebooter, won't happen when a permanent phases out.
* Any continuous effects with a "for as long as" duration such as that of Awakener Druid ignore phased-out objects. Any such effects will expire if their conditions are no longer met after ignoring the phased-out objects.
* Each Aura and Equipment attached to a permanent that's phasing out also phases out. They will phase in with that permanent and still be attached to it. Similarly, permanents that phase out with counters phase in with those counters.
* Choices made for permanents as they entered the battlefield are remembered when they phase in.
* A creature phased out by Oubliette doesn't phase in during its controller's untap step as normal. Rather, it phases in immediately after Oubliette leaves the battlefield.
* Abilities that trigger when a creature becomes tapped won't trigger when the creature phases in tapped.

![Ovalchase Daredevil](https://media.wizards.com/2020/2xm/en_eUetfQgLIs.png)


Ovalchase Daredevil  

{3}{B}  

Creature — Human Pilot  

4/2  

Whenever an artifact enters the battlefield under your control, you may return Ovalchase Daredevil from your graveyard to your hand.


* Ovalchase Daredevil's ability triggers only if it's already in your graveyard as an artifact enters the battlefield under your control.



---

![Painsmith](https://media.wizards.com/2020/2xm/en_XlnM9B3WGm.png)


Painsmith  

{1}{B}  

Creature — Human Artificer  

2/1  

Whenever you cast an artifact spell, you may have target creature get +2/+0 and gain deathtouch until end of turn.


* An ability that triggers when a player casts a spell resolves before the spell that caused it to trigger. It resolves even if that spell is countered.



---

![Parasitic Strix](https://media.wizards.com/2020/2xm/en_YfetxYWv4N.png)


Parasitic Strix  

{2}{U}  

Artifact Creature — Bird  

2/2  

Flying  

When Parasitic Strix enters the battlefield, if you control a black permanent, target player loses 2 life and you gain 2 life.


* If you don't control a black permanent immediately after Parasitic Strix enters the battlefield, its ability doesn't trigger. If you don't control one as the ability resolves, no player loses or gains life. It doesn't have to be the same black permanent both times, however.
* Parasitic Strix's ability triggers only once, no matter how many black permanents you control beyond the first.



---

![Path to Exile](https://media.wizards.com/2020/2xm/en_UP1WPvGH0r.png)


Path to Exile  

{W}  

Instant  

Exile target creature. Its controller may search their library for a basic land card, put that card onto the battlefield tapped, then shuffle their library.


* If the target creature is an illegal target by the time Path to Exile tries to resolve, the spell won't resolve. The creature's controller won't search for a basic land card.
* The controller of the exiled creature isn't required to search their library for a basic land. If that player doesn't, the player won't shuffle their library.



---

![Pentad Prism](https://media.wizards.com/2020/2xm/en_aKOKF0ED2A.png)


Pentad Prism  

{2}  

Artifact  

Sunburst *(This enters the battlefield with a charge counter on it for each color of mana spent to cast it.)*  

Remove a charge counter from Pentad Prism: Add one mana of any color.


* Sunburst checks what mana was actually spent to cast the spell. If an effect allows you to spend mana "as though it were mana" of any color or type, that allows you to spend mana you couldn't otherwise spend, but it doesn't change what mana you spent to cast the spell.
* Once Pentad Prism has run out of charge counters, it remains on the battlefield.



---

![Phyrexian Revoker](https://media.wizards.com/2020/2xm/en_6UAwHrpxns.png)


Phyrexian Revoker  

{2}  

Artifact Creature — Horror  

2/1  

As Phyrexian Revoker enters the battlefield, choose a nonland card name.  

Activated abilities of sources with the chosen name can't be activated.


* Activated abilities are written in the form "Cost: Effect." Some keywords are activated abilities (such as equip) and will have colons in their reminder texts. Static and triggered abilities of sources with the chosen name are unaffected.
* Phyrexian Revoker's ability affects sources with the chosen name no matter what zone they are in. For example, a cycling ability of a card with the chosen name can't be activated from hand.



---

![Pongify](https://media.wizards.com/2020/2xm/en_72o9Y3XPkz.png)


Pongify  

{U}  

Instant  

Destroy target creature. It can't be regenerated. Its controller creates a 3/3 green Ape creature token.


* If the target creature is an illegal target by the time Pongify tries to resolve, the spell won't resolve. No player creates an Ape token. If the target is legal but not destroyed (most likely because it has indestructible), its controller does create an Ape token.



---

![Puresteel Paladin](https://media.wizards.com/2020/2xm/en_jhc7zETjdN.png)


Puresteel Paladin  

{W}{W}  

Creature — Human Knight  

2/2  

Whenever an Equipment enters the battlefield under your control, you may draw a card.  
*Metalcraft* — Equipment you control have equip {0} as long as you control three or more artifacts.


* You may still activate the Equipment's other equip abilities if you wish.
* Once the equip {0} ability is activated, causing Puresteel Paladin to leave the battlefield or causing its controller to control fewer than three artifacts won't stop the equip ability from resolving.



---

![Pyrewild Shaman](https://media.wizards.com/2020/2xm/en_CmdGRiKRWl.png)


Pyrewild Shaman  

{2}{R}  

Creature — Goblin Shaman  

3/1  
*Bloodrush* — {1}{R}, Discard Pyrewild Shaman: Target attacking creature gets +3/+1 until end of turn.  

Whenever one or more creatures you control deal combat damage to a player, if Pyrewild Shaman is in your graveyard, you may pay {3}. If you do, return Pyrewild Shaman to your hand.


* Pyrewild Shaman's last ability triggers only if it's in your graveyard when the creatures deal combat damage to a player. Notably, if Pyrewild Shaman is dealt lethal damage at the same time that a creature you control deals combat damage to a player, Pyrewild Shaman's ability won't trigger.
* If creatures you control deal combat damage to more than one player at the same time (most likely because it's a multiplayer game), Pyrewild Shaman's ability will trigger once for each of those players. However, only the first such ability that you pay for will return Pyrewild Shaman to your hand. Even if it's put back into your graveyard before the other abilities resolve, it's considered a different Pyrewild Shaman than the one whose ability triggered.



---

![Rage Reflection](https://media.wizards.com/2020/2xm/en_YS8YKcrEJK.png)


Rage Reflection  

{4}{R}{R}  

Enchantment  

Creatures you control have double strike.


* If a creature loses double strike after assigning damage in the first strike combat damage step (due to Rage Reflection leaving the battlefield, for example), that creature won't assign damage in the normal combat damage step.



---

![Ratchet Bomb](https://media.wizards.com/2020/2xm/en_qYVtMPK4uy.png)


Ratchet Bomb  

{2}  

Artifact  

{T}: Put a charge counter on Ratchet Bomb.  

{T}, Sacrifice Ratchet Bomb: Destroy each nonland permanent with converted mana cost equal to the number of charge counters on Ratchet Bomb.


* Tokens that aren't a copy of something else don't have a mana cost. Anything without a mana cost normally has a converted mana cost of 0.
* If a permanent has {X} in its mana cost, X is considered to be 0.



---

![Ravenous Trap](https://media.wizards.com/2020/2xm/en_XyKKGWVI6e.png)


Ravenous Trap  

{2}{B}{B}  

Instant — Trap  

If an opponent had three or more cards put into their graveyard from anywhere this turn, you may pay {0} rather than pay this spell's mana cost.  

Exile all cards from target player's graveyard.


* To determine the total cost of a spell, start with the mana cost or alternative cost you're paying (such as Ravenous Trap's alternative cost), add any cost increases, then apply any cost reductions. The converted mana cost of the spell remains unchanged, no matter what the total cost to cast it was.



---

![Relic Runner](https://media.wizards.com/2020/2xm/en_fzlNToYpF1.png)


Relic Runner  

{1}{U}  

Creature — Human Rogue  

2/1  

Relic Runner can't be blocked if you've cast a historic spell this turn. *(Artifacts, legendaries, and Sagas are historic.)*


* Once Relic Runner has been blocked, casting a historic spell won't remove the blocking creature from combat or cause Relic Runner to become unblocked.



---

![Reshape](https://media.wizards.com/2020/2xm/en_netgib5LFu.png)


Reshape  

{X}{U}{U}  

Sorcery  

As an additional cost to cast this spell, sacrifice an artifact.  

Search your library for an artifact card with converted mana cost X or less and put it onto the battlefield. Then shuffle your library.


* If a card in a player's library has {X} in its mana cost, X is considered to be 0 for that card.



---

![Riddlesmith](https://media.wizards.com/2020/2xm/en_yPVhWtZXed.png)


Riddlesmith  

{1}{U}  

Creature — Human Artificer  

2/1  

Whenever you cast an artifact spell, you may draw a card. If you do, discard a card.


* An ability that triggers when a player casts a spell resolves before the spell that caused it to trigger. It resolves even if that spell is countered.
* You draw a card and discard a card all while Riddlesmith's ability is resolving. Nothing can happen between the two, and no player may choose to take actions.



---

![Riku of Two Reflections](https://media.wizards.com/2020/2xm/en_76OqDEUHF4.png)


Riku of Two Reflections  

{2}{G}{U}{R}  

Legendary Creature — Human Wizard  

2/2  

Whenever you cast an instant or sorcery spell, you may pay {U}{R}. If you do, copy that spell. You may choose new targets for the copy.  

Whenever another nontoken creature enters the battlefield under your control, you may pay {G}{U}. If you do, create a token that's a copy of that creature.


* While resolving either of Riku's triggered abilities, you can't pay the mana multiple times to create multiple copies.
* Riku's first ability can copy the instant or sorcery spell even if it was countered before the triggered ability resolved. Similarly, Riku's second ability can create a token that's a copy of the creature even if it left the battlefield before the triggered ability resolved. Use the spell or creature's last known copiable values to determine what the copy looks like.



---

![Rolling Earthquake](https://media.wizards.com/2020/2xm/en_wzBo6DhGSO.png)


Rolling Earthquake  

{X}{R}  

Sorcery  

Rolling Earthquake deals X damage to each creature without horsemanship and each player.


* Horsemanship is a keyword ability that functions similarly to flying. It appears in the *Portal: Three Kingdoms* set and does not appear in the *Double Masters* set. This means that in most cases Rolling Earthquake will simply deal X damage to each creature and each player, even creatures depicted on horseback in their illustration.



---

![Rush of Knowledge](https://media.wizards.com/2020/2xm/en_NIvRELYH2A.png)


Rush of Knowledge  

{4}{U}  

Sorcery  

Draw cards equal to the highest converted mana cost among permanents you control.


* If a permanent on the battlefield has {X} in its mana cost, X is considered to be 0.

![Salvage Titan](https://media.wizards.com/2020/2xm/en_xMkVVlcEhu.png)


Salvage Titan  

{4}{B}{B}  

Artifact Creature — Golem  

6/4  

You may sacrifice three artifacts rather than pay this spell's mana cost.  

Exile three artifact cards from your graveyard: Return Salvage Titan from your graveyard to your hand.


* To determine the total cost of a spell, start with the mana cost or alternative cost you're paying (such as Salvage Titan's alternative cost), add any cost increases, then apply any cost reductions. The converted mana cost of the spell remains unchanged, no matter what the total cost to cast it was.
* Casting Salvage Titan by paying its alternative cost doesn't change when you can cast it. You can cast it only at the normal time you could cast a creature spell.
* You may activate its second ability only if Salvage Titan is in your graveyard. To pay this ability's cost, you may exile any three artifact cards from your graveyard—including Salvage Titan itself. If you exile it to pay the cost, however, it won't be returned to your hand when the ability resolves.



---

![Sandstone Oracle](https://media.wizards.com/2020/2xm/en_4EIr8R03ps.png)


Sandstone Oracle  

{7}  

Artifact Creature — Sphinx  

4/4  

Flying  

When Sandstone Oracle enters the battlefield, choose an opponent. If that player has more cards in hand than you, draw cards equal to the difference.


* You choose an opponent while Sandstone Oracle's ability is resolving. No player may take actions between the time you make this choice and the time you draw cards.
* To draw cards equal to the difference, first determine how many cards you'll draw, then draw that many cards, as modified by replacement effects. For example, if you have two cards in hand and the chosen opponent has five, Thought Reflection will cause you to draw six cards instead of three.



---

![The Scarab God](https://media.wizards.com/2020/2xm/en_W0ltWY6PA2.png)


The Scarab God  

{3}{U}{B}  

Legendary Creature — God  

5/5  

At the beginning of your upkeep, each opponent loses X life and you scry X, where X is the number of Zombies you control.  

{2}{U}{B}: Exile target creature card from a graveyard. Create a token that's a copy of it, except it's a 4/4 black Zombie.  

When The Scarab God dies, return it to its owner's hand at the beginning of the next end step.


* The number of Zombies you control is counted as The Scarab God's first ability resolves. Players can try to change that number in response to the ability (perhaps by activating its second ability).
* If The Scarab God dies but leaves your graveyard before the next end step, it will remain in its new zone.
* In a Two-Headed Giant game, The Scarab God's first ability causes the opposing team to lose life equal to twice the number of Zombies you control, although you scry only equal to the number of Zombies you control.



---

![Sen Triplets](https://media.wizards.com/2020/2xm/en_fAJ8vPSeyb.png)


Sen Triplets  

{2}{W}{U}{B}  

Legendary Artifact Creature — Human Wizard  

3/3  

At the beginning of your upkeep, choose target opponent. This turn, that player can't cast spells or activate abilities and plays with their hand revealed. You may play lands and cast spells from that player's hand this turn.


* The target opponent can't activate any abilities, including mana abilities.
* Activated abilities are written in the form "[Cost]: [Effect]." Some keyword abilities (such as cycling) are activated abilities and will have colons in their reminder texts.
* Triggered abilities use the word "when," "whenever," or "at." They're often written as "[Trigger condition], [effect]." Triggered abilities are unaffected by Sen Triplets.
* Abilities that create replacement effects, such as a permanent entering the battlefield tapped or with counters on it, are unaffected by Sen Triplets. Abilities that apply "as [this creature] enters the battlefield" are also replacement effects and are unaffected.
* You can't activate abilities of cards in the target opponent's hand.
* Sen Triplets doesn't allow you to play more than one land during your turn or change when you may cast spells from the target opponent's hand.

![Sentinel of the Pearl Trident](https://media.wizards.com/2020/2xm/en_h726m4I49K.png)


Sentinel of the Pearl Trident  

{4}{U}  

Creature — Merfolk Soldier  

3/3  

Flash  

When Sentinel of the Pearl Trident enters the battlefield, you may exile target historic permanent you control. If you do, return that card to the battlefield under its owner's control at the beginning of the next end step. *(Artifacts, legendaries, and Sagas are historic.)*


* The exiled card will return to the battlefield at the beginning of the end step even if Sentinel of the Pearl Trident is no longer on the battlefield.
* If the permanent that returns to the battlefield has any abilities that trigger at the beginning of the end step, those abilities won't trigger that turn.
* Auras attached to the exiled permanent will be put into their owners' graveyards. Equipment attached to the exiled permanent will become unattached and remain on the battlefield. Any counters on the exiled permanent will cease to exist. Once the exiled permanent returns, it's considered a new object with no relation to the object that it was.
* If a token is exiled this way, it will cease to exist and won't return to the battlefield.

![Shamanic Revelation](https://media.wizards.com/2020/2xm/en_8lITJld4CD.png)


Shamanic Revelation  

{3}{G}{G}  

Sorcery  

Draw a card for each creature you control.  
*Ferocious* — You gain 4 life for each creature you control with power 4 or greater.


* After you draw cards while Shamanic Revelation is resolving, nothing else can happen before you gain the appropriate amount of life. Notably, abilities that trigger when you draw cards won't be put onto the stack until after you've gained life.

![Sharuum the Hegemon](https://media.wizards.com/2020/2xm/en_6OqpuHir0H.png)


Sharuum the Hegemon  

{3}{W}{U}{B}  

Legendary Artifact Creature — Sphinx  

5/5  

Flying  

When Sharuum the Hegemon enters the battlefield, you may return target artifact card from your graveyard to the battlefield.


* If Sharuum the Hegemon is put into your graveyard as a state-based action immediately after Sharuum the Hegemon enters the battlefield (most likely due to the "legend rule") it can be the artifact card targeted by its own ability.



---

![Silumgar Scavenger](https://media.wizards.com/2020/2xm/en_2CX4hMAtSP.png)


Silumgar Scavenger  

{4}{B}  

Creature — Zombie Bird  

2/3  

Flying  

Exploit *(When this creature enters the battlefield, you may sacrifice a creature.)*  

Whenever another creature you control dies, put a +1/+1 counter on Silumgar Scavenger. It gains haste until end of turn if it exploited that creature.


* A creature with exploit "exploited that creature" if the controller of the creature's exploit ability sacrificed a creature as the exploit ability resolved.
* You choose whether to sacrifice a creature and which creature to sacrifice as the exploit ability resolves. A creature can exploit itself.
* You can't sacrifice more than one creature to any one exploit ability.
* If Silumgar Scavenger is dealt lethal damage at the same time as another creature you control, it won't receive a counter from its last ability in time to save it.

![Skirsdag High Priest](https://media.wizards.com/2020/2xm/en_LZlV9g1t21.png)


Skirsdag High Priest  

{1}{B}  

Creature — Human Cleric  

1/2  
*Morbid* — {T}, Tap two untapped creatures you control: Create a 5/5 black Demon creature token with flying. Activate this ability only if a creature died this turn.


* Unlike Skirsdag High Priest itself, the two other creatures you tap to activate its ability aren't required to have been under your control continuously since the beginning of your most recent turn.

![Skithiryx, the Blight Dragon](https://media.wizards.com/2020/2xm/en_yxKcgyh7So.png)


Skithiryx, the Blight Dragon  

{3}{B}{B}  

Legendary Creature — Dragon Skeleton  

4/4  

Flying  

Infect *(This creature deals damage to creatures in the form of -1/-1 counters and to players in the form of poison counters.)*  

{B}: Skithiryx, the Blight Dragon gains haste until end of turn.  

{B}{B}: Regenerate Skithiryx.


* Damage that a creature with infect deals doesn't result in damage being marked on a creature or a player losing life. Instead, it results in that many -1/-1 counters being put on that creature or that many poison counters being given to that player. Damage dealt to planeswalkers still results in that planeswalker losing that many loyalty counters.
* A player who has ten or more poison counters loses the game. This is a state-based action.
* The -1/-1 counters remain on the creature indefinitely. They're not removed if the creature regenerates or the turn ends.
* Damage from a source with infect is damage in all respects. If the source with infect also has lifelink, damage dealt by that source also causes its controller to gain that much life. Damage from a source with infect can be prevented or redirected. Abilities that trigger on damage being dealt will trigger if a source with infect deals damage, if appropriate.

![Skullmulcher](https://media.wizards.com/2020/2xm/en_kRAMpuaV2p.png)


Skullmulcher  

{4}{G}  

Creature — Elemental  

3/3  

Devour 1 *(As this enters the battlefield, you may sacrifice any number of creatures. This creature enters the battlefield with that many +1/+1 counters on it.)*  

When Skullmulcher enters the battlefield, draw a card for each creature it devoured.


* Because devour applies as Skullmulcher enters the battlefield, it can't devour creatures that enter the battlefield at the same time as it.



---

![Sneak Attack](https://media.wizards.com/2020/2xm/en_MPEpy67TCo.png)


Sneak Attack  

{3}{R}  

Enchantment  

{R}: You may put a creature card from your hand onto the battlefield. That creature gains haste. Sacrifice the creature at the beginning of the next end step.


* You sacrifice the creature only if you still control it at end of turn. If that creature has left the battlefield, even if it came back, you don't sacrifice it.

![Spellskite](https://media.wizards.com/2020/2xm/en_z2o7dMHnvD.png)


Spellskite  

{2}  

Artifact Creature — Horror  

0/4  

{u/p}: Change a target of target spell or ability to Spellskite. *({u/p} can be paid with either {U} or 2 life.)*


* You can activate Spellskite's ability even if Spellskite isn't a legal target for the target spell or ability—or even if that spell or ability has no targets. In this case, no targets are changed.
* If Spellskite leaves the battlefield before its ability resolves or otherwise becomes an illegal target for the target spell or ability before its ability resolves, no targets are changed.
* If changing one target of a spell or ability to Spellskite would make other targets of that spell or ability illegal, that target can't be changed to Spellskite.
* If the spell or ability has multiple instances of the word "target," you choose which one target you're changing to Spellskite as Spellskite's ability resolves.
* If a spell or ability has multiple targets but doesn't use the word "target" multiple times, such as the ability of Deepglow Skate, you can only change one of the targets to Spellskite.
* If a spell or ability has a variable number of targets, you can't change the number of targets.

Creature — Giant Warrior  

4/4  

Vigilance  

{1}{W}, {T}: Search your library for an Equipment card and put it onto the battlefield. Attach it to a creature you control. Then shuffle your library.


* Stonehewer Giant's ability doesn't target a creature. However, the creature must be able to be legally equipped by the Equipment. For example, you could attach the Equipment to a creature with shroud, but not to one with protection from artifacts.
* If there is no legal creature for you to attach the Equipment to, it remains on the battlefield unattached.

Strength of Arms  

{W}  

Instant  

Target creature gets +2/+2 until end of turn. If you control an Equipment, create a 1/1 white Human Soldier creature token.


* You'll create a Human Soldier token if you control any Equipment, not just one attached to the target creature, or even to any creature at all.
* You'll create only one token, no matter how many Equipment you control beyond the first.
* The Human Soldier token that you'll create can't be the target to get +2/+2.

Sundering Titan  

{8}  

Artifact Creature — Golem  

7/10  

When Sundering Titan enters the battlefield or leaves the battlefield, choose a land of each basic land type, then destroy those lands.


* Sundering Titan's ability isn't targeted. When it resolves, Sundering Titan's controller must choose one land for each basic land type (Plains, Island, Swamp, Mountain, and Forest), and then they are destroyed simultaneously.
* Players can't take actions in between the time you choose the lands and the time you destroy them. Notably, they can't activate mana abilities of those lands.
* If one of the basic land types isn't present, it isn't chosen. If the only land of a certain type is one you control, you must choose it.
* If a land has more than one basic land type, it can be chosen more than once.

Artifact — Equipment

Equip {3}


* You can't pay the cost of unattaching Sunforger unless Sunforger is attached to a creature.
* If you cast a spell "without paying its mana cost," you can't choose to cast it for any alternative costs. You can, however, pay additional costs. If the card has any mandatory additional costs, those must be paid to cast the spell.
* If a spell has {X} in its mana cost, you must choose 0 as the value of X when casting it without paying its mana cost.

Supernatural Stamina  

{B}  

Instant  

Until end of turn, target creature gets +2/+0 and gains "When this creature dies, return it to the battlefield tapped under its owner's control."


* Supernatural Stamina's effect works only once. If the target creature dies and is then returned to the battlefield, it's considered to be a new creature. If that new creature dies, it won't come back a second time.

![Surge Node](https://media.wizards.com/2020/2xm/en_9MYpf3gdh3.png)


Surge Node  

{1}  

Artifact  

Surge Node enters the battlefield with six charge counters on it.  

{1}, {T}, Remove a charge counter from Surge Node: Put a charge counter on target artifact.


* Surge Node can be the target of its own activated ability. Because it doesn't "move" a counter, the ability will remove a counter from Surge Node and then put one onto it.
* Once Surge Node has run out of charge counters, it remains on the battlefield.

Sword of Feast and Famine  

{3}  

Artifact — Equipment  

Equipped creature gets +2/+2 and has protection from black and from green.  

Whenever equipped creature deals combat damage to a player, that player discards a card and you untap all lands you control.  

Equip {2}


* You'll untap all lands you control even if the player can't discard a card.
* You can tap your lands for mana while the triggered ability is on the stack. However, you'll lose any mana you produce this way if you don't spend it before the end of the current combat damage step.

Sword of Fire and Ice  

{3}  

Artifact — Equipment  

Equipped creature gets +2/+2 and has protection from red and from blue.  

Whenever equipped creature deals combat damage to a player, Sword of Fire and Ice deals 2 damage to any target and you draw a card.  

Equip {2}


* If the chosen target is an illegal target by the time the triggered ability tries to resolve, the ability won't resolve. You won't draw a card.



---

![Sword of Light and Shadow](https://media.wizards.com/2020/2xm/en_tqzxF9TNmE.png)


Sword of Light and Shadow  

{3}  

Artifact — Equipment  

Equipped creature gets +2/+2 and has protection from white and from black.  

Whenever equipped creature deals combat damage to a player, you gain 3 life and you may return up to one target creature card from your graveyard to your hand.  

Equip {2}


* If you choose a target creature card in your graveyard and that card is an illegal target by the time the triggered ability tries to resolve, the ability won't resolve. You won't gain 3 life. If you don't choose a target at all, you just gain 3 life.
* The triggered ability can target a creature card that was put into your graveyard as a result of state-based actions immediately after the combat damage that caused the ability to trigger.



---

![Sword of the Meek](https://media.wizards.com/2020/2xm/en_4lLw553DzL.png)


Sword of the Meek  

{2}  

Artifact — Equipment  

Equipped creature gets +1/+2.  

Equip {2}  

Whenever a 1/1 creature enters the battlefield under your control, you may return Sword of the Meek from your graveyard to the battlefield, then attach it to that creature.


* Sword of the Meek's last ability triggers only if it's in your graveyard immediately after the 1/1 creature enters the battlefield.
* If a creature is entering the battlefield under your control, consider static abilities to determine whether its power and toughness are both 1. Spells, activated abilities, and triggered abilities can't be used to raise or lower the creature's power and toughness in time to have the last ability trigger or to stop it from triggering.
* Once the last ability has triggered, changing the power or toughness of the creature won't stop you from returning Sword of the Meek and attaching it to the creature.
* Any creature can be equipped with Sword of the Meek, not just 1/1 creatures.
* If Sword of the Meek can't be attached to the creature that caused its last ability to trigger, most likely because that creature has left the battlefield, Sword of the Meek returns to the battlefield and remains unattached.

![Sylvan Might](https://media.wizards.com/2020/2xm/en_XTPqGASN0w.png)


Sylvan Might  

{1}{G}  

Instant  

Target creature gets +2/+2 and gains trample until end of turn.  

Flashback {2}{G}{G} *(You may cast this card from your graveyard for its flashback cost. Then exile it.)*


* To determine the total cost of a spell, start with the mana cost or alternative cost (such as a flashback cost) you're paying, add any cost increases, then apply any cost reductions. The converted mana cost of the spell remains unchanged, no matter what the total cost to cast it was.
* A spell cast using flashback will always be exiled afterward, whether it resolves, is countered, or leaves the stack in some other way.



---

![Tempered Steel](https://media.wizards.com/2020/2xm/en_n0XrI0iX1a.png)


Tempered Steel  

{1}{W}{W}  

Enchantment  

Artifact creatures you control get +2/+2.


* Because damage remains marked on a creature until the damage is removed as the turn ends, nonlethal damage dealt to artifact creatures you control may become lethal if Tempered Steel leaves the battlefield during that turn.



---

![Temur Battle Rage](https://media.wizards.com/2020/2xm/en_ceE3MOE55x.png)


Temur Battle Rage  

{1}{R}  

Instant  

Target creature gains double strike until end of turn. *(It deals both first-strike and regular combat damage.)*  
*Ferocious* — That creature also gains trample until end of turn if you control a creature with power 4 or greater.


* Temur Battle Rage checks whether you control a creature with power 4 or greater as it resolves. If you do, the target creature has trample until end of turn even if you no longer control a creature with power 4 or greater later in the turn.
* If an attacking creature with double strike and trample destroys all of its blocking creatures with first-strike combat damage, all of its normal combat damage is assigned to the player or planeswalker that creature's attacking.

![Thought Reflection](https://media.wizards.com/2020/2xm/en_iuK6yrVQ2I.png)


Thought Reflection  

{4}{U}{U}{U}  

Enchantment  

If you would draw a card, draw two cards instead.


* If a spell or ability causes you to draw multiple cards, Thought Reflection's effect doubles each card draw. For example, if you cast Harmonize ("Draw three cards"), you'll draw six cards.
* The effects of multiple Thought Reflections are cumulative. For example, if you have two Thought Reflections on the battlefield, you'll draw four times the original number of cards. If you have three, you'll draw eight times the number of cards, and so on.
* If two or more replacement effects would apply to a card-drawing event, the player who's drawing the card chooses what order to apply them.

![Throne of Geth](https://media.wizards.com/2020/2xm/en_cuNxTzbeOj.png)


Throne of Geth  

{2}  

Artifact  

{T}, Sacrifice an artifact: Proliferate. *(Choose any number of permanents and/or players, then give each another counter of each kind already there.)*


* You may sacrifice Throne of Geth to pay the cost of its own ability.
* You can choose any permanent that has a counter, including ones controlled by opponents. You can't choose cards in any zone other than the battlefield, even if they have counters on them.
* You don't have to choose every permanent or player that has a counter, only the ones you want to add another counter to. Since "any number" includes zero, you don't have to choose any permanents at all, and you don't have to choose any players at all.
* Players can respond to the spell or ability whose effect includes proliferating. Once that spell or ability starts to resolve, however, and its controller chooses which permanents and players will get new counters, it's too late for anyone to respond.
* Putting loyalty counters on planeswalkers doesn't cause their loyalty abilities to be activated.

![Topple the Statue](https://media.wizards.com/2020/2xm/en_QXJZX1EgSJ.png)


Topple the Statue  

{2}{W}  

Instant  

Tap target permanent. If it's an artifact, destroy it.  

Draw a card.


* Topple the Statue can target any permanent, even one that's already tapped.
* If Topple the Statue targets an artifact, that artifact will be tapped if it's untapped, and then it'll be destroyed. Any abilities that trigger as it becomes tapped do so and will resolve after Topple the Statue has finished resolving.
* If the target permanent is an illegal target when Topple the Statue tries to resolve, it doesn't resolve. You won't draw a card. If the target is legal but isn't tapped, isn't destroyed, or is neither tapped nor destroyed, you do draw a card.



---

![Toxic Deluge](https://media.wizards.com/2020/2xm/en_gh3CqkZFjR.png)


Toxic Deluge  

{2}{B}  

Sorcery  

As an additional cost to cast this spell, pay X life.  

All creatures get -X/-X until end of turn.


* If you cast Toxic Deluge without paying its mana cost, you'll still choose a value for X and pay X life. This is because it doesn't have {X} in its mana cost.
* All creatures on the battlefield when Toxic Deluge resolves are affected. Ones that enter the battlefield or become creatures later in the turn are not.

![Trash for Treasure](https://media.wizards.com/2020/2xm/en_Er8QlZB1UQ.png)

As an additional cost to cast this spell, sacrifice an artifact.

Treasure Keeper  

{4}  

Artifact Creature — Construct  

3/3  

When Treasure Keeper dies, reveal cards from the top of your library until you reveal a nonland card with converted mana cost 3 or less. You may cast that card without paying its mana cost. Put all revealed cards not cast this way on the bottom of your library in a random order.


* If you don't cast the nonland card with converted mana cost 3 or less, it'll be put on the bottom of your library in a random order with the other cards.
* If your library has no nonland cards in it with converted mana cost 3 or less, you'll reveal all the cards in your library, then put them back in a random order.
* If a card in a player's library has {X} in its mana cost, X is considered to be 0.
* If you cast a spell "without paying its mana cost," you can't choose to cast it for any alternative costs. You can, however, pay additional costs. If the card has any mandatory additional costs, those must be paid to cast the spell.
* If a spell has {X} in its mana cost, you must choose 0 as the value of X when casting it without paying its mana cost.

When Treasure Mage enters the battlefield, you may search your library for an artifact card with converted mana cost 6 or greater, reveal it, put it into your hand, then shuffle your library.

![Trinisphere](https://media.wizards.com/2020/2xm/en_S6LAF3LEHU.png)


Trinisphere  

{3}  

Artifact  

As long as Trinisphere is untapped, each spell that would cost less than three mana to cast costs three mana to cast. *(Additional mana in the cost may be paid with any color of mana or colorless mana. For example, a spell that would cost {1}{B} to cast costs {2}{B} to cast instead.)*


* To determine the total cost of a spell, start with the mana cost or alternative cost you're paying, add any cost increases, then apply any cost reductions. Finally, apply Trinisphere's effect if the mana component of the spell's cost is less than three mana. The converted mana cost of the spell remains unchanged, no matter what the total cost to cast it was.
* If Trinisphere leaves the battlefield or becomes tapped or untapped as a cost to cast a spell, this cost is paid after you've locked in the total cost.

![Ulvenwald Mysteries](https://media.wizards.com/2020/2xm/en_0VioyXXmSm.png)


Ulvenwald Mysteries  

{2}{G}  

Enchantment  

Whenever a nontoken creature you control dies, investigate. *(Create a colorless Clue artifact token with "{2}, Sacrifice this artifact: Draw a card.")*  

Whenever you sacrifice a Clue, create a 1/1 white Human Soldier creature token.


* If a nontoken creature dies at the same time as Ulvenwald Mysteries, the first ability triggers.
* The last ability is a triggered ability, not an activated ability. It doesn't allow you to sacrifice a Clue whenever you want; rather, you need some other way of sacrificing it, such as the activated ability that Clue tokens have.
* If you sacrifice a Clue as part of casting a spell or activating an ability, the last ability will resolve before that spell or ability.



---

![Unlicensed Disintegration](https://media.wizards.com/2020/2xm/en_h26H1HBtWo.png)


Unlicensed Disintegration  

{1}{B}{R}  

Instant  

Destroy target creature. If you control an artifact, Unlicensed Disintegration deals 3 damage to that creature's controller.


* If the target creature is an illegal target by the time Unlicensed Disintegration tries to resolve, the spell won't resolve. It won't deal damage to any player. If the target is legal but not destroyed (most likely because it has indestructible), its controller is dealt 3 damage.
* Whether or not you control an artifact is checked only after the creature is destroyed while Unlicensed Disintegration is resolving. For example, if you destroy a Fairgrounds Warden that exiled your artifact creature, Unlicensed Disintegration deals 3 damage to Fairgrounds Warden's controller.



---

![Valor in Akros](https://media.wizards.com/2020/2xm/en_vod62orZPj.png)


Valor in Akros  

{3}{W}  

Enchantment  

Whenever a creature enters the battlefield under your control, creatures you control get +1/+1 until end of turn.


* Valor in Akros's ability affects only creatures you control at the time the ability resolves, including the creature that caused it to trigger. Creatures you begin to control later in the turn won't get +1/+1.

![Vengevine](https://media.wizards.com/2020/2xm/en_E5CS3bqFiM.png)


Vengevine  

{2}{G}{G}  

Creature — Elemental  

4/3  

Haste  

Whenever you cast a spell, if it's the second creature spell you cast this turn, you may return Vengevine from your graveyard to the battlefield.


* An ability that triggers when a player casts a spell resolves before the spell that caused it to trigger. It resolves even if that spell is countered.
* Vengevine's triggered ability works only if Vengevine is already in your graveyard as you finish casting your second creature spell in a turn and if it remains there until the triggered ability resolves.
* Vengevine's triggered ability checks the spells you cast over the course of the entire turn, not just the ones you cast while Vengevine is in your graveyard. For example, if you cast a creature spell, then Vengevine is put into your graveyard, then you cast another creature spell, Vengevine's ability triggers.
* Vengevine's ability triggers only for the second creature spell you cast in a turn. It won't trigger for the third, fourth, or so on. It also doesn't matter how many noncreature spells you cast in a turn; the ability counts only the creature spells.

![Vexing Shusher](https://media.wizards.com/2020/2xm/en_cSOKkYEg81.png)


Vexing Shusher  

{r/g}{r/g}  

Creature — Goblin Shaman  

2/2  

This spell can't be countered.  

{r/g}: Target spell can't be countered.


* A spell or ability that counters spells can still target spells that can't be countered. When that spell or ability resolves, the uncounterable spell won't be countered, but any additional effects of the countering spell or ability will still happen.

Vish Kal, Blood Arbiter  

{4}{W}{B}{B}  

Legendary Creature — Vampire  

5/5  

Flying, lifelink  

Sacrifice a creature: Put X +1/+1 counters on Vish Kal, Blood Arbiter, where X is the sacrificed creature's power.  

Remove all +1/+1 counters from Vish Kal: Target creature gets -1/-1 until end of turn for each +1/+1 counter removed this way.


* Use the sacrificed creature's power as it last existed on the battlefield to determine how many +1/+1 counters to put on Vish Kal.
* Vish Kal's last ability doesn't deal damage. It doesn't cause you to gain any life from its lifelink ability.



---

![Voice of Resurgence](https://media.wizards.com/2020/2xm/en_a0m74EFVxG.png)


Voice of Resurgence  

{G}{W}  

Creature — Elemental  

2/2  

Whenever an opponent casts a spell during your turn or when Voice of Resurgence dies, create a green and white Elemental creature token with "This creature's power and toughness are each equal to the number of creatures you control."


* An ability that triggers when a player casts a spell resolves before the spell that caused it to trigger. It resolves even if that spell is countered.
* The power and toughness of the token change as the number of creatures you control changes. The token's ability counts itself, so it'll be at least 1/1.



---

![Walking Ballista](https://media.wizards.com/2020/2xm/en_DfMjCYafuJ.png)


Walking Ballista  

{X}{X}  

Artifact Creature — Construct  

0/0  

Walking Ballista enters the battlefield with X +1/+1 counters on it.  

{4}: Put a +1/+1 counter on Walking Ballista.  

Remove a +1/+1 counter from Walking Ballista: It deals 1 damage to any target.


* A casting cost of {X}{X} means that you pay twice X. If you want X to be 3, you pay {6} to cast Walking Ballista.
* If Walking Ballista has been dealt damage or had its toughness reduced by an effect, this limits how many times you'll be able to remove +1/+1 counters from it in a single turn. For example, if it has three +1/+1 counters on it and has been dealt 1 damage this turn, it will be destroyed immediately after you activate the ability a second time and you won't be able to activate it a third time.



---

![Weapon Surge](https://media.wizards.com/2020/2xm/en_2kVckiD3gl.png)


Weapon Surge  

{R}  

Instant  

Target creature you control gets +1/+0 and gains first strike until end of turn.  

Overload {1}{R} *(You may cast this spell for its overload cost. If you do, change its text by replacing all instances of "target" with "each.")*


* If you don't pay the overload cost of Weapon Surge, that spell will have a single target. If you pay the overload cost, the spell won't have any targets.
* Because a spell with overload doesn't target when its overload cost is paid, it may affect permanents with shroud or with protection from the appropriate color.
* To determine the total cost of a spell, start with the mana cost or alternative cost you're paying (such as an overload cost), add any cost increases, then apply any cost reductions. The converted mana cost of the spell remains unchanged, no matter what the total cost to cast it was.
* If you are instructed to cast a spell with overload "without paying its mana cost," you can't choose to pay its overload cost instead.



---

![Weapons Trainer](https://media.wizards.com/2020/2xm/en_SD3ekN6YgU.png)


Weapons Trainer  

{R}{W}  

Creature — Human Soldier Ally  

3/2  

Other creatures you control get +1/+0 as long as you control an Equipment.


* Weapons Trainer's ability gives just +1/+0, no matter how many Equipment you control beyond the first.
* Weapons Trainer's ability applies even if the Equipment you control isn't attached to any creature.

![Woodland Champion](https://media.wizards.com/2020/2xm/en_jmAXDSNuzC.png)


Woodland Champion  

{1}{G}  

Creature — Elf Scout  

2/2  

Whenever one or more tokens enter the battlefield under your control, put that many +1/+1 counters on Woodland Champion.


* The number of +1/+1 counters you put on Woodland Champion is the number of tokens that entered the battlefield under your control, even if some or all of them leave the battlefield before the triggered ability resolves.



---

![Wound Reflection](https://media.wizards.com/2020/2xm/en_gJNQTwTxCY.png)


Wound Reflection  

{5}{B}  

Enchantment  

At the beginning of each end step, each opponent loses life equal to the life they lost this turn. *(Damage causes loss of life.)*


* When Wound Reflection's ability resolves, it checks how much life each opponent lost over the course of the turn, then it causes that opponent to lose that much life. It doesn't matter how the opponent lost life or who caused it. It also doesn't matter if Wound Reflection wasn't on the battlefield at the time some or all of the life was lost.
* Wound Reflection's ability checks only whether life was lost. It doesn't care whether life was also gained. For example, if an opponent lost 4 life and gained 6 life during the turn, that player will have a higher life total than they started the turn with but Wound Reflection's ability will still cause that player to lose 4 life.
* If Wound Reflection's ability resolves, then an opponent loses life later in the same turn, that life loss is never counted by Wound Reflection.
* Multiple Wound Reflections each trigger separately. For example, if an opponent lost 1 life, the first one's triggered ability to resolve causes them to lose another 1 life. Since they've now lost 2 life, the next triggered ability causes them to lose 2 life, and the next 4, and so on.
