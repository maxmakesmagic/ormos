Last weekend was a break in the Grand Prix action, but players aspiring to play on the Pro Tour had plenty of PTQs to attend. The format, *Khans of Tarkir* Limited, has had a few weeks in the spotlight, and we're nearing the finals weeks for you to earn your invitation to compete at [Pro Tour *Fate Reforged*](http://magic.wizards.com/en/content/event-information-pro-tour-fate-reforged) in Washington, DC, from February 6â€“8, 2015.


While we finish up the last month of PTQs for this season, there are still plenty of invitations to the Pro Tour to win. [Be sure to find a PTQ near you](http://magic.wizards.com/en/protour/qualifierlist) and we hope to see you in Washington, DC in February!
