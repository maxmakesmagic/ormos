This round we have two Italians in the Pit. On this table two Pro Tour Veterans: Dato facing off against Pro-Tour Lin-Sivvi Champion Eskeland. On the other table crowd favorite – well, when we get a crowd in here - Sam Gomersall against Stefano Fiore.

### Game 1

![Careful Study](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Careful+Study)Dato stared at his starting hand for a few moments before deciding to keep it. Although it was brilliant for UG, it wasn't actually bad. He played a first turn Rootwalla and Sigurd announced the mirror with a first turn [Careful Study](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Careful+Study), discarding his own Rootwalla.[Quiet Speculation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Quiet+Speculation) gave Federico two Analysis and one [Roar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Roar). Eskeland played [Mongrel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mongrel). A Flashbacked Analysis failed to give Dato his third land, showing his opponent the trouble he was in. The Italian Rootwalla chump-blocked the Nordic one and a second Rootwalla for Eskeland dropped Dato to eleven.

With the game quickly running out of control, Dato tried a desperate [Wild Mongrel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Mongrel) but Sigurd had the backbreaking [Circular Logic](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Circular+Logic).

Sigurd 1-0 Federico.

Sigurd: "These mirror matches are very stupid. It's always about how draws the best cards."

### Game 2

This time it was Sigurd's turn to think long and hard about his starting hand. He eventually mulliganed. Dato started with [Careful Study](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Careful+Study) discarding [Wonder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wonder) and [Roar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Roar). When he followed that with a turn two [Mongrel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mongrel) and a turn three [Stupefying Touch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stupefying+Touch) on Sigurd's [Mongrel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mongrel) it seemed clear who had the initial upper hand.

![Aquamoeba](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Aquamoeba)The Norwegian played [Aquamoeba](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aquamoeba) and they started checking "cards in hand" ([Mongrel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mongrel)s squaring off have a tendency to do that). Dato sent his dog in and pumped out [Arrogant Wurm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arrogant+Wurm). Unable to safely attack Eskeland took the time to play a second [Mongrel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mongrel) and [Merfolk Looter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Merfolk+Looter).Afraid of the Looter Federico gave it a [Stupefying Touch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stupefying+Touch), and sent the [Arrogant Wurm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arrogant+Wurm) in before played his own [Aquamoeba](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aquamoeba). Eskeland sent his "untouched" [Mongrel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mongrel) in but decided not to pump it when Dato declared "no blocks".

The [Arrogant Wurm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arrogant+Wurm) waltzed into the virtual Red Zone , taking [Wild Mongrel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Mongrel) with it, dropping Sigurd to six. The [Roar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Roar) joined the party but it was too late. Sigurd Eskeland drew one more card, shrugged and scooped.

Sigurd 1-1 Dato.

### Game 3

For a chance, no one had a first turn play. To compensate, they both had second turn [Wild Mongrel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Mongrel)s. Sigurd discarded [Wonder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wonder) and Dato answered with his own [Wonder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wonder). The [Mongrel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mongrel)s clashed in the skies.

Sigurd discarded [Roar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Roar) and Dato answered by discarding Analysis and [Unsummon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Unsummon). Sigurd lost [City of Brass](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=City+of+Brass) and Federico Dato again upped the ante with a second [Unsummon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Unsummon).

![Quiet Speculation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Quiet+Speculation)Eskeland's dog bit the dust, but he was happy to replace with [Merfolk Looter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Merfolk+Looter). Dato sent his dog in and flashed the Analysis finding more spells. The Norwegian flashed his [Roar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Roar) to stop the [Mongrel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mongrel).Facing the huge monster and with two [Unsummon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Unsummon)s already in the graveyard, Dato had to pass the turn. Eskeland played [Phantom Centaur](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phantom+Centaur) and Federico answered with end of turn Rootwalla and [Arrogant Wurm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arrogant+Wurm). On his turn he played a second [Mongrel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mongrel) and [Aquamoeba](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aquamoeba), clearly hoping to swarm around Eskeland's colossus (not an easy task when your opponent is at eighteen with an active Looter).

The huge Norwegian used [Quiet Speculation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Quiet+Speculation) to find two [Roar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Roar)s and Reclamation. Things were getting uglier for the Italian by the second. The Reclamation got rid of the [Wonder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wonder) and suddenly the skies belonged solely to the Nordic PT champion.

Dato weighted in his chances and sent the whole crew in. The Centaur ate up [Arrogant Wurm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arrogant+Wurm), two Rootwallas traded and two [Mongrel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mongrel)s brought Eskeland down to thirteen. But it was too little, too late. Sigurd untapped and sent his team in. Just enough to deal the final ten points of damage.

**Final Result:** Sigurd 2-1 Federico.
