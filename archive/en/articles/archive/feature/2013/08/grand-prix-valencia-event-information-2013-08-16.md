There are plenty of clubs and bars that you can visit should you want a break from flopping cards plus the Spanish climate, hospitality and, of course, food. But we hope that there will be enough inside the event hall to keep you entertained. Not only will you be able to win great prizes but you'll also have a chance to win a slot in the coveted Super Sunday Series.

**Tournament Structure** 


* Modified Swiss-style (50-minute rounds).

* For the first game of each match in the Top 8, the player that finished higher in the Swiss rounds chooses either to play first or to play second. For subsequent games in each Top 8 match, the usual Play/Draw rule applies (loser of the previous game decides whether to play first in the next game).

(For Grand Prix Valencia, the cutoff date will be November 6.) Points earned in tournaments held at the Grand Prix event site do not count toward earned byes at that Grand Prix. Byes will be given to players in the Grand Prix based on the following criteria:
