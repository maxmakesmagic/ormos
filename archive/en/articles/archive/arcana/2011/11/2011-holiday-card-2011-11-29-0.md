The first four (Fruitcake Elemental, Gifts Given, Evil Presents, and Season's Beatings) are [here](/en/articles/archive/wallpapers-week-holiday-cards-2009-12-11), and last year's card (Snow Mercy) is [here](/en/articles/archive/wallpaper-week-snow-mercy-2010-12-17). And this year's is, well, *here*.
