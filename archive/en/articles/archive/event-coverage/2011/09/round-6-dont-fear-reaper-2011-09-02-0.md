Jeremy Neeman vs. Sebastian Thaler (Draft)
------------------------------------------


[Owen Turtenwald vs. David Williams](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/eventcoverage/ptphi11/fm7)


2006 Rookie of the Year Sebastian Thaler and Pro Tour San Juan Top 8 competitor Jeremy Neeman both sat at 5-0 on the backs of their Modern Constructed performances heading into the first of three rounds of ***Magic*** *2012* booster draft. Which of these two players would continue his winning ways?


 


### Game One


Thaler won the die roll and decided to play first, and started the match with a [Phantasmal Bear](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phantasmal+Bear) on turn one. Neeman only had a [Swamp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swamp) on his turn. Thaler attacked with [Phantasmal Bear](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phantasmal+Bear), which brought Neeman down to 18. [Ponder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ponder) and a second land rounded out Thaler's turn. Neeman played his second [Swamp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swamp) and used [Consume Spirit](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Consume+Spirit) for zero to target the [Phantasmal Bear](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phantasmal+Bear). Thaler sacrificed the Bear, and Neeman passed the turn. Thaler had a third land and an [Auramancer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Auramancer) to resume the pressure, while [Sacred Wolf](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sacred+Wolf) was Neeman's third-turn play. Thaler attacked with [Auramancer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Auramancer) which dropped Neeman to 16 life. Thaler then played [Solemn Simulacrum](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Solemn+Simulacrum) to bring his land count up to five.

*Sebastian Thaler and Jeremy Neeman face off in the first round of ***Magic** 2012* Draft.*

Neeman left his Wolf back to play defense alongside his newly played [Runeclaw Bear](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Runeclaw+Bear). Thaler summoned an [Æther Adept](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=%C3%86ther+Adept) to bounce [Runeclaw Bear](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Runeclaw+Bear) then attacked Neeman down to 12. Neeman went for a [Doom Blade](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Doom+Blade) on Thaler's [Æther Adept](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=%C3%86ther+Adept) during his main phase, but [Mana Leak](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak) from Thaler protected the Wizard. Neeman used his last to untapped lands to recast [Runeclaw Bear](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Runeclaw+Bear). Thaler's next turn only included an attack with all three of his creatures. Neeman blocked [Æther Adept](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=%C3%86ther+Adept) with [Runeclaw Bear](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Runeclaw+Bear) and dropped to 10 life. Neeman's turn was less impressive as he laid an [Onyx Mage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Onyx+Mage). Thaler had a much better use of his mana on his following turn, as he cast a [Sun Titan](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sun+Titan). [Sun Titan](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sun+Titan) brought back [Æther Adept](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=%C3%86ther+Adept), which in turn bounced Neeman's [Onyx Mage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Onyx+Mage). Neeman realized that the [Sun Titan](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sun+Titan) would be too much for him to handle and conceded.


Thaler 1, Neeman 0


 


### Game Two


Neeman decided to play first and mulliganed to six cards. Thaler kept his opening seven cards.


Neeman opened with a [Swamp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swamp), while Thaler started with [Island](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island) and [Phantasmal Bear](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phantasmal+Bear). Neeman only laying a [Swamp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swamp) on turn two meant that Thaler could attack with his [Phantasmal Bear](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phantasmal+Bear). Neeman dropped to 18 life, and Thaler added [Coral Merfolk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Coral+Merfolk) to the battlefield. Neeman played his third land, a [Forest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest), and used [Arachnus Web](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arachnus+Web) to trigger [Phantasmal Bear](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phantasmal+Bear)'s sacrifice ability. Thaler enchanted [Coral Merfolk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Coral+Merfolk) with [Divine Favor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Divine+Favor) and attacked. The life totals now stood at 23 to 15 in Thaler's favor. Neeman dropped a [Cemetery Reaper](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cemetery+Reaper) and a [Forest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest) on the next turn.

*Neeman puts the **Magic** fingers to work.*

Thaler, still only with two lands on the battlefield, attacked Neeman down to 12 and played [Gideon's Lawkeeper](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gideon%27s+Lawkeeper). Neeman laid a land and passed the turn with mana available to activate [Cemetery Reaper](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cemetery+Reaper). Thaler continued his assault with his [Coral Merfolk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Coral+Merfolk) enchanted by [Divine Favor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Divine+Favor). Neeman sat at 9 life and Thaler found his third land of the game. At the end of the turn, Neeman created a Zombie token with [Cemetery Reaper](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cemetery+Reaper). Neeman declared his attack which prompted Thaler to tap the Zombie token. [Cemetery Reaper](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cemetery+Reaper) attacked Thaler down to 21 while [Tormented Soul](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tormented+Soul) and [Devouring Swarm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Devouring+Swarm) joined Neeman's forces. Thaler attacked with his Merfolk. Neeman blocked with [Devouring Swarm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Devouring+Swarm) and sacrificed [Tormented Soul](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tormented+Soul) and his Zombie token to pump the Swarm.

*Thaler keeps pushing.*

After both creatures died, Thaler used [Auramancer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Auramancer) to retrieve the [Divine Favor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Divine+Favor) that had enchanted the Merfolk. Neeman played a [Swamp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swamp) before ending his turn. At the end of Neeman's turn, Thaler tapped the [Cemetery Reaper](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cemetery+Reaper), which forced Neeman to create a Zombie token then instead of on Thaler's turn. Thaler drew an [Aven Fleetwing](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aven+Fleetwing). That, combined, with [Divine Favor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Divine+Favor) would make short work of Neeman's remaining 9 life. Neeman's last winning effort was to try to race the Fleetwing with a [Carnage Wurm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Carnage+Wurm), but Thaler used [Gideon Jura](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Gideon%2BJura)'s [Lawbringer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lawbringer) to keep the Wurm at bay while he finished Neeman off through the air.


Sebastian Thaler defeats Jeremy Neeman to move on to 6-0 at Pro Tour Philadelphia.
