**Game One** 


In this classic matchup between Mono-Blue Devotion and Mono-Black Devotion, Nam swiftly clinched Game One before I could even get seated. After going down to five cards, McGlaughlin found himself facing one of the most dreaded openings his opponent could present in Standard.

After duplicating some rodents, McGlaughlin reached for his sideboard and Nam was up one Game just like that.

**Game Two**
McGlaughlin retaliated in Game two, opening aggressively with triple [Cloudfin Raptor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloudfin+Raptor) and double [Judge's Familiar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Judge%27s+Familiar). However, Nam did what the Mono-Black Devotion deck ought to be doing and led with [Thoughtseize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtseize) and [Pack Rat](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pack+Rat) once again.


With two [Mutavault](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mutavault)s on his side, there was a good chance Nam could outrace McGlaughlin's flyers. Nam made a copy of [Pack Rat](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pack+Rat), and then another. Suddenly, McGlaughlin was facing a horde of 5/5s when turn 5 rolled around, and offered the handshake soon after.
