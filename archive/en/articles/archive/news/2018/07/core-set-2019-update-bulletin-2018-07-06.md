Hello, everybody! The return of the core set marks the return of the smorgasbord of rules and Oracle changes. We've got lots of random little updates coming out with this set, plus the changes from *Battlebond* and *Global Series: Jiang Yanggu & Mu Yanling*. We've got Pangolins playing, coin flips flipping, and a whole new bunch of words about the words below the words on cards!


You can find the [Comprehensive Rules here](http://magic.wizards.com/en/game-info/gameplay/rules-and-formats/rules) on our website, and Oracle text updated in [Gatherer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/)â€”at this time, one or both of those might not be updated just yet, so I'm describing a general truth here. Keep in mind that this article was written before the rules changes were finalized in editing, so there may be minor deviations from what I describe below.
