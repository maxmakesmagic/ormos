Jacob Van Lunen began playing Magic in 1995. He has participated in organized play at every level of competition and was a member of the winning team at Pro Tour San Diego in 2007, thanks to an innovative draft strategy. As a writer, Van Lunen has had more than three hundred Magic strategy pieces published 





Canada has established itself as powerhouse of Magic over the last few years. Last year, I spent a few weekends in Canada and invariably heard [22] Alexander Hayne’s name when I asked about their Magic community and why it’s grown at such a tremendous rate. Alexander Hayne has been the King of the North for quite some time at this point. Hayne led his country into The World Magic Cup way back in 2012 after winning Pro Tour Avacyn Restored. Then, last year, Hayne won a WMCQ after narrowly missing captainship.



Others like Jon Stern and Shaun McLaren have had their share of success, but Hayne’s jovial attitude to the game combined with his tremendous skill have made him a household name amongst Magic players all over the world, and especially so in Canada.



More recently, we’ve seen a new Canadian rising to the occasion. Pascal Maynard dreamed of Pro Tour glory, poured every ounce of himself into the game last season, and, after a seemingly endless string of disappointing finishes, fell short of his goal. Having given it his best, Maynard hung up the wand and retreated back to playing locally. Grand Prix Ottawa was a close drive, so Maynard decided to make the trek with a few friends. After fifteen rounds of swiss, he found himself in his first Grand Prix Top 8 in over a year. The fever was back and Maynard booked a ticket to Grand Prix Omaha. Another fifteen rounds of swiss later and he found himself in his second Top 8 in as many tournaments. Then, just a few weeks later, Maynard went to Mexico City and won the whole tournament. Maynard became one of the few players to ever Top 8 three Grand Prix events in a row and the only player to ever achieve this tremendous feat in the modern era of massive Grand Prix events around the globe. Since then, Maynard has continued having reasonable success and proved that his hat trick was no fluke. His recent finishes even include a Top 8 at Grand Prix Las Vegas, the largest Magic tournament of all time.

It seems like it would be safe to assume that Maynard would be a favorite in the race for Canada’s National Champion, but he’s found a challenger ready to reestablish themselves as The King of the North.



Alexander Hayne is as dangerous as he’s ever been and he’s in fighting shape as we enter the final stretch before the end of the Pro Tour season. Maynard seemed to be a solid lock for Canadian National Champion, but Hayne starting chopping away at the lead over the last couple months. It started with a Top 8 in Vancouver, then Krakow, then another in Atlantic City. Those finishes, combined with strong records at Pro Tours, have put Hayne back in the lead despite Maynard’s unprecedented run.



Hayne flew to Singapore this weekend with the expectation of further establishing his newfound lead. Maynard wasn’t going to roll over and lose that easily, though. Instead of fighting the dragon head on, Maynard made his way here to Grand Prix Buenos Aires and is seeking a strong finish that could potentially put him back in the lead for National Champion while simultaneously achieving Gold in the Pro Players Club.



Will Alexander Hayne further cement his lead in Singapore? Or will Maynard’s trip to South America pay off? This is one of the closest and most exciting races as we approach The World Magic Cup. Follow all the action from Singapore and Buenos Aires right here on dailymtg.com.
