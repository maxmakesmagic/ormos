 Stybs has played Magic the world over, writing and drafting as part of the event coverage team and slinging Commander everywhere his decks will fit. 






While I learned the game—and received a handful of cards—from my friend at school, there was a year or so before I had the opportunity to make my very first *Magic* purchase. I wasn't exactly sure what to get, and this was long before I had fast internet and plenty of ways to see what was out there.


I looked over the booster packs and recognized the names of sets I'd been playing with: *Mirage*, *Visions*, *Fifth Edition*. But it was a larger package that caught my eye. It was purple, with a mean-looking dragon looking back at me underneath a radical set name: *Tempest*.

That box of *Magic* cards was called a "Starter Deck" and sounded *exactly* like what I was doing. I can vividly recall the moment I pulled the wrapper off the box, becoming more engrossed as I read every page of the included "storybook" that pulled me into [the journey of the *Weatherlight* crew on the plane of Rath](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/arcana/tempest-storyboard-2015-04-30).


The exact details and contents are lost from my memory, and so are most of the cards I opened. One of my cards I read multiple times and couldn't fathom how it was remotely useful—[Duplicity](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duplicity)—but another blue card tipped me off to something different going on.


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&multiverseid=4746)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=4746)
"What are Slivers? Do I even have any? Do they all give each other abilities?"


Questions soon became answered as I looked through the cards I'd opened.


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&multiverseid=4772)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=4772)[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&multiverseid=4714)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=4714)
Slivers rightfully earned their enduring popularity by giving you the best of it all: Slivers care about Slivers, grant their abilities to all the rest, and encourage you to build up a deck full of them simply by finding more.


The history of Slivers in *Magic* stretches from their initial appearance on Rath in *Tempest* to the overlay—merging—of Rath onto Dominaria during *Invasion* block, to their revival by Riptide scientists during *Onslaught* block, to their distant descendants surviving as the plane of Dominaria was dying during *Time Spiral*—and beyond.


That harsh environment of a post-apocalyptic Dominaria pushed Slivers to adapt with even stranger abilities from combinations of colors—or was as good a time as any other to design some using enemy color pairs for the first time—and brought a smile to the face of everyone that wanted to see even more.


*Time Spiral Remastered* wouldn't be a true trip to the past without the return of these iconic creatures.

![Firewake Sliver](https://media.wizards.com/2021/tsr/en_ZL49LC20u9.png)![Harmonic Sliver](https://media.wizards.com/2021/tsr/en_Me8l8o9NxF.png)![Necrotic Sliver](https://media.wizards.com/2021/tsr/en_mZs2i8kIDn.png)


These Slivers offer quite a range of abilities. [Firewake Sliver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Firewake+Sliver) and [Harmonic Sliver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Harmonic+Sliver) are nods to the powerful and useful enchantments [Fires of Yavimaya](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fires+of+Yavimaya) and [Aura Shards](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aura+Shards). [Darkheart Sliver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Darkheart+Sliver), too, references [Dark Heart of the Wood](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dark+Heart+of+the+Wood)—which is a little less powerful than [Necrotic Sliver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Necrotic+Sliver) as homage to the sorcery [Vindicate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vindicate).


And if you caught that [Dormant Sliver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dormant+Sliver) draws from [Jungle Barrier](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jungle+Barrier)—including defender to turn off their ability to attack—and [Cautery Sliver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cautery+Sliver) makes them all into [Goblin Legionnaire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Legionnaire)s, then you have a sharp mind for *Invasion* block cards.


Slivers are a look into the past as a look into the past!


Legions of Slivers
==================


Riffing off older effects and spells is one thing Slivers are known for, but it's not the only one. While I didn't open her that day, *Tempest Remastered* had [Sliver Queen](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sliver+Queen), a Sliver with every color in its mana cost that represented the leader of the tribe. [Sliver Queen](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sliver+Queen) makes more Slivers, a handy feature if you're playing all five colors and have Slivers—which would be a reason to have [Sliver Queen](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sliver+Queen) and lots more Slivers.


You get how this works.


The next Sliver leader was [Sliver Overlord](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sliver+Overlord), a legendary Sliver leader that can search up Slivers from your library and steal other Slivers hanging around that you don't control. *Future Sight*, too, brought back a venerable Sliver leader with [Sliver Legion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sliver+Legion)—a Sliver that represented its leadership by mimicking [Coat of Arms](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Coat+of+Arms) for Slivers: the more Slivers in your "legion" that you play, the bigger every Sliver gets.


![Sliver Legion](https://media.wizards.com/2021/tsr/en_XWpVVwzv3K.png)


The "legendary Sliver that makes your Slivers way better" and "Slivers that staple other card abilities onto all of your Slivers" themes continued in both *Magic 2014* and *Modern Horizons*—the latter set containing yet another Sliver that returns on *Time Spiral Remastered*'s bonus sheet.


![Cloudshredder Sliver](https://media.wizards.com/2021/tsr/en_nWw6BZSSwF.png)


[Cloudshredder Sliver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloudshredder+Sliver) makes each Sliver into [Skyknight Legionnaire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skyknight+Legionnaire)—a powerful creature in drafts—and promises to make "the Sliver drafter" a terrifying opponent to play against. It's also outstanding if you play Commander with a Sliver commander since flying and haste are excellent ways to attack with an army of Slivers.


Just maybe you might want to think carefully about when you drop that [Dormant Sliver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dormant+Sliver).
