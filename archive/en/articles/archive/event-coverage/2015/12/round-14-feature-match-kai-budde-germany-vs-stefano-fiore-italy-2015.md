Kai was already safe into the top 8, but Stefano had to win in order to make it. Apparently, the Italian wanted Kai to concede to him, but Kai knew that not only was the deck a bad match-up for himself, but also for his teammate Ben Ronaldson and for his friend Benedikt Klauser. So he chose to play in an attempt to avoid him in the top 8.



**Game 1**


Kai won the die roll and chose to play. He kept his opening hand which was pretty good, he had two Necropotences, two Pyroblasts, an Illusions of Grandeur and two lands. Stefano had a decent draw as well, he had three swamps, a Pyroblast, a Necropotence, an Illusions of Grandeur and one Demonic Consultation.



The German went first, and he played a swamp and said 'go'. Stefano drew another Necro, then he played an Underground Sea and ended his turn. Kai played another land, and during Kai's end of turn step, Stefano cast Demonic Consultation for Duress. The Consult wasn't particularly good, the Duress was the twentieth card and two of the Italian's Donates were removed from the game.



Stefano untapped, played a swamp and cast Duress. In response, Kai Demonic Consultationed for a Badlands, then he showed his hand: two Pyroblasts, one Illusions of Grandeur, two Necropotences and the Badland he had just found. Stefano wasn't pleased when Kai had two Necros, so he chose the Illusions.



During his next turn, Kai dropped the Badlands and cast Necro, then he Necroed for twelve. Stefano tried to cast a Necro as well during his turn, but Kai Force of Willed it, removing a Donate from the game. Kai then Duressed Stefano, and after taking a Pyroblast, he Duressed again to remove a Donate as well. He ended his turn by re-filling his hand with Necro.



Stefano played a land during his following turn, and then he let Kai play again. The German played Mox Diamond, then Illusions of Grandeur. And with 20 more life available, he Necroed for 20 and went down to two. When he had discarded, his hand consisted of a Donate, one Force of Will, a Duress, two Pyroblasts, a Brainstorm and an Underground Sea.



Stefano couldn't do anything but try to Duress Kai, but the Duress was Force of Willed. Stefano then tried to cast his own Illusions, but a Pyroblast stopped it and he scooped.

**Game 2**


Fiore's main deck was pretty regular, however, the Italian had Hunted Wumpuses in his sideboard which took a lot of people by surprise. Kai knew this, and he chose to keep the combo in instead of sideboarding it out for Phyrexian Negators and Masticore. Stefano went for the creatures, on the other hand, which made for an interesting second game.



Stefano kept his opening hand which consisted of two Gemstone Mines, a swamp, an Underground River, a Vampiric Tutor, a Mox Diamond and a Demonic Consultation. Kai had to mulligan, but he kept his second hand: two swamps, an Underground Sea and two Vampiric Tutors.



During Stefano's first turn he played a swamp, a Mox Diamond and then he Consulted for a Necropotence. Unfortunately, he had to mill 18 cards before finding it, and two of his Hunted Wumpuses were at that time removed from the game. But at least he got to play a turn two Necro, and he Necroed for seven and passed priority.



Kai had to go for the quick combo, and he Vampiric Tutored for a Necropotence of his own. He then cast it, and drew seven cards that put the whole combo in his hand. So when Stefano cast a Duress in his following turn, he got to see two Illusions of Grandeur, one Donate, one Consult, one Badlands, one Mox Diamond and one Underground Sea. "Bastarde," Fiore exclaimed. He picked one Illusions, and then he Duressed again to take the second Illusions before Vampiric Tutoring for something.



Kai knew he was short on time, so he cast a Mox Diamond and Consulted for a Duress. But the two last Illusions of his deck both went while he was Consulting, and he scooped.



Budde 1 - Fiore 1



**Game 3**


After some 'sideboarding' Kai had to mulligan again in the final game. His second hand was a Mox Diamond, a swamp, an Illusions of Grandeur, two Demonic Consultations and an Annul. Stefano kept his first hand, which consisted of four swamps, a Hunted Wumpus, a Firestorm and a Necropotence.



Kai went turn one swamp, Consult for another swamp. He got it as the thirteenth card and lost one Illusions and one Donate in the process. Then, he cast the Mox Diamond and passed priority. Stefano dropped a swamp during his turn, and then, during his end of turn step, Kai Consulted for a Necropotence.



Two Force of Wills were milled away, and so was a second Illusions of Grandeur. But Kai got the Necro - unfortunately, he didn't have a third land so that he could cast it. Instead, Stefano got to play two lands, and the Italian also attempted to cast Necropotence, but Kai had the Annul and wisely countered it.



Kai drew a Duress during his fourth turn, and he used it. Stefano had four swamps, a Firestorm and a Hunted Wumpus in his hand, and Kai took the Firestorm as that was the only card he could possibly take. The Italian obviously needed a green mana source in order to cast his Wumpus, and he drew it off the top of his deck - a Mox Diamond. However, Kai Force of Willed it with the THIRD Illusions of Grandeur.



Finally, Kai got his land, and he immediately cast Necro and drew 14 cards. He sighed of relief when he saw the last Illusions of Grandeur, and he also filled up his hand with two Donates, a Force of Will, an Annul, an Underground Sea and a Duress.



He needed the Force of Will though when Stefano cast Duress during his following turn. Then he cast Illusions, Necroed for the rest of his deck and let Stefano have his turn. The Italian needed a Force of Will or a Pyroblast in order to have a chance, but he didn't draw anything. So after Duressing first, Kai could finish him off with a Donate.



**Final Result:** Kai Budde 2 - Stefano Fiore 1
