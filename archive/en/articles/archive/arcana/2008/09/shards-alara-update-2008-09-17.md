This week's [*Shards of Alara* product section](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/tcg/products/shardsofalara) update has something you've never seen before. It's called the "Alara Explorer", and it lets you wander the five shards, interacting with monsters, mages, and, um, something else beginning with "m". Possibly "magma". Oh, and you'll get to see over a hundred pieces of art from *Shards of Alara* as you interact. Neat!


And as usual, there's a new flavor piece (about monsters!), a new puzzle, and a new wallpaper. Plus, of course, our visual spoiler. C'mon over!

PS: The Alara Explorerer is in the "Explore *Shards of Alara*" section
