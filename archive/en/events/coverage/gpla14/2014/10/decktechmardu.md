"You're really trying to avoid snowballs," is the way Brad Nelson described the Mardu Midrange mish-mosh he, Patrick Dickmann, and Valentin Mackl are all playing. Mackl, hailing from Vienna, is currently the highest in the standings with the deck, even though he's the one who knows it the least.



 "I just played what [Brad and Patrick] told me too," Mackl said. The deck was constructed between Pro Tour *Khans of Tarkir* and last Friday. All three players were staying at a house together. Dickmann and Mackl were happy to spend time in LA with Brad and were expecting to have some fun adventures. "But all Brad did was sit on MTGO," Mackl said.
