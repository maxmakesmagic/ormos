As expected, Pro Tour *Magic Origins* completely reshaped the *Magic* Top 25. We have four new entrants on the list, a new entrant into the Top 5, and, of course, a new No. 1-ranked player in the world.


Let's start there, with our newly crowned Player of the Year, Mike Sigrist. Sigrist was ranked merely 20th coming into Pro Tour *Magic Origins*, but making it all the way to the finals has a way of adding a hefty sum to your Pro Points total. That means Sigrist displaces Eric Froehlich from the No. 1 spot, dropping the Hall of Fame member-elect all the way down to . . . No. 2. Froehlich actually had a strong showing at the Pro Tour, rallying back from 0-3 to finish in 19th place—but Sigrist did exactly enough to grab the top spot and all of the end-of-year accolades that go with it.


Sam Black and Lee Shi Tian don't fall far either, as they remained in contention for Player of the Year late into Day Two but slipped in the final rounds.


After Sigrist's whopping nineteen-position rise, the next biggest (upward) movers were Brad Nelson and Antonio Del Moral León, who moved up seven places each to No. 5 and 15, respectively. Andrew Cuneo also continued to ascend, jumping six spots to No. 15 as well. The biggest mover, however, is something of a dubious honor this month, as Ivan Floch falls twelve spots to now find himself the man on the trap door at No. 25.


But let's not dawdle on the falls, let's appreciate the new entrances. Pro Tour *Magic Origins* Champion Joel Larsson enters the rankings at 11th after his dramatic win, and Alexander Hayne, Kentaro Yamamoto, and Matthew Sperling all finished well enough at the Pro Tour—36th, 5th, and 4th, respectively—to jump into the Top 25. Proof that all it takes is one excellent Pro Tour performance to push you up in the rankings.


And that, boys and girls, is the final Top 25 update for the 2014-2015 season, as the 2015-2016 season begins this weekend with Grand Prix in [Hong Kong](http://magic.wizards.com/en/content/fact-sheet-grand-prix-hong-kong-2015) and [San Diego](http://magic.wizards.com/en/content/fact-sheet-grand-prix-san-diego-2015). Who will reign supreme? Tune in every Thursday to follow along.
