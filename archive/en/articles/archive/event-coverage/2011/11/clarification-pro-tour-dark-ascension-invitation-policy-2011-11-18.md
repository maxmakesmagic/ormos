There have been questions regarding the Pro Tour *Dark Ascension*  Invitation Policy, and we want to make an important clarification. For Pro Tour *Dark Ascension*  we will run two invitation lists based on Competitive Planeswalker Points totals: one with the Worlds 2011 results, and one without. Any player who appears on one or both of the lists will receive an invitation. If a player appears on both invitation lists, it will not cause a passdown of invitations.
