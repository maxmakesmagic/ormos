Last Day of Legacy Cube
-----------------------


Do you like that one card, from that one set, and you just never see it anymore? Well, there's only one day of *Legacy Cube* left in this run! *Legacy Cube* is full of some of the best cards from across *Magic*'s history, working together in ways you can only experience in a Cube. But the fun ends April 25 at 10 a.m., so get in on the action while you still can.


For more information on this update of the *Legacy Cube*, check out [designer Paul Cheon's article](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/magic-online/march-2019-legacy-cube-overhaul-2019-03-19).

*War of the Spark: Magic Online* Edition
----------------------------------------


*War of the Spark* ravages its way onto MTGO this Thursday, April 25, before your local prerelease! You can start Sealed play the day it arrives at 10 a.m. PT, while Draft play starts Monday morning, April 29. No matter which side you fight for, expect all sorts of exciting changes with the coming of the new set.


For more information, check out the latest updates in Alli's release article [here](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/magic-online/war-spark-magic-online-edition-2019-04-19).

*Magic Online* Championship
---------------------------


The wait is almost over—24 qualified players from the 2018 *Magic Online* Championship Series will battle for a $200,000 prize pool! The *Magic Online* Championship takes place Friday–Sunday, May 17–19 at Wizards' HQ in Renton, Washington.


Formats for the event include *War of the Spark* Draft, plus both Standard and Modern Constructed. Live video coverage will be provided by the Vintage Super League team of Randy Buehler and Athena Froehlich at [twitch.tv/magic](https://twitch.tv/magic).

Upcoming MCQ Dates and Formats
------------------------------


We have another batch of MCQ dates to announce:





| MCQ Finals Date | Qualifies for MC | Format |

| Sunday, June 2, 2019 | Barcelona | Modern |
| Sunday, June 16, 2019 | Richmond | WAR Sealed |
| Sunday, June 23, 2019 | Richmond | Modern |

| Saturday, August 17, 2019 | Richmond | M20 Sealed |
| Sunday, August 18, 2019 | Richmond | M20 Sealed |


Additionally, we are rescheduling the May 10 WAR Sealed MCQ. Previously, this was announced as a 7 a.m. Friday event. It will instead begin at 3 p.m. on Friday. We recognize not everyone is on the same schedule and that some players have family or work commitments that prevent them from participating in an event that starts so early, especially on a weekday. This event is an experiment to test participation and interest among different groups of players; if it goes well, we will likely continue to start some events in the afternoon again in the future.


As always, all times listed are in Pacific Time.
