Tom LaPille makes things. Some of the things he makes are card sets, like Dark Ascension and Born of the Gods. Sometimes he makes stories, too. Sometimes he makes unexpected things, like 16th-century Japanese clothing. He's probably making something right now. 





One of the least-understood distinctions in **Magic** Ramp;D is the distinction between design and development. I'm not sure I even understood it that well for a good few years when I started working here. Both roles involve making cards and tweaking environments. If you had forced me two years ago to put a fine point on the difference, I'm not sure I would have done a great job. After leading a few sets through development, though, I think I understand how it works. Now, I would say that it is design's job to come up with a vision for how a card set should work and get as close as possible to having it actually work that way. It's development's job to make sure the design team's idea is cool, then get it the rest of the way. 

 A good design makes a statement about the strategies that it wants different colors and color pairs to use. Those strategies can be placed on a continuum that goes from "completely natural and emergent from things **Magic** cards normally do" to "wild new thing that **Magic** has never done before." 

 Executing on the first kind of strategy tends to be a simple affair. For example, ***Magic** 2013*'s red-white deck was intended to be a strategy that went wide with tokens and used mass creature-pumping effects. [Captain's Call](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Captain%27s+Call) and [Crusader of Odric](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crusader+of+Odric) were already in the set to support the mono-white strategy and [Krenko's Command](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Krenko%27s+Command) already existed to support the mono-red Goblin strategy, so it's fairly trivial to put [Trumpet Blast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Trumpet+Blast) in and get most of the way there. Part of this is because the stated strategy does not depend on a new kind of effect we've never made before, and part of this is because we have a strong understanding of how such a deck needs to work.
