 Mike first played with Ice Age and became the copy editor for DailyMTG.com in December 2011. Before DailyMTG, he was an editor on D&D's Dragon magazine for four years. 






*We are remembering Mike McArtor by taking a look at some of the best articles he produced while working a job he clearly loved. This is only a glimpse into Mike’s world, but as we all reflect on this loss, we wanted to highlight some of the joy he brought to us through his own words.*

**Q: Which came first, the chicken or the egg?** 



**A: Mike McArtor, copy editor of DailyMTG.com:**


It depends on what you mean by "first."

The first card with [Egg in the name](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&name=+%5Begg%5D) is [Dingus Egg](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=12), from Alpha. The first card with [Chicken in the name](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&name=+%5Bchicken%5D) appeared in *Unglued*.


Alphabetically, of course, a Chicken card comes first. In this case, [Chicken à la King](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chicken+%C3%A0+la+King).


And if you're looking for "eggs" for your deck, I recommend the winning decklists from [Pro Tour *Return to Ravnica*](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/top-8-decklists-modern-2012-10-20) (Cifka's) and [Grand Prix San Diego](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/magazine/article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/eventcoverage/gpsd13/welcome) (Holiday's).
