Standard now rotates only once each year, with the release of the October large set. So ***Magic** 2011* will enter Standard on its release without knocking anything out, then ***Magic** 2010* and *Shards of Alara* block will leave Standard with the release of "Lights." The Standard format between ***Magic** 2011* and "Lights" will consist of *Shards of Alara* block, *Zendikar* block, ***Magic** 2010*, and ***Magic** 2011*. After the release of "Lights," it will consist of Z*endikar* Block, ***Magic** 2011*, and "Lights."


Extended rotates at the same time. After the release of *Scars of Mirrodin*, Extended will be *Lorwyn/Shadwomoor*  block, *Shards of Alara*  block, *Zendikar*  block, *Scars of Mirrodin*  block, ***Magic**  2010*  and ***Magic**  2011*.
