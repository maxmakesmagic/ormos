Thanks to byes, this was the first round the pro players were playing in, and already we found quite a good match to watch. In one corner sat Hall of Famer Ben Stark, veteran of countless Grand Prix and Pro Tour Top 8s. (Actually, that's not entirely true; we were able to count and came up with 15 and four respectively, with one win apiece.) Facing him was Max Sjöblom who, so far, had only finished in one Top 8 each at Pro Tours and Grand Prix and was looking to maybe add another to his résumé this weekend.



Sjöblom was running what appeared to be a pretty standard version of Abzan Aggro, whereas Stark had brought a sweet-looking Abzan Control with [Satyr Wayfinder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Satyr+Wayfinder)s, [Murderous Cut](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Murderous+Cut)s, and [Den Protector](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Den+Protector)s. Who would prevail in the battle between the Abzans? Well, we would find out.



**The Games**



All began with a mulligan for Sjöblom. Though his six-card hand looked spectacular (two lands and [Ultimate Price](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ultimate+Price) with a perfect curve of [Fleecemane Lion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fleecemane+Lion), [Anafenza, the Foremost](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Anafenza%2C+the+Foremost), and [Siege Rhino](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Siege+Rhino) to boot) it deteriorated quickly, thanks to a pair of [Thoughtseize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtseize)s from Stark who took both Sjöblom's 2- and 3-drop. Sjöblom didn't cast a single spell until turn four, while Stark had a [Satyr Wayfinder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Satyr+Wayfinder).



Next, the two players summoned matching [Siege Rhino](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Siege+Rhino)s. Sjöblom had a second, killed Stark's with [Hero's Downfall](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hero%27s+Downfall), and it looked as if he might actually come back from the early-game lull. However, Sjöblom lost one Rhino to [Bile Blight](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bile+Blight) and blocks, the other to [Murderous Cut](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Murderous+Cut), and once again found himself out of creatures.

Pulling ahead even further, Stark cast and turned up a pair of [Den Protector](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Den+Protector)s. He then re-summoned [Siege Rhino](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Siege+Rhino) and cast [Mastery of the Unseen](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mastery+of+the+Unseen). Sjöblom did have [Bile Blight](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bile+Blight) to dispatch the two [Den Protector](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Den+Protector)s, but when [Mastery of the Unseen](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mastery+of+the+Unseen) found a third (what else?) on top of Stark's deck, the game was effectively over.



**Ben Stark 1-0 Max Sjöblom**



The second game began with the players casting [Thoughtseize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtseize)s, Stark again stripping Sjöblom of a turn-two play. Nevertheless, Sjöblom was able to build a bit of a board presence with [Sorin, Solemn Visitor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sorin%2C+Solemn+Visitor) and a Vampire token, while Stark cast [Satyr Wayfinder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Satyr+Wayfinder) plus [Courser of Kruphix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Courser+of+Kruphix). Stark lost both right away when [Dromoka's Command](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dromoka%27s+Command) forced him to sacrifice an enchantment and forced a fight between Vampire and Wayfinder.



Stark drew [Hero's Downfall](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hero%27s+Downfall), but was low on answers to planeswalkers and knew about [Nissa, Worldwaker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nissa%2C+Worldwaker) in Sjöblom's hand. "Can I see Nissa for a second?" Stark asked. Sjöblom gave Stark the card to read, and Stark decided to let Sorin live.

However, Nissa was not the only planeswalker in these two players' hands. With more [Satyr Wayfinder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Satyr+Wayfinder)s, Stark himself was building toward eight mana for the [Ugin, the Spirit Dragon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ugin%2C+the+Spirit+Dragon) he had revealed earlier. The looming Spirit Dragon may have kept Sjöblom from deploying as many threats as he otherwise might have. He never mounted much of an offense and later found himself forced to cast [Nissa, Worldwaker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nissa%2C+Worldwaker) anyway. Stark's [Elspeth, Sun's Champion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elspeth%2C+Sun%27s+Champion) died to [Hero's Downfall](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hero%27s+Downfall) immediately, but her Soldiers stayed around and managed to take down Nissa before long.



The game was shifting more and more in Stark's favor. Close to the end, Sjöblom blocked one of Stark's tokens with a solitary [Wingmate Roc](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wingmate+Roc) and promptly lost it to the +2 ability of [Ugin, the Spirit Dragon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ugin%2C+the+Spirit+Dragon) which entered the battlefield post-combat. Later, Sjöblom said, "That was such a bad block."



The mistake was not exactly crucial to the match, but neither was it irrelevant. It certainly sped things up as Sjöblom, bereft of his only flier, was unable to stop Ugin from going straight up to eleven counters. In the face of this as well new additions to Stark's team in [Siege Rhino](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Siege+Rhino) and [Den Protector](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Den+Protector), Sjöblom extended his hand in concession.



**Ben Stark 2-0 Max Sjöblom**



After the match the players discussed some of the more interesting game play situations. "I think everything you did up to that point," Stark told Sjöblom, referring to the block with [Wingmate Roc](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wingmate+Roc), "I would have played exactly the same."
