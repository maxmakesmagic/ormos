As you look at *Return to Ravnica* cards, you might notice a weird-looking Spirit here and there:

| Vassal Soul | Soulsworn Spirit |

They're even more disturbing when you see them close up!

These disturbing creatures are "bound spirits" that the Azorius keep around for advice and other tasks. There was one back in the original *Ravnica: City of Guilds*: [Soulsworn Jury](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soulsworn+Jury).

And now for something you *haven't* seen: the sketches from the *Return to Ravnica* style guide, showing generally how the bound souls look!
