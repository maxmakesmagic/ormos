 Katie is a copy editor and occasional writer for DailyMTG, as well as a longtime Magic player with a fondness for giant green creatures. She especially loves Commander, despite having the patience of a fruit fly, and might glare at you if your turn takes too long. 






The Daily *Magic* Update is a roundup of everything *Magic* you should know on October 27, 2017. Today's Update is brought to you by a weekend of [CARDS AND FESTIVITIES](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/magic-story/something-else-entirely-2017-10-04)!


Today's Must
============


1. [What Matters in the Temur vs. Ramunap Red Matchup?](https://www.channelfireball.com/articles/what-matters-in-the-temur-vs-ramunap-red-matchup/) | ChannelFireball | Brian DeMars

Sometimes it feels a little overhyped to call a given matchup "the most important" for its format . . . but in this case, when the two decks in question are so ubiquitous *and* recently faced off in the deciding match of the World Championship? It's just the truth. With three GPs this weekend and a Pro Tour coming up next weekend, everyone is thinking about Temur Energy and Ramunap Red, and Brian has some thoughts about how to tune each one for the evolving metagame. We're all waiting to see what these two back-to-back weekends of premier play will bring.


After That, Read, Watch, or Listen to These
===========================================


1. [Rough Drafts: *Innistrad*](https://www.mtggoldfish.com/articles/rough-drafts-innistrad?src=wizards) | MTGGoldfish | SaffronOlive

Original *Innistrad* was a famously fun Draft environment—yes, even if you weren't playing [Spider Spawning](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spider+Spawning), amazingly enough. (Werewolf Tribal and [Burning Vengeance](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Burning+Vengeance) decks were my two favorites.) Now that the flashback drafts are live on *Magic Online*, SaffronOlive jumped in to see what sort of crazy synergy he could put together. I don't know about you, but now I sure want to go draft some *Innistrad* like right now.


1. [Easy Mode: Winning by Playing What You Know](http://www.starcitygames.com/article/36068_Playing-What-You-Know.html) | StarCityGames.com | Emma Handy

Emma discusses the power of practice and the benefits of choosing a deck you're already well-acquainted with. She talks about it in the context of Modern—with some interesting insight into the current Modern metagame—but the lessons can apply to any format. No matter what kind of raw power a given deck has, there's no substitute for familiarity and experience.


1. [MTG Top 10: *Innistrad*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47CtBhZASDQ) | YouTube | Nizzahon Magic

In honor of the original *Innistrad* flashback drafts available (right! now!) on *Magic Online*, Nizzahon Magic has created a pretty definitive list of the top ten cards from the block. These aren't your average opinion-based rankings, though—Nizzahon painstakingly scoured years of decklists and tournament results to generate a data-based numerical score for each card. Can you guess what's number one? (Yes. Yes, you probably can.)

1. [Mad Prophecies for *Rivals of Ixalan*](https://www.hipstersofthecoast.com/2017/10/mad-prophecies-rivals-ixalan/) | Hipsters of the Coast | Beck Holden

Wild speculation is objectively more fun than boring facts. Ask any scientist. In that spirit, Beck has lots of guesses about what might be around the corner in the *Rivals of Ixalan* story arc. What do you think? Will Angrath's entire family history be revealed? Did an Izzet mage create the [Thaumatic Compass](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thaumatic+Compass)? When will Breeches get his well-deserved day in the sun?


1. [State of Modern](https://collected.company/2017/10/26/state-modern-150/) | Collected.Company | Masters of Modern | Ben Bateman and Alex Kessler

In the wake of the [recent (non)change to the Modern banned and restricted list](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/news/october-17-2017-banned-and-restricted-announcement-2017-10-17), the Masters of Modern take a broad look at the format. They do some guessing about what might get banned (or unbanned) in the future, survey the metagame, and debate what strategies might be best poised to break into the top tier. (Spoiler alert: it's Camel tribal.)


1. [MTGInktober](https://reuxben.tumblr.com/tagged/MTGinktober) | Tumblr | Removal Too

An illustrator going by the name Removal Too has been doing an Inktober series of *Magic* art, and some of the pieces are pretty darn delightful! The series includes interpretations of classics like "Feldon of the Emo Path" and "Gishath, Sass's Avatar." This artist could probably make even an Eldrazi adorable, and I eagerly await "Emracool, the Party Starter" (I'm so sorry).

Grand Prix Liverpool is already under way! (It's also much later in the day there, because time is a mysterious thing.) If my understanding of time zones is correct, which is at least possible, GP Hong Kong is also up and running, with GP Phoenix kicking off a little bit later today.


Deck of the Day
===============


1. [Kyle McLain's Mono-White Monument](http://sales.starcitygames.com/deckdatabase/displaydeck.php?DeckID=116719)

A few weeks ago at a StarCityGames.com Classic, Kyle McLain managed to claim 16th place with a deck that didn't play a single copy of [The Scarab God](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=The+Scarab+God), [Hostage Taker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hostage+Taker), [Ramunap Ruins](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ramunap+Ruins), or anything that makes energy. For this, Kyle, wherever you are, you deserve a large ice cream sundae and some compliments written on fancy paper.


The deck is basically a traditional white weenie strategy, supported by the namesake [Oketra's Monument](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oketra%27s+Monument). The new white Vampires from *Ixalan* enable some Vampire synergies as well, with enough life gain to make Adanto's Vanguard extremely hard for an opponent to deal with. There are enough small creatures and token-makers/supporters running around right now that I'll be interested to see if this kind of strategy starts showing up more at the top level of play.
