Another week, another double header of Grand Prix action as the season powers on toward a date with destiny at Pro Tour *Origins* in Vancouver, British Columbia, at the end of the month. Let's see who fared how and where and what it all means as we once again take you inside the *Magic* Top 25 Pro Rankings.



In France, Legacy was the format for Grand Prix Lille. That isn't a format that's always kind to the Pros—it rewards a ton of iterations with your deck of choice, plus a sizeable knowledge of the format as a whole, which isn't easy to come by. In the event, only Ondrej Strasky of the Czech Republic chanced his arm, and came away with a single win and a couple of draws on Day One before his involvement in the tournament was ended.



Meanwhile in Montreal, eleven of our Ranked players took their chance, and six were rewarded with draft action on Sunday: Andrew Cuneo, Pro Tour Champions Ari Lax and Alexander Hayne, Hall of Famer William Jensen, former Player of the Year Owen Turtenwald, and (completing the Peach Garden Oath trio) Reid Duke. Two major stories emerged from draft day.



Duke was the first. After an indifferent season by his stratospheric standards, he has roared back to form in recent weeks—this was his second Top 8 in only a few weeks, and having fallen out of the rankings only a month or so ago, he's now up four to No. 15.



For Alexander Hayne, this was a huge weekend. He is locked in a fearsome (but also incredibly friendly) battle with a fellow Canadian, Pascal Maynard, for the coveted Grand Prix slot at the World Championship in Seattle later this year. With Maynard having just won Grand Prix Buenos Aires, it was up to Hayne to respond . . . and he did yet again, with a 12-3 finish on the weekend.



Two new entries join the ranks. Mike Sigrist was the champion in Montreal, adding to an excellent eighteen months. He is the new No. 19, while Hall of Famer Jelger Wiegersma enters at No. 23 on the back of his Top 8 performance in Montreal. Watch for both of them at the final Pro Tour of the season.



So, that's a wrap, and less than five points cover the top five—Eric Froehlich, Sam Black, Lee Shi Tian, Yuuya Watanabe, and Owen Turtenwald. Join us again next week as the race for Player of the Year intensifies here at the home of the *Magic* Top 25 Pro Rankings.
