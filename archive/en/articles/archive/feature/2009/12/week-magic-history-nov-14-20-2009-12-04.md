### November 30-December 4, 2005: Japan's Crowning Achievement

When the World Championships came to Yokohama, it felt right at home. Matching a feat only performed by the United States in the history of Magic, the host nation of these 2005 World Championships claimed the World Championship (Katsuhiro Mori), World Team Championship (Takuma Morofuji, Masashi Oiso and Ichirou Shimura ) and Player of the Year (Kenji Tsumura) in the same season.


That kicked off a five-year run of Japanese dominance in the Player of the Year race. 2005: Kenji Tsumura. 2006: Shouta Yasooka. 2007: Tomoharu Saito. 2008: Shuhei Nakamura. 2009: Yuuya Watanabe. And who knows what 2010 will bring?

The induction speeches have been [preserved for you](/en/articles/archive/event-coverage/feature-hall-fame-induction-ceremony-2005-11-29).
