From August 15–18, all roads will lead to Gen Con in Indianapolis and, of course, there will be plenty of **Magic** on offer. With an exciting program of events running day and night, featuring formats from the mainstream to the manic, there really is something for everyone at this most wonderful of gaming weekends. One event that we just have to mention is particularly exciting and recognizes that **Magic** is celebrating a special birthday this year 

###  Gen Con 2013: Magic: The Gathering 20th Anniversary Tournament

 In celebration of the 20th Anniversary of **Magic: The Gathering**, Pastimes and Wizards of the Coast will present a special tournament. 

 The **Magic** 20th Anniversary Tournament will be an invitation-only, eight-player booster draft using boosters from throughout the history of **Magic: The Gathering**. To qualify, you must win one of the designated eight **Magic** tournaments taking place on Thursday, Friday, and Saturday, at Gen Con 2013. 

 Eighty different boosters will be drafted during the tournament, including *Beta*, *Unlimited*, *Arabian Nights*, *Antiquities*, *Revised Edition*, *Legends*, *Portal Three Kingdoms*, and seventy-three other boosters from *The Dark* all the way through ***Magic** 2014*.

### Eternal Weekend

 We are also delighted to announce that the Vintage and Legacy Championships now have their own weekend!
