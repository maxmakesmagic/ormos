The Hidden Value in Lands

 Marshall came back to Magic after discovering Limited and never looked back. He hosts the Limited Resources podcast and does Grand Prix and Pro Tour video commentary. 





"Lands Matter" was the original big-picture theme for the ultra-popular *Zendikar* block when it came out in 2009. That's kind of vague, but R&D knew it wanted to do a set about one of the most underrated permanent types in the game. They invented a sweet adventure world and even the landfall mechanic.


Things that care about lands (including landfall) are back as we return to the battle on Zendikar, and this week we are going to focus on lands and what they mean in the new Limited formats.


Quantity
========


I've been playing eighteen lands for the most part in this format. In a deck with a bunch of landfall creatures, it's never too bad to keep hitting those land drops. In decks looking to cast massive Eldrazi or similarly costed threats, hitting lands forever isn't bad either. And even in aggressive Ally decks, hitting those first five lands or so is super important.


In a normal Limited set, I feel like the perfect number of lands would be seventeen and a half. Since a one-half land isn't really a thing, we can't do this. But in sets that encourage us to hit our land drops late into the game, I find that bumping up to eighteen seems correct. There are a ton of mana outlets floating around Zendikar this time around. From awaken spells to Eldrazi to Invokers, you'll always have a place to put that extra mana.


It's essentially never correct to say that a single number of lands is always right in a given format, though. You'll need to evaluate each deck before deciding how many lands to include. But as a starting point, eighteen is a good place to be.


Hidden Value
============


Before we get into actual cards from *Battle for Zendikar*, I want to touch on a cool concept you may not have considered before.


Every spell you draft (or choose from your sealed pool) and put in your deck is a valuable asset. And you only get so many slots in each deck, of course. I recommended playing eighteen lands in this column, which leaves you with only 22 actual spells slots. You have to make every one count!


To illustrate this, I'll explain it how I did to my friend Adam, who is learning to draft. He's a big sports fan, and I compared it to a roster of baseball players. A baseball team fields nine players. That's it. They have some backup players (sideboard players?), but only nine get to play in a game at any given time.


As a professional manager of a baseball team, every single one of those slots is super important. You have to maximize the talent at each position, because you only have so many ways in which to effect the outcome of a game.


*Magic* is the same! Sure, you get more than nine slots, but even with 22 or 23, you only have a few actual card slots that can help you win the game.


![](https://media.wizards.com/2015/images/daily/LI20151007_baseball.jpg)


This is where my "[Value of a Card](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/limited-information/value-card-2013-06-26-0)" column comes in. I used [Ornithopter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ornithopter) as the example there, because it trips up so many newer players. The basic concept here, of course, is Opportunity Cost. If you play an underperforming, inconsistent, or just plain bad card in your deck, you are bumping out a potentially better option.


The question should always be, "What am I playing this instead of?" That way you can contextualize your actual decision. What I mean is, you may think that the decision looks like this:


"I have a card I am going to play in my deck, so I choose to play the card in my deck."


When in reality it's this:


"I have a card I'm going to play in my deck, which I think is better than the next best option, so I'll play it."


Instead of playing cards because they are good or bad, you are playing them because they are better than the relative options you have in your card pool.


This concept is really important to understanding how to build good decks, but what does it have to do with lands of all things?


This is where the hidden value comes in. If you can play lands that can do spell-like things, you are effectively clearing a whole new slot for a spell in your deck! That's like getting to field a tenth player in a baseball game for free! It's a big deal.


The knee-jerk reaction to a lot of these "spell lands" is that they aren't particularly efficient. Which is true. But thinking of it this way is a trap.


To illustrate, let's jump back to baseball: If you were a professional manager, and your opposing manager only got to field nine players, but I came up to you and offered that you could field a tenth, you'd take that deal in a heartbeat. And even if I offered you a player that was a bit worse than your other nine players, you'd still take it because hey, it's free, right?


That's how these lands are in *Battle for Zendikar*. They may not be super high-impact cards, but they are almost free. Why almost? Because most of them tap for colorless mana or enter the battlefield tapped. This can mess with your color requirements a bit, but if you don't overdo it you can usually impact your deck minimally by including them.


Now that we have a better idea for why these cards are sweet, let's look at a few of them up close and see what awaits.


 


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Blighted+Cataract)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blighted+Cataract)
 


[Blighted Cataract](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blighted+Cataract) is part of the whole Blighted cycle of uncommon lands, with one for each color. All of these cards are playable, though they aren't all equal in power level. With the blue version we have here, you can tap seven lands (six other lands, plus the Cataract itself) to draw two cards late in the game.


I know your first reaction will be to reject this as it's not a good deal to spend six mana just to draw a couple of cards.


As we discussed above, this is gravy. It's a freeroll (almost anyway). So even though it's not particularly mana-efficient, because it's coming in the form of a land and not an actual spell, it's great. Plus, it's drawing cards, which is always sweet.


 


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Blighted+Fen)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blighted+Fen) [![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Blighted+Gorge)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blighted+Gorge)
 


And it doesn't stop at drawing cards. As you can see with [Blighted Fen](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blighted+Fen) and [Blighted Gorge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blighted+Gorge), you even get removal attached to these lands. Again, these aren't the best options as far as mana efficiency goes, but since it's not taking a spells slot *and* can even kill some really important creatures, it's a great deal.


I like all of the Blighted lands quite a bit. I haven't quite sorted where to pick them up in a draft yet, though. They do get a bump in utility thanks to being lands, but the overall impact on the game may not be as high as a real spell you start in your deck. Balancing out the impact versus the power level is tricky, and we'll have to let some time pass before we get a great feel for it.


 


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Fertile+Thicket)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fertile+Thicket)
 


Now for some common lands that have an even smaller effect on the game than the blighted lands. They don't have a mana cost attached to them, and they produce colored mana instead of colorless. They do enter the battlefield tapped, however, so they have a cost associated with them.


[Fertile Thicket](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fertile+Thicket) is a tricky one to evaluate, but so far I've been pretty happy with it. The main use for it is to play on turn one or two in a hand that needs more land to make it go. I've kept two-land hands with this in there, knowing that I'd be able to hit my third land drop the vast majority of the time thanks to [Fertile Thicket](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fertile+Thicket).


One important point about [Fertile Thicket](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fertile+Thicket) is that its ability is a "may" ability, meaning you can choose if you'd like to use it or not. In the early part of the game, you'll often want to use it. But in the late part of the game, the last thing you want to see on the top of your library are more lands.


In that scenario, just play your land tapped, but decline the ability.


 


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Skyline+Cascade)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skyline+Cascade)
 


I'm going to let you look deeper at the rest of the nonbasic lands available in *Battle for Zendikar* and evaluate for yourself where they fit in. But first we'll go over [Skyline Cascade](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skyline+Cascade).


[Skyline Cascade](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skyline+Cascade) is a nice little utility land in the same cycle as [Fertile Thicket](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fertile+Thicket), but with a very different ability. It can keep a creature tapped down through its controller's next untap step. One thing it can't do (though I saw people trying this at the Prerelease) is tap down a creature on its own. The creature has to already be tapped or become tapped that turn for it to matter.


That aside, the card is tricky for players to time correctly, but it's a nice reward of those who do.


Lands Do Matter
===============


Lands are what make *Magic* tick. They introduce a healthy amount of variance to a game that needs it. They allow you to cast your spells and in some cases they can act as actual spells in your deck. The real key for the lands in *Battle for Zendikar* is to figure out just how important these lands are and where we take them in Booster Draft.


Also how many of them to run in a two-color deck. Or a three-color deck.


And which order we take them in.


Back to the ol' Work Research for me, it seems.


Until next week!
