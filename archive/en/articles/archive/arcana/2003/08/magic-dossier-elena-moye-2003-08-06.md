**Name:** Elena Moye

**Job title and duties: Magic: The Gathering** Associate Brand Manager.  
 Current duties: **Magic** Product marketing and more.  
 Previous duties: **Magic** Organized Play marketing and more.

**Age:** 27

**Education:** University of Washington, MBA (in progress); University of Washington, BA 1998.

**Began working at Wizards:** April 2000

**Previous job:** Training Coordinator in the Management Development Group at Microsoft

**How you got your job here:** Emailed my resume every four months after graduating college until I got a call from Human Resources asking me to interview for the **Pokémon** Marketing Coordinator position.

**Magic accomplishments prior to working here:** Hmm… I played casually. Nothing really exciting.

**Previous responsibilities within the company: Pokémon** and **Harry Potter** marketing.

**Expansions or projects you've worked on:** campaigns for **Magic** 10th Anniversary, Global Celebration Event, World Champ Decks, Worlds, Pro Tour, Grand Prix, PT Qualifiers, Nationals, Junior Super Series Challenges & Championship, Regionals, Champs (aka States), Friday Night **Magic**, Arena, and product marketing for every expansion since *Odyssey*.

**Favorite part of your job:** Working with such awesome and terribly creative people.

**Least favorite part of your job:** Working with such awesome and terribly creative people. Just kidding. I’d have to say that my least favorite part of my job is… hmm… nothing really jumps to mind.

**Thing you've worked on that you're most proud of:** Wow. Tough one. I’m proud of pretty much everything I’ve worked on, mostly for different reasons though. I was thrilled with how the **Magic** Museum turned out at GenCon. That took a lot of teamwork and the help of two brilliant designers (Kristin Standiford and Laurie Shattuck) who worked insanely long days to meet grueling timelines. All of the marketing campaigns I’ve lead, because of the creativity and passion of our creative team (Mark Jessup, Kurt Isensee, and Mark Painter). The success of many of those campaigns due to the strategic placement and amazing negotiation skills of our advertising team (Kathryn Jones and Kim Doyel). I guess that I’m just really proud of my team.

**Other games you currently enjoy playing:** PS2 games and XBOX games: *Halo, Final Fantasy*, racing games, etc.

**Favorite Magic card:** [Desolation Angel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Desolation+Angel).
