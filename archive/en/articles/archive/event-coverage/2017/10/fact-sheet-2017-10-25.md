FORMAT AND STRUCTURE
--------------------



* [Format](#-tabs-1)
* [Structure](#-tabs-2)
* [Judges & Notes](#-tabs-3)

* Team [Modern Constructed](http://magic.wizards.com/en/game-info/gameplay/formats/modern)
* Players should review the [*Magic* Tournament Rules](http://wpn.wizards.com/en/document/magic-gathering-tournament-rules) for the rules specific to Team Tournaments, paying particular attention to the following sections:
	+ Section 8.2 — Team Composition and Identification
	+ Section 8.3 — Team Communication
* Unified Deck Construction Rules  

 Team Constructed tournaments use Unified Deck Construction rules: Except for cards with the basic supertype or cards with text that specifies otherwise, no two decks on a team may contain the same card, based on its English card title. (For example, if one player is using [Naturalize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Naturalize) in a Team Constructed tournament, no other player on that team may use [Naturalize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Naturalize) in his or her deck.) No players may use cards that are banned in a particular format.
* Deck lists are required
* Players must use the same deck on Day Two that they used on Day One.


* Modified Swiss-style (50-minute rounds).
* Day One will consist of 9 Swiss rounds. Day Two will consist of 5 Swiss rounds and the Top 4 single-elimination playoff.
* All teams with an X-3-0 record (or better) or the top 40 teams – whichever is greater – advance to the second day of competition for prizes and invitations.
* The Top 4 teams after the final Swiss round on Day Two will advance to the Top 8 single-elimination playoff.
* Top 4 playoff matches will be best 2 of 3 per individual match, with no time limit. (Players are still expected to play at a normal pace and complete playoff matches in a reasonable amount of time.)
* Only 1 round will be played in the semi-finals and finals.
* Standings after the Swiss rounds will be used to determine final order in the standings for losing players in the quarterfinal and semifinal playoff rounds.

For the first game of each match in the playoff, the players on the team that finished higher in the Swiss rounds chooses either to play first or to play second. For subsequent games in each Top 4 playoff match, the usual Play/Draw rule applies (loser of the previous game decides whether to play first in the next game).




**Judges**


Judges interested in applying for the event should do so using the [Judge Center](http://apps.magicjudges.org/).


**Main Event Notes**


* [Planeswalker Points](http://www.wizards.com/Magic/PlaneswalkerPoints/Information) multiplier 8x, Rules Enforcement Level (REL) is Competitive on Day One and Professional on Day Two.
* The [*Magic: The Gathering* Tournament Rules](http://wpn.wizards.com/en/document/magic-gathering-tournament-rules) and the [*Magic: The Gathering* Infraction Procedure Guide](http://wpn.wizards.com/en/document/magic-infraction-procedure-guide) are in effect for this event unless specifically overruled by information in this Format Document. Rules documents can be found in the [*Magic* Document Center](http://wpn.wizards.com/en/resources/rules-documents/244).
* Players are responsible for bringing their own method of tracking life totals, card sleeves, and appropriate counters or tokens.
* In the event that a player who wins an invitation to a Pro Tour stop at a Grand Prix has already qualified for an invitation, the invitation does not pass down under any circumstances. Previous qualification may be through a Qualifier tournament, through performance at a professional tournament, or by being an invited DCI player (valid upon the date of the official rank announcement for the appropriate professional tournament).

TOURNAMENT BYES

Team Modern events do not offer byes.








Side Events
-----------


Along with the main event, there are additional side-event tournaments to play in at a Grand Prix. The Side Events listed in this section are on the schedule of every Grand Prix. For a more robust listing of side events, visit the Grand Prix website. Side events at a Grand Prix have a 3x Planeswalker Points multiplier (or whichever multiplier is appropriate for the event type).


#### Friday


**"Foiled Again"**


A straight Swiss tournament lasting three or four rounds. Participants get one past promo card for playing, then one additional promo card per match win. Format varies by event.


#### Saturday


**"Rebound" Event**  

Format at organizer's discretion. Players who also played in the main Grand Prix tournament will get a discount for entry.


#### Sunday


**Pro Tour Qualifier**  

The winner of the Pro Tour Qualifier receives an invitation to the same Pro Tour that the Grand Prix feeds. The format depends on the format of the Grand Prix: if the Grand Prix is Limited, the Pro Tour Qualifier will be Standard; otherwise the format of the Pro Tour Qualifier will be Limited. The Pro Tour Qualifier will consist of either an eight-round Swiss tournament with a maximum of 225 players, or eight single-elimination pods of 32 players each; in either case, a Top 8 single-elimination playoff will take place.








Artists
-------


Some of the hottest and most famous artists in *Magic* will be joining us at the Grand Prix. All artists will be available to sign cards, playmats, and more. In addition, all will be selling prints, artist proofs, original art/sketches, and doing custom alterations of mats and cards! See the Grand Prix website for more information about the artists that will be attending.
