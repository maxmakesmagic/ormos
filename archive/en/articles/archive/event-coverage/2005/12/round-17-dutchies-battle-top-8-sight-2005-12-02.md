The two players chattered on in Dutch for a good while before the match started. Being an ignorant American, I couldn't understand a word they said. However, I do have something in Dutch to say to all of you.


Ik bedoel.


Postema then asked me to give a shout out to his sponsor, ManaMaze. I told him only if he buys me dinner. I think he agreed, but how should I know? I don't speak Dutch!

Karsten is playing the awesome CAL (Confinement/[Assault](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Assault)/[Life](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Life)) concoction, while Postema has brought Boros Deck Wins, and they are both in great shape to make Top 8.


### Game 1


Karsten started off with the turn-one [Birds of Paradise](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Birds+of+Paradise) and Postema happily picked it out of the sky with an end-of-turn [Lava Dart](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lava+Dart), then followed up with [Kataki, War's Wage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kataki%2C+War%27s+Wage). Karsten played a turn two [Sakura-Tribe Elder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sakura-Tribe+Elder) and Postema grimaced. He untapped, played a third land (knocking himself to 15) and added [Silver Knight](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Silver+Knight) and [Savannah Lions](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Savannah+Lions). Karsten thought about sacrificing his Elder but decided it would serve him better in play. He just played a third land and passed the turn back.


Postema's creatures crashed in and the Elder blocked [Savannah Lions](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Savannah+Lions), with [Putrefy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Putrefy) being aimed at [Silver Knight](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Silver+Knight). Karsten fell to 18. He searched up a [Mountain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mountain), with his mana base now having one each of four different land types. Postema tapped three for [Pillage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pillage) and paused, shaking his head. Karsten just grinned. Postema took down the [Forest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest), correctly worrying about [Life from the Loam](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Life+from+the+Loam).


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/worlds05/fm17_karsten.jpg)*You sure you want to keep playing?*
I might have floated a mana, flashed back [Lava Dart](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lava+Dart) to clear out the Elder, and then [Pillage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pillage)d before attacking so as to attack for four and keep an extra creature, but what do I know? To be fair, he didn't have another land in his hand. And anyway, he owes me dinner.


Karsten cycled some lands and searched up a replacement [Forest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest) with [Wooded Foothills](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wooded+Foothills). Postema drew a land (see!), sent Kataki in for 2 and [Molten Rain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Molten+Rain)ed Karsten's new [Forest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest). Karsten cycled some more (doesn't he have anything better to do?) and eventually placed down a [Tranquil Thicket](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tranquil+Thicket).


Postema, having drawn another land, could only attack for two. On Karsten's turn, more cycling plus a [Life from the Loam](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Life+from+the+Loam) spelled bad news for Postema. Frank played a new Elder, which fell to the flashed back [Lava Dart](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lava+Dart), and Postema hit for another two.


That would be all though, as Frank had the [Solitary Confinement](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Solitary+Confinement) and locked up the game at 11 life.


Frank said something in Dutch and Postema considered, then nodded. They called a judge and announced that they wanted an intentional draw. It appears that before the match, Karsten asked for a draw, but Postema is a point behind in the standings and wasn't sure if that was enough. He decided to play, but after being down a game against the tough CAL deck, changed his mind.


Karsten, ever the gentleman, gave him the draw.


Final Result  

Frank Karsten draws with Bas Postema
