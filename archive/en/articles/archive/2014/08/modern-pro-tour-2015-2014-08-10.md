During Pro Tour *Magic 2015*, on August 2, we announced the schedule, locations, and formats for the 2015 Pro Tours. The Constructed format for all Pro Tours in that announcement was Standard.


Since then, we have received comments and concerns from the *Magic* community regarding this announcement, and the omission of Modern from the 2015 Pro Tour schedule. After evaluating all feedback and after further discussion, we have decided to add Modern to the 2015 Pro Tour schedule.


The Pro Tour in Washington D.C., which will take place from February 6–8 in 2015, will feature Modern Constructed and Booster Draft as the tournament's formats. This is a change from the previous schedule announcement of Standard and Booster Draft.


In addition, the format for Grand Prix Vancouver, taking place February 21–22 in 2015, will be changed from Limited to Modern.


In order to address the community's questions regarding this change and other changes related to the direction of *Magic*, its formats, and Organized Play, we will also be hosting a CoverItLive chat session on Tuesday, August 26, where Director of Global Brand Marketing Mark Purvis, Senior Director of R&D Aaron Forsythe, and I will answer the community's questions. We will have more details—including the time for when this CoverItLive chat session will take place—later this month.


As always, we appreciate the feedback that you have provided us regarding recent announcements, and we will address the community's questions accordingly.
