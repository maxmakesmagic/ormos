G**et ready for a beating!**


The Beatdown Gift Box for **Magic: The Gathering** is here, and it is ONE BAD-ASS SET. Don't believe us? Take it up with creatures like [Mahamoti Djinn](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mahamoti+Djinn), [Erhnam Djinn](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Erhnam+Djinn), and [Sengir Vampire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sengir+Vampire).


It's BIGGER, too. Bigger creatures. Bigger combat. Bigger hurt! Grab a friend and tear them apart. ("Get well" card not included.)


**Play with pain.  

Deliver a Beatdown.**
