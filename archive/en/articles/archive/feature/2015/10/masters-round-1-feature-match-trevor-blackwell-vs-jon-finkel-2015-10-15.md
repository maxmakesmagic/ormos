This feature match pits the current U.S. and World Champion and
the consensus best player in the game, Jon Finkel, against the winner
of this summer's booster draft Masters tournament as well as last year's
PTLA and the world's top-rated limited player, Trevor Blackwell. With
two of the world's best competing in the first round, there's a lot at
stake; because of the prize distribution of the Masters tournament,
this is essentially a $2,000+ ante match.



Both players are extremely focused from the outset, and after a minimal
amount of pre-match banter, Jon wins the toss and opts to play. When he
drops an Island and sends the turn over to Trevor, it is obvious that
Jon is playing his signature deck, Forbidian. Trevor plays a second-turn
Priest of Titania, indicating that he is playing an Extended variant of
Trinity Green, similar to the deck Brian Schneider piloted to some
success in the earlier Gateway tournament. At the end of Trevor's turn,
Jon Impulses for an Ophidian, drops it on his turn, and proceeds to
Forbid-lock Blackwell out of the game. After a few turns of Blackwell
casting threats and Finkel responding with Forbid with buyback, however,
Jon makes a crucial mistake. He chooses not to counter Blackwell's
Rofellos, which ends up costing him the game. On his next turn, Blackwell 
drops a Quirion Ranger, which, in combination with Rofellos, gives him 
the ability to produce a ridiculous amount of mana. He first casts a
Skyshroud Poacher to draw out Finkel's Forbid, then a Natural Order
which resolves. Blackwell sacrifices Rofellos to bring out a Verdant
Force, which effectively ends the first game in his favor.



Blackwell 1, Finkel 0.



Jon again chooses to play first and opens with a couple of Islands and a
Powder Keg. Blackwell's second-turn Null Rod resolves, thus nullifying
Jon's Keg as well as virtually all of his deck's ways for dealing with
permanents. Trevor is unable to apply any pressure, however, mustering
only a Deranged Hermit, which is met with a Forbid. Finkel sees his
window and uses his next turn to cast Morphling with Force of Will
backup as well as a second Morphling in hand. Blackwell's attempt at a 
Choke is countered by the Force and it appears that Jon is in excellent
position. But when Blackwell taps three more mana, Finkel knows what is
coming. "Another Choke?" Blackwell responds in the affirmative, and
although he makes a couple of minor mistakes in subsequent turns,
running his Squallmonger directly into Finkel's Masticore and forgetting
to attack with a couple of creatures for a couple of turns, Jon cannot
recover from the Choke and extends the hand a few turns later.



Blackwell 2, Finkel 0.
