The winner would still have much to do but a 1-2 draft can be momentum destroying.

### Game 1

Tim wins the toss and play first, but Scott goes on the offensive with a [Goblin Taskmaster](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Taskmaster). Tim's 3rd turn regulation morph drop doesn't block the Goblin, and Scott replied in turn with a face down creature of his own. The rule of thumb is not to block morph creatures, as you can often lose your blocker to a first striker, but that proved costly as Tim morphed in his Goblin Commando.

A [Fallen Cleric](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fallen+Cleric) hit Scott once before being traded with a [Symbiotic Elf](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Symbiotic+Elf) as Scott started collecting small 1/1 tokens. Scott was put on a clock with an unblockable [Severed Legion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Severed+Legion) being played. With both players not missing a land drop in turns, spells were at a premium, and an [Aggravated Assault](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aggravated+Assault) seemed out of place. The next turn a [Symbiotic Beast](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Symbiotic+Beast) came off the top and took down a [Battering Craghorn](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Battering+Craghorn) and a morphed creature, leaving Scott with 6 1/1 tokens against a [Severed Legion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Severed+Legion). With Scott on 3 life after a Legion attack, Tim [Misery Charm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Misery+Charm)ed the [Fallen Cleric](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fallen+Cleric) back – an interesting choice with Scott on such low life. With [Solar Blast](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Solar+Blast)s ready, Scott was able to remove the Cleric for a second time and then the legion a turn later leaving him on 1 life. Tim unfortunately could draw nothing but land in the subsequent turns allowing Scott to get the win by the smallest of margins.

**Boarding**

Richards – In, Spurned Wolverine. Out, [Words of Wilding](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Words+of+Wilding).  
 He – No changes.

### Game 2

Again both players drew enough land to be considered real estate, Scott pushing early with a Birchlore Ranger. Tim's Legion blocked the ranger third turn and was removed with a [Solar Blast](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Solar+Blast). Scott's [Symbiotic Elf](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Symbiotic+Elf) was caught with a morphed in [Battering Craghorn](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Battering+Craghorn), Tim was unable to push for any attack with Scott playing true to his curve with a [Barkhide Mauler](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Barkhide+Mauler). The mauler was double blocked, by the Craghorn and the [Fallen Cleric](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fallen+Cleric), trading 2 for 2 with the assistance of a [Goblin Sledder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Sledder).

Scott was then able to drop the Spurned Wolverine and a [Krosan Tusker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Krosan+Tusker), following it with an [Aggravated Assault](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aggravated+Assault). An interesting combo, which gave him a 6/5 first striker which a mana flooded Tim couldn't deal with. 

**Final Result:** Scott Richards defeated Tim 2-0.
