These were the cards that shaped the tournament, that sparked discussions and were the most debated, the cards that won games and turned Grand Prix Copenhagen into an event to remember …


 


**#5 Nourishing Shoal**


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Nourishing+Shoal)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nourishing+Shoal)
 


The plan to get [Griselbrand](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Griselbrand) onto the battlefield via [Goryo's Vengeance](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goryo%27s+Vengeance) or [Through the Breach](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Through+the+Breach) has been around for awhile. However, the addition of [Nourishing Shoal](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nourishing+Shoal) debuted at Grand Prix Charlotte a week ago, and immediately gained a big following, including luminaries like No. 11 Jacob Wilson and No. 15 William Jensen.


 


Once [Griselbrand](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Griselbrand) hits the table and the combo player starts drawing cards, [Nourishing Shoal](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nourishing+Shoal) turns [Worldspine Wurm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Worldspine+Wurm) into 11 extra life, meaning more cards, further [Nourishing Shoal](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nourishing+Shoal)s, and so on. With this improvement, the probability for the deck's infamous turn-two kill increased dramatically, and we were able to witness such drama unfold in the feature match area more than once.

**#4 Gurmag Angler**


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Gurmag+Angler)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gurmag+Angler)
 


The Zombie Fish was an easy pick once we saw how many players were following Patrick Chapin's lead and ran more [Gurmag Angler](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gurmag+Angler) than [Tasigur, the Golden Fang](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tasigur%2C+the+Golden+Fang) in their Grixis Control decks. The blue/black/red deck, a strange hybrid of aggressive, tempo, and control elements, really came into its own this weekend, and put twelve players into Day 2.


 


Still it's funny how the Angler outdid the mighty Tasigur. There are a few reasons at play here: First, the difference between 6 and 7 mana isn't as big a deal when no one is paying full price anyway. Also, a 5/5 matches up nicely with opposing 4/5 creatures like [Siege Rhino](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Siege+Rhino) and Tasigur itself. Furthermore, Tasigur's activated ability isn't activated very often when playing a deck with downward of 21 lands. And finally, [Gurmag Angler](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gurmag+Angler) kills in four turns and sometimes, between [Lightning Bolt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt) and [Kolaghan's Command](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kolaghan%27s+Command), even faster than that.

**#3 Snapcaster Mage**


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Snapcaster+Mage)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snapcaster+Mage)
 


With thirteen copies, [Snapcaster Mage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snapcaster+Mage) was the most played 2-drop in the Top 8. And in reality it was cast way more often than the numbers suggest, since players were routinely returning it via [Kolaghan's Command](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kolaghan%27s+Command). In fact, [Kolaghan's Command](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kolaghan%27s+Command) could have taken this spot just as well. The synergy with [Snapcaster Mage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snapcaster+Mage) even was a two-way street: Sometimes the Command would return the Mage, other times the Mage would grant flashback to the Command, and often both of these things would simply happen one after the other.


 


In any case, this team-up was one of the defining interactions of the format as displayed at Grand Prix Copenhagen, and it was a huge factor in turning a bevy of tradionally blue/red decks to the dark side. The Top 8 alone had one Grixis Delver, one Grixis [Splinter Twin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Splinter+Twin), and one Grixis Control deck, all with at least one [Kolaghan's Command](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kolaghan%27s+Command) and several [Snapcaster Mage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snapcaster+Mage)s.

**#2 Scapeshift**


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Scapeshift)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scapeshift)
 


The deck built around and named for this card had somewhat fallen out of favor in recent times, and [Scapeshift](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scapeshift) was not exactly a popular choice at this Grand Prix either. Between arguably more powerful and definitely more splashy combo choices on one side and a potent as well as popular foil in [Blood Moon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Moon) on the other side, the deck didn't attract a great many players and only put three into Day 2.


 


One of them, however, made it all the way to the finals. Luxembourg's Steve Hatto still believed in the inherent power of a one-card combo and had faith in the deck. Also, he knew that it really was no combo deck at all but should rather be considered a control deck. "Paying four mana for a finisher? In Modern? That's a control thing, isn't it?" Hatto joked.

**#1 Lord of Atlantis**


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Lord+of+Atlantis)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lord+of+Atlantis)
 


[Lord of Atlantis](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lord+of+Atlantis) is as old as Magic and can look back on more top tournament finishes than even the greatest of players. This weekend, the original lord of the Merfolk tribe was able to add another trophy to his decidedly decadent collection. While only four Merfolk decks made it to the second day of the Grand Prix, they immediately swam to the top tables and eventually secured Top 8 berths for both Christoffer Larsen as well as Przemek Knocinski who, of course, went on to win the whole thing.


 


While the sudden success of Merfolk came as quite the surprise, the reasoning behind choosing this deck for this metagame was definitely sound. In a field full of decks that either were working with and off important nonbasic lands or were trying to assemble some sort of combo or were predominantly blue with lots of Islands (or some combination of the three), Merfolk with its reasonable clock, its cheap and efficient disruption including [Spreading Seas](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spreading+Seas), and its mastery of islandwalk proved a deadly weapon.
