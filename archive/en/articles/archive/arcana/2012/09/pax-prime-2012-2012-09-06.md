It was PAX Prime last weekend, and **Magic** made the most of it! Let's look back at the calendar, even starting a few days before PAX. The Wednesday before we held the first-ever [**Magic** Players Championship](/en/events/coverage/watanabe-wins-magic-players-championship), bringing the sixteen best players from around the world to one place to duke it out for the title "Player of the Year."


### Wednesday & Thursday, Aug. 29 & 30, 2012


The **Magic** Players Championship kicked off!

### Friday, Aug. 31, 2012


Yuuya Watanabe is crowned the victor, defeating Shouta Yasooka 3-2 in the finals!

Also, that was the first day of PAX, with our booth open. Since 2009, at PAX, we've thrown a party for the new block and the fall set. This year, our daily allotment of invites to the party was gone within an hour of the event opening.


**Magic Online** even held a special 64-player event at PAX. The event was won by, \*ahem\* The\_Love\_Sponge and he got a number of prizes which included copies of *From the Vault: Realms* both physical and digital..


Also every day at the booth, LoadingReadyRun was there battling against all challengers on **Duels of the Planeswalkers 2013**'s first expansion! Those who defeated a member of LoadingReadyRun walked away with an exclusive PAX t-shirt!

### Saturday, Sept. 1, 2012


The line for the PAX Party went around the block, and apparently people began lining up to get into the party almost six hours before we opened the doors!

Once we opened the doors, hundreds of players, and the Internet as a whole, were given their first real taste of what *Return to Ravnica* holds in store for them!

We also debuted the new *Return to Ravnica* trailer, and when it played every eye in the place was on the screen.

### Sunday, Sept. 2, 2012


While most of the party goers recovered from a Raucous Ravnican good time, 330 packed out the Raven Theater for the Magic R&D Creative Team's World Building Panel. We also live streamed the panel, so in case you missed it here's the recording:

On top of that, at PAX we held a coloring contest using art of either Jace, or Nicol Bolas.
