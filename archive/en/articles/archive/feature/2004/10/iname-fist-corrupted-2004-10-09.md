Send your rules questions to **Magic** Rules Manager [John Carter](javascript:makeWinXY('/company/emailtoauthor.asp?author=John%20Carter&amp;headline=Rules%20Question',500,455);). Can't find the answer to your question somewhere else? Maybe he's already answered it! Try the [Saturday School Searchable Rules Database](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/satschoolarchive).

**Q**: Although they have different 'subnames', [Iname, Life Aspect](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Iname%2C+Life+Aspect) and [Iname, Death Aspect](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Iname%2C+Death+Aspect) technically have the same name and would axe each other due to the new Legendary rule. Is this right? --Hyrum T.




|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Iname, Life Aspect | Iname, Death Aspect |

**A**: No, their names are different. For example, the green Iname is named “Iname, Life Aspect”, not just “Iname”. Though the *Champions* names may be flavored differently than in past sets, we still take the entire contents of that upper left corner [CR 202.1] - the intervening comma doesn't delineate the name.


**\*Extra\*** For more on Inane, check out his [origin story](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=magic/chk/iname). Iname is just the latest in a line of Legendary creatures that evolve over time such as [Ertai, Wizard Adept](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ertai%2C+Wizard+Adept) / [Ertai, the Corrupted](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ertai%2C+the+Corrupted) and [Kamahl, Pit Fighter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kamahl%2C+Pit+Fighter) / [Kamahl, Fist of Krosa](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kamahl%2C+Fist+of+Krosa).


**Q**: Say you attack with [Wicked Akuba](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wicked+Akuba), and they take it. Can you pay 8 black mana and make them lose 8 life? --Jonathan


**A**: Yes, once the Akuba's dealt damage to a player, you can sink as much black mana into the ability as you have (assuming they're still targetable). By comparison, cards like [Pit Imp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pit+Imp) do have a limit, and [Dragon Whelp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragon+Whelp) has a drawback if you go over a limit.


**Q**: If I have a [Heartbeat of Spring](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Heartbeat+of+Spring) or a [Reflecting Pool](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reflecting+Pool), and it copies the mana produced by a [Hall of the Bandit Lord](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hall+of+the+Bandit+Lord), or [Boseiju, Who Shelters All](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Boseiju%2C+Who+Shelters+All), does the copied mana have the extra ability (adding haste or uncounterability) as well? –Ben


**A**: No, the extra effect is not included with the mana. The types of mana are only the five colors of mana and colorless. Extra effects are not a part of the type of mana produced. This includes negative effects, too—with Heartbeat, [Mishra's Workshop](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mishra%27s+Workshop) would produce three-colorless-only-for-artifacts plus one regular colorless.


**Q**: I have two [Floating-Dream Zubera](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Floating-Dream+Zubera)s tokens in play because of [Kiki-Jiki, Mirror Breaker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kiki-Jiki%2C+Mirror+Breaker). Is there an order in which they are sacrificed or are they all sacrificed at the same time? If I play [Wrath of God](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wrath+of+God), do I get two cards for each one, or one for one, then two for the second? –Brad


**A**: Kiki-Jiki tokens will be sacrificed one at a time. Their “at end of turn” triggers will stack on top of each other. When the “at” trigger resolves, you'll sack one, and trigger a draw for one. After drawing, you'll resolve the other “at” trigger and cause a trigger to draw two. Total drawn: three.


For the Wrath version, you'll draw two for each. The zuberas die at the same time, and then their abilities start to resolve. Each one sees that two Zubera have already gone to the graveyard. Total draw: four.


**Q**: Suppose I control [Kiki-Jiki, Mirror Breaker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kiki-Jiki%2C+Mirror+Breaker) and [Academy Rector](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Academy+Rector). Will a dying Rector token trigger, be removed from the game, and fetch me an enchantment from my library? --Jesse McE.


**A**: No, a Mirrored Rector will not exist long enough to fetch an enchantment. When the token is sacrificed, it does go to the graveyard, and the ability does trigger, but just before putting the trigger on the stack, state-based effects check, and the token-not-in-play ceases to exist [CR 420.3 420.5f]. Thus, when the trigger resolves you are unable to meet the “if you do” requirement of removing the Rector's corpse from the game.


**Q**: I remove a divinity counter from [Myojin of Life's Web](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Myojin+of+Life%27s+Web). In my hand I have an [Eternal Witness](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eternal+Witness). Is there a way to play not only the Witness, but also a creature that I bring from my graveyard to my hand with the Witness? --Eric P.


**A**: No. The [Eternal Witness](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eternal+Witness)' triggered ability still needs to go onto the stack and resolve. In short, if the creature card isn't in your hand when you start resolving the Myojin's ability, you won't get to put it into play.


![Horobi, Death's Wail](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Horobi%2C+Death%27s+Wail)**Q**: How does [Horobi, Death's Wail](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Horobi%2C+Death%27s+Wail) interact with the modular ability? I know the placement of the +1/+1 counters is optional, but is the targeting? --Tommy K.
 **A**: Choosing a target for the ability is not optional even though putting counters onto something is. For example, let's say you opponent has oh… three [Arcbound Ravager](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arcbound+Ravager)s. If you target one while Horobi is in play, when Horobi's trigger resolves, that Ravager will be sacrificed. Then that player will have to target one of his artifact creatures with the modular trigger [CR 410.4]. Once the target is chosen, Horobi triggers again, and the process continues. If the opponent had an [Ornithopter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ornithopter) or other non-modular artifact creature, they could stop the cycle of violence by targeting (and thus losing) the [Ornithopter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ornithopter).


**Q**: When I resolve [Cranial Extraction](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cranial+Extraction), could I use this opportunity to see what my opponent's library holds? For instance, if I want to know how may copies of a certain card are in there for [Mindblaze](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mindblaze)? Is this legal? --Hagai R.


**A**: Yes, you search the library, so you see the contents of the library.


**\*Extra\*** In tournaments you are allowed to take notes while in a match, but you must make them quickly. Jot down initials and numbers, but don't take much time or you could invoke the ire of the judges.


**Q**: Does [Konda's Banner](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Konda%27s+Banner) pump the equipped creature? Does a creature share a type with itself? --Geoff F.


**A**: Yes, the equipped Legendary creature will get +1/+1 if it has a type and +1/+1 if it has a color. This bonus will be shared with all creatures with the appropriate type and/or color as applicable.


**\*Extra\*** Note that “Legendary” is a supertype, not a type, so being Legendary doesn't cause pumping. Also note that not all Legendary creatures have a creature type (check the [unemployment roster](/en/articles/archive/kamigawa-kontinued-2004-09-18-0)). And not all Legendary creatures have a color (such as [Karn, Silver Golem](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Karn%2C+Silver+Golem) [Yeah, even though he's silver.]). Karn will still get +1/+1 for having a type (Golem), and [Baron Sengir](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Baron+Sengir) will get +1/+1 for having a color (black).


**Q**: I play [Shatter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shatter) targeting my opponent's [Tatsumasa, the Dragon's Fang](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tatsumasa%2C+the+Dragon%27s+Fang), and in response he pays 6 and makes a blue 5/5 Dragon Spirit, then I play [Smother](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Smother) targeting the token.


Will my [Shatter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shatter) destroy the equipment when it returns to game? --Gustavo M.


**A**: No-- any time a card moves from one zone to another, the game treats it as a brand new object (the keyword “phasing” excepted). The freshly returned Dragon's Fang is not considered the same permanent even though the physical cardboard might be the same.


**Q**: If [Tatsumasa, the Dragon's Fang](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tatsumasa%2C+the+Dragon%27s+Fang) is equipped, and I pay the cost to make it into a 5/5 Dragon Spirit, does the Dragon's Fang come back equipped to my creature? Does the Dragon's Fang come back if the token was removed from the game without hitting the graveyard (with AEther Snap perhaps)? --Chris D


**A**: A returning Dragon's Fang will not be equipped to anything [CR Glossary: Equipment].


If the Dragon Spirit token is not put into a graveyard (ie: it's bounced or removed from the game), the Dragon's Fang will not return to play.

**Q**: I have [Confusion in the Ranks](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Confusion+in+the+Ranks) in play and I play a [Summoner's Egg](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Summoner%27s+Egg) while holding [Phage the Untouchable](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phage+the+Untouchable). My opponent has a [Shatter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shatter) in hand. Can I stack the imprint and the Confusion to imprint Phage and not lose from the [Shatter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shatter)? –Nick


**A**: You control both cards, so you may stack both the triggers as you wish. If you stack “Imprint — When [Summoner's Egg](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Summoner%27s+Egg) comes into play, you may…” and then stack the Confusion trigger on top of it (you stack your own triggers in any order [CR 410.3]), then you'll resolve the Confusion trigger, and then resolve the imprint trigger. This way, Phage doesn't get imprinted on the Egg until your opponent controls it, so you're not in any danger of losing.


Do note that your opponent will have the opportunity to [Shatter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shatter) the Egg before the imprint trigger resolves. He could even [Shatter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shatter) it before the Confusion trigger resolves, to stop the exchange from happening and keep the artifact you're trying to steal.


![Synod Sanctum](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Synod+Sanctum)**Q**: I have a [Synod Sanctum](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Synod+Sanctum) in play, and I have removed some of my permanents from the game. My opponent tries to destroy the Sanctum, so I bounce it back to my hand. Can I replay the Sanctum, and then sacrifice it to return those permanents to play, or do they cease to exist once the Sanctum leaves play? --Theron M.
 **A**: The cards would not be returned to play. Though they'd still exist as cards (not permanents [CR 214.1]), the new [Synod Sanctum](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Synod+Sanctum) doesn't know anything about its previous life.


**Q**: Can a [Shunt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shunt) shunt a [Counterspell](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterspell) onto itself? If you can, doesn't that make the target illegal because [Shunt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shunt) has already resolved? Have I found a way to counter a [Last Word](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Last+Word)? -- B. R. C.


**A**: Itself? Depends on your pronoun reference. Ok, let's spell this one out: You can [Shunt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shunt) a [Counterspell](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterspell) so it targets the [Shunt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shunt). The [Shunt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shunt) then leaves the stack, and the game will counter the [Counterspell](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterspell) for lack of target [CR 413.2a].


You cannot shunt a [Counterspell](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterspell) so the [Counterspell](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterspell) targets itself. Spells are not allowed to target themselves [CR Glossary: Target].


Yes, this means you can cause a [Last Word](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Last+Word) to be countered. [Last Word](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Last+Word) says that it can't be countered *by spells or abilities*. Counter for lack of target (often called “fizzle”) is a game rule that's doing the countering, and a game rule is neither a spell nor ability.


**Q**: Does [March of the Machines](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=March+of+the+Machines) kill artifact lands that are indestructible? If so can I make a [Darksteel Colossus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Darksteel+Colossus) a 0/0 and make him go to the graveyard? --Malcolm H.


**A**: Yes and yes-ish (the Colossus will get shuffled in instead of put into the graveyard). Putting zero-or-less-toughness creatures into the graveyard is a state-based effect, not a “destroy” effect [CR 420.5b].


**Q**: When someone is trying to destroy my [Clone](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Clone) of a [Darksteel Colossus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Darksteel+Colossus) do I shuffle the [Clone](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Clone) back into my library or does it die? --Tommy C.


**A**: A [Clone](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Clone)d [Darksteel Colossus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Darksteel+Colossus) would get shuffled back into your library. “Destroy” isn't a likely way to kill a Colossus, so let's just pretend some cruel person Edicted you.


**Q**: If I play [Grab the Reins](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grab+the+Reins) with entwine can I take my opponent's [Avatar of Woe](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Avatar+of+Woe), tap it to destroy his our creature, and then sac it to the entwine and do 6 damage to other creature? –Sam


**A**: No, once [Grab the Reins](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grab+the+Reins) starts resolving you have to finish resolving it (taking a guy and tossing a guy) before you get priority to do anything else.


**Q**: Suppose my opponent has an [Upwelling](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Upwelling) in play and we've both accumulated a ridiculous amount of mana. I have a [Mindslaver](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mindslaver) in play. Can I activate it, targeting myself, and then on my next turn destroy his [Upwelling](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Upwelling), killing him but not me? --Nathan McC.


**A**: No. The rule avoiding mana burn only applies to a player “while another player controls his or her turn” [CR 507.4]. Since you're still controlling your turn, you'll still mana burn like normal.


**Q**: If a creature like [Warbreak Trumpeter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Warbreak+Trumpeter) has a morphing ability that includes two X's and a mountain what do the two X's mean? –Judy


**A**: The ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20160829100442im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/x.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20160829100442im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/x.gif) means you have to choose an amount for X, then pay ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227130159im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/red.gif) plus **twice** that X amount. In [Warbreak Trumpeter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Warbreak+Trumpeter)'s case, let's say you wanted three Goblin tokens. Then the X would be three, and the mana you'd have to spend is (![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227130050im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless3.gif) + ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227130050im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless3.gif) + ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227130159im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/red.gif))… ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161005045835im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless6.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227130159im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/red.gif).


**Q**: If I have [Dralnu's Crusade](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dralnu%27s+Crusade) in play, along with [Noxious Ghoul](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Noxious+Ghoul), would a Goblin that enters play trigger the Ghoul's ability, or just become a Zombie afterwards and not trigger the ability? –Nathan


**A**: The ability triggers. Continuous effects (such as [Dralnu's Crusade](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dralnu%27s+Crusade)) apply even as creatures come into play. Thus, the Goblin enters play as a “Creature – Goblin Zombie” that is black and gets +1/+1.


![Volrath's Laboratory](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Volrath%27s+Laboratory)**Q**: [Volrath's Laboratory](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Volrath%27s+Laboratory) allows me to make tokens of the creature type of my choice. Since [Island Fish Jasconius](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island+Fish+Jasconius) has the creature type "Island," I assume I can then make Island tokens If I cast [Echoing Truth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Echoing+Truth) on one of these tokens, what happens to lands with the name "Island" that are in play? --Arlen S.
 **A**: Actually, [Island Fish Jasconius](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island+Fish+Jasconius) is a “Creature — Island-Fish”. The hyphen makes this a single creature type, which doesn't match either Island or Fish. So Islands will not be affected, but any other creatures named Island-Fish are toast.


**Q**: If I have a [Goblin Bombardment](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Bombardment) and [Spirit Mirror](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spirit+Mirror) in play during my upkeep can I infinitely sacrifice a creature to the Bombardment and keep getting a creature from the Mirror since it is still out it play. --Frank G.


**A**: No, the current wording for the Mirror triggers “At the beginning of your upkeep”. Since your upkeep only begins once each turn, it can only make one Reflection per turn. (The card originally said “during your upkeep”, which makes it less clear… but it has always been designed to work this way).


**Q**: If I have a [Samite Healer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Samite+Healer) and my opponent attacks with a [Serra Angel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Serra+Angel) with [Gratuitous Violence](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gratuitous+Violence) in play, how much damage do I take? Is it 4 x 2 = 8 then prevent 1 (take 7) or is it prevent 1 then 3 x 2 = 6? –Darren


**A**: It's your choice [CR 419.9a]. Since you're the player affected (you're about to get smashed), you decided which order to apply the replacement (GV) and the prevention (SH) to the event that's affecting you. If you apply the prevention first, then you double the remaining three into six. If you apply the doubling first, then you'll prevent one of the eight and take seven. The key with replacements and prevention is who controls the affected permanent or is the affected player—whose turn it is doesn't matter.


**\*Extra\*** If you were being attacked by a 1/1 instead, you block with the [Samite Healer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Samite+Healer) and then prevent one to the Healer. Because you control the Samite you'll make the choice about how to apply the replacement and prevention affecting it. You could prevent the one and then double zero into zero. 


### Feeling a Little Sick?

Getting pulled through the vacuous reaches of time and space is hard on most beings. Typically all they want to do is sit down and rest. [Polar Kraken](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Polar+Kraken), [Skyshroud Behemoth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skyshroud+Behemoth), and [Leviathan](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leviathan) are so tuckered out that they even take a nap. To help convey this particular syndrome, people often use the phrase “summoning sick”. But what exactly is summoning sickness? Have a seat in the waiting room, and Dr. John Carter will be with your shortly. [Cue ER theme song]

Let's start with the textbook definition of summoning sickness from the Comprehensive Rules Glossary:


> 
> Summoning Sickness (Informal)  
>  The term “summoning sickness” is an informal term which describes a creature's inability to attack or to use activated abilities that include the tap symbol when it has come under a player's control since the beginning of that player's most recent turn. See rule 212.3d. See also Haste.
> 
> 
> 

Summoning sickness is **Magic's** common cold. “Common cold” isn't a technical statement so much as an idea of what's going on with your runny nose and achy body. Likewise, saying something is “summoning sick” is a flavorful way of saying that you haven't controlled a given creature continuously since the start of your most recent turn and thereby the creature is unable to attack or to use abilities with the tap symbol.

![Saproling Burst](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Saproling+Burst)**Q**: When I bring in tokens with [Saproling Burst](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Saproling+Burst) by removing a fade counter, can those creatures attack the turn they come into play? –Rob
 **Q**: If you return creatures directly from your graveyard to play with a spell such as [Patriarch's Bidding](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Patriarch%27s+Bidding) can those creatures attack and/or tap the turn they are put back into play? --Jon H.


**A**: No, the new creatures haven't been under your control continuously since you began your turn.


**Q**: What does “unaffected by summoning sickness” mean? **A**: Creatures with that wording such as the *Mirage* [Talruum Minotaur](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Talruum+Minotaur) predate the introduction of “haste”. The *Sixth Edition* [Talruum Minotaur](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Talruum+Minotaur) is functionally the same but has the haste keyword instead. Both wordings mean that the creature can be used to tap or attack regardless of how long a player has controlled it. Symptom by symptom:

* Summoning sickness applies to creatures—non-creatures can track if they have been under you control since the start of the turn, but summoning sickness doesn't apply unless they become creatures. This is why you can't attack with a [Blinkmoth Nexus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blinkmoth+Nexus) you just played; activating it is fine, but once it becomes animated, the sickness sets in, and you won't be able to attack with or tap it. If you controlled the Nexus since you started the turn, then animating it wouldn't cause any problems since it know you've controlled it continuously since the turn began.
* Summoning sickness “wears off” when you start your turn—any creatures you control at that time will be ready to go.
* If a creature leaves your control and comes back, it becomes sick again—this is why you'll see the word “continuously” when talking about controlling sick creatures.
* Using abilities with the tap symbol and attacking are not allowed.
* Using abilities with no tap symbol (such as the sacrifice ability on Arcbound Ravager) and blocking as perfectly fine.
* An ability whose Oracle text says to tap a creature without the tap symbol itself works fine with sick and non-sick creatures. [Azami, Lady of Scrolls](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Azami%2C+Lady+of+Scrolls) does this with wizards, and [Earthcraft](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Earthcraft) does this with any creature.

There you have it all bandaged up. When people talk about things having summoning sickness, they're using a simple phrase to describe a series of complex interactions. Once you start a turn with a creature, it'll be feeling better and be ready to do your bidding.

Class dismissed.
