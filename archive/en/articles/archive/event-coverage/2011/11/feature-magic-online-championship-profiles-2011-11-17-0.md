### Florian Pils / flying man

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/worlds11/mocs_pils.jpg)Season 3 winner   
 SOM Block Sealed

**Age:** 24   
**Hometown:** Munich, Germany   
**Clan:** M Bork

**How long have you been playing Magic:**
  
 My first sanctioned tournament was in 2000 -- probably bought the first pack some years before. I think it was Sixth Edition.

**How long have you been playing Magic Online:**
  
 When I started, *Onslaught* was the current draft format, no idea what year that was.

**Magic accomplishments: (PTs, GPs, Nats, etc):**
  
 One Worlds Top 8, three Grand Prix Top 8, two Nationals Top 8

**Magic Online accomplishments:**
  
 None.

**What is the meaning behind your screen name?**
  
 Nothing special. I just think it's a cool and fun card with nice flavor text.

**Tell us something about the deck drafted to win your slot in the MOCS.** 
  
 I was too late so I got a random first pick, after that got passed [Mortarpod](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mortarpod) and [Viridian Corrupter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Viridian+Corrupter) and drafted green-black infect. I think I drew the Corrupter in nearly every game :)

**How are you preparing for Worlds and for the MOCS?**
  
 I don't have much time because of university, but I'll probably play a little bit on MTGO. I hope to get a decklist from people who were able to test more.

**What are your goals for the weekend of Worlds?**
  
 Winning some extra money beside the $4000 for 9th -12th place would be nice. Top 24 in the main event would give me Level 4 for 2012, that would be cool too.

### Bing Luke / Prolepsis9

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/worlds11/mocs_luke.jpg)Season 4 winner   
 Standard

**Age:** 31   
**Hometown:** New York, NY   
**Clan:** #goodgamery (efnet)

**How long have you been playing Magic:**
  
 I only played "Magic: Offline" for a couple years during *The Dark* through *Mirage*. The rest has been almost purely online.

**Magic accomplishments: (PTs, GPs, Nats, etc):**
  
 Unlike some with, say three GP Top 8 and a Worlds Top 8, I am a lowly Level 31 Invoker with only a couple PTQ finals appearances to my name. 

**Magic Online accomplishments:**
  
 I am the consensus best-looking player to qualify for MOCS twice. 

**What is the meaning behind your screen name?**
  
 There's not really any meaning behind it.

**Tell us something about the deck you played to win your slot in the MOCS.** 
  
 I qualified with pre-ban Caw-Blade. I don't think there were any key picks besides having four Stoneforge Mystics and Jace, the Mind Sculptor. It was pretty clearly the best deck at the time and I had to beat two mirrors in the Top 8 to get here. 

**How are you preparing for Worlds and for the MOCS?**
  
 I've been mashing drafts and trying to figure out Standard, which is surprisingly hard. It turns out that a lot of the data from Magic Online and various real-world events (like Star City Games Opens) are just more noise to have to wade through. My plan is to familiarize myself with the main archetypes to put myself in a position to audible (deck or sideboard) into a 75 that puts me in position to win.

**What are your goals for the weekend of Worlds?**
  
 In hindsight, I went into last year's Worlds with a just-happy-to-be-here attitude that cost me a lot that weekend, both off- and online. I'm setting my sights on a trophy this year.

### Yuki Yoshioka / yoshidora

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/worlds11/mocs_yoshioka.jpg)Season 5 winner   
 Urza's Block Sealed

**Age**: 25   
**Hometown**: Saitama, Murabito

**How long have you been playing Magic:** 11 Years

**How long have you been playing Magic Online:** Since the beta test.

**Magic accomplishments: (PTs, GPs, Nats, etc):** None

**Magic Online accomplishments:** Qualifying for the MOCS.

**What is the meaning behind your screen name?**
  
 I named myself "yoshidora" because I like Doraemon.

**Tell us something about the deck you played to win your slot in the MOCS.** 
  
 In the final match, a made an attack that killed my opponent's Academy Rector – and he searched for Opposition. The Opposition was tapping down all of my creatures, but I was able to win the match with Fodder Cannon.

**How did you prepare for Worlds and for the MOCS?**
  
 Magic Online only.

**What are your goals for the weekend of Worlds?**
  
 Enjoy playing Magic!

### David Caplan / Goobafish

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/worlds11/mocs_caplan.jpg)Season 6 winner   
*Scars of Mirrodin* Block Sealed

**Age:** 23   
**Hometown:** Toronto, Ontario   
**Clan:** Beach House Central

**How long have you been playing Magic:**
  
 Since Urza's

**How long have you been playing Magic Online:**
  
 Since *Shards of Alara*

 Grand Prix Chicago Top 8

**Magic Online accomplishments:**
  
 Winning the *Scars of Mirrodin* Sealed MOCS.

**What is the meaning behind your screen name?**
  
 I don't remember, I've been using the same one forever. I just like the way it sounds I guess.

**Tell us something about the deck drafted to win your slot in the MOCS.** 
  
 I ended up drafting an archetype that I wasn't used to, green-white. Props must go to [Marrow Shards](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Marrow+Shards) as it won me Game 3 of the finals by hitting two [Plague Stinger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plague+Stinger)s.

**How are you preparing for Worlds and for the MOCS?**
  
 Lots of Magic Online. Working with the Canadian National Team and the rest of the crew that is qualified for Worlds for Constructed.

**What are your goals for the weekend of Worlds?**
  
 Winning the MOCS would be a good start.....

### Ricky Sidher / \_\_SipItHolla

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/worlds11/mocs_sidher.jpg)Season 7 winner   
*Scars of Mirrodin* Block Constructed

**Age:** 19   
**Hometown:** Yuba City, California   
**Clan:** New Times/WeDidtheMath

**How long have you been playing Magic:**
  
 I have been playing **Magic** ever since *Darksteel*. I took a break after the bannings on the affinity cards, and I got back in with *Saviors of Kamigawa*.

**How long have you been playing Magic Online:**
  
 I would like to say I have been playing MTGO for two years, and it has improved my game a lot and at the same time has given me so many more opportunities to qualify for the Pro Tour. 

**Magic accomplishments: (PTs, GPs, Nats, etc):**
  
 I won money in my first Pro Tour in Berlin, made Day Two of Philadelphia, and finished in the Top 4 at Grand Prix San Diego last weekend.

**Magic Online accomplishments:**
  
 I have won three online PTQs and one MOCS, which was good enough to be called a true MTGO legend in one of Reid Duke's articles.

**What is the meaning behind your screen name?**
  
 The meaning behind my screen name was really just to piss off my friend Michael Hetrick (\_Shipitholla). It was also an inside joke from Grand Prix Seattle that I can't remember off the top of my head

**Tell us something about the deck you played to win your slot in the MOCS.** 
  
 The deck I played in the MOCS I won was Blue-black Tezzeret in Scars of Mirrodin Block Constructed. The deck was pretty much a traditional build of Tezz at the time, and it was an easy deck to board with, which in my opinion is so much more important in a smaller metagame. I played the deck because I had played it in Pro Tour Nagoya, and I felt like it was a good choice with three byes, because I expected Puresteel decks to beat the [Tempered Steel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tempered+Steel) decks in the early rounds. 

**How are you preparing for Worlds and for the MOCS?**
  
 I have been talking to numerous people that I've met online and from my travels to Pro Tours and other high-level magic events. I can't really hope to bum a list of Hetrick like I always do and beat him with it.

**What are your goals for the weekend of Worlds?**
  
 My number one priority is to become the 2011 MOCS champion and qualify for next year's new World Championship that way. I also really want to do well in Worlds itself. Another one of my goals is to not go crazy by playing 29 rounds of high-level magic over three days.

### Thoralf Severin /Toffel

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/worlds11/mocs_severin.jpg)Season 8 winner   
 Legacy

**Age:** 24   
**Hometown:** Berlin, Germany

**How long have you been playing Magic:**
  
 Since Nemesis, some classmates played with some funny looking cards. They all dropped it pretty fast. I didn't and I won't ;)

**How long have you been playing Magic Online:**
  
 Since Pro Tour Honolulu. I never really wanted (an account) before but it was free with some boosters and it's pretty nice to draft in the comfort of your own home.

**Magic accomplishments: (PTs, GPs, Nats, etc):**
  
 Nationals Top 8

**Magic Online accomplishments:**
  
 Since I only play some drafts and the release stuff, winning MOCS is pretty big ;)

**What is the meaning behind your screen name?**
  
 People call me that, well actually only the **Magic**-playing friends. It somehow evolved and stuck.

**Tell us something about the deck you played to win your slot in the MOCS.**
  
 I stopped playing Constructed seriously quite some time ago and I only play once a year for Nationals. Normally I will take a funny (but pretty badly built) deck and finish somewhere in the middle. Since I had not a single idea what to play I asked a friend of mine, David Kaufmann. He is a genius. He told me to play Merfolk because its nuts against anything that's blue.

**How are you preparing for Worlds and for the MOCS?**
  
 Well... yeah I will use almost all the time leading up to it to get a good insight into the Constructed formats. I rock at drafting though ;)

**What are your goals for the weekend of Worlds?**
  
 Well, it would be nice to win both. Since that is pretty unreal I'll go with hoping that I have no reason to be mad about myself at the end of the day

### Benny Soewanda / HeavenX

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/worlds11/mocs_soewanda.jpg)Season 9 winner   
 Magic 2012 Sealed

**Age:** 25   
**Hometown:** Surabaya, Indonesia   
**Clan:** Indostructible

**How long have you been playing Magic:**
  
 I've been playing Magic since *Urza's Saga*.

**How long have you been playing Magic Online:**
  
 I played Magic Online since last year, to practice for 2010 Worlds. About two weeks before this year's Season 9 was over my friend told me that this season format would be Sealed Deck so I opened my Magic Online account again especially for this event.

**Magic accomplishments: (PTs, GPs, Nats, etc):**
  
 2007 - 2010 Nationals Top 8 (I lost my Top 8 this year :( )

**Magic Online accomplishments:**
  
 Winning MOCS session 9 after first-picking [Swamp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swamp) in the Top 8 draft, I guess :P

**What is the meaning behind your screen name?**
  
 HeavenX is the name of card shop and team that I built few years ago, but the shop was closed few years ago and the team already dismissed.

**Tell us something about the deck drafted to win your slot in the MOCS.** 
  
 In the Sealed portion I got a crazy pool: [Gideon Jura](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gideon+Jura), [Archon of Justice](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Archon+of+Justice), [Aegis Angel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aegis+Angel) and [Sorin's Vengeance](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sorin%27s+Vengeance), So everyone already knows that's how I won (the) Sealed portion. But in (the) Draft portion, lots of bad things happened. There were some PM that caused a blank message window block my pick so I had to reject all PM. I already locked my choice to first-pick to [Cudgel Troll](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cudgel+Troll) but then [Swamp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swamp) got picked...The MVP for draft portion is Primeval Hydra + [Lure](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lure).

**How are you preparing for Worlds and for the MOCS?**
  
 I don't know why but suddenly I got too busy this end of the year, so I don't have enough time to practice my Magic but I'll play some Modern in Magic Online, because there's no one playing that format here in Indonesia.

**What are your goals for the weekend of Worlds?**
  
 The main goal is to have fun of course, then to have a better record than last year (4-2, 4-2, 1-5)

### Andrew Cuneo / Gainsay

 Won the first online PT qualifier

**What is the meaning behind your screen name?**

### Reid Duke / reiderrabbit

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/worlds11/mocs_duke.jpg)Player of the Year   
 Standard

**Age:** 22   
**Hometown:** Sugar Loaf, NY   
**Clan:** Newtimes

**How long have you been playing Magic:**
  
 17 Years

**How long have you been playing Magic Online:**
  
 4 Years

**Magic accomplishments: (PTs, GPs, Nats, etc):**
  
 Top 8 Grand Prix Providence and Grand Prix Montreal

**Magic Online accomplishments:**
  
 5th Place 2010 MOCS, nine online PTQ Top 8s, two wins

**What is the meaning behind your screen name?**
  
 A friend called me Reiderrabbit when I was a kid and it stuck. People sometimes also get a kick out of the fact that it's a misspelling of Reader Rabbit, who's a cartoon character who teaches kids to read and write.

**Tell us something about the deck you played to win your slot in the MOCS.** 
  
 I played Blue-black Control in Zendikar/Scars Standard. That was a tough format with a wide variety of decks capable of a wide variety of nut draws and Blue-black Control was the only deck with enough answers and disruption to handle them all. In particular, it was the only deck I was happy to play against Splinter-Twin.

**How are you preparing for Worlds and for the MOCS?**
  
 Playing MTGO every second that I can. I'm sticking to drafts, gold queues, and private games so my decklists aren't published.

**What are your goals for the weekend of Worlds?**
  
 My goal is to do better in each event than I did last year. I'm hoping that a 10-8 record in the main event will make me a Level 4 pro for next year. That may not sound difficult, but I've played five Pro Tours before this and never yet finished with a winning record. The MOCS is definitely my main focus, though. I'd be happy to have a 7-4 record after the eleven rounds. From my experience last year, that may or may not be good enough to make the finals, but even if I finish third or fourth, that's a record I can be proud of in a field full of such tough players.
