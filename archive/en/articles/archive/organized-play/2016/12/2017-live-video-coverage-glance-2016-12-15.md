 Mike Rosenberg is a writer and gamer and has been part of the Magic text coverage team since 2011. He joined Wizards as organized play’s content specialist in June 2014. 






With the end of the year almost here, this will be the final Organized Play article to come from me for 2016. I'll be back after DailyMTG reruns and once *Aether Revolt* previews run their course.


I leave you with three final things this year: a tease of 2017's live video coverage schedule, a look at the Grand Prix T-shirt you'll find on prize walls starting at [Grand Prix Louisville](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/premierplay/grandprix/fact-sheet-gplou17), and some more Regional Pro Tour Qualifier Top 8 decklists.


2017 Live Video Coverage Teaser
===============================


Personally, I am very excited for 2017. There are lots of great things on the horizon, some fantastic work trips coming up (I'm looking at you, Kyoto!), and a Pro Tour Team Series making its debut with a soft launch very, very soon.


2017 is also going to be a fun year for fans who want to watch top tournament *Magic* action from home. While 2016 presented a few challenges, 2017 presents a step up, with more shows receiving live video coverage and a lot of exciting tournaments to dig into as a result of our official partnership with Twitch.


Coverage for tournaments listed below are what you'll find on [twitch.tv/magic](https://www.twitch.tv/magic), our official home for all English-language coverage of *Magic*'s premier play events!


We'll be going into greater detail on our plans for 2017 coverage with you in January, and that will include a broad look at the year, our plans for both video and written coverage, and more. But in the meantime, here's what you can look forward to in January and February!


**January 7–8**: Super Sunday Series Championship (Multiple Formats) and an *Aether Revolt* Pre-Prerelease  
**January 28–29**: [Grand Prix Prague](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/premierplay/grandprix/fact-sheet-gppra17) (Limited)  
**February 3–5**: [Pro Tour *Aether Revolt*](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/premierplay/protour/ptaer) in Dublin, Ireland (Standard/Booster Draft)  
**February 11–12**: Grand Prix Pittsburgh (Standard)  
**February 18–19**: Grand Prix Vancouver (Modern)  
**February 25–26**: Grand Prix Utrecht (Standard)


Keep your eyes peeled in January for an even bigger announcement, but in the meantime, mark your calendars for those, and we'll see you next year in our Twitch channel!


The Grand Prix Prize Wall T-Shirt for *Aether Revolt*
=====================================================


With *Aether Revolt* previews trickling out now and more to come, now's a great time to show off what you can get from a Grand Prix prize wall starting at Grand Prix Louisville. Take a look at the art for this one!

In fitting fashion, the Grand Prix T-shirt continues its very heavy metal look and feel with the [Master of Metal](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/feature/aether-revolt-packaging-promos-and-planeswalker-decks-2016-12-05) himself.


This is a Grand Prix exclusive, and it'll only be available through Grand Prix Mexico City (April 8–9, 2017), so if you want one for yourself, plan your travel to a Grand Prix near you in the first quarter of 2017!
