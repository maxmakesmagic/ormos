Five -hundred thirty players have come to Sendai this weekend, looking for a piece of the money and Pro Tour points up for grabs. In the wake of Masashiro Kuroda's Pro Tour win in Kobe last month, Japan has the monkey off its back, and its future has never looked brighter. Grand Prix tournaments have always been a fixture of Japanese Magic, and now they not only serve as a proving ground for Japan's best, but they will show the world who they should watch out for next. Kazumasa Shiki is a prime example of this, as he followed his Grand Prix Okayama win in January with a ninth place finish in Kobe. This is no longer a tournament for national bragging rights, but a stepping stone to international success- and the rest of the world's Magic players would be well served to take notice. Today will feature eight rounds of *Mirrodin* Block Sealed, cutting to tomorrow's Booster Draft. Stay with our live coverage all weekend to see who comes out on top.
