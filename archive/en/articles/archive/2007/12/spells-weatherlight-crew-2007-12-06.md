The*Weatherlight* Saga had a strong impact on the flavor of sets from *Visions* through *Apocalypse*. Over those years the crew of the skyship *Weatherlight* changed, but many characters are recognizable as being part of that famous crew.


Just about every one of the crew had one or more cards themed to their characters in name and art. Check out these crew members and the cards that were associated with them. (Note that most of the characters were not mages, so it is not assumed that they were able to *cast* these spells.)

Crovax the Cursed

Note that Crovax never had a card named "Crovax's [Whatever]." *Tempest's* [Evincar's Justice](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Evincar%27s+Justice) probably doesn't count, since it depicts Volrath as evincar, which was before Crovax's reign.
