During Round 6 of Pro Tour *Ixalan*, competitor Huang Hao-Shan was disqualified from the tournament for intentional misrepresentation of the game state. Below is a statement from the tournament's head official:


"When Huang was in a disadvantageous position on the battlefield, after activating the ability for Longtusk Cub, the indicator for the amount of energy the player had at resolution was not indicative of [the] cost that was supposed to be paid. Once this happened, it was brought to the attention of tournament officials.


This led to a thorough discussion with players to determine whether the action was intentional. As the error in regard to the energy spent benefited Huang, and because the detailed investigation could not clarify that this was simply a mistake, the decision was ruled that the action was a misrepresentation of the game state, and to preserve the integrity of the tournament, the player was disqualified."
