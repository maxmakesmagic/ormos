**An endless war rages in the heavens.**


*The skies blacken and crackle with dark magic. Bellows of grim laughter drown out the beating of black, leathery wings. The demons have come.*


*Then, a ray of golden light pierces the darkness. A flight of angels arrives, swords gleaming. The champions of law have arrived to cleanse the sky.*


*Now, planeswalker, you will wage this eternal battle between good and evil against one of your own kind. Which celestial force will prevail?*


These ready-to-play 60-card decks showcase some of the best and most beloved **Magic** cards that the forces of light and dark have to offer. *Duel Decks: Divine vs. Demonic* has ten rare cards and showcases seven cards with new artwork, including foil alternate-art versions of Akroma, Angel of Wrath and Lord of the Pit.
