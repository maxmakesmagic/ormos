The April 28, 2016 Update
=========================

The Daily *Magic* Update is a roundup of everything *Magic* you should know on April 28, 2016. Today's Update is brought to you by the [Pro Tour Gauntlet](http://magic.wizards.com/en/MTGO/articles/archive/magic-online/pro-tour-gauntlet-shadows-over-innistrad-2016-04-26), which is currently available on *Magic Online* and, thanks to an awesome Pro Tour, is just great.


Today's Must
============


1. [Standard's Top 8 Improved Cards and Top 8 Decks You Haven't Seen](http://magic.tcgplayer.com/db/article.asp?ID=13241&writer=Adam+Yurchick&articledate=4-28-2016) | TCGPlayer | Adam Yurchick

Still basking in the glow of an incredible Top 8, most articles are analyzing what happened. But not Adam Yurchick. No, Adam Yurchick is an enterprising writer, boldly blazing new trails, pushing boundaries, and extending the reach of human knowledge.


Or he's just one of the first to start looking ahead at the effects of [Pro Tour *Shadows over Innistrad*](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/ptsoi). The article does pretty much what the title says—introducing (or re-introducing) the reader to eight cards that improved with this weekend, plus the best decks that are flying under the radar right now. With a diverse Standard metagame highlighting the weekend, there's a lot of room for exploration—and Bold Adam Yurchick is just the person for the job.


For another take on a similar topic, Josh Silvestri at ChannelFireball looked at [five lessons from the Pro Tour](http://www.channelfireball.com/articles/5-important-lessons-from-pro-tour-shadows-over-innistrad/) as well. But eight is more than five, so Enterprising Adam Yurchick takes the spot.


After That, Read, Watch, or Listen to These
===========================================


1. [Goggles, For the Win!](http://www.mtgmintcard.com/articles/writers/joel-larsson/goggles-for-the-win) | MTGMintCard | Joel Larsson

"Burn you for 36."—What are things actually said by Joel Larsson at the Pro Tour?


Larsson, who put up a Top 16 finish at Pro Tour *Shadows over Innistrad*, discusses the deck that got him there—the same Red-Green Goggles Ramp deck that Brad Nelson parlayed into a Top 8 finish. It includes an incredibly thorough deck and sideboard guide as well that will get you right up to speed on the deck. So it's basically like cheating.


And if you love this deck, or are at least interested, Brad Nelson also has [an article about his 6th-place finish](http://www.starcitygames.com/article/32827_Pro-Tour-Shadows-Over-Innistrad-6th.html) at the Pro Tour on StarCityGames.com—but it's under Premium (subscription required).

SCG Tour ringer Jim Davis is a huge fan of Cube, and in this article he reveals which cards from *Shadows over Innistrad* will—and maybe won't—make the cut in his cube.


1. [Against the Odds: Horror(able) Dredge](http://www.mtggoldfish.com/articles/against-the-odds-horror-able-dredge) | MTGGoldfish | SaffronOlive

I'm not going to make any horrible puns, I promi...


What's that? That one counts? Okay, fine. One horrible pun. But after that, just watch this fun Against the Odds where Saffon Olive takes a horrible deck through the...what's that? I did it again?


Fine. It's a fun deck. Watch it. Check out the deck tech. See [The Gitrog Monster](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=The+Gitrog+Monster) and [Geralf's Masterpiece](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Geralf%27s+Masterpiece) team up to do—things.


1. [The Modern Perspective: Thoroughly Unprofessional](http://puremtgo.com/articles/modern-perspective-thoroughly-unprofessional) | PureMTGO | Christopher Giovannagelo

Point-by-point-by-point-by-point, Christopher Giovannagelo (type that three times fast!) walks through the article by Aaron Forsythe detailing "[Where Modern Goes from Here](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/ptsoi/where-modern-goes-from-here-2016-04-24)." He offers some quite in-depth analysis of what the announcement means to Modern aficionados and to the format. And then there's a [Writ of Passage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Writ+of+Passage) image. Because.


And while we're at it, Oliver Law has another take on the same issue in [his article](http://puremtgo.com/articles/modern-musings-no-more-pro-tours-anymore), also posted last night.


What to Watch Tonight
=====================


1. [Community Super League Debut](https://www.twitch.tv/magic)

The Community Super League—a new show demonstrating the fun side of *Magic* with an amazing group of streamers, personalities, and community members battling in a variety of formats—debuts tonight at 6 p.m. PT (9 p.m. ET) on [twitch.tv/magic](https://www.twitch.tv/magic)!


Tonight the crew will be battling through the [Pro Tour Gauntlet](http://magic.wizards.com/en/MTGO/articles/archive/magic-online/pro-tour-gauntlet-shadows-over-innistrad-2016-04-26)! What crew, you might ask? Check out this snazzy trailer to get hyped.

Eternal Weekend—the weekend that features the Vintage and Legacy Championships—was announced yesterday afternoon with a tweaked schedule. The three-day event will feature the Swiss rounds of Vintage on Friday, the Legacy Swiss on Saturday, and both Top 8s on Sunday. Plus it's been moved to Columbus, Ohio—I can only assume because the organizers really wanted to go to the world-famous [Columbus Zoo](https://www.columbuszoo.org/) and see their [adorable polar bear cub, Nina](https://www.columbuszoo.org/home/animals/meet-our-animals/nora-polar-bear).


And that's what starts happening when you Google Columbus, Ohio. I'm shocked every day that Wizards of the Coast pays me to do this.

Cue training montage.


But, seriously, if you haven't checked out *Enter the Battlefield* yet, that's probably a thing you should do. You can view it on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCm-rRUwNGk) (for free) or [Netflix](https://www.netflix.com/title/80104065) (if you have a subscription).

This is just so weird and cool. David Williams, most often seen in the *Magic* world [Top 4ing team tournaments](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/gpsj15) with Paul Reitzl and Matt Sperling, is going to be on *Master Chef*, because apparently he's also a fantastic cook in addition to being moderately famous.


I want his life. He gets paid to be yelled at by Gordon Ramsay. I just get paid to look up facts about Columbus, Ohio.


Deck of the Day
===============


1. [Sultai Midrange](http://magic.wizards.com/en/MTGO/articles/archive/magic-online/pro-tour-gauntlet-shadows-over-innistrad-2016-04-26#Kowalski)

While I'm partial to Esper and Jeskai, I'll get my Sultai on now and then when the mood is right. It can be my jam.


The mood definitely struck Grzegorz Kowalski at Pro Tour *Shadows over Innistrad*, where he went 8-2 in Standard with his Sultai Midrange deck featuring a slew of value creatures, removal, and a few planeswalkers. Kowalski skillfully built a deck no one was looking at and battled among the best in the world with it, choosing a bevy of powerful cards.


Seriously, the list reads like a "who's who" of the most impactful cards in Standard. [Ob Nixilis Reignited](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ob+Nixilis+Reignited). [Dragonlord Silumgar](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragonlord+Silumgar). [Kalitas, Traitor of Ghet](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kalitas%2C+Traitor+of+Ghet). [Languish](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Languish). And so on, and so on.


Kowalski also had some interesting card choices. [Gilt-Leaf Winnower](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gilt-Leaf+Winnower) is powerful, but rarely played. [Conclave Naturalists](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Conclave+Naturalists) is mostly seen as a Commander card. [Pick the Brain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pick+the+Brain) is far less efficient then [Transgress the Mind](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Transgress+the+Mind) (which he's also playing), and [Caustic Caterpillar](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Caustic+Caterpillar) is...well, [Caustic Caterpillar](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Caustic+Caterpillar).


But Kowalski definitely knows what he's doing, and for that reason, his deck earned a spot in the [Pro Tour *Gauntlet*](http://magic.wizards.com/en/MTGO/articles/archive/magic-online/pro-tour-gauntlet-shadows-over-innistrad-2016-04-26) on *Magic Online*, going on now!
