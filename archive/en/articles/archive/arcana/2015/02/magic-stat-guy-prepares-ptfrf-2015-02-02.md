It's that time of the season again, as Paul Jordan—otherwise known to the internets as [@magicPJ](https://twitter.com/@magicPJ) or the *Magic* Stat Guy—fires up his Pro Tour stat machine and starts flooding the Twitterverse with data like this:



> 
> PT win % since 2012 (min 40 matches). Expected some younger allstars. Nothing ever changes. 1. Budde, Kai 67.5% 2. Finkel, Jon 66.5% [#PTFRF](https://twitter.com/hashtag/PTFRF?src=hash)

That stat blew my mind when I read it, and I get paid to follow exactly this sort of thing.



That's why I and many others in the *Magic* community eagerly anticipate following the Stat Guy's Tweets around Pro Tour time. How else would you find out the top Limited win percentage among pros over the last decade, or how far away from 1,000 PT matches played Jon Finkel is? (That would be [80](https://twitter.com/magicPJ/status/561255019652317185).) These are the questions we must know!



You want answers, [@magicPJ](https://twitter.com/@magicPJ) has them.
