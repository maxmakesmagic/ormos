We are aware of a small number of printing and collation issues concerning some *Modern Masters 2015 Edition* booster packs. We take pride in the quality of our gameplay and products, and our customer service team is on hand to assist you should you have any questions or concerns. Be sure to save the packaging of your booster pack and share it with customer service, as that helps us identify when and where the booster pack was produced. 


We hope you’ll join in making *Magic* history at [Modern Masters Weekend](http://magic.wizards.com/en/game-info/products/card-set-archive/modern-masters-2015-edition). Whether you’re playing in Vegas, Utrecht, or Chiba, if you have any questions about the cards you receive, please speak with one of the judges on site. They are prepared to help so you can do what you came to do: play in your event and have fun.
