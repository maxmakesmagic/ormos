The August 24, 2016 Update

The Daily *Magic* Update is a roundup of everything *Magic* you should know on August 24, 2016. Today's Update is brought to you by Modern. So much Modern.


DailyMTG is Getting a Facelift
==============================


1. Changes coming Thursday

You're going to notice some cosmetic changes coming to DailyMTG, likely tomorrow, making the page easier to read, better for scanning, and overall less cluttered. Basically, we're making it just plain look better.


The changes coming aren't particularly functional, though you will notice, for example, that the white box doesn't pop up anymore when you hover over an article. Additionally, color schemes, general layout, and the location of articles aren't changing. If you looked in one place for something before, it should still be there.


What we are doing is making things more readable. This includes making the text larger, increasing the content well size (the area where the main content lives), and decreasing the sizes of icons to make it so that you don't have to scroll down just to see the rest of the article block.


We're constantly looking to improve the website, and we hope this is one step in making it more readable.


Now, the other part of this is that, in order to make these changes, we'll be in maintenance mode for a while on Thursday. That means, for the most part, you won't notice any service or article interruptions. What we're actually doing is publishing DailyMTG earlier than normal—at 6 a.m. PT. So you'll get articles two hours earlier for that day only. The look and feel changes won't go into effect till later that day, and chances are good I'll tweet ([@blakepr](http://www.twitter.com/blakepr)) about it when they are up and running.


There are still a couple check points that need to be passed, so things can still shift, but you can always check with me on Twitter for updates.


Otherwise, articles will go up as normal, we'll still be delivering *Magic* strategy and news (the new Friday Night *Magic* promo comes on Thursday!), and the sun will still be rising in the east. See you Thursday.


Today's Must
============


1. [*Conspiracy: Take the Crown* with Shawn Main](https://www.patreon.com/posts/e061-conspiracy-6600601) | Commanderin' MTG | Phil DeLuca, Nate Burgess, and Sean Whatson

Look, when a podcast [writes a theme song for you](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BxaB2OaCJzR0ZklYR3JsNWlKV2c/view), they have your ear forever. It just so happens that they have some pretty great, timely content today too, interviewing Shawn Main, the lead designer for *Conspiracy: Take the Crown*, on their podcast. I mean, that makes Shawn pretty darn special—but did he get his own theme song? Didn't think so.


After That, Read, Watch, or Listen to These
===========================================


1. [Top 8 Tips for Winning with Affinity](http://www.channelfireball.com/articles/top-8-tips-for-winning-with-affinity/) | ChannelFireball | Frank Karsten

Affinity is Frank Karsten's baby. His child. He loves it more than I love [Mulldrifter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mulldrifter) (maybe). So when we've got three Modern Grand Prix this weekend, and some sizeable portion of the field will be playing Affinity, it's no surprise Karsten would gift us with an article on the archetype. Plus, you can't pass up an article with tips like "Don't forget to feed your Ravager."


1. [Chris Pikula—Episode 12](https://kitchentablemagic.org/2016/08/23/chris-pikula/#more-182) | Kitchen Table Magic | Sam Tang

Kitchen Table Magic is all about interviewing the people who make up the *Magic* community. This week Tang talks to Chris Pikula, the longtime great who is featured in [*Enter the Battlefield*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCm-rRUwNGk) and, of course, on the card [Meddling Mage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=26591). The highlight is the conversation around the *Magic* Invitational in 2000, where Pikula defeated Jon Finkel to earn the right to make [Meddling Mage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=26591).


1. Modern Lists!

There were two articles published today that were kind of close in scope, so I'm bundling them into one super-item for a multi Modern metagame look at the format. First up, we have [Seth Manfield's "Top Ten Modern Decks" over at TCGPlayer](http://magic.tcgplayer.com/db/article.asp?ID=13469&writer=Seth+Manfield&articledate=8-24-2016). The article title is pretty on the nose, and you get exactly what you came for—ten decks Seth thinks are the best in the format.


Moving on, we have ["Modern Archetypes on the Rise (and on the Decline)" by Todd Stevens at StarCityGames.com](http://www.starcitygames.com/article/33527_Modern-Archetypes-On-The-Rise-And-On-The-Decline.html). This article looks at the Modern portion of the StarCityGames.com Tour and draws some conclusions about what's on the upswing and what's on the downswing. [Mulldrifter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mulldrifter) is not to be found anywhere. One day, my little Elemental fish, one day.


1. [This Week in Legacy: Recruiter of the Guard and Sanctum Prelate](https://www.mtggoldfish.com/articles/this-week-in-legacy-recruiter-of-the-guard-and-sanctum-prelate) | MTGGoldfish | Sean Brown

This article isn't so much about this week in Legacy as it is about some week in the future of Legacy where new *Conspiracy: Take the Crown* cards [Recruiter of the Guard](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Recruiter+of+the+Guard) and [Sanctum Prelate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sanctum+Prelate) start to change and reshape the format. Or at least how white decks are played. There's been a lot of talk about these two cards, but this analysis is particularly in-depth and well done.

It's true. In fact, I'm somewhat surprised I never saw anyone point out that we never previewed a card [with the Kaya art from the packaging](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/feature/conspiracy-take-crown-packaging-2016-08-10). The internal sweat we had about that turned out to be nothing, and we got the surprise we wanted! Enjoy opening packs this Friday!

Eric Froehlich has been one of the more dominant players in Vintage Super League history (all five seasons of it), but can he tackle the seemingly unbeatable buzz saw that is Shuhei Nakamura this season? Find out next Tuesday on [twitch.tv/magic](https://www.twitch.tv/magic). In the meantime, [all of last night's matches are already up on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?list=PL3rP64NRtmbhGb6I6vTslqQKoLpfnrKry&v=D0UgAXV6Vd8) for your viewing pleasure.


Deck of the Day
===============


1. The Return of Amulet?

The other day, Matt Nass, pro player and streamer, streamed (as streamers do) a new take on Amulet, the deck formerly known as Amulet Bloom until one half of the deck's namesake—[Summer Bloom](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Summer+Bloom)—was banished to the banned list. Since then, we haven't really seen much of the deck.


But with [Grand Prix Indianapolis](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/premierplay/grandprix/fact-sheet-gpind16), [Lille](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/premierplay/grandprix/fact-sheet-gplil16), and [Guangzhou](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/premierplay/grandprix/fact-sheet-gpgua16) all happening this weekend (and with video coverage happening at Grand Prix Indianapolis), Nass tested out a version of the deck to see if it still had legs. And, [based on the results of his stream](https://www.twitch.tv/mattnassty/v/85170840) (head to the 48-minute mark for roughly the start of his Amulet testing), it seems it does.


The innovations include finding more ways to play land that are slightly less explosive than [Summer Bloom](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Summer+Bloom), but still effective. [Explore](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Explore) is a longtime ramp staple that is only one-third of a [Summer Bloom](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Summer+Bloom), but it draws a card. The real find is [Journey of Discovery](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Journey+of+Discovery), which, for one more mana, is effectively two-thirds of a [Summer Bloom](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Summer+Bloom). That's about the best rate you'll get these days. While it's certainly less explosive, the Amulet deck was a bit *too* explosive before. Now it might be just about right. At any rate, in honor of this worse-but-still-effective substitute, I now dub this deck Amulet Journey. Because I'm creative like that.
