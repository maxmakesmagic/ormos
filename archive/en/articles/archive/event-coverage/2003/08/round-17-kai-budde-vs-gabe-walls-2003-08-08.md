![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/worlds03/a713.jpg)Any speculation that Gabe Walls was simply a "random" who lucked his way onto the U.S. National team should be put to rest by now. After sixteen rounds and three different formats, he finds himself one win away from the Top 8 of Worlds. Unfortunately for him, the man across the table is Kai Budde, the player you least want to face when your career has reached a clutch moment. Interestingly enough, this match may be even more important to Kai. His feature matches have been filled to the brim with spectators all week, and local media has been following the hometown hero all day. After getting this close, missing the Top 8 in front of his countrymen would be a huge disappointment.

### Game 1

Walls mulliganed his opening hand. Budde's [Duress](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress) revealed a hand with lands, [Reanimate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reanimate) and [Sickening Dreams](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sickening+Dreams)- [Reanimate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reanimate) went to the graveyard. Budde cast [Brainstorm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brainstorm) on turn two, followed by [Vampiric Tutor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vampiric+Tutor). He untapped and played another [Duress](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress), which Walls responded to with his own Tutor. [Duress](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress) then resolved, taking [Sickening Dreams](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sickening+Dreams) and leaving Walls with a land and [Phantom Nishoba](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phantom+Nishoba). Budde waited to make a big move until he cast [Cabal Therapy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cabal+Therapy), naming [Faceless Butcher](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Faceless+Butcher). To his surprise, Walls had Tutored for [Entomb](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Entomb) instead. With no present danger of removal, Budde [Entomb](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Entomb)ed [Verdant Force](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Verdant+Force), and [Reanimate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reanimate)d it. For lack of any other options, Walls [Entomb](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Entomb)ed Akroma, and made a big production out of drawing his next card.

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/worlds03/a714.jpg)Walls- "Come on [Exhume](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Exhume)!"  
 Budde (sarcastically)- "You're on YMG. YMG never topdecks."  
 (Walls draws [Exhume](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Exhume) off the top, puts Akroma into play)  
 Walls- "That was masterful!"

At this point, Walls had gone from slumping shoulders and a look of defeat on his face to mocking Kai. It was another example of Walls's psychological strategy- when you get lucky, rub it in as much as possible to try and throw your opponent off his game. Budde's attack allowed Walls to go down to one life point. One more damage or Saproling, and Walls would have been forced to chump block [Verdant Force](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Verdant+Force) with Akroma. The German's only out was [Gilded Drake](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gilded+Drake), and [Brainstorm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brainstorm) didn't find one.

Budde- 0 Walls- 1

Budde- "How lucky."  
 Walls- "That was pure skill! This is one Top 8 you're not making."

### Game 2

Walls' [Duress](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress) revealed [Vampiric Tutor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vampiric+Tutor), [Reanimate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reanimate), [Wonder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wonder) and lands- the Tutor went to the graveyard. Walls followed up with [Cabal Therapy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cabal+Therapy) to get [Reanimate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reanimate), but was stuck at one land.

Walls- "You're going to play that [Wonder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wonder) and just kill me."

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/worlds03/a715.jpg)Indeed, Budde summoned [Wonder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wonder) on turn four, and Walls [Entomb](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Entomb)ed [Nether Spirit](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nether+Spirit) on end step. [Wonder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wonder) attacked for two, and Budde cast [Duress](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress). Walls responded by [Entomb](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Entomb)ing [Coffin Purge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Coffin+Purge), and Walls' hand contained [City of Traitors](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=City+of+Traitors), [Diabolic Edict](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Diabolic+Edict), [Last Rites](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Last+Rites), [Faceless Butcher](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Faceless+Butcher) and [Cabal Therapy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cabal+Therapy)- the Edict went to the graveyard. The Spirit attacked for two, and Walls used the [Butcher](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Butcher) to get rid of [Wonder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wonder), which surprised Budde.

Regardless, Walls' plan to live for the moment was working, as Budde was drawing nothing but land, while Walls made his clock even more impressive with [Phyrexian Negator](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phyrexian+Negator). With his back against the wall, Budde went digging with [Careful Study](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Careful+Study) off the top, followed by [Brainstorm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brainstorm). He [Entomb](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Entomb)ed [Verdant Force](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Verdant+Force), and Walls played to the crowd, begging Kai not to slow roll him. Indeed, Kai had nothing, but seemed to have fun making Walls sweat.

**Final Result:** Budde- 0 Walls- 2
