GRAND PRIX HONG KONG 2015
=========================


















GRAND PRIX HONG KONG 2015
-------------------------




* [DAY 1 COVERAGE](#tabs-0)


DAY 1 COVERAGE



851 players have been reduced down to 110, leaving only three players at the perfect 9-0 record.


Yam Wing Chun, Chye Yian Hsiang and Victoriano Lim have all done it with the help of Mountains, an indication that red might be the mightiest color of them all!


Close behind are Nam Sung Wook, Yuta Takahashi, (4) Yuuya Watanabe and Tzu Ching Kuo, intent on giving them a run for their money. Barely scraping into Day 2 are (3) Lee Shi Tian, Sun Bo, Tomoharu Saito, Huang Hao Shan and Makihito Mihara, who will need to draft exceptionally well tomorrow if they wanted a shot at the Top 8!


As we vacate the tournament hall, the doors are opening on the other side of the globe. If you're still hungry for more *Magic*, zoom over to the Live Coverage of Grand Prix San Diego. They're about to get started!


Signing off! Be seeing you...
