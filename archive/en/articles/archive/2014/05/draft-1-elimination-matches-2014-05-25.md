Going into Round 12, the final round of the first Booster Draft for today, there are a few facts to keep in mind:


-39 Points before Round 15 locks you in the Top 8 with this event size


-Since only 36 points are possible at this point, nobody is safe for Top 8 going into Draft #2


-27 points is the bubble, and anyone who loses here is most assuredly out of the Top 8


Round 12 presented a number of incredible match-ups, where players were battling for their tournament life.

**Table 114**



**David Ochoa vs. Vidianto Wijaya**


Both Platinum Pro David Ochoa and Grand Prix Denver 2012 Champion Vidianto Wijaya were fighting for different stakes going into this event. While Ochoa desperately needs a good Grand Prix finish or two to make reclaiming Platinum for next season a more realistic possibility, Wijaya is vying for two Pro Points from this tournament in order to lock up Silver, which would give him an invitation to compete at Pro Tour **Magic** 2015.


While Ochoa kicked away color combinations in order to just go mono-black, Wijaya sported a powerful blue-green deck with some reasonable options.


Ultimately, it would be Wijaya who persevered, giving him a good shot at achieving his goal of the weekend. Ochoa, meanwhile, would have his work cut out for him if he wanted to maintain his Platinum status.


**Ochoa 0 – Wijaya 2**

**Table 112** 



**Ben Friedman vs. Frank Skarren**


Table 112 featured two-time Limited Grand Prix winner Frank Skarren against two-time Grand Prix Top 8 competitor Ben Friedman. The two players are known for being very active personalities, and it was no surprise to hear them joking around during their match, despite the pressure of knowing that a loss most assuredly knocks them out of Top 8.


Conveniently (or rather inconveniently), both players were on white-red aggressive decks. However, it was Friedman who managed to best Skarren 2-1 in their match, keeping his hopes of a Top 8 alive and – for the moment – well.


**Friedman 2 – Skarren 1**

**Table 110** 



**Pierre Mondon vs. Guillaume Wafo-Tapa**


While Grand Prix Oklahoma City 2013 Champion Pierre Mondon had proven his understanding of the *Theros* Limited format months ago, the format has changed, and most certainly has not remained the same. Worse for him was that he was up against Guillaume Wafo-Tapa, Pro Tour *Theros* Quarterfinalist and a man hoping to achieve Platinum this season. At 34 points, Wafo-Tapa could use some Grand Prix finishes to make his journey to Platinum a lot easier at Pro Tour **Magic** 2015. Mondon, however, is simply going for Silver at this point.


Ultimately, it would be Wafo-Tapa's pursuit of Platinum that truly remains alive, as the French pro dispatched his opponent's white-red deck 2-0 with – shockingly – a blue-black deck. As though you'd ever expect anything else of a player known for casting blue spells whenever feasible.


**Mondon 0 – Wafo-Tapa 2** 


Hmm...I seem to be forgetting two big matches.

Oh right! These two matches.



While No. 4 Ranked Player Owen Turtenwald keeps his Top 8 hopes alive against teammate No. 10 Ranked Player Ben Stark, No. 21 Ranked Player Jacob Wilson has kept his Platinum dreams alive after dispatching Pro Tour *Theros* Finalist Pierre Dagen. You can catch some of these matches in the video below.
