Welcome to March 2014! Let's take a look ahead and see what FNM Promo you can earn if you hit your local game store this Friday, as well as a peek further into the future to see what is coming down the pike.


### March 2014


Introduced in ***Magic** 2014* here is [Banisher Priest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Banisher+Priest). It was a new spin on the [Oblivion Ring](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oblivion+Ring) effect.

Next is [Encroaching Wastes](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Encroaching+Wastes), also introduced in ***Magic** 2014*. It's a rarely seen land destruction land, while not quite on the power level of [Strip Mine](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Strip+Mine) or [Wasteland](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wasteland) it provided an easy to get land for players who enjoyed that strategy to use.
