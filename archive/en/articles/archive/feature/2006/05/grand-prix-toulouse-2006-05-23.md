### Nothing to lose in Toulouse!


Grand Prix are easily the biggest open events the DCI offers. They're high-energy and held around the world. Plus, no invitation is necessary -- anyone can attend.


Even if you don’t want to attend the main event, there are still plenty of reasons to come. A Grand Prix is not just a regular **Magic** tournament… Grand Prix’s in Europe are true **Magic** events. Besides the main tournaments, there’s plenty of excitement throughout the weekend that you can enjoy… There are loads of side events, **Magic** artists on site to sign your **Magic** cards, gunslinging against pro’s, and lots more…


So you have plenty of reasons to come to one of the many GP stops in Europe.
