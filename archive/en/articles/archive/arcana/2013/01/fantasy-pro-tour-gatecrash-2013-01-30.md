With Pro Tour *Gatecrash* happening on February 15-17 in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, it's time to start thinking about what decks are going to do well. The constructed format is Standard, so how will *Gatecrash* affect decks?


Well, even if you don't have an invitation to the Pro Tour, you can still show how good you are at predicting the Standard environment. Because [Fantasy Pro Tour *Gatecrash*](http://apps.facebook.com/magicfantasyprotour/) is open and ready for action!

All you have to do is go to [Fantasy Pro Tour *Gatecrash*](http://apps.facebook.com/magicfantasyprotour/) on Facebook and decide what cards you think are going to prove themselves in Standard.

You'll select a Planeswalker, three sizes of creatures, an instant, and so on. And you'll get points based on the number of times your roster's cards appear in all decks scoring at least 18 points across the ten Swiss Constructed rounds at the Pro Tour. Full rules are available in [Fantasy Pro Tour *Gatecrash*](http://apps.facebook.com/magicfantasyprotour/) itself.


And there's a new category this time! Select the "New Set Card" (that would be "the card from *Gatecrash*") that you think will show up the most. This can overlap with a card you already picked in a different category.

And now that you've got a stake in what does well, you'll naturally want to follow the Pro Tour itself! The live video webcast for Pro Tour *Gatecrash* begins Friday morning and runs all three days, with Brian David-Marshall, Rich Hagon, Tim Willoughby, Rashad Miller, Zac Hill, and Marshall Sutcliffe calling the action.
