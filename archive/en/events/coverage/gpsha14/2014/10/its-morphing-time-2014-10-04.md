 When people think of the *Onslaught* Block, the cycle of fetchlands come to mind. But, those aren't the only things to return to *Khans of Tarkir* from that block. It was also the debut of Morph and has since been revisited in *Time Spiral* Block.




 Perhaps the most significant change in *Khans of Tarkir* is the revision that creatures with Morph costs of 4 or less now no longer trump each other. If you haven't read Marshall Sutcliffe's article, it might be a good time to check it out [here](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/li/five-little-morphlings-2014-09-03). If you're too lazy to check that out, here's a screenshot of the article.
