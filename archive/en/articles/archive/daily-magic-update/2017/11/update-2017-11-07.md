Top 25
======


1. A New No. 1—again!

Just after Reid Duke staked a claim for the Peach Garden Oath as the No. 1 player in the world, he's making room for our newest Pro Tour Champion and No. 1–ranked player in the world: Seth Manfield!


Manfield was already ranked 11th in the world, so a Pro Tour victory was enough to catapult him to the top of the standings. His lead is sizeable, so don’t expect him to be dethroned any time soon.


Going down the list, the Pro Tour gave us a bunch of shifts and new players. Duke slid to 2nd, sure, but his PGO brothers—William Jensen and Owen Turtenwald—both picked up points falling just short of the Top 8, and now the PGO is fully three-fifths of the Top 5.


Meanwhile, Mike Sigrist and Pascal Maynard turned Top 8 berths into entrances into our rankings, and Matthew Nass and Alexander Hayne both used strong performances at the Pro Tour to join them in the Top 25.


That means four players drop out: Gerry Thompson, Donald Smith, Ken Yukuhiro, and Eric Froehlich tumble out of the rankings.

Today’s Musts
=============


1. Enter the Battlefield(s)

With all of the Pro Tour videos going up on YouTube today, I know a number of you will be exploring the tournament’s videos for the first time. Might I make a recommendation? We have two lovely vintages for you, both from *Enter the Battlefield*. The first is on our new World Champion, William Jensen, and is simply titled “Huey." It’s sweet, it's touching, and it goes down smiling.


<https://www.youtube.com/embed/s8z8o8bOvZ0>


The second is a newer vintage, highlighting the Team World Championship won by Musashi. It’s robust and full-bodied, with an international flavor.

Also, Read, Watch, or Listen to These
=====================================


1. [The Winners From Pro Tour *Ixalan*](http://www.starcitygames.com/article/36128_The-Winners-From-Pro-Tour-Ixalan.html) | StarCityGames | Jadine Klomparens

Klomparens covers the big winners and losers from the Pro Tour. Besides Seth Manfield.


1. [My Playgroup Always Targets Me First](https://collected.company/2017/11/06/playgroup-always-targets-first-185/) | The Command Zone | Jimmy Wong and Josh Lee Kwai

Me too, guys. Me too.


This episode, despite the title, is actually reader-submitted questions answered by our intrepid hosts. The title is one such question—though one I certainly need the answer to as well.


1. [Draw-Perfect Temur](https://www.channelfireball.com/articles/draw-perfect-temur/) | ChannelFireball | Paulo Vitor Damo da Rosa

Team ChannelFireball took a risk with a strained mana base—but it paid off in spades. They might have only come in second as a team (to Team Genesis), but it took a Pro Tour win from Seth Manfield to displace what was otherwise a powerhouse outing from the ChannelFireball crew. Here, Paulo details the deck that helped them get there.


1. [Creating a Commander League](https://www.brotherswarcast.com/2017/11/07/episode-22-creating-a-commander-league/) | The Bros. War | Ryan and AJ Greene

I struggled with this back in my pre-WotCStaff days, and got one going for a little bit at my local Iowa City store first, then in Austin as well. The Greenes have compiled some tips, tricks, and rules to help you form your own Commander league and make it more successful than any of mine ever were.


What to Watch Tonight
=====================


1. Vintage Super League | [Twitch.tv/magic](https://go.twitch.tv/magic) | 5 p.m. PT/8 p.m. ET/midnight UTC

We’ve got about a month of Super Leaguing left before the season ends, so strap in, queue up the VSL, and start forming opinions about Mishra’s Workshop.


What People Are Talking About

*Unstable* previews start Monday! My mind is ready! So is my body! All of me is ready! I don’t know why I divided the two!


1. [*Unstable* and Cube](http://markrosewater.tumblr.com/post/165690033548/youve-asked-as-at-least-twice-now-what-type-of)

My feet are ready! My face is ready! My hands are ready! My elbows are strangely reluctant . . .


But yeah, there’s a ton of cool Cube stuff in the set. *Un*-sets were never my jam before. *Unstable* definitely is. I have a cube that started as a *Modern Masters* cube and eventually became a “cards I like” cube, and *Unstable* has a number of cards I’ve already mentally slotted into that cube.


Deck of the Day
===============


1. [Standard Mono-White Vampires](https://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/ptxln/24-27-point-standard-decklists-2017-11-05)

The surprise deck of Pro Tour *Ixalan* wasn’t in the Top 8, but it might have been the most successful deck at the tournament.


Mono-White Vampires, of all things, was played by only a handful of players, but they all found success with it. All five players who played the deck made Day 2, and Wilson Hunter finished 9-1 with the list below.


Yeah, 9-1.


That should make you sit up and take notice, especially when the deck packs cards like [Duskborne Skymarcher](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duskborne+Skymarcher) and [Adanto Vanguard](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Adanto+Vanguard) and [Aviary Mechanic](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aviary+Mechanic) and finds that much success.


At its core, the deck is a tokens deck, but unlike the [Anointed Procession](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Anointed+Procession) decks, this list is looking to make tokens quickly and efficiently and then pump them up for the win. [Angel of Invention](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Angel+of+Invention) and [Shefet Dunes](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shefet+Dunes) often herald the end, but it’s Oketra’s Monument that really gives the deck its power.


This deck is unique in that it’s probably the most *Ixalan*-based deck in the format, which means it’s likely to only get better when *Rivals of Ixalan* adds even more Vampires to the format.
