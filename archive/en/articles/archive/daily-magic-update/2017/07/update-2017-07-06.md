The Daily *Magic* Update is a roundup of everything *Magic* you should know on July 6, 2017. Today's Update is brought to you by set reviews. So very many set reviews.

Marshall and LSV have the most, um, thorough set review of anyone around—this one clocking in at a shade under 3 hours without even getting to the rares and mythic rares of the set. It's the only time of the year you'll wish your commute was longer.

1. [Fastest Prerelease Ever – *Hour of Devastation* Early Exclusive](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2LStqH4qu4) | Windmill Slam (Some adult language, many Irish accents)

What would it look like if you had to use a *Magic Online* clock at your *Hour of Devastation* Prerelease? A bit like this, according to the good folks at Windmill Slam.


1. [Paul Jordan's 2017 Pro Tour Hall of Fame Breakdown](http://www.hipstersofthecoast.com/2017/07/52670/) | Hipsters of the Coast | Paul Jordan

Jordan—occasionally known as MTG Stat Guy—goes about as deep as one can go, offering an interesting analysis of every single one of the candidates compared to the Hall of Fame players who were already elected. If the readership of this column were entirely made of up Hall of Fame voters, this would be today's must.


1. [*Hour of Devastation* Limited Primer: Prerelease](http://manadeprived.com/hour-devastation-limited-primer-prerelease/) | Mana Deprived | Keith Capstick

This is one of the more compact, effective Prerelease primers I've seen so far, so definitely give this a (quick) read if you plan to Prerelease this weekend. Which you should.


1. [*Magic: The Gathering* Tournament – FINAL](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBu3O5Sazio) | Games Night

1. [Wizards of the Coast Officially Participating in Seattle Pride Parade [Picture with Modified Planeswalker Logo]](https://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/6ljskb/wizards_of_the_coast_officially_participating_in/)

That we did! And that text on the banner, "Dragons and Elves belong in our worlds, and so do you," wasn't made just for that parade. It's one of our company values statements, and it hangs, along with the rest of our values, in our building's main shared space.

The old "catching someone who F6'd but has an activated ability in play you need them to not respond with." Classic. [Caleb Durward vs. Mana Crypt](https://clips.twitch.tv/NurturingTenuousCurryAMPTropPunch) is also pretty entertaining.


Also, he's right. Caleb Durward's stream is a good time. You can check it out at [twitch.tv/calebdmtg](https://www.twitch.tv/calebdmtg).


Deck of the Day
===============


1. Second Sun Fevered Fog

For some reason, I keep running into this deck on *Magic Online*—and losing.


Now, to be fair, I've been doing a lot of losing lately in Standard as I try out new things, but this one was especially eye-opening as I went through my "attack with creatures" phase (ew), because I could just never kill them unless the deck faltered.


This four-color deck is reminiscent of the Turbo Fog decks of old, which used [Howling Mine](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Howling+Mine) (cards that have everyone drawing more cards every turn) effects alongside [Fog](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fog) effects (cards that say "Prevent all combat damage" or some variation thereof). In this case, the [Howling Mine](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Howling+Mine) is [Fevered Visions](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fevered+Visions) and the Fog effects are legion—[Haze of Pollen](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Haze+of+Pollen), [Commencement of Festivities](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Commencement+of+Festivities), [Encircling Fissure](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Encircling+Fissure), and even [Repel the Abominable](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Repel+the+Abominable). The rest of the deck is made up of sweepers and card draw and the deck's main win condition, [Approach of the Second Sun](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Approach+of+the+Second+Sun). Note that having [Fevered Visions](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fevered+Visions) in play speeds up the time by which you'll re-draw your second Sun. It seems Nicol Bolas has a fever, and the only cure is ~~more cowbell~~ [Approach of the Second Sun](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Approach+of+the+Second+Sun).


Actually, the cure is [Negate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Negate). And [Fragmentize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fragmentize). And [Cast Out](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cast+Out). Etc., etc. The deck is a bit of a glass cannon, but boy is it effective if all your opponent is trying to do is attack you with creatures. I would actually recommend looking into a transformational sideboard against control decks, or at least playing some number of [Sphinx of the Final Word](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sphinx+of+the+Final+Word).


This list, by the way, came courtesy [@jakejoelmtg](https://twitter.com/jakejoelmtg), who were kind enough to respond to my call for lists yesterday. And for their generosity, I'll mention that they have a YouTube channel called Jake and Joel are Magic. They publish pretty regularly, and [you can check out their stuff here](https://www.youtube.com/jakeandjoelaremagic).
