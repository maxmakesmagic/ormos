An FAQ is a collection of clarifications and rulings involving the cards in a new **Magic: The Gathering** set. It's intended to make playing with these new cards more fun by clearing up the common misconceptions and confusion inevitably caused by new mechanics and interactions. As future sets are released, updates to the **Magic** rules may cause some of this information to become outdated. If you can't find the answer you're looking for here, please contact us at [www.wizards.com/customerservice](http://www.wizards.com/customerservice).


This FAQ has two sections, each of which serves a different purpose.


The first section ("General Notes") explains the mechanics and concepts in the set.


The second section ("Card-Specific Notes") contains answers to the most important, most common, and most confusing questions players might ask about cards in the set. Items in the "Card-Specific Notes" section include full card text for your reference. Not all cards in the set are listed.


### GENERAL NOTES

Go to [www.wizards.com/MagicFormats](http://www.wizards.com/MagicFormats) for a complete list of formats and permitted card sets.


### Returning Themes: Guilds and Guildmarks


The original *Ravnica* block introduced the plane of Ravnica, a world dominated by cityscape and controlled by ten guilds, each centered around two colors. Five of these ten guilds (Azorius, Golgari, Izzet, Rakdos, and Selesnya) are featured in the *Return to Ravnica* set. The remaining five (Orzhov, Dimir, Gruul, Boros, and Simic) will be featured in the February 2013 set: *Gatecrash.*


If a card in the *Return to Ravnica* set is associated with a guild, it features the appropriate guildmark in the background of its text box. These guildmarks have no effect on game play.


**Returning Mechanic: Hybrid Cards**


Hybrid mana symbols represent a cost that can be paid with either of two colors. For example, ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20210208014640im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/black-green.gif) can be paid with either ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227195556im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/black.gif) or ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20220123123600im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/green.gif). It’s both a black and a green mana symbol. A card with the mana cost ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20210208014640im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/black-green.gif) is both black and green, and its converted mana cost is 1. Visually, the # symbol is a circle divided in half: the upper left looks like a black mana symbol and the lower right looks like a green mana symbol.



> ![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/tcg/products/rtr/odih4otbdl_en.jpg)Golgari Longlegs   
> ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227130050im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless3.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20210208014640im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/black-green.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20210208014640im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/black-green.gif)  
>  Creature — Insect   
>  5/4 


* Hybrid mana symbols appear only in costs, such as the mana cost in the upper right corner of a card or the cost to activate an activated ability.
* A card with hybrid mana symbols in its mana cost is each color that appears in its mana cost, regardless of what mana was spent to cast it. For example, the Golgari Longlegs above is black and green, even if you cast it with only green mana.
* As you cast a spell or activate an activated ability with hybrid mana symbols in its cost, you choose which color of mana you will spend for each hybrid mana symbol. You do this at the same time you would choose modes or choose a value for an X in a mana cost. For example, you choose whether you’ll cast Golgari Longlegs by paying ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227130050im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless3.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227195556im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/black.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227195556im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/black.gif), ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227130050im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless3.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227195556im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/black.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20220123123600im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/green.gif), or ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227130050im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless3.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20220123123600im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/green.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20220123123600im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/green.gif).

**Returning Cycle: *Ravnica* “Dual Lands”**


There are five nonbasic lands in the *Return to Ravnica* set that each have two basic land types. These lands were originally printed in the *Ravnica* block.



> ![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/tcg/products/rtr/yv1r4rw3wr_en.jpg)Hallowed Fountain   
>  Land — Plains Island   
> *(![](https://web.archive.org/web/20170424152623im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/tap.gif): Add ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227125855im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/white.gif) or ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161115194122im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/blue.gif) to your mana pool.)*
>   
>  As Hallowed Fountain enters the battlefield, you may pay 2 life. If you don’t, Hallowed Fountain enters the battlefield tapped.


* Although these cards have basic land types, they are not basic lands. For example, you couldn’t find one of these cards if an effect told you to search your library for a “basic land card.”
* Effects that care about a basic land type are looking for lands that have that land type, not just lands with that name. For example, islandwalk cares if the defending player controls a land with the land type Island (such as Hallowed Fountain), not just lands named Island.
* If another effect instructs you to put one of these lands onto the battlefield tapped, it will enter the battlefield tapped whether you pay 2 life or not.
* If more than one of these lands are entering the battlefield at the same time, you’ll decide whether to pay 2 life for each one individually, then put them all onto the battlefield. For example, if you have 3 life and two Hallowed Fountains are entering the battlefield at the same time, you could pay 2 life for only one of them, not both.

**Azorius Keyword Action: Detain**


The white-blue guild is the Azorius Senate. The Azorius are Ravnica’s lawmakers and bureaucrats. Detain is a new ability that can render permanents ineffective for a short time.



> ![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/tcg/products/rtr/fpoutp308r_en.jpg)Inaction Injunction   
> ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20211201201921im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless1.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161115194122im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/blue.gif)  
>  Sorcery   
>  Detain target creature an opponent controls. *(Until your next turn, that creature can’t attack or block and its activated abilities can’t be activated.)*
>   
>  Draw a card.

The official rules for detain are as follows:



> 701.26. Detain
> 
> 
> 701.26a Certain spells and abilities can detain a permanent. Until the next turn of the controller of that spell or ability, that permanent can’t attack or block and its activated abilities can’t be activated.
> 
> 
> 


* Activated abilities include a colon and are written in the form “[cost]: [effect].” No one can activate any activated abilities, including mana abilities, of a detained permanent.
* The static abilities of a detained permanent still apply. The triggered abilities of a detained permanent can still trigger.
* If a creature is already attacking or blocking when it’s detained, it won’t be removed from combat. It will continue to attack or block.
* If a permanent’s activated ability is on the stack when that permanent is detained, the ability will be unaffected.
* If a noncreature permanent is detained and later turns into a creature, it won’t be able to attack or block.
* When a player leaves a multiplayer game, any continuous effects with durations that last until that player's next turn or until a specific point in that turn will last until that turn would have begun. They neither expire immediately nor last indefinitely.

**Izzet Keyword: Overload**


The blue-red guild is the Izzet League. The Izzet are impulsive and reckless, the inventor-mages of Ravnica. Overload is a new ability found on some instants or sorceries that broadens their scope.



> ![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/tcg/products/rtr/n9rov2xf7r_en.jpg)Blustersquall   
> ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161115194122im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/blue.gif)  
>  Instant   
>  Tap target creature you don’t control.   
>  Overload ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227130050im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless3.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161115194122im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/blue.gif)*(You may cast this spell for its overload cost. If you do, change its text by replacing all instances of “target” with “each.”)*

The official rules for overload are as follows:



> 702.94. Overload
> 
> 
> 702.94a Overload is a keyword that represents two static abilities: one that functions from any zone in which the spell with overload can be cast and another that functions while the card is on the stack. Overload [cost] means “You may choose to pay [cost] rather than pay this spell’s mana cost” and “If you chose to pay this spell’s overload cost, change its text by replacing all instances of the word ‘target’ with the word ‘each.’” Using the overload ability follows the rules for paying alternative costs in rules 601.2b and 601.2e–g.
> 
> 
> 702.94b If a player chooses to pay the overload cost of a spell, that spell won’t require any targets. It may affect objects that couldn’t be chosen as legal targets if the spell were cast without its overload cost being paid.
> 
> 
> 702.94c Overload’s second ability creates a text-changing effect. See rule 612, “Text-Changing Effects.”
> 
> 
> 


* If you don’t pay the overload cost of a spell, that spell will have a single target. If you pay the overload cost, the spell won’t have any targets.
* Because a spell with overload doesn’t target when its overload cost is paid, it may affect permanents with hexproof or with protection from the appropriate color. For example, if you cast Blustersquall and pay its overload cost, creatures you don’t control with protection from blue will be tapped.
* Note that if the spell with overload is dealing damage, protection from that spell’s color will still prevent that damage.
* Overload doesn’t change when you can cast the spell.
* Casting a spell with overload doesn’t change that spell’s mana cost. You just pay the overload cost instead.
* Effects that cause you to pay more or less for a spell will cause you to pay that much more or less while casting it for its overload cost, too.
* If you are instructed to cast a spell with overload “without paying its mana cost,” you can’t choose to pay its overload cost instead.

**Rakdos Keyword: Unleash**


The black-red guild is the Cult of Rakdos. Led by a demonic guildmaster, the Rakdos spread depravity and mayhem wherever they riot. Unleash is a new ability found on creatures that can make them fiercer and relentlessly aggressive.



> ![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/tcg/products/rtr/3x0i4f0pxe_en.jpg)Spawn of Rix Maadi   
> ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227130050im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless3.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227195556im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/black.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227130159im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/red.gif)  
>  Creature — Horror   
>  5/3   
>  Unleash *(You may have this creature enter the battlefield with a +1/+1 counter on it. It can’t block as long as it has a +1/+1 counter on it.)*

The official rules for unleash are as follows:



> 702.96. Unleash
> 
> 
> 702.96a Unleash is a keyword that represents two static abilities. “Unleash” means “You may have this permanent enter the battlefield with an additional +1/+1 counter on it” and “This permanent can’t block as long as it has a +1/+1 counter on it.”
> 
> 
> 


* You make the choice to have the creature with unleash enter the battlefield with a +1/+1 counter or not as it’s entering the battlefield. At that point, it’s too late for a player to respond to the creature spell by trying to counter it, for example.
* The unleash ability applies no matter where the creature is entering the battlefield from.
* A creature with unleash can’t block if it has any +1/+1 counter on it, not just one put on it by the unleash ability.
* Putting a +1/+1 counter on a creature with unleash that’s already blocking won’t remove it from combat. It will continue to block.

**Golgari Keyword: Scavenge**


The black-green guild is the Golgari Swarm. The Golgari revere the natural cycles of life and death. Scavenge is a new ability found on creature cards that allows the living to eat the dead and become stronger.



> ![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/tcg/products/rtr/h10hnwx2oy_en.jpg)Zanikev Locust   
> ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20170413132456im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless5.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227195556im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/black.gif)  
>  Creature — Insect   
>  3/3   
>  Flying   
>  Scavenge ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161225105850im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless2.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227195556im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/black.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227195556im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/black.gif)*(![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161225105850im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless2.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227195556im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/black.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227195556im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/black.gif), Exile this card from your graveyard: Put a number of +1/+1 counters equal to this card’s power on target creature. Scavenge only as a sorcery.)*

The official rules for scavenge are as follows:



> 702.95. Scavenge
> 
> 
> 702.95a Scavenge is an activated ability that functions only while the card with scavenge is in a graveyard. “Scavenge [cost]” means “[Cost], Exile this card from your graveyard: Put a number of +1/+1 counters equal to this card’s power on target creature. Activate this ability only any time you could cast a sorcery.”
> 
> 
> 


* Exiling the creature card with scavenge is part of the cost of activating the scavenge ability. Once the ability is activated and the cost is paid, it’s too late to stop the ability from being activated by trying to remove the creature card from the graveyard.

**Selesnya Keyword Action: Populate**


The green-white guild is the Selesnya Conclave. A vast interconnected commune, the Selesnya constantly strives to recruit new members. Populate is a new ability that lets you do just that by copying creature tokens you control.



> ![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/tcg/products/rtr/lby2cbi6da_en.jpg)Coursers’ Accord   
> ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20160830042801im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless4.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20220123123600im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/green.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227125855im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/white.gif)  
>  Sorcery   
>  Put a 3/3 green Centaur creature token onto the battlefield, then populate. *(Put a token onto the battlefield that’s a copy of a creature token you control.)*

The official rules for populate are as follows:



> 701.27. Populate
> 
> 
> 701.27a To populate means to choose a creature token you control and put a token onto the battlefield that’s a copy of that creature token.
> 
> 
> 701.27b If you control no creature tokens when instructed to populate, you won’t put a token onto the battlefield.
> 
> 
> 


* You can choose any creature token you control. If a spell or ability puts a token onto the battlefield under your control and then instructs you to populate (as Coursers’ Accord does), you may choose to copy the token you just created, or you may choose to copy another creature token you control.
* If you choose to copy a creature token that’s a copy of another creature, the new creature token will copy the characteristics of whatever the original token is copying.
* The new creature token copies the characteristics of the original token as stated by the effect that put the original token onto the battlefield.
* The new token doesn’t copy whether the original token is tapped or untapped, whether it has any counters on it or Auras and Equipment attached to it, or any noncopy effects that have changed its power, toughness, color, and so on.
* Any “as [this creature] enters the battlefield” or “[this creature] enters the battlefield with” abilities of the new token will work.
* If you control no creature tokens when you populate, nothing will happen.

**Cycle: Guildgates**


The *Return to Ravnica* set introduces a new land subtype: Gate. Each guild has a Gate card with Guildgate in its name that taps for mana of either of that guild’s colors.



> ![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/tcg/products/rtr/24rd98uq0w_en.jpg)Azorius Guildgate   
>  Land — Gate

* The subtype Gate has no special rules significance, but other spells and abilities may refer to it.
* Gate is not a basic land type.

**Cycle: Keyrunes**


Each guild has a Keyrune, an artifact that taps for mana of either of that guild’s colors and can become a creature.

* Until the ability that turns the Keyrune into a creature resolves, the Keyrune is colorless.
* Activating the ability that turns the Keyrune into a creature while it’s already a creature will override any effects that set its power and/or toughness to another number, but effects that modify power and/or toughness without directly setting them will still apply. For example, say you activate the last ability of Golgari Keyrune. After it resolves, you cast Giant Growth targeting it. It’s now 5/5. Then Diminish (“Target creature becomes 1/1 until end of turn”) is cast targeting it. Once Diminish resolves, Golgari Keyrune would be 4/4. Activating Golgari Keyrune’s last ability a second time would make it 5/5 again until end of turn.

>  Sorcery   
>  Supreme Verdict can’t be countered.   
>  Destroy all creatures.


* The standard wording for spells that “can’t be countered” varies depending on whether the spell is targeted. Targeted spells have the additional text “by spells or abilities” because the spell can still be countered by the game rules if all of its targets are illegal when the spell tries to resolve.
* A spell that can’t be countered by spells or abilities can be targeted by spells and abilities that try to counter it. Those spells and abilities will resolve, but the part of their effect that would counter the spell won’t do anything. Any other effects those spells and abilities have will work as normal.

* The creature can still regenerate.
* A creature dealt damage by Annihilating Fire that dies this turn will be exiled even if it wasn't the target of Annihilating Fire (say, because the damage was redirected somehow).
* A creature dealt damage by Annihilating Fire will be exiled no matter why the creature would die. It could be destroyed by another spell or ability.

* The two nonland permanents can be controlled by the same opponent or by different opponents.
* The nonland permanents will be detained before blockers are chosen. Notably, a creature detained this way can't block before it is detained.

* Ash Zealot's ability doesn't allow any player to cast cards from a graveyard. Such cards need another way to be cast, such as the flashback ability.
* Ash Zealot's triggered ability will resolve before that spell resolves.
* Ash Zealot's ability doesn't trigger if you put a card onto the battlefield from a graveyard (using Grave Betrayal's ability, for example).

* You must be able to target a creature to cast Assassin's Strike.
* If the creature is an illegal target when Assassin's Strike tries to resolve, it will be countered and none of its effects will happen. Its controller won't discard a card.
* If Assassin's Strike resolves but the creature isn't destroyed (perhaps because it regenerated or is indestructible), its controller will discard a card.

* It doesn't matter what the creature dealt damage to. If the creature dealt damage to another creature or a planeswalker, it doesn't matter whether that creature or planeswalker is still on the battlefield.
* Avenging Arrow doesn't affect the damage the creature dealt. It isn't retroactively prevented.

>  Whenever a source deals damage to you, remove a filibuster counter from Azor's Elocutors.


* You'll only win the game if Azor's Elocutors has five or more filibuster counters on it when the first ability resolves. For example, if Azor's Elocutors has four filibuster counters on it and you somehow add another during your main phase, you won't win the game immediately.
* The second ability of Azor's Elocutors removes one filibuster counter per source, no matter how much damage that source dealt. For example, if two attacking creatures deal damage to you at the same time, two filibuster counters will be removed.

* If you copy an instant or sorcery spell on the stack (using Nivix Guildmage's second ability, for example), the copy isn't cast. Blistercoil Weird's ability won't trigger.

* Once you activate the ability of Centaur's Herald, it's too late for a player to respond by trying to destroy it or otherwise stop you from sacrificing it.

If you do, change its text by replacing all instances of "target" with "each.")*


* If you cast Chemister's Trick with overload, only creatures you don't control that are on the battlefield when Chemister's Trick resolves are affected. Creatures that come under another player's control later in the turn are not.
* The controller of a creature that attacks if able still chooses which player or planeswalker it attacks.
* If, during a player's declare attacker's step, a creature is tapped, is affected by a spell or ability that says it can't attack, or hasn't been under that player's control continuously since the turn began (and doesn't have haste), then it doesn't attack. If there's a cost associated with having a creature attack, the player isn't forced to pay that cost, so it doesn't have to attack in that case either.

>  At the beginning of your upkeep, you may exchange control of Conjured Currency and target permanent you neither own nor control.


* The only legal target for Conjured Currency's ability is a permanent both owned and controlled by another player, although it doesn't have to be the same player. For example, a permanent owned by an opponent but controlled by your teammate (or another opponent) could be chosen as the target.
* The exchange occurs only if Conjured Currency and the target permanent are both on the battlefield and controlled by different players when the ability resolves. In addition, the target permanent must be one you neither own nor control. If any of these things aren't true when the ability tries to resolve, the exchange won't happen and neither permanent will change controllers.
* You don't necessarily have to control Conjured Currency when its ability resolves in order for the exchange to happen. If another player has gained control of Conjured Currency while the ability is on the stack, and a third player controls the target (and you don't own it), you may choose to have those two players exchange control of the relevant permanents.

* If no opponent has lost life on the turn Cryptborn Horror enters the battlefield, it will enter with no +1/+1 counters on it and be put into its owner's graveyard (unless something else is raising its toughness).
* Cryptborn Horror cares about the total life lost, not necessarily what an opponent's life total is compared to what it was at the beginning of the turn. For example, if an opponent loses 5 life and then gains 10 life on the turn Cryptborn Horror enters the battlefield, it will enter with five +1/+1 counters on it.
* In multiplayer games, life lost the turn Cryptborn Horror enters the battlefield by opponents who left the game later that turn will count toward the value of X.

>  Whenever a creature you don't control dies, return it to the battlefield under your control with an additional +1/+1 counter on it at the beginning of the next end step. That creature is a black Zombie in addition to its other colors and types.


* Grave Betrayal doesn't overwrite any previous colors or types. Rather, it adds another color and another creature type.
* If the creature is normally colorless, it will simply be black. It won't be both black and colorless.
* If a creature you don't control dies during the end step, that creature won't return to the battlefield until the beginning of the next end step.
* Each creature you don't control that dies causes a delayed triggered ability to trigger at the beginning of the next end step. If there are multiple such abilities, you can put them on the stack in any order. The creatures will return to the battlefield one at a time as each ability resolves. The last ability you put on the stack will be the first one to resolve.
* If the creature card leaves the graveyard before the delayed triggered ability resolves, it won't return to the battlefield. This is also true if the card leaves the graveyard and returns to the graveyard before that ability resolves.
* The phrase "with an additional +1/+1 counter on it" means that the creature enters the battlefield with one more +1/+1 counter than it would normally enter the battlefield with. It doesn't keep any counters it had on it when it died.
* In a multiplayer game, if more than one player controls a Grave Betrayal and a creature controlled by none of those players dies, each Grave Betrayal will create a delayed triggered ability at the beginning of the next end step. The first such ability to resolve will return the creature. Usually, this will be one controlled by the player furthest from the active player in turn order.

* If no creatures or only one creature is put onto the battlefield this way, no fight happens.
* Players can't cast spells or activate abilities between the creatures being put onto the battlefield and them fighting each other. Notably, you can't respond with a spell like Giant Growth.

>  Enchantment   
>  Players can't gain life.   
>  At the beginning of each player's upkeep, that player loses half his or her life, rounded up.


* Spells and abilities that would cause a player to gain life still resolve, but the life-gain part has no effect.
* Effects that would replace gaining life with another effect won't apply because it's impossible for players to gain life.
* If an effect says to set a player's life total to a certain number and that number is higher than the player's current life total, that part of the effect won't do anything. (If the number is lower than the player's current life total, the effect will work as normal.)
* The amount of life lost is calculated when the triggered ability resolves. For example, if a player has 20 life and there are two Havoc Festivals on the battlefield, the first ability will cause that player to lose 10 life and then the second ability will cause that player to lose 5 life.
* In a Two-Headed Giant game, the last ability triggers for each player. Any life loss is applied to the team's life total. For example, if the team has 30 life, the first ability will cause the player (and thus the team) to lose 15 life and then the second ability will cause the other player (and thus the team) to lose 8 life. The team will end up having 7 life.

>  [-8]: For each player, search that player's library for a nonland card and exile it, then that player shuffles his or her library. You may cast those cards without paying their mana costs.


* Jace's first ability creates a delayed triggered ability that triggers whenever a creature an opponent controls attacks. It doesn't matter which player or planeswalker that creature is attacking.
* You pick one of your opponents when Jace's second ability resolves. The ability doesn't target that opponent. All players may see the revealed cards and offer opinions. You (not your opponent) choose which pile is put into your hand and which pile is put on the bottom of your library.
* Piles can be empty. If one of the piles is empty, you choose to put all the revealed cards in your hand or on the bottom of your library.
* When resolving Jace's third ability, you search each player's library (including yours) and exile the nonland cards before casting any of them.
* For each library, the search is complete only when you explicitly say it is. For example, you can look through one player's library, set that library down, look at another player's library, choose a nonland card in the first library, then choose a nonland card in the second library. Don't reveal any cards from those libraries to any other player until you exile them.
* You cast the cards by putting them on the stack one at a time, choosing modes, targets, and so on. The last card you cast will be the first one to resolve.
* When casting a card this way, ignore timing restrictions based on the card's type. Other timing restrictions, such as "Cast [this card] only during combat," must be followed.
* If you can't cast a card, perhaps because there are no legal targets available, or if you choose not to cast one, it will remain exiled. Jace's ability won't allow you to cast it later.
* If you cast a card "without paying its mana cost," you can't pay alternative costs such as overload costs. You can pay additional costs such as kicker costs. If the card has mandatory additional costs, you must pay those.
* If a card has ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20160829100442im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/x.gif) in its mana cost, you must choose 0 as its value.

Even if one of the lands you sacrifice is both a Swamp and a Forest, you have to sacrifice another land that is a Swamp or a Forest.
* You can sacrifice any land with the land type Swamp or Forest, not just ones named Swamp or Forest. For example, you could sacrifice two Overgrown Tombs.

You may choose new targets for the copy.


* Nivix Guildmage's second ability can target (and copy) any instant or sorcery spell you control, not just one with targets.
* When the second ability resolves, it creates a copy of a spell. That copy is created on the stack, so it's not "cast." Abilities that trigger when a player casts a spell won't trigger. The copy will then resolve like a normal spell, after players get a chance to cast spells and activate abilities.
* The copy will have the same targets as the spell it's copying unless you choose new ones. You may change any number of the targets, including all of them or none of them. If, for one of the targets, you can't choose a new legal target, then it remains unchanged (even if the current target is illegal).
* If the copied spell is modal (that is, it says "Choose one —" or the like), the copy will have the same mode. You can't choose a different one.
* If the copied spell has an X whose value was determined as it was cast (like Sphinx's Revelation does), the copy has the same value of X.
* You can't choose to pay any additional costs for the copy. However, effects based on any additional or alternative costs that were paid for the original spell are copied as though those same costs were paid for the copy too. For example, if you copy a spell that you cast by paying its overload cost, the copy will resolve as though its overload cost had been paid as well.

* Exiling a spell is not the same as countering it, although the spell won't resolve in both cases. You may exile a spell that can't be countered.
* You can exile a copy of an instant or sorcery spell to activate Nivmagus Elemental's ability if you control the copy.

* Pack Rat's first ability counts any creature you control with the creature type Rat, not just Pack Rats.
* The token will copy Pack Rat's two abilities. Its power and toughness will be equal to the number of Rats you control (not the number of Rats you controlled when the token entered the battlefield). It will also be able to create copies of itself.
* The token won't copy counters on Pack Rat, nor will it copy other effects that have changed Pack Rat's power, toughness, types, color, or so on. Normally, this means the token will simply be a Pack Rat. But if any copy effects have affected that Pack Rat, they're taken into account.
* If Pack Rat leaves the battlefield before its activated ability resolves, the token will still enter the battlefield as a copy of Pack Rat, using Pack Rat's copiable values from when it was last on the battlefield.

* Applying this redirection effect doesn't change whether the damage is combat damage.
* If noncombat damage would be dealt to a planeswalker you control, the planeswalker redirection effect and Palisade Giant's redirection effect apply in whichever order you choose. No matter which order you choose to apply them in, that damage will be dealt to Palisade Giant instead.
* If you control more than one Palisade Giant, you choose which redirection effect to apply. You can't divide damage dealt by one source. For example, if an attacking creature would deal 8 damage to you and you control two Palisade Giants, you may have that damage dealt to either of the Palisade Giants. You can't have 4 damage dealt to each Giant or choose to have the 8 damage dealt to you.

* The hybrid spells in the *Return to Ravnica* set are multicolored, even if you cast them with one color of mana.
* The triggered ability will resolve and Pyroconvergence will deal damage before that spell resolves.

* Remember, damage dealt to a player causes that player to lose that much life (unless the source has infect).
* Rakdos can be put onto the battlefield by another spell or ability even if no opponent has lost life that turn.
* Rakdos's last ability cares about the total life lost, not necessarily what an opponent's life total is compared to what it was at the beginning of the turn. For example, if an opponent loses 5 life and then gains 10 life in a turn, creature spells you cast will cost ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20170413132456im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless5.gif) less to cast.
* Rakdos's last ability can't reduce the colored mana requirement of a creature spell you cast.
* If there are additional costs to cast a creature spell, such as a kicker cost or a cost imposed by the rules of a Commander game, apply those increases before applying cost reductions.
* Rakdos's last ability won't reduce the cost to cast Rakdos itself. It applies only to creature spells you cast once Rakdos is on the battlefield.

* If Rest in Peace is destroyed by a spell, Rest in Peace will be exiled and then the spell will be put into its owner's graveyard.
* If a card is discarded while Rest in Peace is on the battlefield, abilities that function when a card is discarded (such as madness) still work, even though that card never reaches a graveyard. In addition, spells or abilities that check the characteristics of a discarded card (such as Chandra Ablaze's first ability) can find that card in exile.

* Trostani's first ability checks the creature's toughness as it resolves. If that creature has left the battlefield, use its toughness from when it was last on the battlefield. You can't lose life this way if that creature's toughness was less than 0.

* You must target a creature to cast Trostani's Judgment. If that creature is an illegal target when Trostani's Judgment tries to resolve, it will be countered and none of its effects will happen. You won't populate.
* If you choose a creature token you control as the target, it will be exiled before you populate and you won't be able to choose that creature to copy.

* Effects that state that the enchanted land doesn't untap during your untap step won't apply during another player's untap step.

* If Volatile Rig is dealt damage by multiple sources at the same time (for example, multiple blocking creatures), its first triggered ability will trigger only once.

* If an effect creates a copy of one of the Assassin creature tokens, the copy will also have the triggered ability.
* Each Assassin token's triggered ability will trigger whenever it deals combat damage to any player, including you.

* The ability that defines Wayfaring Temple's power and toughness works in all zones, not just the battlefield.
* As long as Wayfaring Temple is on the battlefield, its first ability will count itself.

>  Creature — Human Shaman   
>  1/1   
>  Whenever Wild Beastmaster attacks, each other creature you control gets +X/+X until end of turn, where X is Wild Beastmaster's power.


* The value of X is determined when the triggered ability resolves. If Wild Beastmaster is no longer on the battlefield at that time, use its last known power to determine the value of X. This could be bad for you if Wild Beastmaster's power was negative. For example, if Wild Beastmaster's power is -4, each other creature you control will get -4/-4 until end of turn.

* Worldspine Wurm's last ability is a triggered ability, not a replacement ability. Players can respond to this ability, for example, by trying to exile Worldspine Wurm from the graveyard before it's shuffled into a library.
