### Artist Appearances

**Christopher Moeller**

Christopher Moeller has been writing and painting graphic novels from his studio in Pittsburgh since 1991, his most recent work being the hardcover *JLA: A League of One* for DC Comics. He is currently working on another JLA graphic novel entitled *Cold Steel*. An avid wargamer, Moeller has provided illustrations for a variety of game publishers, including Wizards of the Coast, OSG, White Wolf, FASA, Wiz Kids and Columbia Games. 

**Jerry Tirtilli**

Jerry has been living in a fantasy world for most his life and at some point in his long freelance art career started taking advantage of it and making a living from it. His first job as an artist was doing courtroom sketch art for WGM television. He later worked in an art studio then left and became a freelancer, working for magazines and newspapers amongst other things. Eventually he illustrated book covers and children's books ("The Pagemaster" was a more well know project) and hooked up with WOTC, illustrating **Magic** Cards. " I love working on Fantasy art, stepping into that other, magic, world, created by your own imagination (well, influence by others too)!"

Currently, he just finished working with Gary (Far Side) Larson. "I worked with Gary as a painter, collaborating with ideas and rendering his drawings for book covers for a new 2 volume set of books that will come out, hopefully, next year".

Jerry lives in Chicago with Marge and their daughter Elizabeth. He doesn't want to mention the three cats. Too many cats! "Also I was a prize fighter, an inventor and sold shoes for a couple of months....well I did sell shoes for a couple of months anyway-when I was young".
