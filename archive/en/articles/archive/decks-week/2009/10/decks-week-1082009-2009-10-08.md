Z*endikar* has arrived into the world of Constructed **Magic**! It's already zipping off the shelves, and this weekend marks the first time it'll be seen live in major tournaments! To tide you over, we have a host of **Magic Online** deck lists to serve as jumping-off points for building in the new world. And check out [this week's installments of Daily Decks](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Archive.aspx?tag=dailydeck&description=Daily%20Deck) to see what members of R&D used to face off against fans all over the country during the *Zendikar* Prereleases.
