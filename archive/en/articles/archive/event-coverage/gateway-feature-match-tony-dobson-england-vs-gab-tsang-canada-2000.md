[Click here](http://archive.wizards.com/article.asp?x=MASTERSCHI00%5C901fm2gw) to read how Gab Tsang and Tony Dobson drafted their decks. They each needed to win three more matches to qualify for the $150,000 Masters Series. Dobson has been here before - he ran the table in New York and qualified for that Masters with an Extended Stasis deck.



Tsang only drew two lands in game 1 and they were both Mountains. When he finally drew a Forest he did get to Zap a Sunscape Apprentice, but then Dobson Excluded his first creature and Tsang found himself too far behind to recover.



Game 2 was much more interesting. Tsang played out many beefy green creatures and used two Zaps to destroy two Quirion Sentinels. However, Dobson had the answer in the form of Zanam Djinn. The Djinn was small, but Dobson had a couple of decent blockers holding off Tsang's ground troops while the Djinn served through the air. Tsang managed to beat Dobson down to 5 by attacking and losing two guys every attack phase. However, when Dobson played a Charging Troll, he narrowly avoided losing to the surprise Serpentine Kavu that Tsang had been setting him up for. Tsang was then forced to send Verduran Emissary on a suicide mission just so the Djinn would shrink. Dobson made the mistake of blocking and killing it when he could have just blocked. However, on the extra turn that Tsang bought himself, he could only knock Dobson down to 1. Thus it was Dobson who moved on to the semi-finals, two matches from his second consecutive gateway win.
