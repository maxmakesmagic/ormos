Sam Black ([Blazing Shoal](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Blazing%2BShoal) Infect) vs.Jesse Hampton (Twelvepost)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------





As long as Sam Black has been playing and writing about ****Magic****, it's a little hard to believe this is his first Pro Tour Top 8. The Level 6 pro has several Grand Prix Top 8s to his name and was on the U.S. National Team with Michael Jacob and Paul Cheon that won the team world championship in 2008.


Black is playing one of the breakout decks of the tournament with an essentially mono-blue combo poison list that can kill as early as turn two by exiling [Dragonstorm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragonstorm) or [Progenitus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Progenitus) to [Blazing Shoal](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blazing+Shoal) to deal the full ten poison with either an [Inkmoth Nexus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inkmoth+Nexus) or, on turn three, a [Blighted Agent](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blighted+Agent).


Playing in his very first Pro Tour, Jesse Hampton may be less familiar to some readers, but his recent performances speak for themselves. He placed in the Top 16 at Grand Prix Dallas and took 35th at Pittsburgh last weekend. He's playing one of several variations of the [Cloudpost](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloudpost) deck that uses [Through the Breach](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Through+the+Breach) to make attacking with [Emrakul, the Aeons Torn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Emrakul%2C+the+Aeons+Torn) happen even faster.

*Americans Sam Black and Jesse Hampton battle for a slot in the semifinals.*

Hampton said he didn't like his matchup against Black's blue Infect deck and thought it could be his worst possible draw in the Top 8. He did, however, have some strong sideboard cards in [Dismember](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dismember), [Firespout](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Firespout), and [Punishing Fire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Punishing+Fire). [Punishing Fire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Punishing+Fire) could be especially brutal against Black's deck full of 1/1s.



### Game One


Black mulliganed to six to start, but his fast poison deck only needs a few cards to kill quickly regardless.


Hampton, on the play for the first game, started with the classic [Cloudpost](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloudpost), while Black had the weekend's signature play, a turn one [Ponder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ponder), declining to shuffle.


A [Vesuva](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vesuva) let Hampton cast a [Gruul Signet](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gruul+Signet) off his first [Cloudpost](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloudpost), but Black had both an [Inkmoth Nexus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inkmoth+Nexus) and a [Blighted Agent](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blighted+Agent) on turn two, possibly spelling a quick end to the game. Main deck, Hampton's answers were limited to [Beast Within](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Beast+Within) and [Through the Breach](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Through+the+Breach) for something with annihilator, putting him in a tough spot if Black had virtually any counterspell.


Hampton chose to keep his mana open for [Beast Within](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Beast+Within), playing a second [Vesuva](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vesuva) and passing the turn. Black, mindful of [Beast Within](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Beast+Within), played [Preordain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Preordain) and attacked for just one poison counter.


Now on a whopping ten mana on turn three, Hampton once again just played a land—[Dryad Arbor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dryad+Arbor)—and passed, still representing [Beast Within](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Beast+Within). Black, meanwhile, used an end-of-turn [Peer Through Depths](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Peer+Through+Depths) to find a [Blazing Shoal](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blazing+Shoal).


When he went for it the following turn, Hampton did indeed have the [Beast Within](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Beast+Within), but Black had [Muddle the Mixture](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Muddle+the+Mixture) to force eleven poison counters through and take game one.


Black 1, Hampton 0



### Game Two


Both players kept their seven, and Black led with a [Gitaxian Probe](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gitaxian+Probe) and a tapped [Tolaria West](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tolaria+West). The probe revealed a relatively slow hand for Hampton, but it did contain a [Firespout](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Firespout) to take care of any early [Blighted Agent](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blighted+Agent)s.


Black used a [Scalding Tarn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scalding+Tarn) to search up and [Island](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island), then followed it with a [Preordain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Preordain) into a [Ponder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ponder), choosing not to shuffle.


A [Glimmerpost](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glimmerpost) allowed Hampton to play [Oracle of Mul Daya](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oracle+of+Mul+Daya), except Hampton had no second land and saw "only" an [Emrakul, the Aeons Torn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Emrakul%2C+the+Aeons+Torn) on top of his deck.


Meanwhile, Black played his trusty [Blighted Agent](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blighted+Agent) and passed the turn.

*Jesse Hampton has made a phenomenal run, especially considering his relative inexperience with the format coming into the weekend.*

Oracle was kinder this turn, revealing [Grove of the Burnwillows](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grove+of+the+Burnwillows) and [Misty Rainforest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Misty+Rainforest) off the top of Hampton's deck. Hampton attacked with the Oracle to put Black to 15. This time, with no [Inkmoth Nexus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inkmoth+Nexus) on site and his opponent tapped low, Hampton took the opportunity to cast [Beast Within](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Beast+Within) on the [Blighted Agent](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blighted+Agent), giving Black a mostly irrelevant 3/3 [Beast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Beast) token.


Yet another [Preordain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Preordain) let Black keep both cards on top, and allowed him to play both [Inkmoth Nexus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inkmoth+Nexus) and a [Spellskite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spellskite) to protect it from the [Dismember](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dismember) sitting on top of Hampton's deck.


Hampton drew the [Dismember](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dismember), but shuffled away the revealed [Primeval Titan](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Primeval+Titan) with the [Misty Rainforest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Misty+Rainforest), finding an untapped [Stomping Ground](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stomping+Ground) in the process. The life totals stood at 18-15 in Hampton's favor, but when you're casting Eldrazi and looking to poison people, life totals are usually unimportant.


A [Vesuva](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vesuva) copying [Inkmoth Nexus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inkmoth+Nexus) gave Hampton possible blocking options if he could untap with it in play. Yet another [Preordain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Preordain) shipped two cards to the bottom for Black, and he cast a second [Spellskite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spellskite), still unable or unwilling to get in for ten poison. [Seal of Primordium](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seal+of+Primordium) gave Hampton another possible layer of protection, one that couldn't be countered once it was in play. It could, however, be redirected by one of Black's two [Spellskite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spellskite)s.


A [Ponder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ponder), roughly the eighty-seventh cantrip Black had played this game, again resulted in no shuffle as he continued to stack his hand and his draw. Hampton, drawing nothing of relevance, simply cast [Wall of Roots](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wall+of+Roots) and passed, while Black responded with yet another [Ponder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ponder) (no shuffle) and the deadly [Blighted Agent](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blighted+Agent), still backed up by two [Spellskite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spellskite)s.


Those [Spellskite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spellskite)s, however, could not protect the Agent from [Firespout](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Firespout), which cleared the board of the offending unblockable, the [Beast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Beast) token, and Hampton's own [Oracle of Mul Daya](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oracle+of+Mul+Daya).


Black had a strong follow-up with an end of turn [Peer Through Depths](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Peer+Through+Depths) to find [Muddle the Mixture](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Muddle+the+Mixture) and then the third [Blighted Agent](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blighted+Agent) of the match.


Making his first big play of the game, Hampton resolved a [Primeval Titan](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Primeval+Titan) to find two [Cloudpost](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloudpost)s. If he could survive the next turn, the [Emrakul, the Aeons Torn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Emrakul%2C+the+Aeons+Torn) in his hand threatened to win the game outright.


Black, now forced into action, transmuted [Muddle the Mixture](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Muddle+the+Mixture) for [Blazing Shoal](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blazing+Shoal), which he used along with [Dragonstorm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragonstorm) to deal exactly ten poison.


Black 2, Hampton 0



### Game Three


Hampton had turn-one [Cloudpost](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloudpost) again, while Black unsurprisingly played a turn-one [Ponder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ponder) and shuffled. [Glimmerpost](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glimmerpost) and [Gruul Signet](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gruul+Signet) powered up Hampton's mana and allowed him to [Punishing Fire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Punishing+Fire)s Black's second-turn [Blighted Agent](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blighted+Agent) at the end of turn.



![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/ptphi11/qf2_hampton2.jpg)
*Are you ready for this?*

When Hampton played a [Grove of the Burnwillows](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grove+of+the+Burnwillows), things looked bleak for Black. When he followed that with a [Through the Breach](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Through+the+Breach) revealing [Primeval Titan](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Primeval+Titan), all on turn three, Black opted to concede in the face of mountains of mana and the [Punishing Fire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Punishing+Fire) engine.


Black 2, Hampton 1



### Game Four


After his ridiculous third turn in game three, Hampton's fortunes didn't hold as he was forced to mulligan to a six card hand with only two mana sources, but plenty of removal.


To the surprise of no one, Black played a turn one [Preordain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Preordain), leaving both cards on top, followed by a [Ponder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ponder) that shuffled away some junk and a second [Preordain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Preordain) that left two cards on top. After only his second turn, Black had already looked at seven additional cards.


Hampton, meanwhile, got off to a significantly slower start with just a [Forest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest) and a [Vesuva](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vesuva) copying [Forest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest) and no other action. A [Spellskite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spellskite) landed on Black's side of the table and promptly ate a [Dismember](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dismember), but that cleared the way for a [Blighted Agent](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blighted+Agent) the following turn.



![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/ptphi11/qf2_black.jpg)
*Sam Black aims to poison Jesse Hampton right out of this Top 8.*

Hampton, however, could only muster the less-than-useful [Eye of Ugin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eye+of+Ugin) followed by [Cloudpost](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloudpost) without any other Loci. With only two untapped mana in play, he couldn't even cast [Beast Within](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Beast+Within) if Black chose to attempt a [Blazing Shoal](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blazing+Shoal).


Instead, Black cast [Peer Through Depths](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Peer+Through+Depths) and attacked for just one poison, either electing not to play into another possible [Dismember](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dismember) or still searching for another combo piece while stuck on two lands.


Hampton's mana base was also getting nowhere fast, and he simply passed the turn after drawing, holding ups [Beast Within](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Beast+Within) mana.


However, Black found his opening when an [Inkmoth Nexus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inkmoth+Nexus) allowed him to transmute [Muddle the Mixture](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Muddle+the+Mixture) for [Blazing Shoal](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blazing+Shoal), and then follow it up with [Summoner's Pact](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Summoner%27s+Pact) for [Progenitus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Progenitus). When Black went for the win, Hampton did indeed have the [Beast Within](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Beast+Within), but was stopped by a very timely [Pact of Negation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pact+of+Negation) to seal the game and the match for Black.


Sam Black 3 defeats Jesse Hampton 3-1 and advances to the semifinals!
