The current Pro Tour policy has the semifinalists and finalists given their opponent's decklists for review. While the two players were setting up for their first game of the best of five series, a judge came by and dropped off numerous tokens for Edel.


Didierjean: "I can't imagine what those are for." Oh, those subtle Pro Tour players.


### Game 1


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/ptkob06/SF_Edel_Didierjean.jpg)*Thomas Didierjean watches as Willy's Edel's Grapeshotdoes its work.*
Willy started off mono-green this match, playing four [Forest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest)s into the powerful [Penumbra Spider](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Penumbra+Spider). Willy finally found a [Mountain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mountain) on turn six and used it to playone [Ironclaw Buzzardiers](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ironclaw+Buzzardiers), then a second one. Thomas had a great start to his opponent's weak one: [Foriysian Totem](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Foriysian+Totem) helped helped him cast his fifth-turn [Fury Sliver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fury+Sliver). Next turn Thomas played [Coal Stoker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Coal+Stoker) and used the mana to activate the Totem, attacking for a whopping 10 points. The Buzzardiers had to stay out of the way, so the Spider absorbed 6 of the points for the turn. [Faceless Devourer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Faceless+Devourer) gave Thomas yet another source of pressure. Double [Grapeshot](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grapeshot) from Willy killed the [Fury Sliver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fury+Sliver), but he still couldn't stop the Totem and shadow guy. [Tendrils of Corruption](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tendrils+of+Corruption) on the Spider token earned the concession and gave Thomas the opening lead.

### Game 2


Willy came out like gangbusters this game. Here's a rundown of his first five turns:




|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Turn 1 | Suspend Durkwood Baloth |
| Turn 2 | Thallid Shell-Dweller |
| Turn 3 | Thallid Germinator |
| Turn 4 | Thallid Germinator |
| Turn 5 | Penumbra Spider |

Not only was this an incredible opening, Willy cast it off four different land types. Not remembering the lesson from the first game, Thomas cast an [Ironclaw Buzzardiers](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ironclaw+Buzzardiers) and quickly flew it right into the Spider. Thomas searched his hand for a way to salvage the mis-attack, and finding none, angrily put his creature in the graveyard. Thomas tried to get back in the game with a [Tendrils of Corruption](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tendrils+of+Corruption) on one of the Germinators and [Pit Keeper](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pit+Keeper) alongside [Vampiric Sliver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vampiric+Sliver) to take down the Baloth. It wasn't enough, as Willy played [Verdant Embrace](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Verdant+Embrace) on his Spider and starting dealing massive damage to the French player. After the tokens began accumulating, double [Thrill of the Hunt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thrill+of+the+Hunt) finished the job.

### Game 3


Thomas started to groan when his opponent tapped a [Forest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest) and put a card aside, but caught himself when he saw it was just a [Search for Tomorrow](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Search+for+Tomorrow). The land fetcher played pretty well with Willy though, as it enabled him a turn-three [Sporesower Thallid](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sporesower+Thallid). The Sporesower came in for four points but died the next turn as Thomas [Assassinate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Assassinate)d the Fungus, nipping the problem in the bud. Willy wasn't done playing threats, as a [Thallid Germinator](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thallid+Germinator) came into play. Thomas tapped out for a Totem and a [Basal Sliver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Basal+Sliver), which gave Edel the opportunity to play [Verdant Embrace](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Verdant+Embrace) on his Germinator and attack for 5.

"I hateâ€¦this Embrace," Thomas told the table as he adjusted his life total. Thomas did have a solution of sorts to the 5/5 in [Stuffy Doll](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stuffy+Doll), although the Saprolings continued to increase. A suspended [Nantuko Shaman](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nantuko+Shaman) from Willy gave him more offense to work with, in addition to a free card. Thomas stayed alive as best he could, but he was taking far more damage than he was dealing back. Willy's final card in [Pardic Dragon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pardic+Dragon) was far too much for Thomas to handle, and died a fiery, mossy death.


Edel 2 - Didierjean 1


### Game 4


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/ptkob06/SF_Edel_Smile.jpg)*Willy smiles apologetically.*
Thomas decided to start with a [Pit Keeper](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pit+Keeper) for this game, perhaps hoping to get in some damage before the field became overrun with grass and fungi. He never had the opportunity, as Willy aimed [Grapeshot](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grapeshot) at the Human Wizard. Both players played a [Thallid](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thallid)-type on their next turn, Willy with a Germinator and Thomas with [Phyrexian Totem](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phyrexian+Totem) into Deathspore. Things grew worse for Thomas soon after, as an unsuspended [Nantuko Shaman](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nantuko+Shaman) took on Willy's favorite card, that same [Verdant Embrace](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Verdant+Embrace). Thomas literally slumped in his seat as he saw the rare aura in play again. Willy gave a little apologetic smile, but his sympathy didn't prevent him from attacking for 6 points.


Thomas tried to hang on as well as he could, but clearly needed his MIA [Assassinate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Assassinate) to handle the Shaman. Thomas's shrinking life total forced him into a major block with [Phyrexian Totem](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phyrexian+Totem). That + [Feebleness](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Feebleness) did the job but left the Frenchman with almost zero permanents. A [Smallpox](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Smallpox) to kill [Durkwood Baloth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Durkwood+Baloth) reduced his resources even further. Willy Edel still wasn't out of creatures by this point, much to Thomas's horror. With two Totems in play, still facing heavy damage, Thomas looked at his grip and had to extend the hand.


Didierjean: "Nicely done."
