Yesterday the Grand Prix attendance world record belonged to Kobe, where Pro Tour players will be playing next week. That magic number was 1348 in August 2001. Today that record fell.

There are 1353 (yup, it was THAT close) players eagerly waiting for their sealed decks in Madrid. There are tables literally EVERYWHERE. In a few minutes this record crowd will begin their nine round Odyssey, scrambling for one of the 128 coveted slots that will earn them the right to draft for free tomorrow.

Stick around, and we will bring you all the late-breaking action right here.
