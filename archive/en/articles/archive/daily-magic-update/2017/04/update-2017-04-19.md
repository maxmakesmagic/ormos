The Daily *Magic* Update is a roundup of everything *Magic* you should know on April 19, 2017. Today's Update is brought to you by the [*Amonkhet* Prerelease](http://magic.wizards.com/en/event-types/prerelease). Are you signed up for yours?


Today's Musts
=============


1. [Nissa, Steward of Elements](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjvO4r2SdZA) | Howard Lyon

Check out this beautiful time-lapse video of Howard Lyon's [Nissa, Steward of Elements](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nissa%2C+Steward+of+Elements) painting, where he goes from outline to fully finished piece in the span of about 5 minutes. I'm fairly certain it took him longer than that in real life, so this is pretty fun to watch. Mesmerizing, in fact.

After Those, Read, Watch, or Listen to These
============================================


1. [*Amonkhet* Limited Set Review: Blue](https://www.channelfireball.com/articles/amonkhet-limited-set-review-blue/) | ChannelFireball | Luis Scott-Vargas

I'll probably keep reminding everyone about LSV's set reviews now and then as the week goes on, but you really should be on these by now. I mean, his very first entry in this one is on [Ancient Crab](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ancient+Crab), and he actually says "I'd be pretty crabby if my aggro deck ended up with one of these." How can you turn that down?


1. [The *Amonkhet* Flavor Review](http://www.starcitygames.com/article/34947_The-Amonkhet-Flavor-Review.html) | StarCityGames.com | John Dale Beety

*Amonkhet* is a bit of a top-down set (meaning it was designed flavorfully), so the set is positively dripping with flavor. John dives in deep to explore the story found on the cards, checks out the new artists in the set, and reviews the flavor of many, many cards.


1. [MTG Top 10: Cats](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFyz0J5tnEU) | Aether Hub | Nizzahon

My fiancée would probably disown me if I didn't include a *Magic* video about Cats in the update, but this one also just happens to be a fun look at the best Cats in *Magic*'s history. Nizzahon actually based this list on high-level tournament results, so there's a bit of a Spike bent to it. But they're all still fuzzy and adorable. Mostly.

1. [*Amonkhet* Commander Set Review](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iCHQr8kTow) | Commander's Brew | Sean Tabares and Andy Hull

Two talking heads (that would be Tabares and Hull) review *Amonkhet* for the world of Commander. It clocks in at an astounding 2 hours, so it is quite thorough.


<https://www.youtube.com/embed/6iCHQr8kTow>


1. [Commander Review: *Amonkhet* Part 1 (Mechanics, White, Blue, Black)](https://www.mtggoldfish.com/articles/commander-review-amonkhet-part-1-mechanics-white-blue-black?src=wizards) | MTGGoldfish | Tomer Abramovici

Want more Commander reviews of *Amonkhet*? Tomer's got you covered, starting with the mechanics and working his way through the color pie. I love reading these things, because the angles are always ones I don't tend to think of right away. [Trial of Knowledge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Trial+of+Knowledge) with [Brago, King Eternal](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brago%2C+King+Eternal)? [Drake Haven](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Drake+Haven) with [Nekusar, the Mindrazer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nekusar%2C+the+Mindrazer) and [Wheel of Fortune](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wheel+of+Fortune)? Be still my beating heart.


*Magic* Player Profile Survey
=============================


1. [Want to influence how we make *Magic*?](https://www.research.net/r/mtg-motivations)

What do you want as a *Magic* fan? How can we better serve what you're looking for as a gamer? You can let us know directly with [this new survey](https://www.research.net/r/mtg-motivations) we've put out that's currently active and waiting for your feedback.


Although we're already well aware of [your feelings on Sensei's Divining Top](http://imgur.com/NvLcIoL), so you can leave that part out.


What People Are Talking About
=============================


1. [Worthy Commons](http://sarpadianempiresvol-viii.tumblr.com/post/159753278394/worthy-commons) | Sarpadian Empires Vol. VIII

Andrew Weisel of Sarpadian Empires Vol. VIII (the Tumblr, not [the card](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=114921)) is one of the more popular and prolific *Magic* Tumblr users, and his worthy offering today is a brief highlight of common cards from each color that will do more than pull their weight come the Prerelease this weekend.


Access *Magic*
==============


1. [Access *Magic* *Amonkhet*—Episode 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgqQMfeCOEo)

Want to learn about the [Trial of Strength](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Trial+of+Strength)? Pump some iron with Maria Bartholdi and Gavin Verhey in this video that tells you more.

Deck of the Day
===============


1. [Zombies!](https://www.channelfireball.com/articles/zombies-in-amonkhet-standard/) | ChannelFireball | Reid Duke

With *both* *Shadows over Innistrad* and *Amonkhet* bringing a bevy of Zombies, the undead have rarely felt more playable in Standard. Reid goes straight for the throat with two different takes on the archetype—one completely mono-black and the other touching on blue for [Prized Amalgam](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Prized+Amalgam). Today we'll look at the mono-black version, as it pushes the creature type Zombie to the forefront (though [check out his article](https://www.channelfireball.com/articles/zombies-in-amonkhet-standard/) for both lists).


The deck hits hard and fast and gets to play multiple Zombie "lords," which [Diregraf Colossus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Diregraf+Colossus) loosely could be called as well. The deck is brutal and straightforward—play Zombies, make Zombies bigger, play more Zombies. Maybe eat some brains.
