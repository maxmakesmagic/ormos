![Neurok Prodigy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Neurok+Prodigy)### Game 1

Omar won the roll and chose to play.

Omar cycled a [Pyrite Spellbomb](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyrite+Spellbomb) and played a [Neurok Prodigy](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Neurok+Prodigy) while Bernard started his game with an [Auriok Transfixer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Auriok+Transfixer), Pteroc Ghost, [Viridian Longbow](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Viridian+Longbow) and drew a card from a [Lifespark Spellbomb](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lifespark+Spellbomb). Bernard was having some mana problems and Omar kept increasing the pressure with [Hematite Golem](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hematite+Golem), [Goblin War Wagon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+War+Wagon) and [Duskworker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duskworker).

A Krark Clan Grunt came to help on defense, trading Bernardo's equipment for Omar's attacking creatures, but Bernardo's life was already on single digits. When Bernardo cast the [Spikeshot Goblin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spikeshot+Goblin) and [Leonin Sun Standard](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leonin+Sun+Standard), he started to slowly remove the attacking creatures, while all Omar could do about it was to keep hitting on Bernardo's life and use some [Aether Spellbomb](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aether+Spellbomb)s to delay the Spikeys effect.

As the Belgian drew both [Vulshok Battlegear](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vulshok+Battlegear) and Vulshok Morningstar, the goblin took total control of the game and the additional creatures from Omar only delayed his incoming demise. With Bernardo at one life the spikeshot dealt the final damage to Omar.

### Game 2

With only thirteen minutes left in the round, Omar chose to play.

Omar cycled a [Sunbeam Spellbomb](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sunbeam+Spellbomb), and cast [Skullclamp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skullclamp) and [Neurok Prodigy](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Neurok+Prodigy). Bernardo played an Auriok transfixer, the [Leonin Sun Standard](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leonin+Sun+Standard) and a [Slith Ascendant](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Slith+Ascendant). [Goblin Replica](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Replica) was equiped with the [Skullclamp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skullclamp) and took the standard down, drawing two cards in the process.

Another [Auriok Transfixer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Auriok+Transfixer) and [Skyhunter Cub](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skyhunter+Cub) join the Belgian's team with the Cub receiving some [Vulshok Battlegear](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vulshok+Battlegear). Bernardo [Detonate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Detonate)s the clamp and Omar is forced to trade both Somber and [Looming Hoverguard](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Looming+Hoverguard)s for the cub and in the next turn the prodigy, a Drill Skimmer and [Arcbound Crusher](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arcbound+Crusher) all had to sacrifice themselves to kill the slith.

Bernardo played a [Leonin Bola](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leonin+Bola), and his "tapping team" didn't left many options to Omar. Time ends and in the extra turns Bernardo is able to keep Omar from killing him, and wins the second game on his last turn.
