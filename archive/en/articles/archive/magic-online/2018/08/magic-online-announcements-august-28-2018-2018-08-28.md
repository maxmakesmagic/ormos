*Khans of Tarkir* Flashback
---------------------------


If you have never drafted *Khans of Tarkir*, or loved it when *KTK* came out, we have quite the treat for you! This week you'll be able to [delve](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=446789) into drafting with *Khans of Tarkir* packs. Note that this is a Phantom Event, so you can't keep these cards long term. The League opens Wednesday, August 29, following the downtime and closes Wednesday, September 5, at 10 a.m. PT. The league officially ends Wednesday, September 5, at 2 p.m. PT.

Post-Game Actions Temporary Turnoff
-----------------------------------


We're going to be turning off our post-game actions, such as showing your hand after the game, to help us track down in-game bugs. This will be turned off on Wednesday, August 29, and will remain turned off until the following day, as it's been off for the past week.

Premier Play Schedule Adjustments Next Two Weekends
---------------------------------------------------


This weekend's Pro Tour Qualifier, previously scheduled for Sunday at 9 a.m., will be held instead on **Saturday**at 9 a.m.


Those intending to play in the Modern Challenge at 8 a.m. can instead play in a 9 a.m. PTQ, then in the Format Challenge if the first few rounds don't go so well.


This change applies to both this weekend and next weekend: a PTQ moving from September 2 to September 1, and another one moving from September 9 to September 8.

PTQ Saturday

The Modern PTQ Finals originally scheduled for this Sunday will now be held this Saturday, September 1, at 9 a.m. PT. The winner qualifies for Pro Tour *Ravnica Allegiance*. How exciting! The entry options are 30 Event Tickets or 300 Play Points.
