One of the things I find so fascinating about the ****Magic**** game is its mutability. It's right there in the Golden Rule of ****Magic****: When the cards contradict the rules, the cards win. That ability to shift the boundaries of the game on the fly keeps things exciting. You can never be sure of what will happen in a given game. You'll show up to some matches ready for a gunfight, and it'll turn out that the order of the day is tea and tiddlywinks. 


The card that really brings this point home for me is [Meddling Mage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Meddling+Mage). Two mana and suddenly whatever future mischief your opponent was chuckling about gets the bum's rush. If your opponent wants to unfold that master plan, he or she will have to dispatch Mr. Pikula. Rule-breaking cards like this are all over the place. [Exploration](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Exploration) breaks the one-land-per-turn rule. [Crumbling Sanctuary](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crumbling+Sanctuary) swaps damage for decking while still leaving the door open to the Misfits-inspired [Last Caress](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Last+Caress) and other loss of life cards. If you want to get really arcane, you can look to something like [Zur's Weirding](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Zur%27s+Weirding) that takes the right to draw a card every turn and turns it into some sort of tough-guy competition. I'd be remiss if I didn't briefly mention alternate victory conditions, à la [Battle of Wits](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Battle+of+Wits). 


There's an obvious strategic advantage to throwing a wooden shoe (called "sabot") into your opponents' machinery. If they can't play the game by your rules, they're not going to be able to win. Mage fighting isn't all "Get him, my flying monkeys!" and foom to the face. With all due respect to *Lord of the Rings* fans, nor is it some kind of telekinetic wrestling match. There's strategizing, creativity, and quick-wittedness, gradually working your opponent into submission through an elaborate series of moves and countermoves. That isn't to say it's some sort of high-stakes game of Nomic. It's somewhere in between. For a choice example of wizard combat, look no further than *The Sword in the Stone* or its subsequent reinterpretation in the pages of *Sandman* comics. Battles are waged one-on-one, a combination of might and cunning. And when all else fails, you can turn yourself into a giant dragon and chow down on your opponent's noggin. 


What, you can't do that last one? Think again. 


![Form of the Dragon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Form+of+the+Dragon)Enter [Form of the Dragon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Form+of+the+Dragon), a card that combines the great tastes of rule breaking and creative manslaughter. When I first saw the name, I expected nothing less than an Enchant Player (bearing in mind that they don't exist) that turned you into a dragon. Imagine my surprise when it lived up to my expectations. Seven mana makes you a 5/5 flyer with the ability to deliver pain made to order. You even heal damage at the end of turn! We've all heard the old chestnut "If you want something done right, you have to do it yourself." Well, [Form of the Dragon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Form+of+the+Dragon) lets you give your monsters the day off while you get your hands dirty. After all, who doesn't have a little [Trogdor](http://www.homestarrunner.com/sbemail58.html) in them? 


The big draw is obviously the no-nonsense 5 damage a turn. Besides being efficient player removal, you can aim the fire hose at any troublesome beastie on the board. [Worship](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Worship) will need more than just your average crew to keep your opponent alive. It also helps to make sure that your opponent doesn't accumulate enough fliers to swing in for the win. After all, dragons are resilient, but not that resilient. It's almost too bad that the burnination is going to end games in such a hurry. Sure, you get the joy of blowing up your enemy, but what about all the cool stuff that the Form lets you do? Like the dragons of Shiv, you'll want to play with your food. 


The fact that creatures without flying can't get to you is more than just a great bit of flavor. Because the [Form of the Dragon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Form%2Bof%2Bthe%2BDragon) leaves you at the low end of "alive," it'll save your bacon from an incoming horde. There's nothing like negating your opponent's principal route to victory, and sometimes it'll do just that. So far, things are looking pretty good for "Transform and Roll Out." 


The bad news is your new life total. Going down to 5 is likely to be a drag. Still, it's not like you plan on being in the comfortable teens all the time. In truly dire situations, it could even be a boon. The real fun is that you constantly get reset to 5. This means your opponent can't use a slow blade to penetrate your shield. Better yet, it means you've got an endless source of life points to spend on effects -- assuming your opponent survives the barrage of 5-to-the-face you're dealing each turn. 


Your new wealth of health can buy you all kinds of goodies. On the survival front, [Righteous Aura](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Righteous+Aura) gives you a two-source buffer against damage. If you've got appropriate mana, [Protective Sphere](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Protective+Sphere) does even more. A life total of 5 can be a little dicey so it probably doesn't hurt to have a way to keep yourself sturdy. It also happens to be the right number to go with [Convalescent Care](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Convalescent+Care), giving you an extra card and three more life to work with on your turn. If that seems like a lot of enchantments to worry about, why not try on a [Sterling Grove](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sterling+Grove)? There's no sense in letting a [Naturalize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Naturalize) ruin your fun. 


Beyond the mundane task of keeping yourself alive and blasting, that life can be used to draw cards with [Book of Rass](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Book+of+Rass) or [Sylvan Library](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sylvan+Library) or to gun down weenies with [Reckless Assault](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reckless+Assault), or even to create a pseudolock with [Zur's Weirding](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Zur%27s+Weirding). The possibilities are limited only by your own tolerance for self-destruction. Just don't get too caught up and neglect your opponent. He or she deserves a little destruction too. 


It's like Sean Connery said in *Zardoz,* quoting Nietzsche: "He who fights too long against dragons, becomes a dragon himself." Sure, he didn't mean it as advice, or literally, but the sentiment is there. Go out and do him proud.
