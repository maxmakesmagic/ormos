 Ask Wizards is a weekly feature that allows you to ask us questions! If you'd like to submit your question please email it to [AskWizards@wizards.com](mailto:AskWizards@wizards.com). We aren't able to answer every question we receive but if your question is good then it might show up in the coming weeks! 



**Q:** Why wasn't [Trostani, Selesnya's Voice](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Trostani%2C+Selesnya%27s+Voice) the wallpaper for Selesnya week? 



**A: Monty Ashley, Magic: The Gathering Web Producer**



![Trostani, Selesnya's Voice](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Trostani%2C+Selesnya%27s+Voice)Good question! As you might remember, the wallpaper during Selesnya week was actually [Sphinx of the Chimes](/en/articles/archive/wallpaper-week-sphinx-chimes-2012-10-03), which is a great piece, but not particularly Selesnyan.


There are really two questions to answer here. For the first, "Shouldn't theme weeks have a wallpaper that matches the theme?" the answer is clearly yes. Next week is Azorius Week and the wallpaper will be Azorius.


But the other question, which is basically "Hey, how come there aren't wallpapers for the guild leaders?" has a more interesting answer. Because there *are*! You just don't know where they live.


In [GuildsofRavnica.com](http://www.guildsofravnica.com), there's a quiz to see what guild you are. But there are also pages about each guild. And if you go into, say, [the Selesnya page](http://www.wizards.com/magic/tcg/productarticle.aspx?x=mtg/tcg/guilds/selesnya), you'll find the words "Download the Selesnya Fan Kit."


And that? That's a 33MB ZIP file with 220 images. It's got *extremely* high resolution art files. It's got PNGs of each aspect of the Selesnya texture. It's got logos. And it's got wallpapers for [Common Bond](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Common+Bond); [Vitu-Ghazi Guildmage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vitu-Ghazi+Guildmage); and, yes, [Trostani, Selesnya's Voice](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Trostani%2C+Selesnya%27s+Voice). And the other nine guilds also have fan kits! So if you're just looking for wallpapers (especially if you're interested in Guildmages and Guild Leaders), you should know that there are thirty of them waiting for you in [GuildsofRavnica.com](http://www.guildsofravnica.com).


And yes, some of those wallpapers are from *Gatecrash*.
