What in the world is an [Onulet](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Onulet)? Well, it's a creature that gives you two life when it goes to the graveyard -- an effect mirroring that of the Alpha card [Soul Net](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soul+Net). The card was supposed to be called "Onulets" -- with an "s" -- which is an anagram of [Soul Net](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soul+Net).

But the art came back with just one little pink coffee table on it, not suitable for the plural name. So the "s" went away, and the wordplay went with it.
