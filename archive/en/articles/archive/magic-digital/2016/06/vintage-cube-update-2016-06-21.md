Vintage Cube Update
===================

From Friday Night Magic to the Pro Tour, Adam Prosak loves all types of tournament Magic. Currently, Adam is working in R&D as a developer. 






Hello, *Magic Online* players!


The *Vintage Cube* is great. Within R&D, we are really happy with how it's doing, and we don't think there are any particular overhauls we want to make. We like the themes and we feel that the game encapsulates the feel of Vintage *Magic*—which includes the strongest cards in the history of *Magic*.


That being said, there are still opportunities to tune and improve. First, there are new cards since the last time we've run the *Vintage Cube*. Cards from *Commander (2015 Edition)*, *Oath of the Gatewatch*, and *Shadows over Innistrad* have found their way into the *Vintage Cube*.


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Traverse+the+Ulvenwald)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Traverse+the+Ulvenwald)[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Kozilek%2C+the+Great+Distortion)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kozilek%2C+the+Great+Distortion)[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Fiery+Confluence)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fiery+Confluence)
One of the big additions from *Oath of the Gatewatch* is the completion of the cycle of creature lands, begun in *Worldwake* and continued in *Battle for Zendikar*. As a rule, we don't like to include incomplete cycles of lands, as it unbalances the color fixing available. We've always wanted to include the *Worldwake* lands, but until *Oath of the Gatewatch*, the cycle of ten creature lands was not complete. Now that they are, you can expect to see the creature lands in most iterations of *Magic Online* cubes.

The other subtle shift we plan on doing for our cubes has to do with the color identity of cards. While we have [Lingering Souls](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lingering+Souls) listed as a white card, in practice it only goes into decks with both white and black cards. We've moved cards with off-color flashback to multicolored. In addition, we've found that cards that require Phyrexian mana often go into decks that are not of that color. You'll see [Dismember](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dismember) in a blue-white deck or [Porcelain Legionnaire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Porcelain+Legionnaire) in a mono-red deck fairly often. We've decided to make these cards count as colorless cards. For quite some time, we've counted [Vedalken Shackles](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vedalken+Shackles) as a blue card and [Shrine of Burning Rage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shrine+of+Burning+Rage) as a red card, even though they are technically colorless artifacts. Expanding this to include off-color flashback and Phryexian mana helps us get the right color balance from a practical standpoint, and not just a technical standpoint.


That's all for now. We'll continue to update the *Vintage Cube* with new stuff, and we hope that you continue to enjoy playing the *Vintage Cube*.


I'll see you in the queues.
