### Team Japan


Ryuichiro Ishida had only 27 individual points after a 3-3 showing in Standard and a nearly disastrous 1-5 record in Booster Draft, but he rebounded nicely on Day Three to go 5-1 with Domain Zoo. With Japan only finishing four points ahead of the United States, Ishida's 5-1 record in Modern was hugely important to Japan's ascent to the top of the standings. Also, like teammate Tomoya Fujimoto, his 3-0-1 record in the team competition against Finland, Switzerland, Germany and the Netherlands was key.


Tomoya Fujimoto was second on the Japanese squad with 28 individual points, but he really shined in the team competition. His perfect 4-0 record in Legacy helped Japan lead all countries in team round points with 36, bashing some difficult competition from Finland, Switzerland, Germany and the Netherlands.


Makihito Mihara was the rock that paced the Japanese team in individual competition with a whopping 34 points in the Swiss rounds. He finished the individual competition in 49th place. He finished 2-2 in team rounds, but with his teammates going undefeated, it was hardly needed.

### Team Norway


Sveinung Bjørnerud, like all of the Norway team members, put in a solid individual performance, finishing 77th with 33 points at 11-7. He put up his best numbers in Modern, but went 2-2 in the team competition in the same format. Along with Kristoffer Jonassen, he was the high individual scorer for the team.


Jonassen dominated Standard this weekend, going 5-1 in the individual rounds and 3-1 in the team rounds. His 2-4 finish on Booster Draft day kept him from finishing high in the standings, but he still managed a top 64 finish – at exactly 64th place – to help his team edge the United States by just two small points.


Nordahl stumbled out of the gate with an unfortunate 1-5 Standard record, but immediately rebounded by being one of only a handful of players with a perfect draft record on Day Two before rounding out his weekend with a 3-3 in Modern. But where he really made noise was in Legacy with a 4-0 record, facing down teams from Sweden, Finland, Mexico and Denmark. He'll face off against Tomoya Fujimoto in a battle of undefeated Legacy players.
