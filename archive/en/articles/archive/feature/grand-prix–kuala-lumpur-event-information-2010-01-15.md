**Tournament Structure** 


* Grand Prix–Kuala Lumpur will be run over two days using modified Swiss-style rounds of 50 minutes each. The number of rounds on Day 1 will be determined based on the number of players registered. Players will be paired randomly against players with similar win-loss records, with match points accumulating throughout the event.
* If 799 or fewer players register for the event, all players with an X-2-0 or better record OR the top 64 players—whichever number is greater—will advance to the second day of the event.
* If 800 or more players register for the event, all players with an X-2-0 or better record OR the top 128 players—whichever number is greater—will advance to the second day of the event.
* The Top 8 players after the final Swiss round on Day 2 will advance to the Top 8 single-elimination playoff round.
* Top 8 playoff matches will be best 2 of 3, and have no time limit. (Players are still expected to play at a normal pace and complete playoff matches in a reasonable amount of time.)
* Where necessary, the standings after the Swiss rounds will still be used to determine final order in the standings.

**Judges**
  
 The head judge for Grand Prix–Kuala Lumpur is Wearn Ee Chong. If you wish to volunteer as a judge at Grand Prix–Kuala Lumpur, please contact David Ong at [david.ong@wizards.com](mailto:david.ong@wizards.com).

A player who has a bye in a round does not have to play a match in that round, but is treated as having won. A bye is normally given out to a player when there are an odd number of players in a round, but byes may also be rewarded to players for previous performance at a tournament or as a prize at a Trial tournament. Byes will be given to players in the Grand Prix based on the following criteria *(Byes are not cumulative throughout the season or year. Byes do not pass down under any circumstances. Players that accumulate multiple byes to a particular Grand Prix tournament receive only the bye for the greatest number of rounds)*:

* Players with a [Players Club](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/TCG/Events.aspx?x=protour/playersclub/guidelines) level of 4 or higher

* Winners of Grand Prix–Kuala Lumpur Trial tournaments.

**Second-Round Byes** 
  


* Players with a [Players Club](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/TCG/Events.aspx?x=protour/playersclub/guidelines) level of 2 or 3
* Players with a DCI Total rating of 1950 or higher. Byes are based on DCI Total ratings published on March 10, 2010.
