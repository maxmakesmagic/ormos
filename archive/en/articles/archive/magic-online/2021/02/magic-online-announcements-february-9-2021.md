*Kaldheim* Season Alternative Play Calendar
-------------------------------------------


For *Kaldheim* season's alternative play, we have quite the variety for you. Please note that events change over from one week to the next on Wednesday mornings and last for one week unless specified otherwise.


* **February 17: *Modern Horizons* Encore**. The set everyone loves, and back for one week only. This is an Encore Draft, not a Flashback, which means you'll keep the cards you draft!
* **February 24: *Ultimate Masters* Flashback**. One of the most underplayed yet incredibly fun Draft environments returns for a week.
* **March 3: *Vintage Cube***. We've got a three-week run of this classic experience from March 3 until March 24. March is a little unusual for this cube, but . . . well, we live in unusual times and the Showcase events on March 13 and 14 are worth celebrating. Life's too short not to have a little more *Vintage Cube*.
* **March 24: *Time Spiral Remastered* Supreme Draft**. *Time Spiral Remastered* comes out on March 19. Before everyone has mastered this remaster, let's draft some truly absurd decks.
* **March 31: A new Spotlight Cube**. As usual, we'll have more to share when we get closer.
* **April 7: Another new Spotlight Cube**. Again, details will come as the event approaches.

Spotlight Cube Series: *Live the Dream*
---------------------------------------


David McDarby, product manager for *MTG Arena*, brings us a second iteration of his *Live the Dream Cube* from MTGO's Spotlight Cube Series. Here, cards cost more mana, have more versatility, and are more . . . mythic. If you haven't yet, check out [David's article](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/magic-online/spotlight-cube-series-live-dream-cube-returns-2021-02-09), which covers all eleven archetypes from the cube and includes a full card list.


*Live the Dream* runs from tomorrow through February 17, and entry options are 10 Event Tickets or 100 Play Points. Both a League and a single-elimination queue will be provided—information on prizes can be [found here](https://magic.wizards.com/en/MTGO/content/magic-online-limited-events).

Triple Khans Flashback Ends Tomorrow
------------------------------------


Tarkir at its best: five clans of three colors, powerful creatures hidden face down as morphs, and infinite possibilities. The Triple Khans Flashback event ends tomorrow, so act fast!
