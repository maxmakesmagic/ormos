This past weekend, you might have seen the debut of our first *Aether Revolt* preview, Ajani Unyielding!

We're going to be previewing a few more cards throughout December, and we'll of course have a surprise for you on December 25, but today we've got a bundle of information for you, from the *Aether Revolt* packaging to all the promo cards to the Planeswalker Deck face cards, featuring another version of Ajani plus a certain nefarious head judge.


Let's start with some packaging.


Packaging
=========


We'll begin with the first packaging you'll likely come into contact with: the Prerelease Pack, still with a look similar to that of the *Kaladesh* packaging, but with way more angry Chandra.

That art is going to be seen in a lot of places, including on the *Aether Revolt* Bundle and the Booster Box.

Inside both the Bundle and the Booster Box (and the Prerelease Pack for that matter), you'll find three different designs for the booster packs, featuring our friend Ajani, Tezzeret, and a mysterious denizen of Kaladesh we'll certainly meet soon enough.

Finally, we'll also have Planeswalker Decks again, and they'll look a little something like this:

We'll share the decklists at a later date (after previews are finished), but let's take a closer look at those two face cards of the Planeswalker Decks. Reminder: while these cards are Standard legal, they're different from the Ajani and Tezzeret cards you'll be seeing in *Aether Revolt* booster packs.

Promo Cards
===========


That brings us to our Promo cards, none of which you've seen yet (well, none of which were supposed to have been seen yet)â€”so consider this one of the earliest looks at what's coming in *Aether Revolt*!


First up, the Buy-a-Box promo, which you can get if you buy a box at a [local game store](http://locator.wizards.com/) (supply limited, check with your store first).

Next, on Launch Weekend, play in an event and you could pick up one of these:

Finally, participate in a Game Day event, and you could get this fantastic Trophy Mage. Make the Top 8, and you'll get this intriguing Yahenni's Expertise.
