Spring All-Access Weeks with Super Qualifiers
---------------------------------------------


All-Access Weeks are back! From March 23 to April 6, the Mythic Event Token will be available in the *Magic Online* Store and will allow players to play with almost every card on *Magic Online*.


![](https://media.wizards.com/2022/images/daily/MTGO-Mythic_Generic.png)


To use the Mythic Event Token, simply purchase it in the *Magic Online* store and enter a game or event. No cards will be added to your collection, but you'll be able to play with a deck even if you don't have all the cards in your collection. In fact, you don't need any!


The token is $25.00 USD, and the access will last until 10 a.m. on April 6. We'll remove all the Mythic Event Tokens from accounts at that time.


And what better way to use that access than to play in some sweet Super Qualifiers? Every day from March 28 through April 1, there will be a Super Qualifier available to join and do battle in!


Each of the Super Qualifiers will have an entry option of two Mythic Event Tokens. That means that if you want to play in a Super Qualifier and have already purchased a Mythic Token to gain All Access, you can save on entry by picking up a second token instead of paying the normal entry option! And don't worry; spending your Mythic Event Tokens won't end your access early. (Note: Limited Super Qualifiers on March 25 and 29 also accept two Mythic Event Tokens as entry but do not grant All Access within the event)


Here's the schedule of Super Qualifiers during All Access:





| Date | Time | Event | Invitation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Monday, March 28 | 10:00 a.m. | Modern Super Qualifier | New Capenna Championship (*MTG Arena*) |
| Tuesday, March 29 | 3:00 p.m. | Pioneer Super Qualifier | New Capenna Championship (*MTG Arena*) |
| Wednesday, March 30 | Noon | NEO Limited Super Qualifier | New Capenna Championship (*MTG Arena*) |
| Thursday, March 31 | 7:00 a.m. | Legacy Super Qualifier | New Capenna Championship (*MTG Arena*) |
| Friday, April 1 | 7:00 a.m. | Modern Super Qualifier | New Capenna Championship (*MTG Arena*) |


Full Premier Play information can always be found on the [2022 *Magic Online* Premier Play Program Page](https://magic.wizards.com/en/mtgo/2022-magic-online-premier-play-program).


For those of you who have QPs saved up, you can enter Showcase Challenges and Showcase Last Chance Events as normal, but purchasing the Mythic Event Token will allow you to easily try out new formats!


All times above are Pacific (for UTC, add 7 hours).
