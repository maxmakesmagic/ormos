### Artist Information

**John Avon**

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/gpgot10/artist_avon.jpg)John Avon is an Illustrator living in the United Kingdom and has been working professionally since 1983. He has illustrated many hundreds of book covers for well-known authors in many areas from Science Fiction, Fantasy, Horror to History and Psychology. He has also worked on National Advertising Campaigns, CD covers, Game, Toy and TV Development.

**Magic: The Gathering** has been a key element in his career and since *Mirage*, his artwork has been featured in almost every expansion of the game. Primarily, John works on environments, some very strange settings and the odd bizarre creature! He loves working for **Magic** as it gives him the freedom to constantly re-invent exciting worlds and stretch imagination to the limit.

For over a decade all his work has been digital, and John is a keen fan of using technology to its fullest potential. This summer his work will appear in the UK’s “Advanced Photoshop Magazine.” However his original roots are in traditional oil painting. He's currently accepting commissions on canvas as he returns to a classical approach. His intention is to move into the gallery fine art world and is working on an extensive personal project involving his musical and spiritual interests.

### Other Hall Attractions

**Live Digital Painting Session by Aleksi Briclot**

Come to Grand Prix–Gothenburg and watch one of **Magic**'s biggest artists paint a ***Magic**  2012*  card live on his computer. 

We invited Aleksi to show you how a **Magic**  card is created. Join us in Gothenburg on Friday August 27 from 18.00 to 19.30 and from 20.30 to 22.00 to get an exclusive glimpse of this art show.

This is the art description of the card:   
**Color**: Red creature   
**Location**: Mountain area   
**Action**: Show a fiery phoenix that's been summoned by the fire mage planeswalker Chandra Nalaar. Perhaps the phoenix spreads its fire-wings, dominating the frame, but in the background we can see Chandra conjuring/summoning the creature as if she was throwing a blast of fire at the viewer. The whip-smart mage Chandra has her trademark goggles up on her forehead, and her hair is literally made of flame.   
**Focus**: The phoenix should be the main focus of the piece.   
**Mood**: A legendary bird that's as fiery as its master.

Don’t miss it!
