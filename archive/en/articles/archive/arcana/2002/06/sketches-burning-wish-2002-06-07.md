This week's Sketches looks at the *Judgment* rare [Burning Wish](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Burning+Wish), illustrated by Scott Fischer. Scott made the art for this piece a lot larger (dimensionally) than most artists do, but it was done with the clear intention of being cropped.

### 1. Art Description

Here is the art description given to the artist:  
  
"This is a red card and should show a djinn handing a barbarian a fireball with which he accepts with awe."

### 2. Sketch

Here is the sketch submitted by Scott. (The card was called "Barbarian's Wish" at the time. Scott has indicated where the card cropping would occur. His big deviation from the art description was making the barbarian a female; he put a message explaining his choice at the top of his sketch: "NOTE: I went with a female barbarian on this one because I thought the juxtaposition of the female form with the male Djinn added interest in the piece."

  
### 3. Final Art

Here is a large version of his final piece, pre-cropping.
