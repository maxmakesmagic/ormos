*Mirrodin* playtest cards III: Strictly better

Generally speaking, having a more powerful card means paying a higher cost, but sometimes you get more than you would normally pay for. When two different cards -- or two versions of the same card -- have different abilities for the same cost, the more powerful of the two is said to be *strictly better* (for example, compare [Grizzly Bears](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grizzly+Bears) and the strictly better [Wild Mongrel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Mongrel)).


This comes up during the design and development of **Magic** sets, too. While R&D is developing a new card, that card's abilities and costs can change radically, often for the better. In today's Magic Arcana, we take a look at some playtest versions of *Mirrodin* cards that didn't change cost in their final forms, but that R&D made strictly better for that same cost. Thanks, R&D!

Plated Slagwurm

| [Plated Slagwurm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plated+Slagwurm) survived playtesting as an 8/8 for , but in its final form is targetable by its controller -- a serious advantage. That means it can be [Predator's Strike](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Predator%27s+Strike)'d by you, but still not [Terror](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Terror)ed by your opponent.

Annul

| R&D toyed with the idea of printing an instant in *Mirrodin* that countered just artifact spells for , but instead just reprinted *Urza's Saga's* strictly better [Annul](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Annul).

Electrostatic Bolt
 |
| [Electrostatic Bolt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Electrostatic+Bolt) now packs quite a bit more punch for its  mana cost -- a change that is often crucial in Limited play, where it can now kill creatures from [Yotian Soldier](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Yotian+Soldier) to [Platinum Angel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Platinum+Angel).

Thirst for Knowledge
 |
| [Thirst for Knowledge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thirst+for+Knowledge), a staple of current Affinity decks, changed from Sorcery to Instant -- so now you can leave mana open and cast it during your opponent's end step, or whenever it suits you -- but it maintained its bargain price of . |
