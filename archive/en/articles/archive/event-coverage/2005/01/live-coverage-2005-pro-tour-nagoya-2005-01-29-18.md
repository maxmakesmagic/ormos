[Matsu-Tribe Decoy](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Matsu-Tribe+Decoy); the big creatures are overrated

I won a game where my opponent played [Nezumi Cutthroat](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nezumi+Cutthroat) on the second, third, AND fifth turn. I didn't have any way to deal with them; I just raced them.
