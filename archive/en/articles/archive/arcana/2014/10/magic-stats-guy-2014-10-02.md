Blake is the content manager for DailyMTG.com, making him the one you should email if you have thoughts on the website, good or less good (or not good). He's a longtime coverage reporter and hasn't turned down a game of Magic in any format ever. 






All this week (and occasionally in the run up to every Pro Tour) Paul Jordan (the *Magic* stats guy) puts on an entertaining—and incredibly informative—show on Twitter. His [@magicPJ](https://twitter.com/@magicPJ) handle tweets out facts about the Pro Tour, its competitors, the field of players, and any other number of things his stat-minded brain dares to spew out into the internet.


For example, in honor of Abzan Week and the clan's penchant for outlasting the competition, we got this beauty.

Of course, other pros, like Luis Scott-Vargas ([@lsv](https://twitter.com/@lsv)), tend to chime in on Paul's threads from time to time…as Luis did in response to the Tweet above.

And when I ever-so-politely asked Paul to Tweet about draws, he delivered almost immediately.




> 
> Darwin Kastle is 2 draws away from 100 PT/GP draws. [#ptktk](https://twitter.com/hashtag/ptktk?src=hash)

So if you like *Magic*, if you enjoy the Pro Tour, if you're a stat-head, or any combination of the above, you really should be following the [#mtgstatguy](https://twitter.com/hashtag/mtgstatguy?f=realtime) Paul Jordan for tidbits like these:




> 
> Shuhei has more GP byes (502) than 85% of the [#PTKTK](https://twitter.com/hashtag/PTKTK?src=hash) field has non-bye GP matches.

> 
> Median [#PTKTK](https://twitter.com/hashtag/PTKTK?src=hash) player: 28 years old, 3 PTs played, 14 GPs played, 18 career Pro Points.

Paul keeps his ear pretty close to the ground on all things *Magic*, so it was no surprise to see him pull out this nugget on [Community Cup](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/occ14) competitor Paul Cheon recently.




> 
> Top Constructed win % in PT/GP, min 200 matches, [#PTKTK](https://twitter.com/hashtag/PTKTK?src=hash) qualified players: Paul Cheon 151-71-14 68%

Part of what makes the Pro Tour special are the performances that lead to stats just like that one. Or ones that shed even more light from a different angle on a season we already knew was special.




> 
> 45 people Q&#39;d for [#ptktk](https://twitter.com/hashtag/ptktk?src=hash) twice. 9 did it 3 times. Nobody did it 4 times.&#10;&#10;…&#10;&#10; And [@HueyJensen](https://twitter.com/HueyJensen) did it 5 times.

And he does this for *every* Pro Tour, like clockwork, and with aplomb.
