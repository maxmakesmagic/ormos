**Age:** 21  
**Location:** New York, NY, USA  
**Occupation:**  Columbia Senior, Mathematics  
**Played Magic since:** Between Legends and The Dark  
**Best accomplishments:** 3rd 1999 Pro Tour New York, 4th 1999 U.S. Nationals, 10th 2000 World Championship, 10th Pro Tour London, 12th 2000 Pro Tour New York



**Q: What made you decide to come to Grand Prix Manchester?**  

A: The increased prize funds helped, but the Masters Series was the key; I'm on the bubble, so this trip was worth it if I got even one PT Point. That and Invasion's a ton of fun.



**Q: What were your expectations going into this tournament, and why?**  

A: I expected to make the second day due to my byes, and I figured it was Rochester so I had a good shot.



**Q: Briefly describe your tournament play-wise so far, both day one and day two.**  

A: Day one I had a really cool W/U/B control deck; it practically built itself. Day two I drafted a W/U deck in a first co-operative Rochester, and had to fight for a U/B one in the second one.



**Q: What do you think about the tournament location-/organisation-wise?**  

A: Location and organization were great.



**Q: What do you think is the main reason for you making top 8 in this tournament, and why?**  

A: Three byes and a good Sealed Deck helped, but I feel I'm here because of a very good first Rochester and outplaying my opponents.



**Q: What does this top 8 performance mean to you?**  

A: Hopefully that my top 16 curse is broken, but it's definitely at least three less PT Points I need for third Masters. Three down, nine to go.



**Q: What are your predictions for the Top 8?**  

A: We Americans will finish what we started - after it's done, we'll fly home. If I had to pick someone, I'd pick Darwin.
