The "favors" of ***Magic** 2012* ([Divine Favor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Divine+Favor) and [Dark Favor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dark+Favor)) have parallel abilities. Although they both boost power and toughness, one focuses on offense and one focuses on defense.

The art, of course, demonstrates this duality. [Divine Favor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Divine+Favor) shows a wizard with her palms held protectively inward, surrounded by magical shields.

[Dark Favor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dark+Favor), on the other hand, shows a wizard with fists held up, ready to fight. And what's he surrounded by? Magical knives!
