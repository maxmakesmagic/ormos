The Daily *Magic* Update is a roundup of everything *Magic* you should know on August 28, 2017. Today's Update is brought to you by all the *Ixalan* news. Also, a [B&R announcement](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/august-28-2017-banned-and-restricted-announcement-2017-08-28). Also, [*Ixalan* mechanics](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/feature/ixalan-mechanics). Also, my head exploded.


Today's Must
============


1. [Behind the Scenes with the Alleged *Ixalan* Card Theft](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/news/behind-scenes-alleged-ixalan-card-theft-2017-08-28) | DailyMTG | Scott Kelly and Blake Rasmussen

It's exceedingly rare that I'm going to highlight an article on our website, let alone one that I co-authored. So you know I'm serious. Yes, we also changed the [Vintage B&R](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/august-28-2017-banned-and-restricted-announcement-2017-08-28), but I'm fairly certain this article is going to be the one everyone is talking about. This and [the mechanics article](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/feature/ixalan-mechanics) that describes a bit more about the set we're about to get ourselves into.


What You Might Have Missed This Weekend
=======================================


1. [Grand Prix Indianapolis Top Moments](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/gpind17/grand-prix-indianapolis-top-moments-2017-08-27) | Wizards of the Coast | Marc Calderaro

Andrew Cuneo won with [Overwhelming Splendor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Overwhelming+Splendor) in his deck—what more do you need? How about the Memory side of [Commit // Memory](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Commit+%2F%2F+Memory) being cast with [The Locust God](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=The+Locust+God) in play? Or the rise of an old pro? The phrase "Is Owen Turtenwald"? All of that, and more, contained within.


And if that isn't enough to satiate you, how about checking out the full weekend on [our Twitch archive page](https://www.twitch.tv/magic/videos/all).


1. [Top Stories of Grand Prix Metz](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/gpmet17/top-stories-of-grand-prix-metz-2017-08-27) | Wizards of the Coast | Tobi Henke

Wild decks, Draft Master mastery, the heartbreak of another 2nd place, and a David versus Goliath finish all highlighted Grand Prix Metz.


1. [Brave the Unknown – *Ixalan* Geocache](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lEW4_Pa-RcM) | Windmill Slam

Okay, I think we're done with content from us. Some days you just have to revel in what you do, you know? But enough with that, check out this sweet geocaching video from the crew at Windmill Slam. It's gorgeously shot, chuckle-worthy, and it has the location of an *Ixalan* trackable waiting for you—all set to soothing music.

1. [The Hunt for Zigbeard's Booty!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzWwNbBPKkw) | Blair and Jess TV

How about the other end of things? [ZiggyD Gaming hid a trackable and did a fun video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=clyPA7LEubQ) about it. *Then*, the YouTube channel Blair and Jess TV made their own video going off on the hunt to find it.


1. [Geek of the Week: *Magic: The Gathering* head designer Mark Rosewater wouldn't trade his 22 years at dream job](https://www.geekwire.com/2017/mark-rosewater/) | Geek Wire | Kurt Schlosser

Geek of the Week looks at people in tech, science, games, and innovation, all from the Pacific Northwest. We have plenty of geeks up here, so getting one per week isn't particularly tough. But making the list in this crowded field certainly is—so congrats Mark.


After Those, Read, Watch, or Listen to These
============================================


1. [Top 10 Rotating Cards that Should Have Been Good](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-nZyZ6sUxA) | Strictly Better MTG | Dev

Hey, I also tried really hard to make [Splendid Reclamation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Splendid+Reclamation) good. What could have been . . .


<https://www.youtube.com/embed/H-nZyZ6sUxA>


1. [Video Daily Digest: Three Cheers for Trinketeers](http://www.starcitygames.com/article/35717_Daily-Digest-Three-Cheers-For-Trinketeers.html) | StarCityGames.com | Ross Merriam

Speaking of "could have been good," Ross Merriam takes [Master Trinketeer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Master+Trinketeer) for a spin as we head toward a new Standard. The Trinketeer doesn't rotate—maybe it's time could be coming?


What People Are Talking About
=============================


1. > 
> Card frame is absolutely gorgeous. This is like the antithesis of the Amonkhet masterpieces. [#MTGXLN](https://twitter.com/hashtag/MTGXLN?src=hash) [pic.twitter.com/mVubvJPhNC](https://t.co/mVubvJPhNC)

Um, thanks? I think. These aren't *Masterpieces*, just normal cards, but the card frame [definitely does its job](https://twitter.com/samstod/status/902170524264030209).


The [general consensus](https://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/6wjkgd/xln_treasure_map/) seems to be that these look great and have some pretty strong flavor associated with them. Which they do. There are more, and each of them is just as rich in flavor as this one.

That is, indeed, the point. I could write reams on this, but I'll let the article stand on its own. Mostly because [I already wrote reams in it](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/news/behind-scenes-alleged-ixalan-card-theft-2017-08-28). Instead, [check out the reactions from folks on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/6wjqsd/xln_behind_the_scenes_with_the_alleged_ixalan/), both to the cards (which, admittedly, anyone on Reddit already had ready access to) and to our change in philosophy on this one.


Deck of the Day
===============


1. [Standard Blue-Black Zombie Gift Primer](https://mtg.one/standard-ub-zombie-gift-primer/) | MTG.one | Nick Peternell

Why stop innovating? The basic shell of the [God-Pharaoh's Gift](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=God-Pharaoh%27s+Gift) strategy is really only six cards—the gift itself, plus 4 [Gate to the Afterlife](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gate+to+the+Afterlife). After that, you really just need a bunch of creatures that find their way to the graveyard with some regularity, and the ways to do so are many. Peternell decided to have his cake and eat brains too, mixing Zombies—which are really good at dying—with the [Gate to the Afterlife](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gate+to+the+Afterlife) engine. There are a ton of ways you can take that core, and this is certainly a good one for Zombie fans.


(Note: the thirteen-card sideboard is as the article was published.)
