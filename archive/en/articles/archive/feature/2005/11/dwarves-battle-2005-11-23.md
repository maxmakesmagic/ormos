Dwarves in **Magic** are known for [Dwarven Blastminer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Dwarven%2BBlastminer), [Dwarven Vigilantes](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Dwarven%2BVigilantes) and [Bloodfire Dwarf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Bloodfire%2BDwarf), and [Dwarven Recruiter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Dwarven%2BRecruiter). But they may be known best for their skills in war, including crafting armor and weapons to pump other creatures.


Dwarves, with the exception of [Dwarven Strike Force](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dwarven+Strike+Force) (and that famous Witch/Inquisitor, Soldier/Deserter, and Pirate/Ninja [Mistform Ultimus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mistform+Ultimus)) are generally small creatures, but their skill in weapon- and armorsmithing combined with their fierceness in battle makes them formidable opponents.




![Dwarven Weaponsmith](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Dwarven+Weaponsmith)

![Dwarven Armorer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Dwarven+Armorer)

These two are the earliest examples of Dwarven smithing. Not exactly the most powerful mechanics in the world -- would you trade a card in hand or an artifact in play for a teensy size increase to a creature? -- but perfectly in-flavor.




![Dwarven Lieutenant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Dwarven+Lieutenant)

Dwarves don't just enhance their compatriots with weaponry -- they also use tactics and inspiring war-speeches, as in [Dwarven Lieutenant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dwarven+Lieutenant).






![Dwarven Berserker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Dwarven+Berserker)

When it comes to skill with an axe, you gotta hand it to the Dwarves -- who'd want to get in this guy's way?






![Pardic Swordsmith](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Pardic+Swordsmith)

Here's a more recent example of Dwarven weaponsmithing, from *Odyssey*. Here, the pump effect is temporary, but then again, *"A finely crafted blade will never meet as many blows on the battlefield as it did on the anvil."* Again the effect is small, but you can activate [Pardic Swordsmith](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pardic+Swordsmith) multiple times for a 5/1 or 7/1 Dwarf.






![Dwarven Bloodboiler](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Dwarven+Bloodboiler)

Probably the most capable Dwarf ally you could have is [Dwarven Bloodboiler](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dwarven+Bloodboiler). Part of a cycle of three-colored-mana-cost creatures with "tap an untapped X" abilities in the *Odyssey* block (see also [Master Apothecary](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Master+Apothecary), [Patron Wizard](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Patron+Wizard), [Zombie Trailblazer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Zombie+Trailblazer) and [Seton, Krosan Protector](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seton%2C+Krosan+Protector)), the Bloodboiler inspires fury in his allies with his battle cry.




Interestingly, no Dwarves have been printed since the advent of the [equipment](http://gatherer.wizards.com/?first=1&last=100&term=equipment&Field_Type=on&setfilter=Allsets&colorfilter=All&typefilter=All&output=summary&sort=name&x=29&y=28) artifact type in *Mirrodin*. Will future Dwarves be as adept with equipment as the [Taj-Nar Swordsmith](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Taj-Nar%2BSwordsmith)? Only time will tell.
