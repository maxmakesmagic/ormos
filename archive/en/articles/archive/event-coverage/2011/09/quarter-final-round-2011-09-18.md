**Reinaldo da Silva vs. Guilherme Medeiros Merjan**


So here's how this here 'one of me, four matches' thing is going to work. First of all, it's only three matches, since Reinaldo da Silva, having got to 9-0 and paced the field all weekend, can't go to Worlds, and has conceded to Guilherme Medeiros Merjan, making him a very happy man. That leaves three matches to look at. Our good friend Paulo Vitor Damo da Rosa is keeping an eye on Miguel v Camargo and Abe v Sousa, leaving me to concentrate on the match between Jonathan Melamed and Marcus Pacheco. Oh, and don't forget that this is Nationals, so it's best three-out-of five.


Pacheco opened with [Drowned Catacomb](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Drowned+Catacomb)s, while Melamed was straight into action with [Halimar Depths](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Halimar+Depths). [Gitaxian Probe](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gitaxian+Probe) found [Jace Beleren](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace+Beleren), [Solemn Simulacrum](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Solemn+Simulacrum), [Into the Roil](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Into+the+Roil), [Black Sun's Zenith](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Black+Sun%27s+Zenith), [Tectonic Edge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tectonic+Edge), and [Go for the Throat](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Go+for+the+Throat) in Pacheco's hand. [Spell Pierce](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spell+Pierce) dealt with [Jace Beleren](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace+Beleren) the following turn.


*Already the first game was over in Luiz Miguel v Marcus Camargo. A turn three [Deceiver Exarch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deceiver+Exarch) followed up by turn four [Splinter Twin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Splinter+Twin) was enough for Miguel to take the opener.*


***Luiz Miguel 1 - 0 Marcus Camargo*** 


Melamed spent his fourth turn casting [Shrine of Piercing Vision](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shrine+of+Piercing+Vision), and didn't take long to crack it in search of more goodness for his [Splinter Twin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Splinter+Twin) combo. He added [Spellskite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spellskite) to the board, the only non-land between the two players. At end of turn he aimed for [Deceiver Exarch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deceiver+Exarch). [Go for the Throat](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Go+for+the+Throat) from Pacheco was met with [Dispel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dispel). Now Pacheco went for a second [Go for the Throat](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Go+for+the+Throat), and that resolved, killing the [Exarch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=+376301) threat.


Melamed cast [Sea Gate Oracle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sea+Gate+Oracle), now holding six cards in hand. Pacheco too had a grip full of cards. Next up was [Grim Lavamancer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grim+Lavamancer) from Melamed, which persuaded Pacheco to try [Black Sun's Zenith](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Black+Sun%27s+Zenith) to wipe the board. [Mana Leak](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak) was a teaser. Pacheco could pay, but then leave only two mana open. He elected to let his board sweeper hit the graveyard instead. Melamed cast [Splinter Twin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Splinter+Twin), not on an [Exarch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=+376301) as normally happens, but on [Sea Gate Oracle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sea+Gate+Oracle). That was a hideous engine to have to overcome, and virtually forced Pacheco to do something about it. [Into the Roil](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Into+the+Roil) was that something, which Melamed redirected to his [Spellskite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spellskite). [Mana Leak](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak) from Pacheco met [Spell Pierce](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spell+Pierce), and the [Splinter Twin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Splinter+Twin) resolved. Advantage Melamed. [Spellskite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spellskite) reappeared too.


Now Pacheco had [Doom Blade](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Doom+Blade), causing Melamed to get some value by casting [Into the Roil](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Into+the+Roil) with Kicker on his own [Sea Gate Oracle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sea+Gate+Oracle). He was still six cards to three up.


*Elsewhere, Igor Sousa had taken his opener against Allison Abe. Although Abe had played a cagey game, having used [Gitaxian Probe](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gitaxian+Probe) to see early on that Sousa had a lot of removal, in the end Sousa always had one more removal available than Abe could avoid, and Sousa led 1-0.*


***Igor Sousa 1 - 0 Allison Abe*** 




![Consume the Meek](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Consume%20the%20Meek&options=)


Back at Melamed v Pacheco, and Pacheco had landed his first [Grave Titan](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grave+Titan) of the match. Melamed cast [Sea Gate Oracle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sea+Gate+Oracle) once more, a second [Spellskite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spellskite), and a second [Grim Lavamancer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grim+Lavamancer). He didn't have an answer to [Grave Titan](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grave+Titan), however. Pacheco attacked Melamed down to five before casting [Solemn Simulacrum](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Solemn+Simulacrum). For Melamed, at least [Grim Lavamancer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grim+Lavamancer) was shooting down Zombies, but Melamed would need something more. [Splinter Twin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Splinter+Twin) attached itself to [Sea Gate Oracle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sea+Gate+Oracle), and it was back to the Titan Pacheco.


This time he had [Consume the Meek](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Consume+the+Meek). Melamed responded by activating his [Splinter Twin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Splinter+Twin) to see deeper into his deck, but there were no answers. The board was swept away, leaving [Grave Titan](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grave+Titan) to waltz in unopposed to claim the opener.


Jonathan Melamed 0 - 1 Marcus Pacheco


*In Miguel v Camargo, Luiz Miguel had gone for his [Splinter Twin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Splinter+Twin) combo on turn four, but Marcus Camargo was ready with [Nature's Claim](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nature%27s+Claim). Camargo followed up with [Linvala, Keeper of Silence](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Linvala%2C+Keeper+of+Silence), which stops the combo, and Miguel couldn't find a way back. All square once more.*


***Luiz Miguel 1 - 1 Marcus Camargo*** 


Melamed opened game two with [Gitaxian Probe](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gitaxian+Probe). Pacheco didn't want him to see, so cast [Mental Misstep](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mental+Misstep). Melamed really wanted to look, so cast [Mental Misstep](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mental+Misstep) too! He found [Inquisition of Kozilek](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inquisition+of+Kozilek), [Spellskite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spellskite), and four land. When Pacheco cast the [Inquisition of Kozilek](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inquisition+of+Kozilek), he found [Spell Pierce](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spell+Pierce) in the way, so couldn't get the same level of information that Melamed had. Pacheco cast [Spellskite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spellskite), leaving the way clear for Melamed to begin the Planeswalker battle with [Jace Beleren](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace+Beleren), who promptly drew Melamed a card.


[Despise](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Despise) finally got Pacheco a look at Melamed's hand: [Ponder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ponder), [Mana Leak](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak), [Dispel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dispel), and [Misty Rainforest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Misty+Rainforest). Little changed over the next few turns, with [Spellskite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spellskite) for Pacheco and [Grim Lavamancer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grim+Lavamancer) for Melamed, who was nevertheless advantaged by the status quo thanks to his [Jace Beleren](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace+Beleren), which he had restocked to 3 loyalty. Pacheco tried for a Jace of his own, but [Mana Leak](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak) resolved. At end of turn, Melamed went for [Deceiver Exarch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deceiver+Exarch). Was the Jace a mana-sapping fatal mistake from Pacheco?


He was down to three mana, and let the [Exarch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=+376301) resolve. Melamed untapped. He drew an extra card with [Jace Beleren](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace+Beleren). Then he attacked with his [Exarch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=+376301) and [Grim Lavamancer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grim+Lavamancer). Pacheco fell to 16, and then Melamed passed the turn. [Jace Beleren](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace+Beleren) continued to draw him extra cards, pulling further ahead of Pacheco. Even so, the presence of [Spellskite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spellskite) on the board was stopping Melamed from pulling the trigger on his [Splinter Twin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Splinter+Twin).


Pacheco cast [Inquisition of Kozilek](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inquisition+of+Kozilek), and again the [Mana Leak](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak) trap was set. If Pacheco paid, he would be back down to two mana. He declined to pay, laid a [Creeping Tar Pit](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Creeping+Tar+Pit), and passed back to Melamed. [Sea Gate Oracle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sea+Gate+Oracle) resolved, as Melamed hit the ten mana mark. Jace drew him another card, and the same dance occurred again, [Spellskite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spellskite) blocking [Deceiver Exarch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deceiver+Exarch), and Pacheco taking one from [Grim Lavamancer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grim+Lavamancer).


*On the back table, Igor Sousa took a 2-0 lead when he cast [Memoricide](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Memoricide) on Allison Abe, removing all the [Deceiver Exarch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deceiver+Exarch)s from the deck.* 


***Igor Sousa 2 - 0 Allison Abe*** 


*Meanwhile Luiz Miguel was able to find his [Splinter Twin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Splinter+Twin) combo to take a 2-1 lead over Marcus Camargo.*


***Luiz Miguel 2 - 1 Marcus Camargo*** 


Pacheco once again wanted [Inquisition of Kozilek](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inquisition+of+Kozilek) to resolve, and this time it did, Pacheco taking [Dispel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dispel) and finding all four copies of [Splinter Twin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Splinter+Twin) in Melamed's hand. With [Spellskite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spellskite)[Shatter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shatter)ed by Melamed, he was in great shape. He cast [Splinter Twin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Splinter+Twin) on his [Sea Gate Oracle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sea+Gate+Oracle), rather than his [Exarch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=+376301), ready to bait Pacheco into a counterspell war. Pacheco responded with [Doom Blade](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Doom+Blade), and the [Sea Gate Oracle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sea+Gate+Oracle) was no more. Now Pacheco had three cards. Melamed couldn't cast [Splinter Twin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Splinter+Twin) and pay for a [Mana Leak](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak). If Pacheco didn't have [Mana Leak](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak), or a way to kill the [Exarch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=+376301) in response, the win was sitting there right before Melamed's eyes.




![Splinter Twin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Splinter%20Twin&options=)


Intriguingly, Melamed reset Jace to three loyalty, getting both players a card, allowing Pacheco one extra card to have an answer. He cast [Shrine of Piercing Vision](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shrine+of+Piercing+Vision), and passed, having avoided putting the possible win to the test. [Deceiver Exarch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deceiver+Exarch) turned sideways for one damage, putting Pacheco to 14, and Melamed was done.


Finally Pacheco had a way to deal with Jace, casting one of his own. Melamed, now free of the constraints of a [Spellskite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spellskite) across the table, used [Grim Lavamancer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grim+Lavamancer) to drop Pacheco to 12 at end of turn. This time he went for the [Splinter Twin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Splinter+Twin) onto [Exarch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=+376301) combo. Pacheco had [Deprive](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deprive) to stop the combo. The [Exarch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=+376301) attacked, and Pacheco was at 11. That said, Melamed was down to 12 himself...


Pacheco cast [Grave Titan](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grave+Titan), Melamed responding with two damage to the face, Pacheco at 9. Then he cast [Deceiver Exarch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deceiver+Exarch), tapping down a possibly-critical mana. [Splinter Twin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Splinter+Twin) for [Exarch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=+376301) met [Mana Leak](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak), but the final [Splinter Twin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Splinter+Twin) on the second [Exarch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=+376301) resolved, and we were heading for game three all tied up. With just over an hour gone, it was down to a best of three.


Melamed 1 - 1 Pacheco


*Igor Sousa meanwhile had booked his place for San Francisco, defeating Allison Abe by a convincing 3-0. Abe had tried to get his combo together in game three, but once again found a combination of [Doom Blade](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Doom+Blade), [Flashfreeze](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flashfreeze), and other inconvenient spells ready to stop him in his tracks. Sousa advanced to the semi finals.*


***Igor Sousa 3 - 0 Allison Abe*** 


In the early going in game three, there was all the usual fencing, before Pacheco cast a turn four [Inquisition of Kozilek](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inquisition+of+Kozilek), taking out a [Deceiver Exarch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deceiver+Exarch). Melamed went for another in response to another [Inquisition of Kozilek](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inquisition+of+Kozilek), starting a [Mana Leak](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak) war, which he ultimately lost when Pacheco paid. [Shatter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shatter), [Spell Pierce](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spell+Pierce), and [Mana Leak](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak) were left in Melamed's hand, while Pacheco had [Jace Beleren](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace+Beleren), and [Liliana Vess](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Liliana+Vess), something Melamed discovered with [Gitaxian Probe](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gitaxian+Probe).




![Creeping Tar Pit](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Creeping%20Tar%20Pit&options=)


Pacheco was attacking each turn with [Creeping Tar Pit](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Creeping+Tar+Pit), and had Melamed down to 10. He cast [Spellskite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spellskite), then attacked with his [Creeping Tar Pit](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Creeping+Tar+Pit). [Twisted Image](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Twisted+Image) from Melamed turned [Spellskite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spellskite) into a 4/0, killing it, but still took three from the Tar Pit, falling to 7. Pacheco cast [Jace Beleren](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace+Beleren), and here we were again, Melamed casting [Mana Leak](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak) which successfully countered the Planeswalker.


At end of turn Melamed cast [Deceiver Exarch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deceiver+Exarch). He untapped, but needed help from the top of his deck. No [Splinter Twin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Splinter+Twin). Pacheco activated both his [Creeping Tar Pit](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Creeping+Tar+Pit)s, and led by 2-1.


Melamed 1 - 2 Pacheco


*In the other remaining match, Miguel found his combo far too late, and Camargo was able to nibble away at his life total, eventually edging it to send them into a deciding game five, something Melamed would very much like to do here.*


***Miguel 2 - 2 Camargo*** 


Melamed had early counterspels in game four, [Spell Pierce](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spell+Pierce) for [Inquisition of Kozilek](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inquisition+of+Kozilek), and [Mana Leak](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak) for [Jace Beleren](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace+Beleren). [Gitaxian Probe](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gitaxian+Probe) from Melamed met [Mental Misstep](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mental+Misstep), before [Ponder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ponder) resolved. It was all very cagey stuff, as Malemed cast [Deceiver Exarch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deceiver+Exarch) and untapped a land. [Memoricide](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Memoricide) form Pacheco met [Spell Pierce](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spell+Pierce), Melamed bouncing [Spellskite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spellskite) with [Into the Roil](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Into+the+Roil) before Pacheco replayed it.




![Jace Beleren](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Jace%20Beleren&options=)


Down came [Jace Beleren](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace+Beleren), drawing Pacheco an extra card. Melamed took [Shatter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shatter) off [Preordain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Preordain), giving him a route to killing the [Spellskite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spellskite). He wasted no time in aiming the red instant at [Spellskite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spellskite), which duly bit the dust. Still Pacheco had [Jace Beleren](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace+Beleren), ticking down to one loyalty as he presented Pacheco with another bonus card. [Doom Blade](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Doom+Blade) took out [Deceiver Exarch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deceiver+Exarch), and Melamed was faced with a ton of trouble.


He topdecked [Jace Beleren](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace+Beleren) to at least stop the drawing engine, but Pacheco was into [Creeping Tar Pit](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Creeping+Tar+Pit) territory, and couldn't be stopped. Almost two hours, and Pacheco had triumphed, taking the match by 3-1, and guaranteeing himself a slot for Worlds.


Jonathan Melamed 1 - 3 Marcus Pacheco


*By this time, Luiz Miguel and Marcus Camargo were deep into their game five. Miguel was very tentative, deciding to wait until he had [Dispel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dispel) to protect it, but Camargo had [Birthing Pod](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Birthing+Pod), and started fetching [Spellskite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spellskite), then [Linvala, Keeper of Silence](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Linvala%2C+Keeper+of+Silence). The window had passed for Miguel, and it was Camargo who had made it to the semi finals, with a place at San Francisco for Worlds.* 


***Luiz Miguel 2 - 3 Marcus Camargo***
