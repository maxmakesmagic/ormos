Live Coverage of 2003 Junior Super Series
=========================================












Mitch Towner is the 2003 JSS Champion! Handling his green-white-red [Astral Slide](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Astral+Slide) deck like a pro, he cruised through the Top 8 without dropping a single game! After taking apart Grady Hunt's Beasts deck in the quarters, he survived the mirror against Kyle Goodman. In the finals he faced Sam Stein, whose Red-Green Beats deck had served him well. He edged out both Richard Oleksak's [Psychatog](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psychatog) deck and Peter Matson's blue-green, taking both matches to three games.


The finals were a lopsided affair. Slide seems tailor-made to demolish red-green. Towner, significantly taller than most of his competition, accepted the handshake graciously. Mostly interested in athletics, Towner isn't yet sure how he'll spend his newfound scholarship. Luckily he has plenty of time to decide. Congratulations to Mitch Towner, 2003 JSS Champion!
