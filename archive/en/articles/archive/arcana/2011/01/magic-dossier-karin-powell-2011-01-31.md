**Favorite part of your job:** All the shiny foily goodness and the darkly humored people.

**Least favorite part of your job:** Shiny foily goodness costs money and darkly humored people require a lot of attention.

**Other games you currently enjoy playing:** XBox Kinect, Wii, Leapster Explorer, any classic card game aka Gin Rummy, Hearts, Solitaire, Poker, Spades (who doesn't like classic card games?), Yahtzee (I could play that game all night, so many dice to roll!)

**Favorite Magic card(s):** Any Dragon card, [Shivan Dragon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Shivan%2BDragon), [Niv-Mizzet, the Firemind](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Niv-Mizzet%252C%2Bthe%2BFiremind), [Hellkite Overlord](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Hellkite%2BOverlord), [Broodmate Dragon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Broodmate%2BDragon) ...

But my most favorite just for sentimental reasons really goes to [Squee, Goblin Nabob](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Squee%252C%2BGoblin%2BNabob), I am afraid. I know. Cringe.

**In your spare time:** Traveling, painting, cycling, reading, playing with my kids, cooking and eating (I am a total total total foodie).

**Something the readers don't know about you:** I am Swiss citizen, from the birthplace of graphic design, the best pocket knife ever, and the Helvetica typeface ... AND I'm a US Citizen as well, from the birthplace of ... well, you fill in the blank there ....
