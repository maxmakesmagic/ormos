We asked a few of those teams competing on day three to explain some of their otherwise random-sounding team names. Here's what they had to say:


**DM Fan Club** - "Broken Jens and I were supposed to play with our friend Daniel Mukka, but he had a really frustrating GP London and decided he didn't want to come to New York. Fortunately for us, Johan Sadeghpour's team was unable to make the trip, so we picked him up. The DM in our team name is in memory of our departed teammate." - Tomi Walamies


**Phoenix Foundation** - "It's from McGyver. We were going to call ourselves the Forgotten Stuntmen, but someone took the name first." -Kai Budde


**Lyskavermaden-**"I was a German translator for a couple of sets and there was no way to translate 'Mind Maggots'. Maden is the German slang term meaning 'scrub', while the rest is just an anagram of my name, so the translation isn't Mind Maggots, but Valkyser's Scrubs" -Stephan Valkyser


**Monkey Dog** - "Kesselman and I were in Cannes and went to this bar called MoDo's. The place had a freaky circus motif and weird wallpaper and the mastot was this half monkey, half dog thing. We loved MoDo's, so it seemed appropriate." -Brian David-Marshall.


**Car Acrobatic Team** - "I wanted to find some obscure pop culture reference with the word 'team' in it, and this was the best one I could find. It's one of the teams in Speed Racer" -Aaron Forsythe


**Ancient Kavus** - "It was either that or the Century Club. Matt Vienneau is our youngest member, and he's 29." -Gary Krakower.
