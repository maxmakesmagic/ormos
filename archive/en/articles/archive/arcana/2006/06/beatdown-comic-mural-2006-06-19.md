The [*Beatdown Gift Box*](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=magic/expansion/beatdown) featured two prebuilt decks, one in green and red centered around [Ehrnam Djinn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ehrnam+Djinn), and the other decked out in black and blue with [Sengir Vampire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sengir+Vampire) at the helm.

For that product, Greg had the assignment of illustrating these two iconic beasties battling it out. He painted a full mural-style “comic” of the entire fight. Ready to scroll?
