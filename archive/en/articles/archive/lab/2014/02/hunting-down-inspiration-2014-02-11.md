 Mike Cannon started writing From the Lab at the end of 2012 after two years with GatheringMagic. He is an ardent casual player and loves finding uses for bad cards. 






As a writer, I'm often asked where I get my ideas. After all, this column alone has me coming up with two new decks every week. I must have some secret, right? Some magic formula that makes ideas pop out of thin air?


There's a common misconception that inspiration simply comes to you. In my experience, this is rarely the case. Ideas aren't simply going to run up to you and hop in a cardboard box so you can take them home. Most of the time you have to hunt them down.


Hunting down inspiration isn't always easy. Ideas have great camouflage in their natural environment, and it doesn't help that your mental jungle is populated by hundreds of creatures that simply aren't what you're looking for.


Many people try to find inspiration by sitting in one place, waiting for something to jump out at them. While this might work eventually, there are far more efficient ways of hunting your prey. One method I'm rather fond of is finding breeding grounds for new ideas. These areas are loaded with the mental food necessary for an idea to grow, and digging around will almost always yield results.

[Inspiration](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inspiration) | Art by [Izzy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&artist=[%22Izzy%22])


For **Magic**, one such breeding ground is [Gatherer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Default.aspx). In this giant database of cards, there are thousands of ideas waiting to be found. You can start looking in a specific area, like cards that can be cast for zero mana, or creatures that can untap themselves. You can even hit the random button a few times to see some options you might never have considered.


Of course, the great thing about **Magic** is that new sets are released every few months, bringing with them a plethora of new ideas to work with. Oftentimes a great way to find inspiration is to simply examine some of the new cards and figure out what you can do with them. This is my number one source of inspiration, and is responsible for a large percentage of the decks I create.


New things aren't the only place to find ideas. In fact, ground you've already covered can still yield inspiration years later. Just as **Magic** is always changing, your brain is undergoing constant change as well, and concepts that you've used before can morph into brand-new ideas with a bit of stimulus. You might be looking at a card from a different angle, or there might be some new card that changes everything.


The Repercussions of Dancing
============================


The first deck I'll be looking at today is a combination of a new card and an old idea. The first thing I thought when I saw [Satyr Firedancer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Satyr+Firedancer) was that it's essentially a reverse [Repercussion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Repercussion). Okay, the first thing I thought was that it looked really cool and I wanted it, but that was the second thing.


As it happens, the two cards work together pretty nicely as well. Hit your opponent with a [Lightning Bolt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt), and [Satyr Firedancer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Satyr+Firedancer) will deal 3 damage to a creature. Then [Repercussion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Repercussion) will deal 3 more damage to your opponent.


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Satyr+Firedancer)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Satyr+Firedancer)[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Repercussion)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Repercussion)
This kind of chain is all well and good, but we can definitely ramp it up further than that. When *Avacyn Restored* was released, I immediately created a Commander deck with [Gisela, Blade of Goldnight](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gisela%2C+Blade+of+Goldnight). The deck used cards like [Earthquake](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Earthquake) to deal damage to everything, taking advantage of the fact that you and your permanents take half damage while your opponents take double.


[Repercussion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Repercussion) was an immediate game-ender in this deck due to how it works with [Gisela](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gisela)'s ability. If you cast [Earthquake](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Earthquake) for 2, each of your opponents' creatures will take 4 damage thanks to [Gisela](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gisela)'s doubling. Then [Repercussion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Repercussion) will deal 4 damage to your opponents for each creature they control, which will be doubled again to 8.


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Gisela%2C+Blade+of+Goldnight)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gisela%2C+Blade+of+Goldnight)
With [Satyr Firedancer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Satyr+Firedancer) things get even more ridiculous. If you hit your opponent with a [Boros Charm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Boros+Charm), he or she will take 8 damage. Then the Satyr will deal 16 damage to a creature, and [Repercussion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Repercussion) will deal another 32 damage to your opponent.


Since [Gisela](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gisela) costs a lot of mana, I'll also include [Furnace of Rath](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Furnace+of+Rath) as a cheaper option. Although it does make things dangerous for you, you can usually wait to cast it until you're about to win.


*Born of the Gods* also gives us another card perfect for this deck. With [Plea for Guidance](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plea+for+Guidance), you can search for both [Repercussion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Repercussion) and [Furnace of Rath](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Furnace+of+Rath), setting up your combo. You can even search for [Satyr Firedancer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Satyr+Firedancer), since it's an enchantment creature.


[Incinerate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Incinerate) gives you another cheap way to burn your opponent, while [Fireblast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fireblast) doesn't require any mana if you're willing to sacrifice a pair of Mountains. That's certainly not too much to ask when you're about it hit your opponent for 40.


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Plea+for+Guidance)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plea+for+Guidance)[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Incinerate)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Incinerate)
I've also added in two copies of [Blasphemous Act](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blasphemous+Act). They can help you control early onslaughts from creature decks, and can be used to deal an absurd amount of damage with [Repercussion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Repercussion), provided your opponent has a few creatures. Speaking of which, [Forbidden Orchard](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forbidden+Orchard) will give you something to deal damage to in case your opponent is playing a creatureless deck.
