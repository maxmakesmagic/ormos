Raffaele Lo Moro vs. Adam Urban
-------------------------------


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gpzur04/fm6_1.jpg)Lo Moro is an Italian legend. He had a Worlds Top 8 in the last millenium and then took forever to score another big time Top 8. Accross the table... a Polish player called Adam Urban. The name sounds oddly familiar, doesn't it? From a few American events coverages perhaps? Since he's studying in Warsaw and doing the Grand Prix circuit in Europe, you might come accross the name a few more times.


### Game 1


Adam sent his first hand back but came out strong with [Shattered Dreams](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shattered+Dreams) nabbing [Chrome Mox](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chrome+Mox) and seeing a future full of Green creatures. Lo Moro played [Blinkmoth Nexus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blinkmoth+Nexus) and starting pinging his opponent.


He took a break to walk Troll Astetic into [Condescend](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Condescend) and played a second Nexus as his fourth land. [Eternal Witness](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eternal+Witness) gave him the Troll back. Meanwhile Urban was busy using [Darksteel Pendant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Darksteel+Pendant) to have some control over his draws.


The second time around Troll Astetic stuck. The Polish took the time to play [Thirst for Knowledge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thirst+for+Knowledge) and [Serum Visions](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Serum+Visions). Still, he gave the turn back to the Italian with no play other than [Darksteel Ingot](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Darksteel+Ingot).


The Green team struck again and Raffaelle tried to up the ante with [Fangren Firstborn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fangren+Firstborn). [Condescend](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Condescend) put an end to his "Timmy" dreams.


Working his life points like a marathon runner Adam Urban played [Solemn Simulacrum](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Solemn+Simulacrum), the ever-present Jens Thoren, and [March of the Machines](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=March+of+the+Machines).His Ingot was now a fierce 3/3 that could block anyone and survive to tell all about it.


Desconstruct took out Thoren and [Creeping Mold](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Creeping+Mold) ate up [March of the Machines](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=March+of+the+Machines). The Italian was back in control... or not. Urban dropped another [March of the Machines](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=March+of+the+Machines).


Again, the Polish sat behind the Ingot. Lo Moro showed him another [Eternal Witness](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eternal+Witness). Back came [Creeping Mold](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Creeping+Mold) a [Blinkmoth Nexus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blinkmoth+Nexus) brought Urban down to six.


Lo Moro thought about it... and used the Mold. Adam's last card in hand was [Condescend](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Condescend). The three Nexus on the table dropped Adam Urban to five. Despite having the ground somewhat clogged up with [Darksteel Ingot](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Darksteel+Ingot) he had to find a way to stop the flying armada.


Lo Moro sent one Nexus, two Witness and Troll Astetic into the Red Zone. Adam Urban thought about it... and scooped.


Raffaele 1-0 Adam.


Raffaele: "I just like to shuffle. I love shuffling."


### Game 2


Adam: "he likes to shuffle and he does it SO well."



![Viridian Zealot](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Viridian+Zealot)

That a mulligan announcement in case you were wondering. He kept his second hand ahd came out with a vengeance, stopping [Viridian Zealot](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Viridian+Zealot) and Troll Astetic on turn two and three.


On the fourth he played [Solemn Simulacrum](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Solemn+Simulacrum), giving Raffaele the go ahead to cast something big on turn four. The Italian obliged with Frangren Firstborn. [Viridian Shaman](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Viridian+Shaman) took Thoren out of the way and the Firstborn started stomping around the table.


Urban used [Thirst for Knowledge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thirst+for+Knowledge) to find an answer. And he did: [Barter in Blood](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Barter+in+Blood) to clean the table. Lo Moro sighed noisily. Still, he couldn't really complain. His next play was [Eternal Witness](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eternal+Witness) "regrowing" [Viridian Zealot](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Viridian+Zealot), after much deliberation.


The Zealot joined the team but it didn't last long. Adam Urban fired [Death Cloud](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Death+Cloud) for five. cleaning Lo Moro's hand and table. The Italian drew a land.


Adam: "Lucky! Com'on March!"


He didn't draw [March of the Machines](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=March+of+the+Machines) but he did draw [Solemn Simulacrum](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Solemn+Simulacrum). Lo Moro struck back with [Blinkmoth Nexus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blinkmoth+Nexus) with three creatures stuck in his hand. Then he drew his third land... another Nexus. Although it did help it sure didn't help him play Troll Astetic or [Eternal Witness](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eternal+Witness).


Finally he found a castable spell: [Tel-Jilad Chosen](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tel-Jilad+Chosen). But Urban shook his finger. [Condescend](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Condescend) stopped that nonsense. Another Thoren came into play before Raffaele found his second [Forest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest).


He used it to play [Karstoderm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Karstoderm). Urban frowned. Lo Moro tried to even the score with Nexus but Urban had [Echoing Decay](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Echoing+Decay). A swing and a [Barter in Blood](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Barter+in+Blood) later the table was clean again and Adam Urban was hitting his deck demaning [March of the Machines](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=March+of+the+Machines).


He didn't get it but he did get [Death Cloud](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Death+Cloud). With Lo Moro at three it was more than enough.


Raffaele 1-1 Adam.


### Game 3


Lo Moro played a first turn [Chrome Mox](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chrome+Mox) to power out [Viridian Zealot](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Viridian+Zealot).


Adam: "I'm already behind."


The Zealot started swinging but when Lo Moro tried a turn three Firstborn Urban shook his head (a.k.a. [Condescend](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Condescend)). The Italian took his own sweet time to think about his fourth turn and eventaully settled on playing [Tel-Jilad Chosen](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tel-Jilad+Chosen) and attacking with Zealot and Nexus.


Unzafed, the Polish used Thirst of Knowledge to set up his [Barter in Blood](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Barter+in+Blood). Lo Moro was back square one, well almost. He sacrificed the Nexus to keep the Chosen and played Troll Astetic while Urban dropped Thoren.


[Viridian Shaman](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Viridian+Shaman) took out the Simulacrum and Adarm Urban fell to a mere six with nothing but lands on the table. He dropped another [Solemn Simulacrum](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Solemn+Simulacrum).


Adam: "Not another Shaman!"


Lo Moro put on his poker face and sent the crew in. [Echoing Decay](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Echoing+Decay) ate the Chosen and Thoren chumped Troll Astetic. Adam dropped [Darksteel Ingot](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Darksteel+Ingot), [Solemn Simulacrum](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Solemn+Simulacrum) and winced when Lo Moro unleashed his wrath on his deck.


Adam: "Ouch."  

Raffaele: "I need one card. Just one card."


He didn't get it. His Shaman died and Thoren took one for the team. Finally the Polish found [Death Cloud](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Death+Cloud). He played it for one, getting Lo Moro's lone Troll and his card in hand.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gpzur04/fm6_2.jpg)Afterwards he dropped [March of the Machines](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=March+of+the+Machines) and attacked with the Ingot. One turn too late, Lo Moro found [Creeping Mold](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Creeping+Mold). Adam smiled and buried his March before played [Thirst for Knowledge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thirst+for+Knowledge) with seven minutes on the clock.


Lo Moro topdecked [Karstoderm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Karstoderm) but Adam had just found [Condescend](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Condescend). That gave him [March of the Machines](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=March+of+the+Machines). With two Ingots he had a pretty decent clock. Two land draws later for the Italian the round was over.


Final Result:  

Adam 2-1 Raffaele.
