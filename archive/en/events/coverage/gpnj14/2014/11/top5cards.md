There are so many interesting cards and compelling choices for Legacy choosing just five from this weekend felt impossible. What set these five apart, however, were the stories they created for the players that picked them. Some were known quantities that led to contentious discussions. Others were off the radar but reinforced how the format really works.


These were the Top 5 cards of Grand Prix New Jersey.

 Coming into this weekend, the whole Legacy community was abuzz over the power of [Treasure Cruise](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treasure+Cruise). Many expected the card and the strategies it's a part of to be targeted this weekend. Nevertheless, the power of drawing three cards for a single mana made [Treasure Cruise](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treasure+Cruise) an integral part of, eventual winner, Brian Braun-Duin's strategy.
