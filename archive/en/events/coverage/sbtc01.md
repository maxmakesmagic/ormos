2001 Sideboard Team Challenge Coverage
======================================












2001 Sideboard Team Challenge Coverage
--------------------------------------


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/SBTClogo.gif)After smashing their way to the finals, Team TOGIT (The Only Game In Town) finally met their match in Team Egghead Games. It was a tight final series, with TOGIT winning the Extended and Invasion Sealed portions, and the Eggheads ruling IBC and, surprisingly, Type 1. In the end, it was the forgotten format of Masques Sealed that determined the victors, and John Kenny who dealt the killing blow. Congratulations to Team Egghead Games, 2001 Sideboard Team Champions!
