Jacob Van Lunen began playing Magic in 1995. He has participated in organized play at every level of competition and was a member of the winning team at Pro Tour San Diego in 2007, thanks to an innovative draft strategy. As a writer, Van Lunen has had more than three hundred Magic strategy pieces published 







I wrote about an exciting new combo deck built around [Pyromancer Ascension](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyromancer+Ascension)[last week](/en/articles/archive/building-budget/pyromancer-ascension-2010-07-21). I knew the deck was very powerful and I played a version of it at a 296-player Pro Tour Qualifier in Edison, New Jersey. I made a few play errors in round one and lost to a Mono-Red player. I rallied and won my next seven matches in a row. I drew into Top 8 and won my quarter and semi-final matches without dropping a game. I made some play mistakes in the finals and my opponent played exceptionally well. I was a bit upset with myself over the play mistakes, but it was exciting to do so well with a deck that was originally designed for my column.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/boab/boab101_caress.jpg)This week I'd like to discuss another new archetype that has become possible with the release of the new core set. [Liliana's Caress](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Liliana%27s+Caress) is the latest version of [Megrim](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Megrim). [Megrim](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Megrim) has always been a favorite amongst casual players. Both the 2010 and 2011 core sets are legal until fall; this means we can play a deck with eight copies of this type of effect. Cards like [Burning Inquiry](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Burning+Inquiry) suddenly become very powerful when you get to play with eight [Megrim](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Megrim)s.

Liliana's Caress

Dark Tutelage
 |

Another new card from ***Magic** 2011* that hasn't seemed to get the attention it deserves is [Dark Tutelage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dark+Tutelage). I can assure you that control decks are very much alive. A spell with this type of effect seems like it creates a lot of unwinnable positions for your control opponents. Against players with more aggressive curves you can simply sideboard them out for [Burst Lightning](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Burst+Lightning). I prefer packing [Dark Tutelage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dark+Tutelage) in the main and the [Burst Lightning](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Burst+Lightning)s in the board, but if your area seems to be flush with aggressive decks I don't think there's much of a downside to playing the [Burst Lightning](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Burst+Lightning)s in that slot.


[Burning Inquiry](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Burning+Inquiry) seems like the most powerful effect available in a deck like this. With two active enchantments a single [Burning Inquiry](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Burning+Inquiry) deals 12 damage to our opponent. With three enchantments, [Burning Inquiry](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Burning+Inquiry) fires off an 18 point blast directly at our opponent's life total. [Burning Inquiry](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Burning+Inquiry) isn't just a damage spell, though. A lot of opponents use their early turns to mold their hand into a winning combination by way of [Jace, the Mind Sculptor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace%2C+the+Mind+Sculptor). [Burning Inquiry](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Burning+Inquiry) randomly nabs three cards from your opponent's hand. Their hand probably won't look the same after you cast the one-mana sorcery.

Blightning
 |

[Blightning](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blightning) is an obvious inclusion here. [Blightning](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blightning) is one of the most powerful cards available in today's Standard and I would be crazy not to run a full playset in a dedicated discard deck. A lot of people seem to be scared of [Obstinate Baloth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Obstinate+Baloth), and with good reason. The new core set's [Loxodon Hierarch](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Loxodon+Hierarch) is especially dangerous when you're packing cards like [Blightning](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blightning) and [Mind Rot](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mind+Rot). Luckily for us, the new White-Blue Control decks seem to trounce green decks with enough consistency that you probably won't have to fight against [Obstinate Baloth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Obstinate+Baloth)s too often. If you do run into an opponent with [Obstinate Baloth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Obstinate+Baloth) it isn't the end of the world. You can always use a spot removal spell.


[Mind Rot](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mind+Rot) is essentially [Blightning](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blightning) five through eight. We want to play enough discard to make our [Liliana's Caress](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Liliana%27s+Caress) and [Megrim](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Megrim) worth the slots.


[Sign in Blood](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sign+in+Blood) is one of the most underplayed cards available in today's Standard. Last time I checked, the ability to draw two cards for two mana was absolutely ridiculous. This type of effect is especially powerful when your spells have such a high variance of actual value depending on your enchantment situation.


[Lightning Bolt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt) is obvious. There isn't anything quite as good. I've been shoving this in just about everything since it was reprinted last year. As it turns out, there isn't a deck that wouldn't be helped by playing a set of [Lightning Bolt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt)s. It does everything you want a card to do. It kills creatures and opponents with a startling level of efficiency.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/boab/boab101_3Cards1.jpg)[Terminate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Terminate) seems like another obvious inclusion. Sometimes your opponent plays a creature and it changes the race math. Having a card like [Terminate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Terminate) allows you to interact with your opponent when it becomes necessary. I wanted a fifth [Terminate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Terminate) after playing a few games with the deck so I decided to include a [Doom Blade](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Doom+Blade).


Here's the list after I mash it all together:

If you've been lucky enough to open any [Dragonskull Summit](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragonskull+Summit)s or [Lavaclaw Reaches](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lavaclaw+Reaches) then you can replace some of the non-basics here with those. The sideboard hasn't been worked on much at this point, but I'd like to have some number of [Deathmark](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deathmark), [Burst Lightning](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Burst+Lightning)s, and a few copies of [Chandra Nalaar](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chandra+Nalaar) or [Liliana Vess](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Liliana+Vess).


I played a few games with the deck to see how it fared against the new Standard metagame.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/boab/boab101_elspeth.jpg)I lose the roll and keep [Liliana's Caress](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Liliana%27s+Caress), [Megrim](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Megrim), [Mind Rot](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mind+Rot), [Akoum Refuge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Akoum+Refuge), and three [Swamp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swamp)s. My opponent plays a [Celestial Colonnade](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Celestial+Colonnade) and passes the turn. I draw a [Terminate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Terminate), play my Refuge, go to 21, and pass the turn. My opponent plays an [Island](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island) and passes the turn back. I draw a [Blightning](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blightning), cast a [Liliana's Caress](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Liliana%27s+Caress) that gets countered by [Mana Leak](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak), then I pass the turn. My opponent plays another [Celestial Colonnade](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Celestial+Colonnade) and passes the turn. I draw [Dark Tutelage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dark+Tutelage), cast [Megrim](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Megrim), and it resolves. I pass the turn. My opponent plays a [Tectonic Edge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tectonic+Edge), casts [Elspeth, Knight-Errant](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elspeth%2C+Knight-Errant), makes a Soldier, and passes the turn. I draw another [Mind Rot](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mind+Rot), cast [Mind Rot](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mind+Rot) (I choose not to redirect to Elspeth from [Megrim](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Megrim)), my opponent discards two cards and goes to 16. My opponent plays a land, gives his token +3/+3 and flying and comes in for 4, casts [Oblivion Ring](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oblivion+Ring) targeting my [Megrim](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Megrim), and passes the turn. I draw a [Mountain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mountain) and decided to empty my opponent's hand with the second [Mind Rot](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mind+Rot), I cast [Dark Tutelage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dark+Tutelage) and pass the turn. My opponent gives his token a pump again and attacks for another 4, putting me at 13. He passes the turn. I reveal a [Lightning Bolt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt) and draw a [Liliana's Caress](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Liliana%27s+Caress). I cast the Caress, and pass the turn.


My opponent attacks with the single token and makes another one. I reveal [Liliana's Caress](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Liliana%27s+Caress) and draw [Dark Tutelage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dark+Tutelage), then cast the [Dark Tutelage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dark+Tutelage) and pass the turn. My opponent attempts to pump a token and I shoot it with [Lightning Bolt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt). He attacks me down to 8. I reveal [Burning Inquiry](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Burning+Inquiry) and a [Mountain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mountain), and draw [Sign in Blood](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sign+in+Blood), I cast [Liliana's Caress](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Liliana%27s+Caress), play my land, cast [Sign in Blood](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sign+in+Blood) to go to 6 and draw a [Lightning Bolt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt) and a [Terminate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Terminate), and pass the turn. My opponent attempts to pump the token and I shoot it with my [Terminate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Terminate), my opponent has a [Deprive](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deprive) for the [Terminate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Terminate) and I take 4 and go down to 2 with two active [Dark Tutelage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dark+Tutelage) on the table. I reveal [Burning Inquiry](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Burning+Inquiry) and a [Swamp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swamp) and I'm alive at 1. I draw another [Lightning Bolt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt), cast both copies of [Burning Inquiry](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Burning+Inquiry), my opponent has a [Deprive](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deprive) after the first one resolves and I lose the game to my [Dark Tutelage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dark+Tutelage) the next turn.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/boab/boab101_fauna.jpg)I win the roll and keep [Swamp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swamp), [Mountain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mountain), [Terramorphic Expanse](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Terramorphic+Expanse), [Mind Rot](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mind+Rot), [Megrim](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Megrim), [Terminate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Terminate), [Lightning Bolt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt). I play the [Terramorphic Expanse](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Terramorphic+Expanse) and pass the turn. My opponent plays a [Raging Ravine](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Raging+Ravine) and passes the turn back. I pop my Expanse for a [Swamp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swamp) on his end step. I draw [Blightning](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blightning), play my [Mountain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mountain), and pass the turn. My opponent plays a land and casts [Fauna Shaman](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fauna+Shaman), I [Terminate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Terminate) it at end of turn. I draw a [Liliana's Caress](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Liliana%27s+Caress), cast [Megrim](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Megrim), and pass the turn. My opponent plays a [Knight of the Reliquary](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Knight+of+the+Reliquary) and passes the turn back. I draw a [Swamp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swamp), cast [Liliana's Caress](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Liliana%27s+Caress), cast [Terminate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Terminate) on the Knight, and pass the turn. My opponent casts another [Knight of the Reliquary](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Knight+of+the+Reliquary) and passes the turn.


I draw a [Lightning Bolt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt) then cast [Mind Rot](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mind+Rot)—dealing my opponent 8. I [Lightning Bolt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt) the [Knight of the Reliquary](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Knight+of+the+Reliquary) and pass the turn. My opponent hits his fourth land drop and casts a [Bloodbraid Elf](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodbraid+Elf), he flips into an [Oblivion Ring](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oblivion+Ring), which removes my [Megrim](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Megrim) and he passes the turn after his attack. I draw a [Doom Blade](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Doom+Blade) then cast [Blightning](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blightning). [Blightning](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blightning) gets my opponent's last card and, together with [Liliana's Caress](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Liliana%27s+Caress), deals 5 to him, I then pass the turn. My opponent attacks for another 3 and passes the turn. I draw a [Liliana's Caress](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Liliana%27s+Caress), cast it, and pass the turn. My opponent casts another [Bloodbraid Elf](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodbraid+Elf) off the top, reveals [Fauna Shaman](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fauna+Shaman), attacks for 6, and I [Doom Blade](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Doom+Blade) one of the Bloodbraids. On my turn I draw [Sign in Blood](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sign+in+Blood), cast it, draw [Burning Inquiry](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Burning+Inquiry) and a land, cast [Burning Inquiry](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Burning+Inquiry) and win the game.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/boab/boab101_pyro.jpg)I lose the roll and keep [Swamp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swamp), [Swamp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swamp), [Mountain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mountain), [Mountain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mountain), [Mountain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mountain), [Blightning](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blightning), [Blightning](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blightning). My opponent casts a [Ponder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ponder), shuffles his library, and passes the turn. I draw a [Dark Tutelage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dark+Tutelage), play a [Swamp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swamp), and pass the turn. My opponent casts a [See Beyond](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=See+Beyond) and passes the turn again. I draw a [Liliana's Caress](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Liliana%27s+Caress), cast it, and pass the turn. My opponent casts a [Pyromancer Ascension](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyromancer+Ascension) and a [Ponder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ponder) to put a counter on the Ascension. I draw a [Mind Rot](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mind+Rot), cast [Blightning](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blightning)—dealing my opponent 7 damage—and pass the turn. My opponent casts a [Call to Mind](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Call+to+Mind) returning [Ponder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ponder) and casts [Ponder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ponder) getting a second counter on the Ascension before he passes the turn. I draw a [Terminate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Terminate), cast another [Blightning](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blightning), my opponent goes down to 6, and I pass the turn. My opponent plays his fifth land, casts [Time Warp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Time+Warp), takes two extra turns, and starts his next turn. He casts a [Preordain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Preordain) and copies it. He then casts another [Preordain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Preordain) and copies that. Then he casts a [See Beyond](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=See+Beyond) and copies it. He begins his next turn and casts another [Time Warp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Time+Warp) for two extra turns. During his next turn he casts [Foresee](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Foresee) and copies it. He then casts a [Call to Mind](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Call+to+Mind) and I concede to his infinite turns.


Things didn't go as well as we might have hoped, but having access to eight [Megrim](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Megrim) effects will make this deck a boogeyman until the rotation. I've always liked discard strategies, but something seems to be lacking here. I'm not sure I love having a discard deck that wants to play other spells before its discard. The opponent has an opportunity to play their hand while you're casting spells like [Liliana's Caress](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Liliana%27s+Caress) and [Megrim](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Megrim). By the time you start casting your [Blightning](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blightning)s and [Mind Rot](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mind+Rot)s they have already played a good portion of their hand. With more testing and a more finely-tuned list this deck could be a force in the Standard metagame. I'd love to hear your improvements in the forums.


I've been receiving an unprecedented amount of email in reference to last week's column. I'm sorry if I didn't get the chance to respond to emails you may have sent me this past week. A lot of you have asked for my non-budget decklist for [Pyromancer Ascension](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyromancer+Ascension). Here's what I played to a second place finish at the PTQ last weekend.

My sideboard wasn't very finely tuned, if I had to play with the deck again I would probably play with [Matignon's sideboard](/en/events/coverage/parez-prevails-france-nationals) from the French Nationals. The Ascension deck has proven itself to be a tier one deck in today's Standard. I hope you all enjoyed this week's exploration of the double [Megrim](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Megrim) strategy.


Happy Brewing!
