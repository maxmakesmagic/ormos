 Players returning to the feature match area to play are almost invariably cool, calm, and composed. It wasn't the case this time.



"I'm on full blown tilt. I could have drawn five cards and crushed him. I just didn't have the time."


"I could've drawn later. Now I've used that up. There's only one way from here."


Those were the words of No. 19 Ranked Player Paul Rietzl, who was back in the feature match area but on different circumstances than the round before. After tying the legendary Hall of Famer Jon Finkel in the last match, Rietzl couldn't afford any mistakes: The cut to Pro Tour Top 8 wouldn't allow another tie, let alone loss. Both players had dueled with similar BUG Control decks, a common occurrence given that both of their powerful teams had all brought the same. There were two other BUG Control mirrors in that same round Finkel and Rietzl played.



 On the other side sat No. 14 Ranked Player and Pro Tour *Return to Ravnica* champion Stanislav Cifka, who could have afforded to tie, but he too wanted every win in his remaining matches to lock down the best chance for Top 8. Playing a powerful, aggressive white-red deck built for speed meant Cifka's best chances were Rietzl's worst fears: deploy an unanswerable army in the first few turns.






*No. 14 Ranked Player Stanislav Cifka and No. 19 Ranked Player Paul Rietzl were both looking for wins in this match to remain in contention for the Top 8.*
