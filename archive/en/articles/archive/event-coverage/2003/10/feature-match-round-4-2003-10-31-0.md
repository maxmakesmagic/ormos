![Round 4 Feature Match: Wise vs. Baberowski](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/ptno03/953.jpg)Gary Wise and Dirk Baberowski are former teammates meeting for the fifth time at the Pro Tour. Wise is up 3-1 in the series, although Dirk has the momentum with the most recent one being decided in his favor. At Pro Tour Chicago in 2000, Dirk actually taught Gary how to play his blue/white deck in the hallway before the tournament started. Specifically, he told him to bring in his [Disrupting Scepter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Disrupting+Scepter)s against Green/Red because you needed to knock out the [Obliterate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Obliterate)s from their hand.

Of course they ended up being paired up in the Pro Tour that day, and Dirk was playing the Green/Red deck. Gary brought in the Scepters, knocked out the [Obliterate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Obliterate), and won the match. This time they aren't teammates, however, as Gary is part of CMU-TOGIT while Dirk is still with Phoenix Foundation. They've both brought [Tinker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tinker) to the table.

As the players shuffled up, Mark Rosewater hurried over, asking, "Did you guys get your pumpkins?" They had not, so pumpkins were quickly brought over and placed at the appropriate places on the feature match area. Gary then ate one of them, prompting the following conversation:

Dirk - "How is it?"  
 Gary - "Not bad. You should try yours."  
 Dirk - "I do not generally eat things in the United States."

### Game 1

Gary won the right to play first, but had to throw his first seven back. Dirk, in a valiant attempt to make him feel him better about it, offered the following advice: "A mulligan is an opportunity."

Gary, suitably impressed, responded with, "Could anything in Magic be more profound?"

![Dirk Baberowski, unshaven, unkempt](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/ptno03/954.jpg)Gary kept the new hand and led with [Ancient Tomb](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ancient+Tomb) followed by a [Chalice of the Void](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chalice+of+the+Void) set to one. The players simply laid lands and said go for a few turns, until Gary [Tinker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tinker)ed away his Chalice, finding a [Gilded Lotus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gilded+Lotus). Dirk could now play his [Voltaic Key](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Voltaic+Key) but still had nothing beyond that.

[Phyrexian Colossus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phyrexian+Colossus) entered play on Gary's side of the table, although it didn't look too threatening when not backed up by a [Voltaic Key](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Voltaic+Key). Dirk simply played out a bunch of artifact mana, said go, absorbed a hit for eight, and played a second [Grim Monolith](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grim+Monolith), bringing his total available mana to somewhere around twenty.

Gary: "Is one of those cards [Upheaval](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Upheaval) and the other a threat?"  
 Dirk: "Nope."  
 Gary: "Good."

Unfortunately for Gary, one of them was [Stroke of Genius](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stroke+of+Genius). Thirteen mana was tapped into the pool and [Stroke of Genius](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stroke+of+Genius) was cast for eight cards, leaving two colorless floating. [Voltaic Key](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Voltaic+Key) came down, untapped a Dynamo. Dirk sat there, thinking, and Gary swatted a fly that was buzzing around.

Dirk continued lamenting the quality of the cards in his hand, saying, "Wish I had a really good play right now." "I don't. I also wish I wasn't playing you. I wish I was playing some 11 year old kid from Somalia...I could beat him." Followed a minute later by, "With apologies to my readers from Somalia."

Dirk simply cast a [Metalworker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Metalworker), and it was Gary turn again, but not before he cast his own Stroke on end step for five cards.

A [Voltaic Key](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Voltaic+Key) came down and untapped the Colossus, which then swung for eight, taking Dirk to 2. A [Grim Monolith](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grim+Monolith) and two [Tangle Wire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tangle+Wire)s followed, forcing Dirk to tap eight permanents on his turn.

He was able to leave two Keys and the [Metalworker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Metalworker) untapped. The [Metalworker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Metalworker) was tapped to produce ten mana, then nine more off of a Key, then again for a total of twenty-eight mana. [Mindslaver](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mindslaver) was cast and sacrificed, giving Dirk control of Gary's next turn. With the rest of his mana Dirk cast [Masticore](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Masticore) and then [Tinker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tinker), getting a [Clockwork Dragon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Clockwork+Dragon) and immediately pumping it to 11/11.

At this point Gary offered the following: "Gary is starting to slump in his chair."

A moment later he chose to scoop in the face of a large dragon and the impending mind slaving.

Gary took out three [Chalice of the Void](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chalice+of+the+Void), a [Masticore](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Masticore), and a [Mishra's Helix](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mishra%27s+Helix) for an [Oblivion Stone](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oblivion+Stone), three [Chain of Vapor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chain+of+Vapor)s, and a [Kill Switch](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kill+Switch). Dirk sided in four [Annul](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Annul)s, two [Gainsay](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gainsay)s, and a [Mind's Eye](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mind%27s+Eye).

### Game 2

Both players kept their hand and Gary led off with [Ancient Tomb](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ancient+Tomb) and [Grim Monolith](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grim+Monolith). On his next turn he played a second [Ancient Tomb](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ancient+Tomb), prompting Dirk to remark, "I'm not even gonna have to attack you." He considered playing around Dirk's untapped [Island](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island) (and the threat of [Annul](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Annul)), but eventually he attempted a [Thran Dynamo](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thran+Dynamo), which was indeed countered, so instead he played a second Monolith.

Dirk cast a [Metalworker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Metalworker) off of an [Ancient Tomb](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ancient+Tomb) of his own, but Gary had the answer in the form of [Masticore](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Masticore). Dirk played out a Monolith and was done. [Masticore](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Masticore) entered the Red Zone for four as Gary hoped to end the game quickly, but Dirk of course had other plans.

He [Tinker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tinker)ed away a [Grim Monolith](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grim+Monolith) for [Mindslaver](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mindslaver) and used it. Gary showed [Stroke of Genius](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stroke+of+Genius), but he had no blue mana, so Dirk couldn't get rid of it by casting it for zero. [Masticore](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Masticore) died to its upkeep, and as for the rest:

Dirk: "Tap everything, take four [from the Tombs]. My turn."  
 Gary: "That's fair."

![A petulant Wise](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/ptno03/952.jpg)Dirk then cast [Urza's Blueprints](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Urza%27s+Blueprints), a key card in the matchup. Gary still had no blue mana, and when he did draw a [Seat of the Synod](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seat+of+the+Synod), Dirk had the [Gainsay](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gainsay) for his [Tinker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tinker). He briefly considered using [Voltaic Key](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Voltaic+Key)s to cast [Stroke of Genius](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stroke+of+Genius) that same turn, but opted not to as the damage from his [Ancient Tomb](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ancient+Tomb)s would take him down to two. Instead he untapped, made ten mana (falling to four life), and cast [Stroke of Genius](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stroke+of+Genius) for seven cards, followed by "Done."

Gary: "That didn't work out how I planned."  
 Dirk: "Sorry."  
 Gary: "No you're not."  
 Dirk: "True."

Dirk then made sixteen mana, falling to four life as well, and cast his own [Stroke of Genius](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stroke+of+Genius) for thirteen, but seemed unimpressed with the results. [City of Traitors](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=City+of+Traitors), [Grim Monolith](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grim+Monolith), [Tinker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tinker) for [Voltaic Key](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Voltaic+Key), untap [Metalworker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Metalworker), use it for ten, think some more, [Tinker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tinker) for [Clockwork Dragon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Clockwork+Dragon), two [Tangle Wire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tangle+Wire)s, and a [Grim Monolith](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grim+Monolith) all followed. 

Rosewater proceeded to place six pumpkins on the [Clockwork Dragon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Clockwork+Dragon) and four on each of the [Tangle Wire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tangle+Wire)s, turning the board into a virtual feast. Gary used his untapped land to [Chain of Vapor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chain+of+Vapor) the [Clockwork Dragon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Clockwork+Dragon), then used some stack tricks to keep his Monolith untapped despite the effect of the [Tangle Wire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tangle+Wire)s, and then played an [Island](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island), [Voltaic Key](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Voltaic+Key), a second Monolith, and cast [Tinker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tinker). This led to some thought. The two main options were [Kill Switch](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kill+Switch), which would hopefully lock down the board long enough for Gary to get back into the game, or [Oblivion Stone](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oblivion+Stone), which was a nice reset. Unfortunately Gary only had four mana available after the [Tinker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tinker), so the second one seemed a little less impressive, and he chose to get the Switch.

This led to a number of turns where both players were locked down, but eventually Dirk was able to recast [Clockwork Dragon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Clockwork+Dragon). Gary untapped his [Kill Switch](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kill+Switch) and used it again to tap down the Dragon, but Baberowski was simply able to [Tinker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tinker) for a [Voltaic Key](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Voltaic+Key), use it to untap the Dragon, and attack for the kill.

Since Dirk's deck was low on victory conditions and there was no way he could kill Gary the turn after the [Tinker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tinker), the Stone may have been the better choice, but it's hard to know what would have happened.
