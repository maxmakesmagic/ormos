With players travelling from "across the pond" and further afield looking to grab all the lollies the Kiwis are steeling themselves for a battle. With 30,000 greenbacks, four flights and invites to the big show (Pro Tour *Gatecrash* in 2013) and a shiny trophy up for grabs it’s going to be one heck of a weekend. And should your main -event plans not quite pan out? Don’t despair—there a great program of public events with something for everyone. But the very best thing? When you leave the venue after a long day of spell-slinging—you’ll be in New Zealand! 


For up-to-the-minute information on this event, ‘friend’ us on the [Wizards of the Coast Australia/New Zealand Organized Play Facebook page](http://www.facebook.com/pages/Wizards-Organised-Play-Australia-and-New-Zealand/141524005926167).


*The **Magic: The Gathering**  Grand Prix tournament series is a great reason to get out into the **Magic** tournament community, catch up with old friends, meet some new ones, and play some great **Magic**. Grand Prix tournaments are world-wide open events that allow all **Magic**  players to participate and experience the thrill of a large-scale competition. In addition to cash prizes, a high Planeswalker Points multiplier, and exclusive foil promo cards for participants, Grand Prix feature a host of other activities, including public events and artist signings (prizes subject to change).
