 "It makes it a lot harder to choose a Standard deck. You have be more aware of the metagame, and choose a solid deck that has a good chance against the overall field."
 - **Masashiro Kuroda**  | 
 "Honestly, I really don't like having to play two formats on the same day. It's really hard for me to change gears between Limited and Constructed."
 - **Masahiko Morita** | 
 "I'm not necessarily against it, but I think the DCI changes formats too often. It'd be nice if we could have the same format two years in a row."
 - **Tsuyoshi Fujita**  |
