The Grand Prix - Kobe champion is looking for another title to put after his name. In his way is Tokyo's Chikara Nakajima, who has spent most of his career in the shadow of other players, though is generally accepted as a player on the move.

Both players mulliganed their first hands. Nakajima started with a [Puppeteer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Puppeteer) that met an [Innocent Blood](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Innocent+Blood) from Ishida. He quickly replaced it with [Mystic Zealot](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mystic+Zealot). Ishida answered with [Hydromorph Guardian](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hydromorph+Guardian). Nakajima came back with [Graceful Antelope](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Graceful+Antelope). He pushed it past Ishida's defenses with [Shelter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shelter) and started taking over his lands.

Ishida was patient. He used what little time he had to Broker through his deck before bouncing the Antelope with [Aether Burst](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aether+Burst). His [Mortivore](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mortivore) was stopped by [Kirtar's Desire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kirtar%27s+Desire), but [Mindslicer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mindslicer) stuck. He undid Nakajima's team with a second Burst, dropping him to twelve. [Afflict](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Afflict) took care of a [Cephalid Scout](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cephalid+Scout), as well as getting Ishida to [Caustic Tar](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Caustic+Tar). He played it, and Nakajima's face fell. After four more points of pain from the [Mindslicer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mindslicer), he scooped up his cards.

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gpfuku02/916.jpg)Nakajima got on the board quickly in game two with a [Cephalid Scout](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cephalid+Scout) and [Mystic Familiar](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mystic+Familiar). Ishida was ready with [Afflict](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Afflict), and then tried a [Childhood Horror](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Childhood+Horror). Nakajima decided it was worth the [Syncopate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Syncopate). On his fourth turn, however, he had no play, nor on his fifth. Ishida had free reign, but only had [Hydromorph Guardian](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hydromorph+Guardian) for beatdown. His [Think Tank](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Think+Tank) worked to improve his draws.

With Ishida's force growing, all Nakajima could manage was a [Mystic Visionary](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mystic+Visionary) with [Ghostly Wings](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ghostly+Wings). Ishida [Aether Burst](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aether+Burst)ed it, keeping the pressure up. [Churning Eddy](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Churning+Eddy) on the Guardian set him back, but [Gloomdrifter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gloomdrifter) was still hitting in the air.

And then, Ishida drew [Putrid Imp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Putrid+Imp), allowing him to hit threshold and use a second [Gloomdrifter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gloomdrifter) as a one-sided [Wrath of God](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wrath+of+God). With a massive flying force and no resistance from Nakajima, it was soon over.
