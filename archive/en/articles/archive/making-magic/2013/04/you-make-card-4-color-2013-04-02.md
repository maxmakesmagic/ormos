Welcome back to You Make the Card, where you, the **Magic**-playing public, get to work together to design a **Magic** card! [Last week](/en/articles/archive/making-magic/you-make-card-4-enchantment-2013-03-25), we revealed that we are making an enchantment card and that the next vote would be about what color the card should be. We gave you all a week to talk about what the best colors were. People have been advocating rules-defining white enchantments, disruptive blue enchantments, powerful black enchantments, chaos-inducing red enchantments, and green enchantments that grow over time.


Robby ("MTG Color Pie") Rothe has been consistently vocal in the YMTC process, and in [this article](http://mtgcolorpie.com/2013/03/29/you-make-the-card-4-round-3-choose-the-color/) he lays out the role enchantments have played in each color. Those of you looking for a quick guide to what sorts enchantments we've made in the past will find this to be just the thing. I honestly don't know how I'm going to vote yet, but I hope you do, because the polls open today!


As I said last week, a spell's color affects what sorts of effects it can have. In **Magic** R&D, we have a thing we call the "color pie," a concept that illustrates the differences in the philosophies and mechanics of each color. Colors have access to some abilities, but not to others. For instance, blue can counter spells, but generally can't destroy permanents. For a more detailed explanation of why the color pie exists, read [this important article Mark Rosewater wrote](/en/articles/archive/making-magic/value-pie-2003-08-18-0).


Once this vote has been tallied, we can replace our spare-looking wireframe picture with a fancy colored frame.

  **YMTC Vote #3: Card Color**  Thanks all of you who voted! The polls are closed and we are tabulating the final results. Come back Monday for the next step in You Make The Card 4!
The polls close on Thursday night at midnight.


As usual, please discuss this on our forums using the link below this article or on other forums you enjoy. Feel free to shoot me an email using the **other** link on the bottom of this article. Using two different hashtags on Twitter hasn't been working out as well as I'd hoped. Let's try just using [#ymtc](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23ymtc) for discussions about everything related to You Make the Card from now on. Make your voice heard! Vote!
