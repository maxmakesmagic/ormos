 It's more diverse than other formats because of the timeshifted cards.

 I prefer white in this format, but played other colors as well due to the good cards I opened in those colors.

**What was the most exciting card from the timeshifted set that you played with this weekend?**  
[Mystic Enforcer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mystic+Enforcer)



**What do you like the most about the **Time Spiral** Booster Draft format?**  

 It's very versatile - drafts never go the same way. I've been drafting very different decks all weekend.


  
**What was your draft strategy? Did you stick with it all weekend, or did you have to change it?**  

 I don't have any. I just try to pick the best cards and usually focus on removal. I like aggressive strategies, but I don't mind playing control if I get the cards for it, like in the last draft of the event where I ended up with a very controlling black-green deck.

**What was the most exciting card from the timeshifted set that you played with this weekend?**  
[Giant Oyster](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Giant+Oyster)



**What do you like the most about the **Time Spiral** Booster Draft format?**  

 Almost every color combination can be good.


  
**What was your draft strategy? Did you stick with it all weekend, or did you have to change it?**  

 Three main strategies: Slivers, mono-blue, and the
 [Empty the Warrens](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Empty+the+Warrens)
 deck with suspend spells. I managed to draft one of those decks every draft, because cards like
 [Empty the Warrens](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Empty+the+Warrens)
 and Strength of Numbers are really underdrafted.

**What was the most exciting card from the timeshifted set that you played with this weekend?**  
[Disintegrate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Disintegrate)



**What do you like the most about the **Time Spiral** Booster Draft format?**  

 All the decks seem pretty good. It is difficult to find a deck with lots of filler.


  
**What was your draft strategy? Did you stick with it all weekend, or did you have to change it?**  

 Always be red and avoid white. All five of my decks had red cards and not one had white.
