 Kelly Digges has had many roles at Wizards over the years, including creative text writer, R&D editor, website copyeditor, lead website editor, Serious Fun column author, and design/development team member on multiple sets.
 






![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/mm/mm106_gds.jpg)Welcome to the final day of the Great Designer Search 2! After three rounds of initial selection, 1,120 original submissionists were winnowed down to eight contestants. After five rounds of grueling design competition—and something like 100,000 words of meaty design discussion here on DailyMTG.com—those eight were reduced to just three finalists: Ethan Fleischer, Shawn Main, and Scott Van Essen.


Now, the finalists are here at Wizards of the Coast headquarters in Renton for an intensive rotation of interviews, lunch with the contestants from the original GDS currently working at Wizards, and a live design challenge. On the line is the Holy Grail for armchair **Magic**  designers everywhere: a six-month design internship in **Magic**  R&D.

Monday, 10:30 a.m. – The Tour
-----------------------------


*by Kelly Digges*

The final day of the Great Designer Search 2 has begun! But before the competition gets underway, it's time to give the three finalists a taste of the working life here at Wizards—the life one of them will be leading when the dust settles.

Where the **Magic**  happens: The finalists check out some uncut **Duel Masters**  sheets in the proofing room—after Mark checks to make sure it's clear of **Magic**  spoilers. After that, it's on to the famous Art Wall near the creative team, where…

…naturally, the art from upcoming sets has been taken down, probably in preparation for this very tour. Mark does his best to pantomime how awesome this usually looks.

Monday, 2:15 p.m. – You Guess the Card
--------------------------------------


*by Kelly Digges*

The GDS2 interview gauntlet is over! Among many other tough questions, each finalist faced a rather unconventional test from GDS1 finalist Ken Nagle: Guess the Card.


Ken described it as a "rite of passage" for GDS finalists, and explained that director of **Magic** R&D Aaron Forsythe had given the same test to the finalists in the original Great Designer Search. The goal is to test depth and breadth of **Magic** card knowledge—far from the only important criterion at work, but not entirely trivial either.


It works like this: There's a laptop set up in the room. With neither Ken nor the finalist being interviewed able to see the screen, somebody hits the ["random card"](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?action=random) button on [Gatherer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Default.aspx%5D)—the very same random card button Aaron uses to generate [Aaron's Random Card Comment of the Day](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?action=advanced&discussion=+%5Baaron%27s%5D+%5Brandom%5D+%5Bcard%5D+%5Bcomment%5D)—and reads the name of this randomly generated card.


The finalist is then asked to give the card's mana cost, rules text, card type, and power/toughness (if applicable). If the finalist doesn't know or gets it wrong, Ken gets to take a crack at it.


Test your **Magic** knowledge against Ken and the GDS2 finalists—can you remember each card's vital statistics before mousing over to see it?

While discussing this exercise at lunch, Ken mentioned that neither he nor Scott had been able to get [Pavel Maliki](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pavel+Maliki). Aaron Forsythe held up a hand and thought for a second.


"That's a 4BR 5/3, isn't it? With ... BR: +1/+0."


![Pavel Maliki](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Pavel+Maliki)That's why he's the boss!




Monday, 3 p.m. – Lunch with the Great Designers
-----------------------------------------------


*by Kelly Digges*

After the battery of interviews, the three GDS2 finalists settled in for lunch with the four original GDS competitors who now work at Wizards and a few other members of **Magic** R&D. They chatted with one another and with the original Great Designers about the interviews, their worlds, and the differences between the two Great Designer searches.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/features/feature133a_2948.jpg)*As director of Magic R&D, Aaron Forsythe gets first pick of the sandwiches, obviously.*


When the topic of the first GDS's judging came up, Scott—who was also a competitor in the original GDS—said that he was sad not to see the mysterious "Gleemax" (the snarky, anonymous voice of R&D) as a judge this time around.


Mark Rosewater explained that he'd talked to a lot of people about it and made the call not to bring Gleemax back. At the time, he said, "a lot of people felt like it was at the expense of the designers." When he interviewed the Wizards employees who were in the first GDS, "in general the people who were involved in it liked Gleemax," because it cut through the niceties and told the participants, "Do this! Just ... do this!" But outside the building, Mark said, he got a lot more feedback that "Gleemax just seemed mean."


All three finalists had good things to say about the judging they'd been given this time around: specific, critical, useful feedback that let them improve their designs.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/features/feature133a_2947.jpg)*Clockwise from bottom left: Mark Globus, Shawn Main, Graeme Hopkins, Ken Nagle, Alexis Janson, and Scott Van Essen.*


One of the major differences between the first and second GDS was that this time around, each contestant chose one set concept to design in. All of the challenges referenced that original set idea. When asked whether they ever felt trapped by the choices they'd already made, Ethan and Shawn answered strongly in the affirmative.


"Yeah," said Ethan, laughing, "when I got the critique for my design test and Mark told me I should completely start over making my world."


"I had the same sort of thing," Shawn piped in. "It was such a sense of panic that first day, like—'Oh, you liked that thing in the background so much more. What can I take with me?' "


Scott, however, said that he never felt too constrained, having worked on the basic concept of his set design on his own time during the original GDS.

During lunch, a steady stream of other **Magic** R&D members trickled into the room to say hi, so the finalists got a chance to meet developer Tom LaPille, designer Brian Tinsman, and Mark Gottlieb, among others.


Lunch was winding down, but there was one more thing to do before splitting up again. With everybody here, a natural photo op presented itself: Two generations of GDS competitors in one place.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/features/feature133a_2953.jpg)


After lunch, it's on to the final Design Challenge!




Monday, 5:45 p.m. – The Final Design Challenge
----------------------------------------------


*by Kelly Digges*

The tour is long done. The interviews are over. The sandwiches are eaten. The small talk has petered out. Now it's time for the last—and maybe toughest—thing standing between these three finalists and the end of the Great Designer Search 2: the final Design Challenge.


For this Design Challenge, the finalists left behind the world concepts they worked with throughout the rest of the competition in favor of a Challenge where their work could be more directly compared. Instead, they went back to the future—*Future Sight*, that is.


The scenario is this: These three designers are the *Future Sight* design team. It's very late in development, and they've been informed that the card [Steamflogger Boss](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Steamflogger+Boss) is being cut from the set. This is similar to the final Design Challenge of the previous GDS, which asked the contestants to take on the role of the *Urza's Destiny* design team and find a replacement for the card [Opposition](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Opposition), but in some ways this design has even more constraints.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/features/feature133a_2963.jpg)*Whip the Xs! Pinch the Os! What they're building, no one knows!—but they've got an hour to figure it out.*


When a card is cut late in development, the replacement card has to fit exactly the same slot: same art, same color, same rarity, and even the same collector number—meaning that it has to fall in the same place when the set is sorted by color and then alphabetically by name. The additional constraint here is that [Steamflogger Boss](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Steamflogger+Boss) was a "timeshifted" card. The replacement card needs to be timeshifted as well, which puts two big restrictions on it. First, it has to fit in the right spot alphabetically among the red timeshifted cards (after [Skizzik Surger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skizzik+Surger) but before [Shah of Naar Isle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shah+of+Naar+Isle), in case you were wondering). Second, it has to fit the *Future Sight* definition of a timeshifted card: a card that shows off a mechanic or idea that hasn't been printed in **Magic** yet, but could be.


![Steamflogger Boss](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Steamflogger+Boss)Combine all that with the fact that Mark placed the real future of **Magic** since *Future Sight* off limits, and you've got a very tight set of design restrictions. As Mark is fond of reminding his readers—say it with me now!—restrictions breed creativity. The three Great Designer Search 2 finalists were given one hour to prove that maxim. Each one was given his own room with a *Future Sight* player's guide, a dictionary, a printout of [Steamflogger Boss](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Steamflogger+Boss)'s art, and plenty of scratch paper.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/features/feature133a_2956.jpg)*Scott Van Essen*


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/features/feature133a_2958.jpg)*Shawn Main*


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/features/feature133a_2960.jpg)*Ethan Fleischer*


When that hour was up, it was time for the hard part. What, you thought designing three cards to extremely tight restrictions in an hour was the hard part? Oh no. It gets harder.


For the second and final hour of the Challenge, Mark asked the three finalists to sit down in one room, along with himself and **Magic** developers Erik Lauer, Dave Humpherys, and Mark Globus. Each wrote his three designs on the whiteboard, and this faux design/development team had one hour to go from nine designs to one by picking one, mixing and matching, or even designing a new card—the important thing was that they have a single card design to give to development when all was said and done.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/features/feature133a_2962.jpg)


I chatted with GDS1 winner Alexis Janson about the collaborative/competitive nature of this final Challenge, and she said that the final Design Challenge of the first GDS had been much the same—with one crucial difference: the GDS1 finalists had been working entirely on their own up to that point, in direct competition. They made the transition to working as a team awkwardly and tentatively, unsure how much they were being judged on their cooperation. Should they vote for their own cards? Should they *not* vote for their own cards? They didn't know, and Alexis said that the effect was palpable.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/features/feature133a_2987.jpg)


By contrast, the second GDS has involved collaboration with members of the GDS2 Wiki community from the very beginning, and even, in the third Design Challenge, cooperation between pairs of Top 8 competitors working on one another's designs. Having already been selected for an ability to collaborate and to choose the best cards for the set regardless of who designed them, this crop of GDS finalists should be better prepared to work together—at least in theory!


Here's what they had to work with, as written on the whiteboard.

([Sockdolager](http://www.aolsvc.merriam-webster.aol.com/dictionary/sockdolager), by the way, is a real, if archaic, word.)


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/features/feature133a_2974.jpg)*The deliberation begins.*


Right away, the combined design/development team started hashing things out, crossing things off, and making amendments and additions. I've sat in on design meetings before, sometimes with very similar issues in play, and I was struck by how similar this felt to the real deal.


Scott's Steam-Driven Warrior and Shawn's Snapwhip Machine were both artifacts, and [Sarcomite Myr](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sarcomite+Myr), also in *Future Sight*, suggested quite firmly that this would require an additional frame design—and therefore wasn't an option. Steam-Driven Warrior could survive the transition to plain old creature, but the art really wouldn't work as an enchantment, so Snapwhip Machine hit the cutting room floor first.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/features/feature133a_2980.jpg)*Scott and Shawn discuss the possibilities.*


Aaron Forsythe ducked in at one point as the team was discussing Scott's Slave Driver design. "Let's talk about this '[Threaten](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Threaten) from hand' idea—" Mark was saying, but Aaron cut him off.


"That's a *Planar Chaos* card," said Aaron, drawing on his encyclopedic knowledge of **Magic**.


"Oh, is it?" Scott replied. "Crap."


"Ohhhh yeahhhh," Shawn said, recognition dawning. "[Treacherous Urge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treacherous+Urge)."


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/features/feature133a_2977.jpg)


Mark drew a big green X over Slave Driver.


"Well," said Aaron gleefully, "my work here is done!" And with that, he departed, cackling and rubbing his hands together—a spot-on demonstration of the role of directors in **Magic** design meetings.


More changes were in store. Rules manager Matt Tabak was called in to discuss what exactly tapping cards in your graveyard (from Ethan's Sockdolager) might mean, and while he was there he asked if "encasing" (from Scott's Spherebot Champion) had any rules implications, or if it was just a flag showing that the two cards were connected.


Matt also pointed out that they should probably decide between modern templating ("enters the battlefield") and modern-as-of-*Future Sight* templating ("comes into play"), just for sanity's sake. They eventually went with the templating as of *Future Sight*.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/features/feature133a_2978.jpg)*Matt Tabak looks on quizzically while Mark discusses Spherebot Champion.*


The flurry of questions and discussions continued. Was Steamsphere Oppressor "futureshifted" enough? No, although it would be if it said "artifactfall"—but that would be doing some violence to the space/time continuum, as landfall hadn't yet been designed at the end of *Future Sight* development. What about Standard of Chaos? Maybe, but Mark mentioned that they'd tried similar designs in the past, and the actual game play wasn't much fun. Did "encasing" mean anything after all? Not ... really, but the team arrived at a similar sort of effect using an Equipment token—still new enough to seem timeshifted from the future, but without any rules baggage to weigh it down.


Mark reminded the designers periodically how much time they had remaining. When all was said and done, they had combined one of Shawn's card names (and an echo of its sacrifice-centered design) with their communal evolution of Scott's Spherebot Champion:



> 
> Squee, Mecha Boss  
> 
> Legendary Creature – Goblin Artificer  
> 
> 1/1  
> 
> When Squee, Mecha Boss comes into play, put a colorless Equipment artifact token named Battlesphere with "Equipped creature gets +4/+4" and "Equip—Sacrifice two Goblins" into play attached to Squee.
> 
> 
> 


The final Design Challenge ended, then, with no clear "winner"—other than Squee, of course. But that was always the plan; the point of the exercise was to let Mark see how each of the candidates performed in the hectic collaborative environment of a live-fire design team. What were the results? We'll have to wait and see!




Monday, 6:04 p.m. – It Ain't Over 'Til It's Over
------------------------------------------------

The day is coming swiftly to an end here at Wizards of the Coast headquarters in Renton, and one question looms: Who is the winner of the Great Designer Search 2?


I asked Mark Rosewater this question as he walked out of what was clearly an intense meeting with **Magic** R&D director Aaron Forsythe and **Magic** producer Mark Globus, and his response was honest and straightforward: "I don't know yet."


While Mark Rosewater had hoped to reach a decision by the end of the day, he was upfront with the Great Designers from the beginning about the fact that he might not be able to.


"It's a very hard decision," Mark explained—and judging by Aaron's gentle ribbing, the decision was no easier during the previous Great Designer Search.


And so the three finalists settle down for an evening of dinner and drafting with **Magic** R&D with the winner of the GDS2 still undetermined—but it won't stay that way for long. Stay tuned to **DailyMTG.com**, and we'll reveal the winner in a feature article later this week!
