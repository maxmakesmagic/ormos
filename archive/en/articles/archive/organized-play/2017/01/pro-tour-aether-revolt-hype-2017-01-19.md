*Aether Revolt* officially comes out tomorrow. The Pro Tour begins in roughly two weeks. A new Standard is about to be put under the spotlights. Team Series competitors will be out in force, with more than 25 teams representing in the season of this program's soft launch.


Needless to say, I'm pretty hyped for the next few weeks and especially so for what the Pro Tour will be bringing.

Pro Tour *Aether Revolt* Merch
==============================


The merch booth at Pro Tour *Aether Revolt* will feature many favorites, including the Torch of Defiance gear and the Kaladeshi Planeswalker logo shirt from [Pro Tour *Kaladesh*](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/ptkld).

In addition to that, the Pro Tour will also have an event-exclusive playmat. This one features the combo of real world and fantasy with the Dublin, Ireland, skyline and Tezzeret.

These are available in limited quantities on a first-come, first-serve basis for anyone who is at the Pro Tour venue. These tend to be very popular, and the merch booth runs out of them early in the weekend, so if you *really* want this playmat, I'd strongly advise picking yours up on Thursday, February 2, during the registration hours of the Pro Tour.


On top of this, the merch booth is likely to have a cool new surprise or two that are *not quite* ready to be shown off just yet. Keep your eyes peeled on social media during the week of the Pro Tour and on this column the week after the Pro Tour for more info!
