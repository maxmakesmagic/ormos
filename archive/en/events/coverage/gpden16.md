GRAND PRIX DENVER 2016
----------------------




* [DAY 1 COVERAGE](#tabs-0)


DAY 1 COVERAGE



Denver has already shown us some surprises—just after the first day. Many people came in thinking there were two ways to go in Standard—Black-Green Delirium or White-Blue Flash. And though both are still going strong, the top tables have more to offer. Temur Aetherworks, Red-Green Aetherworks, and White-Blue Panharmonicon join the two more conventional archetypes in the undefeated bracket and they don't show signs of slowing. Tyler Heule, Kris Hopkins, Rob Pisano,Pro Tour *Shadows over Innistrad* winner, sixth-ranked Steve Rubin and former World Champion, and 9-0 connoisseur, third-ranked Seth Manfield are providing a nice array of the viable*Kaladesh*Standard decks.


The biggest story of the day was the revealing of Temur Aetherworks. Adding Whirler Virtuoso has apparently shored up many of the tougher matches for the traditional Red-Green Aetherworks deck, and the pro players brought the deck in spades—it was strongly represented in the pro community. Rubin said quite casually that to him it's clear the Temur build will become the third leg of the Standard stool after this weekend.


But will it sustain into the Top 8? Or will it fizzle out, like a Ruinous Path targeting a Bristling Hydra?


We'll find out tomorrow, starting at 9am MT. Join us bright and early on Twitch at [twitch.tv/magic](http://twitch.tv/magic)for the exciting conclusion to Grand Prix Denver!


See you then!
