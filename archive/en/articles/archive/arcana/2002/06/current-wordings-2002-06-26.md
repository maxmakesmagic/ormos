R&D claims that if every card in Alpha and Beta were templated using today's standards, only one card would have the exact same wording now as it did then. Which one?


It isn't a creature card, since the type line has been changed from "Summon X" to "Creature - X". It can't be an artifact, since all artifacts at that time had subtypes of "Mono Artifact", "Poly Artifact", or "Continuous Artifact". So which card is it?


  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
The answer is [Stream of Life](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stream+of+Life). Many old cards referred to targets ambiguously, but [Stream of Life](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stream+of+Life) had it right, and the text is the same now as it was then.
