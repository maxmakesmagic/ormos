**Hometown:** Calgary, Alberta  
**Occupation:** Business Analyst


 

**Previous **Magic** Accomplishments:**   

Almost got Top 8 at a PTQ a few times!


**What was your record in Sealed? What did you play? What was the hardest decision in your build?**  

8-1. Hardest decision was whether to splash for sick cards or not.


**What was your record in Draft 1? What did you play? What did you first-pick and why?**


**2-0-1 with Green-Blue. First-picked [Courser of Kruphix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Courser+of+Kruphix). It was either that or [Ornitharch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ornitharch). I thought white would be over-drafted... also it's better?** 


**What was your record in Draft 2? What did you play? What did you first-pick and why?**  

2-0-1 with Green-Black. First-picked [Asphyxiate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Asphyxiate). The card is awesome and I like black in this format.


**What's your favorite *Born of the Gods* Draft archetype, and why?**   

Green-Blue.


**Which *Born of the Gods* card exceeded your expectations in Limited, and why?**   

Both [Retraction Helix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Retraction+Helix) and [Arbiter of the Ideal](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arbiter+of+the+Ideal).

**Hometown:** Silver Springs, MD  
**Occupation:** Poker player


 

**Previous **Magic** Accomplishments:**   

Team Pro Tour Champion [Boston 2003 with Huey Jensen and Matt Linde as "The Brockafellars"], Team Grand Prix Champion [Turin 2000 with Daniel Clegg and Peter Szigeti as "Team Clegg"], and Grand Prix Pittsburgh 2013 Champion.


**What was your record in Sealed? What did you play? What was the hardest decision in your build?**  

8-1 with Blue-Green with [Kiora, the Crashing Wave](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kiora%2C+the+Crashing+Wave), [Polukranos, World Eater](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Polukranos%2C+World+Eater) and [Courser of Kruphix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Courser+of+Kruphix). Had to decide which five of seven bad cards to play.


**What was your record in Draft 1? What did you play? What did you first-pick and why?**  

3-0 with White-Green Heroic. First-picked [Akroan Skyguard](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Akroan+Skyguard). It's great.


**What was your record in Draft 2? What did you play? What did you first-pick and why?**  

1-1-1 with Green-White 2 [Aspect of Hydra](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aspect+of+Hydra) bad deck. First-Picked [Ghostblade Eidolon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ghostblade+Eidolon). The pack was terrible but white is great.


**What's your favorite *Born of the Gods* Draft archetype, and why?**   

White-based Heroic decks. White has a million great cards that all work well together.


**Which *Born of the Gods* card exceeded your expectations in Limited, and why?**   
[Kiora](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kiora%2C+the+Crashing+Wave), even though my expectations were very high. As far as not-great cards, [Crypsis](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crypsis).

**Hometown:** Livermore, CA  
**Occupation:** Insurance Adjuster


 

**Previous **Magic** Accomplishments:**   

23rd at GP Oakland 2013, 17th at GP Sacramento 2013.


**What was your record in Sealed? What did you play? What was the hardest decision in your build?**  

7-2 with a Red-White Aggro deck that played only a single card that cost more than three. The hardest decision was passing on green's [Courser of Kruphix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Courser+of+Kruphix) and Hunter's Prowess.


**What was your record in Draft 1? What did you play? What did you first-pick and why?**  

3-0 with Red-White Aggro. I only had five white cards, but one was Elspeth. I first-picked [Hero of Leina Tower](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hero+of+Leina+Tower).


**What was your record in Draft 2? What did you play? What did you first-pick and why?**  

3-0 with Red-White splashing Blue. I ended up with too few playables so I splashed [Nimbus Naiad](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nimbus+Naiad) off [Astral Cornucopia](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Astral+Cornucopia). I first-picked [Akroan Conscriptor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Akroan+Conscriptor).


**What's your favorite *Born of the Gods* Draft archetype, and why?**   

Blue-Green with [Griptide](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Griptide)s. That card is unreal.


**Which *Born of the Gods* card exceeded your expectations in Limited, and why?**   
[Fearsome Temper](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fearsome+Temper) has been superb for me.

**Hometown:** Watertown, NY  
**Occupation:** Writer


 

**Previous **Magic** Accomplishments:**   

Monied at Pro Tour Philadelphia 2005. Top 8'd States.


**What was your record in Sealed? What did you play? What was the hardest decision in your build?**  

8-1 with Blue-White Ephara featuring [Akroan Horse](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Akroan+Horse) and [Plea for Guidance](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plea+for+Guidance). Hardest decision was leaving [Divination](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Divination) out of the main deck.


**What was your record in Draft 1? What did you play? What did you first-pick and why?**  

3-0 with Blue-White. I first-picked [Temple of Enlightenment](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Temple+of+Enlightenment) hoping to go base-white aggro.


**What was your record in Draft 2? What did you play? What did you first-pick and why?**  

2-1 with White-Red-Green. It was aggressive, removal-heavy and mostly white, supported by two Temples, [Opaline Unicorn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Opaline+Unicorn) and [Springleaf Drum](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Springleaf+Drum).


**What's your favorite *Born of the Gods* Draft archetype, and why?**   

Blue-based decks with [Retraction Helix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Retraction+Helix) and untapping cards such as [Crypsis](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crypsis), [Kiora](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kiora%2C+the+Crashing+Wave)'s Follower and [Breaching Hippocamp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Breaching+Hippocamp).


**Which *Born of the Gods* card exceeded your expectations in Limited, and why?**   
[Mischief and Mayhem](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mischief+and+Mayhem), because on **Magic Online** I always lose to it, yet never win when I play it myself.

**Hometown:** Toronto, Ontario  
**Occupation:** Student


 

**Previous **Magic** Accomplishments:**   

Four Pro Tour Qualifier Top 8s. Six Grand Prix Day 2s. One Grand Prix winner's photo. Once beat "the" Andrew van Leeuwen in a sanctioned match.


**What was your record in Sealed? What did you play? What was the hardest decision in your build?**  

9-0 with Blue-Red. I struggled with which mediocre two-drop was best in my deck.


**What was your record in Draft 1? What did you play? What did you first-pick and why?**  

3-0 with Red-White Aggro. First picked and did not play [Ornitharch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ornitharch). It was the best card in the pack by far.


**What was your record in Draft 2? What did you play? What did you first-pick and why?**  

1-0-2 with Blue-Red Aggro. First picked [Kragma Butcher](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kragma+Butcher) in an otherwise weak pack because I only needed to win one match to make Top 8.


**What's your favorite *Born of the Gods* Draft archetype, and why?**   

White-Red Aggro or heroic. When it's open it's completely obscene.


**Which *Born of the Gods* card exceeded your expectations in Limited, and why?**   
[Everflame Eidolon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Everflame+Eidolon). It won me many games. When it falls off it still trades with something on the ground.

**Occupation:**


 

**Previous **Magic** Accomplishments:**   

Two Grand Prix Top 8s


**What was your record in Sealed? What did you play? What was the hardest decision in your build?**  

8-1 in Sealed. Played Black-Red with [Mogis, God of Slaughter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mogis%2C+God+of+Slaughter). Played red with bigger creatures (higher curve) and removal as opposed to the white with a lower curve, but with no way to close of grindy games.


**What was your record in Draft 1? What did you play? What did you first-pick and why?**  

2-1 with White-Red Aggro.


**What was your record in Draft 2? What did you play? What did you first-pick and why?**  

3-0 with White-Red Aggro.


**What's your favorite *Born of the Gods* Draft archetype, and why?**   

White-Red Aggro or heroic. The deck is mostly commons and very synergistic.


**Which *Born of the Gods* card exceeded your expectations in Limited, and why?**   
[Fearsome Temper](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fearsome+Temper). It's well-costed, has a big upside, and is quasi-evasion.

3-0 with Blue-Green with Xenagos that I first picked out of a weak pack.

3-0 with Blue-White. [Akroan Phalanx](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Akroan+Phalanx) because white is the best color.


**What's your favorite *Born of the Gods* Draft archetype, and why?**   

White heroic. Lots of good cards in both packs and can be paired with any other color.


**Which *Born of the Gods* card exceeded your expectations in Limited, and why?**   
[Crypsis](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crypsis). Catching opponents off guard, especially with inspired creatures or against [Sudden Storm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sudden+Storm)
