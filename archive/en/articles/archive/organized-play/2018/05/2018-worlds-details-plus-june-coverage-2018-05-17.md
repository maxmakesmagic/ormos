We've got some World Championship news for you today, along with the video coverage schedule for the rest of June following Pro Tour *Dominaria*.


2018 World Championship Details
===============================


The 2018 *Magic: The Gathering* World Championship will be a three-day tournament taking place in Las Vegas, Nevada, September 21–23, featuring 24 of the world's very best competitors. The prize pool totals $300,000, with $100,000 going to the winner.

The formats for this event will be Standard Constructed and Booster Draft using three booster packs of *Dominaria*. Yes, you read that right. We'll be taking one last look at the *Dominaria* Draft format the week before Prereleases for the set code named Spaghetti, before the new set and the Standard rotation shake things up.


There will be fourteen rounds of Swiss—seven rounds on Friday and seven rounds on Saturday—with a cut to a Top 4 playoff on Sunday. Friday and Saturday will begin with three rounds of Booster Draft, then transition into four rounds of Standard. Sunday's format is Standard using the same decks from the Swiss portion of the event.


Sunday will also feature the Team Series Championship, as the Top 2 teams in the 2017–18 Pro Tour Team Series face off for glory and prize money, with the winning team walking away with just over $100,000. We'll have more information on the Team Series Championship format in June.


It's going to be an exciting end of the summer season filled with great players, big moments, and a ton of awesome *Magic*. Be sure to tune in!
