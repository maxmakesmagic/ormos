Pro Tour *Amonkhet* is in the books, and many big stories, decks, and players emerged as the highlights of the latest tournament, including Champion and long-time player Gerry Thompson.


With the Pro Tour now behind us, it's time to look ahead to some upcoming opportunities to play. GP Santiago and Montreal are coming up this weekend, but if you're not able to make it out to any of the Grand Prix, there's another opportunity awaiting you . . .


Game Day
========


*Amonkhet* Game Day is this weekend! Bring your Standard deck to battle at your local game store for cool promos and pride! Those promos are full-art, including this [Trueheart Duelist](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Trueheart+Duelist), which everyone who participates in Game Day will receive (while supplies last at your local store).

The Top 8 competitors at each Game Day will receive this even spiffier full-art [Glorybringer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glorybringer). Bring destruction to your opponents' creatures in style!

And finally, the winner of each Game Day will receive a playmat commemorating their achievement as a worthy champion.
