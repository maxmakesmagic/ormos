Fabio Ancelmo is celebrating his 33rd Birthday in style with his first Grand Prix Top 8. Ancelmo, an accountant from Brasilia, has piloted his Mardu Dragons deck to perfection over the course of the weekend and finds himself facing off against one of the region’s up and coming stars.



His opponent, Rodrigo Soto Sanchez, is a school teacher from Santiago. Soto Sanchez won a World Magic Cup Qualifier a few years back and made it all the way to the finals of Grand Prix Santiago last year. This Top 8 proves that Soto Sanchez’s past finishes were more omen than fluke. Soto Sanchez is armed with Abzan Aggro, a deck that backs up strong removal and disruption with some of the best threats in the format.

Ancelmo got things started with [Soulfire Grand Master](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soulfire+Grand+Master). Soto Sanchez tried to pull ahead with [Anafenza, the Foremost](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Anafenza%2C+the+Foremost), but Ancelmo had a [Thunderbreak Regent](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thunderbreak+Regent) to stay ahead.



They traded creatures repeatedly, but Anafenza and [Thunderbreak Regent](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thunderbreak+Regent) were trading hits and Ancelmo was pulling way ahead. When [Kolaghan, the Storm's Fury](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kolaghan%2C+the+Storm%27s+Fury) came down, the game ended in the blink of an eye.



**Fabio Ancelmo 1 - 0 Rodrigo Soto Sanchez**



The second game started a bit slower, with Ancelmo using removal spells on Soto Sanchez’s early threats.



Once Ancelmo hit turn five he started playing [Stormbreath Dragon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stormbreath+Dragon) after [Stormbreath Dragon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stormbreath+Dragon).

Soto Sanchez tried to stay in the game and eventually found a removal spell for each of the dragons, but each was a turn late and his life total had already dwindled to six.



Ancelmo started using [Self-Inflicted Wound](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Self-Inflicted+Wound) with the activated ability on [Soulfire Grand Master](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soulfire+Grand+Master) and Soto Sanchez found himself with his back against the wall.



He was forcefully thrusts through the wall when Ancelmo drew the last copy of [Stormbreath Dragon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stormbreath+Dragon) to seal the deal.



**Fabio Ancelmo 2 - 0 Rodrigo Soto Sanchez**
