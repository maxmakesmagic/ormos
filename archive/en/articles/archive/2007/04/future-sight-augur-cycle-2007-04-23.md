The cycle of [*Future Sight* "augurs"](http://ww2.wizards.com/gatherer/index.aspx?term=augur&Field_Name=on&Field_Rules=on&Field_Type=on&setfilter=All%20sets) are creatures adept at prophecy, the art of foretelling the future. Their value comes from their dual uses—they can hang around to attack, block, and fight another day, or they can accelerate to their prophesied demise to useful effect.


Each of the augurs is depicted employing his or her method of soothsaying. Check it out:

| [Augur *il*-Vec](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Augur+il-Vec) cradles an oval of light in his cupped hands. The oval serves as his window on the future even as his exile between the planes traps him from the physical world. |

Aven Augur
 | [Aven Augur](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aven+Augur) has conjured a swirl of aether between his talons. He reads the aetheric energies to know whose future will continue and whose will disappear into the mist. |
| [Augur of Skulls](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Augur+of+Skulls), **Magic**'s only Skeleton Wizard other than the [Mistform Ultimus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Mistform%2BUltimus), studies the future in a bowl of ghastly, glowing liquid. The bowl is made from some unfortunate's sliced-open skull. |

Emberwilde Augur
 | [Emberwilde Augur](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Emberwilde+Augur)'s fascination is held by the spark of fire he holds between his hands. His connection to [Emberwilde Djinn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Emberwilde+Djinn) is alluded to in the flavor text. |
| [Llanowar Augur](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Llanowar+Augur) holds in her hands a tiny sprouting seed. The possibility of new growth on Dominaria is the only future she cares about. |
