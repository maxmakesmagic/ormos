Alchemy Rebalance News
======================


It's been a month since the release of Alchemy, and we've enjoyed seeing the format grow and take its first steps over the holiday season. And now, two of our first competitive Alchemy events are almost here: [the Arena Open this weekend](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/news/january-2022-arena-open-alchemy), and the [Qualifier Weekend next weekend](https://magic.gg/events/qualifier-weekend). We know many players are preparing hard for these events, and we will not be making any late-breaking changes to the format before they occur.


After the Qualifier Weekend, you can look forward to Alchemy's next phase, with a new handful of rebalanced cards coming your way. There will be boosts to some fun cards that aren't getting much love right now, as well as adjustments for some current strategies. We're excited for it, and we hope you are, too.


January 2022 Arena Open
=======================


Put your skills with the new Alchemy format to the test for a chance to win up to $2,500 in the first Arena Open of 2022!


The two-day Arena Open begins this Saturday, January 15, with Day 1 Best-of-One and Best-of-Three events. Perform well in these to secure an invitation to Day 2 where competition heats up for top prizes that will get your new year off to a lucrative start!
