The field of 1200 players is now down to just 8. Let's get to know these talented players for a bit!



**![](https://media.wizards.com/2017/events/gpsao17/t8_mopesto.jpg)Name:** Danilo Ramos Mopesto


**Hometown:** Londrina, Paraná, Brazil


**Age:** 26


**Score for Day 1:** 9 - 0 (No Byes)


**Score for Day 2:** 4 - 1 - 1 (The loss was a concession.)


**Previous Magic Accomplishments:**


A couple of Pro Tour Day 2s. Top 16 at Grand Prix São Paulo 2015 and 2016. Top 32 at Grand Prix São Paulo 2012. Top 64 at Grand Prix São Paulo 2011. 


**What deck are you playing today, and why?**


Grixis Shadow. I really think it is the best deck in the format.


**What are your best and worst matchups?**


Titan Shift is easy, but your opponent can always topdeck something. I guess White-Black Tokens is my worst matchup, but it isn't popular.


**What is your favourite memory of the weekend?**


Raphael Finardi pretending to be a crocodile. I’ never going to forget that scene.

 **![](https://media.wizards.com/2017/events/gpsao17/t8_romao.jpg)Name:** Carlos Romao


**Hometown:** São Paulo, Brazil


**Age:** 35


**Score for Day 1:** 8 - 1 (3 Byes)


**Score for Day 2:** 4 - 0 - 2


**Previous Magic Accomplishments:**


2002 World Champion. 2010 Magic Online World Champion. 5-time Grand Prix Champion.


**What deck are you playing today, and why?**


Grixis Shadow. I didn’t test too much and everyone around me told me it was the best deck in the format.


**What are your best and worst matchups?**


Titan Shift is the best matchup, because you have a lot of discard spell which allow you to break their game plan. Also, these ramp decks cannot deal with your creatures. The mirror match, however, is always a problem since they also have discard. They can attack your cantrips and you will have problems building your board.


**What is your favourite memory of the weekend?**


It has to be the Top 8. It’s been a while since my last Top 8.

 **![](https://media.wizards.com/2017/events/gpsao17/t8_lelis.jpg)Name:** Joao Lelis


**Hometown:** Pindamonhangaba, São Paulo, Brazil


**Age:** 29


**Score for Day 1:** 8 - 1 (1 Bye)


**Score for Day 2:** 4 - 0 - 2


**Previous Magic Accomplishments:**


1st place at CLM Modern. Two-times Champion at Liga [Arena](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arena) League 


**What deck are you playing today, and why?**


Cant Nightfall. It has fair games against almost every other deck and [Tireless Tracker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tireless+Tracker) is the best creature in Magic history!


**What are your best and worst matchups?**


My best matchup is the “retired” Sun and Moon White-Red Control deck because [Blood Moon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Moon) doesn’t affect my deck too much. I really, really don’t want to play against the Valakut decks though. It’s hard to deal with and I need to get to my combo really fast.


**What is your favourite memory of the weekend?**


An inside joke among my friends, called “Come EV”.

**Hometown:** São Paulo, Brazil


**Age:** 28


**Score for Day 1:** 8 - 1 (2 Byes)


**Score for Day 2:** 4 - 1 - 1


**Previous Magic Accomplishments:**


6th at Grand Prix San Antonio (Team) 


**What deck are you playing today, and why?**


Titan Shift. You have a chance to beat any opponent and every land you play becomes scary.


**What are your best and worst matchups?**


Any deck without discard spells such as [Thoughtseize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtseize) or [Thought-Knot Seer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thought-Knot+Seer). The worst matchup is classic Tron, because of [World Breaker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=World+Breaker) and [Karn Liberated](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Karn+Liberated).


**What is your favourite memory of the weekend?**


When I was paired against Carlos Romao in Round 15. We took and ID and I locked myself for the Top 8. Special thanks to Willy Edel, William Bernardino and all my other friends.

 **![](https://media.wizards.com/2017/events/gpsao17/t8_nunez.jpg)Name:** Fabian Nunez


**Hometown:** Santiago, Chile


**Age:** 30


**Score for Day 1:** 7 - 2 (1 Bye)


**Score for Day 2:** 5 - 1 - 1


**Previous Magic Accomplishments:**


I received my first Pro Point at Grand Prix Santiago 2017. 


**What deck are you playing today, and why?**


Abzan Midrange. I love interactive games and the deck can fight against any strategy. It is also quite skill-intensive.


**What are your best and worst matchups?**


Burn is my matchup because of [Collective Brutality](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Collective+Brutality), [Shambling Vent](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shambling+Vent), [Siege Rhino](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Siege+Rhino) and [Liliana of the Veil](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Liliana+of+the+Veil). Affinity is a close second because of [Lingering Souls](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lingering+Souls). My worst matchup is the classic Tron decks because seven mana on turn three is too much for me to handle. Plus, [Ugin, the Spirit Dragon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ugin%2C+the+Spirit+Dragon) destroys my entire deck.


**What is your favourite memory of the weekend?**


My friends cheering me on during the final few rounds. It’s nice to do well but even better when you’re with good company.

 **![](https://media.wizards.com/2017/events/gpsao17/t8_reyes.jpg)Name:** Julian Reyes


**Hometown:** Mar del Plata, Buenos Aires, Argentina


**Age:** 30


**Score for Day 1:** 8 - 1 (No Byes)


**Score for Day 2:** 4 - 1 - 1


**Previous Magic Accomplishments:**


Fourth place at Friday Night Magic at Factor Comic. 


**What deck are you playing today, and why?**


Counters Company. It has aggressive openings often and can combo as early as turn three. It is also very consistent.


**What are your best and worst matchups?**


Burn is the best matchup because I have many ways to gain life, while [Living End](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Living+End) is my worst matchup.


**What is your favourite memory of the weekend?**


Changing my deck choice one hour before this Grand Prix.

 **![](https://media.wizards.com/2017/events/gpsao17/t8_zaghi.jpg)Name:** Rafael Costa Zaghi


**Hometown:** São Paulo, Brazil


**Age:** 30


**Score for Day 1:** 7 - 2 (0 Byes)


**Score for Day 2:** 5 - 0 - 1


**Previous Magic Accomplishments:**


Argentina National Team 2010 


**What deck are you playing today, and why?**


Black-Green Tron. Turn-three [Karn Liberated](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Karn+Liberated) is just too good.


**What are your best and worst matchups?**


Abzan Midrange is easy because the game is often slower and big spells can defeat them in the late game. On the other hand, Ponza (land destruction) strategies are horrible for me.


**What is your favourite memory of the weekend?**


In Round 15, my opponent and I could not ID and had to play it out.

Jeskai Control, because it is a deck that I love.


**What are your best and worst matchups?**


The best matchup is Affinity, while my worst matchups are Burn and Eldrazi Tron.


**What is your favourite memory of the weekend?**


The emotion of being the eight best players at this Grand Prix this weekend.
