![walk_the_aeons](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/cardart/TSP/Walk_the_Aeons.jpg)Hey everyone! Welcome back to Online Tech. Today I'll touch on Standard and Extended, and then sprinkle in a new type of content. My plan is to go through a couple of games with a popular Extended deck (TEPS Desire) turn-by-turn, explaining the thought process behind certain plays along the way. I chose interesting games with some debate-worthy decisions. This was inspired by Noah Weil's recent "[Walk of Ages](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/daily/nw37)" articles. I loved his idea of writing detailed game walkthroughs using various Magic Online screenshots to communicate the game state, as there is a lot to learn from them.


The purpose of presenting walkthroughs of this kind is twofold. First of all, you get to see a popular deck in real action. I can imagine it happens way too frequently that you hear the name of a certain deck, but otherwise know very little concrete about it. By going over an example game with me, it will improve your understanding of the deck and the format. The second purpose is to make you a better Magic player, and the best way to get better is to analyze Magic games. By constantly trying to find the optimal play, considering all the options, and reflecting back on your decisions afterwards, you will improve quickly.


But let's tackle Standard first.

Angelfire is on the rise, and consequently Mono Green Aggro took a dive. G/B Dredge may just have been the flavor of last week, as it didn’t stick in the top ranks this week around.


On to the Extended recap.

I see a bunch of interesting observations this week. [Destructive Flow](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Destructive+Flow) decks are surging in popularity online, consistent with the recent Pro Tour Qualifier trends. It may be smart to prepare for this enchantment; little tweaks like cutting artifact land and/or [Minamo, School at Water's Edge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Minamo%252C%2BSchool%2Bat%2BWater%2527s%2BEdge) from your Scepter-Chant deck for more basics can help a bit.


A brand new archetype, developed by Zac Hill and Richard Feldman, has also made a splash online. It's a splash on the omnipresent U/W Tron decks, this time build to get maximum efficiency out of Gifts Ungiven.

I love me a [Gifts Ungiven](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gifts+Ungiven), so I wholeheartedly approve of this deck. Once I get back from [Pro Tour – Geneva](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/protour/geneva07) and have time to log onto Magic Online, I will certainly give this deck a try. Interesting elements are the 4 [Chalice of the Void](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chalice+of+the+Void), which can shut down complete decks. Chalice for two means no more [Isochron Scepter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Isochron+Scepter), no more [Life from the Loam](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Life+from+the+Loam), and no more [Burning Wish](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Burning+Wish). On the other hand, sometimes it just clogs up your hand or ends up hurting you more than your opponent, so I'm not yet completely convinced the artifact needs a four-of status, but I'll admit it can be very powerful.


All those tasty one-ofs allow for spectacular Gifts setups. How about [Mindslaver](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mindslaver), [Academy Ruins](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Academy+Ruins), [Crucible of Worlds](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crucible+of+Worlds), [Petrified Field](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Petrified+Field), for instance? It doesn't matter what combination of 2 cards you get, eventually you will get the Slaver plus Ruins "steal all your turns" lock.


### So What's Up with TEPS Desire?


I'll conclude this week's Extended analysis by stating my surprise that TEPS Desire took a huge plunge. The deck only posted one Top 8, even though enough players entered the events with the combo deck. Perhaps people are running infinite hate cards against it, perhaps the TEPS pilots didn't play well enough, or maybe they just had an unlucky week. I'd guess it's a combination of all of those factors. I still consider TEPS to be one of the best decks (if not *the* best) in the format, so I certainly wouldn't discount the deck yet.


To stick true to my words, I entered an Extended 8-man tournament online, hoping to get in some interesting games to show here. I beat Dezerter\_23's Boros deck in round 1, then beat Wurst\_'s [Ichorid](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ichorid) deck in round 2, and eventually fell to manu chao's Flow Rock deck in the finals. The match against Wurst\_ felt like the most interesting to me, so I picked it for my detailed game walkthroughs.


For reference, here's the deck I used in the games:

![](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Burning+Wish)


















It's my own version, which still changes a couple cards every other week, but the main outline is good. I'll quickly highlight the deviations from a stock TEPS list. I like [Channel the Suns](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Channel+the+Suns) more than most, because it fixes your color problems (more important than you might think), and because it is awesome to flip with a [Mind's Desire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mind%27s+Desire). And +1 mana is never bad. I run 4 [Infernal Tutor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Infernal+Tutor) because you need some card selection. I don't have good experiences with [Plunge into Darkness](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plunge+into+Darkness) or Sensei's Divining Top, and [Infernal Tutor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Infernal+Tutor) was the best other one available. My mana base places more emphasis on getting double blue for [Mind's Desire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mind%27s+Desire), evident from the [Irrigation Ditch](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Irrigation+Ditch)es. My sideboard is fairly typical.


Alright, on to the games! I win the die roll, choose to play first, and am presented with this opening draw:


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/mtgcom/fcpics/online/FK25_1.jpg)


Well, that's an easy mulligan. Not even a single land!


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/mtgcom/fcpics/online/FK25_2.jpg)


[Tendrils of Agony](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tendrils+of+Agony), [Infernal Tutor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Infernal+Tutor), [Chromatic Sphere](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chromatic+Sphere), [Sins of the Past](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sins+of+the+Past), [Gemstone Mine](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gemstone+Mine), [Rite of Flame](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rite+of+Flame). That's not much of an improvement over the first hand. We have one land, but it's the worst possible one. An Invasion block sac-land would be miles better. Another problem with this hand is that [Infernal Tutor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Infernal+Tutor) can never get to hellbent in time. Usually, a typical game involves a big turn where you empty your hand with a bunch of ritual-type cards, get up to 8 mana, then play [Infernal Tutor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Infernal+Tutor) for [Mind's Desire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mind%27s+Desire) and go off. However, we're basically stuck with two uncastables ([Sins of the Past](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sins+of+the+Past) and [Tendrils of Agony](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tendrils+of+Agony)), which means that [Infernal Tutor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Infernal+Tutor) can't be used that way. And regarding those uncastables, well, you're happy if you flip them off a [Mind's Desire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mind%27s+Desire), but they're incredibly bad in your opening hand. We have to go down to five.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/mtgcom/fcpics/online/FK25_3.jpg)


I have seen better, but at least we don't have really awkward cards (like in the previous hand), and a [Lotus Bloom](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lotus+Bloom) in your opening grip is always good. I'm not happy, but going down to four cards is even worse. Our opponent Wurst\_, in the meantime, mulligans down to five cards as well, making it all fair.



![Lotus Bloom](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Lotus+Bloom)

In 99% of the cases it is right to suspend [Lotus Bloom](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lotus+Bloom) right away. You want to get it in play as quickly as possible to allow you to go off on turn four. Holding on to it for a turn and suspending it on turn two is only better if you eventually go off on turn five (as the [Lotus Bloom](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lotus+Bloom) is one extra storm spell for that combo turn), and with this hand we are not sure to go off on turn four. Those [Chromatic Sphere](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chromatic+Sphere)s can draw us into the goodies, or provide us with random blanks, so it's hard to say when we will go off. However, I'd estimate the probability of drawing into the right cards to go off on turn four to be at least reasonable. And I'd pick a potential Desire with about a 75% chance to win on turn four over a surer Desire with about a 90% chance to win on turn five. Trying to win on turn four is crucial in Extended; turn five is usually too late. A Boros or Affinity opponent can easily just kill you on turn four, a [Destructive Flow](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Destructive+Flow) deck may have destroyed you with its namesake card already, and so on. So in general I'd still suspend [Lotus Bloom](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lotus+Bloom) here right away, and that's what I did.

However, I was playing on auto-pilot mode here, not thinking everything through. I said that in 99% of the cases it is right to suspend [Lotus Bloom](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lotus+Bloom) right away. In hindsight, as I am typing this, I believe this particular game would fall into that 1% exception category. What makes this game so strange is that *both* players took a mulligan down to five. An argument I offered for suspending [Lotus Bloom](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lotus+Bloom) right away over holding on to it for a turn is that you can't take the risk to lose to a turn four Affinity or Boros kill. We may very well draw into the right [Mind's Desire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mind%27s+Desire) cards to go off by turn four with our [Chromatic Sphere](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chromatic+Sphere)s, and if we had decided to plan for a turn five combo (with a turn two [Lotus Bloom](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lotus+Bloom) suspend) then we would look very stupid. However, even if our opponent plays Affinity or Boros, he mulliganed down to five! Then what are the odds he has a turn-four kill? That is *very* unlikely. I didn't take that information into account and probably should have waited with [Lotus Bloom](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lotus+Bloom), but alas, I miscounted that option because I was not thinking everything though completely.



![Stonewood Invocation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Stonewood+Invocation)

The dangers of playing on auto-pilot mode are evident here. My suboptimal play shows that I am not fail-proof; pros make mistakes just like other humans. Whereas I will defend most of my plays with proper arguments, there may still be a better play lurking out there, and I would love nothing more than to see a post in the message boards that outlines a superior play that I didn't catch, since I can learn from that. My auto-pilot misplay with the [Lotus Bloom](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lotus+Bloom) here was comparable to:

* Casting [Lightning Helix](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Helix) in your opponent’s attack phase, and then he runs [Stonewood Invocation](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stonewood+Invocation) in response. We are all taught to wait until the last possible second with instant removal spells, but sometimes it’s better to cast them at sorcery speed.
* Playing end-of-turn [Fact or Fiction](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fact+or+Fiction) with U/W Tron, and flipping [Mindslaver](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mindslaver) amongst others. Then you see your array of untapped Urza lands and wonder why you didn’t just play mainphase [Fact or Fiction](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fact+or+Fiction), as that would’ve allowed you to pop [Mindslaver](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mindslaver) right away. [Fact or Fiction](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fact+or+Fiction) doesn’t always have to go at end of turn.
* And so on…

There are so many examples of situations like this, and even good players can fall victim to them. The best way to handle stupid plays like these is to make a mental note not to make the same mistake again, learn from it, then shrug and move on. Don't weaken your concentration by hitting yourself up for making a mistake.


Alright, so let's think well about the next decision for a change: Do we also cast [Chromatic Sphere](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chromatic+Sphere)? Here's our opening hand once again for reference.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/mtgcom/fcpics/online/FK25_3.jpg)


There are pros and cons to playing [Chromatic Sphere](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chromatic+Sphere)s as early as possible. The main reason to hold on to them as long as possible is to jack up the storm count. On the turn where you plan to play a bunch of rituals and [Mind's Desire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mind%27s+Desire), you can throw in a [Chromatic Sphere](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chromatic+Sphere) to get another Desire copy. But this is not always right. Sometimes you are pressed for mana on that turn; if you can only ritual your way up to six mana, then keeping a [Chromatic Sphere](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chromatic+Sphere) in hand is useless. You'd be better off playing it beforehand. Furthermore, by playing Spheres as quickly as possible you can dig through your deck more quickly. This may allow you to draw into lands and play them one turn earlier. In this situation, we would like to draw into some lands for mana (and after a few turns a [Mind's Desire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mind%27s+Desire) of course), so it is right to cast the Sphere right away, with the intention of sacrificing it and playing the other Sphere on turn two.


Pfff... Turn one done, finally. Perhaps I was a bit too long-winded there.


Our opponent plays [Flooded Strand](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flooded+Strand), sacrifices it for [Watery Grave](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Watery+Grave), and plays [Cabal Therapy](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cabal+Therapy) for [Burning Wish](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Burning+Wish). That seems like the right card to call. My play of [Gemstone Mine](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gemstone+Mine), [Lotus Bloom](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lotus+Bloom) and [Chromatic Sphere](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chromatic+Sphere) completely betrays my deck, and since I play 4 [Burning Wish](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Burning+Wish), it's the best probability of hitting a relevant card.


On our second turn, we draw into [Cabal Ritual](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cabal+Ritual). As planned, we sacrifice [Chromatic Sphere](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chromatic+Sphere) and draw into [Seething Song](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seething+Song). No land in sight, too bad. We just play [Chromatic Sphere](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chromatic+Sphere) with the mana in pool and pass.


Our opponent plays [Breeding Pool](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Breeding+Pool) and [Zombie Infestation](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Zombie+Infestation) on his second turn. Ah, we're up against [Ichorid](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ichorid).


Our draw step yields a [Geothermal Crevice](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Geothermal+Crevice). This is how the game state looks in my main phase (our opponent's graveyard consists of [Cabal Therapy](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cabal+Therapy) and [Flooded Strand](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flooded+Strand)):


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/mtgcom/fcpics/online/FK25_4.jpg)


We play it and hope to see a [Mind's Desire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mind%27s+Desire), [Burning Wish](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Burning+Wish), or [Infernal Tutor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Infernal+Tutor) next turn when the [Lotus Bloom](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lotus+Bloom) hits play. There's no reason to lose [Gemstone Mine](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gemstone+Mine) by sacrificing [Chromatic Sphere](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chromatic+Sphere) now.


At end of turn, our opponent activates [Zombie Infestation](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Zombie+Infestation). I expected to see a dredge card, but he doesn't have one. That's what a mulligan to five does to you. Instead, he pitches [Psychatog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psychatog) and [Deep Analysis](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deep+Analysis).



![Cabal Therapy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Cabal+Therapy)

On his third turn, he plays [Cephalid Coliseum](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cephalid+Coliseum) and flashbacks [Deep Analysis](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deep+Analysis), leaving [Watery Grave](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Watery+Grave) open. He uses that mana for [Cabal Therapy](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cabal+Therapy), naming [Chrome Mox](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chrome+Mox). That makes sense – It's the only card he knows out of my hand from the last Therapy. He then proceeds to attack with his Zombie token and passes the turn. Note that he doesn't flashback the [Cabal Therapy](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cabal+Therapy). There are arguments for and against that play. [Flash](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flash)backing [Cabal Therapy](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cabal+Therapy) (on [Seething Song](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seething+Song), probably) will decrease my capabilities of going off next turn if I draw into a [Burning Wish](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Burning+Wish), for instance. However, not flashbacking said Therapy means that you keep your damage clock. By keeping a Zombie in play that delivers the beats, you decrease the amount of time I have until I die, which corresponds to the amount of draw steps I have for a [Mind's Desire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mind%27s+Desire), [Burning Wish](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Burning+Wish), or [Infernal Tutor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Infernal+Tutor).

Alright, so on to our turn. [Lotus Bloom](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lotus+Bloom) hits play in our upkeep and then we draw...


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/mtgcom/fcpics/online/FK25_5.jpg)


Bleurgh. Another [Lotus Bloom](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lotus+Bloom). We might as well suspend it immediately; nothing else we can do with it. So then we have [Cabal Ritual](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cabal+Ritual) and [Seething Song](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seething+Song) in hand, and our board consists of [Gemstone Mine](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gemstone+Mine), [Geothermal Crevice](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Geothermal+Crevice), [Chromatic Sphere](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chromatic+Sphere), [Lotus Bloom](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lotus+Bloom), and a freshly suspended Bloom. Our opponent's board consists of [Watery Grave](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Watery+Grave), [Breeding Pool](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Breeding+Pool), [Cephalid Coliseum](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cephalid+Coliseum), [Zombie Infestation](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Zombie+Infestation), and a Zombie token. He has four cards in his graveyard, amongst which are two [Cabal Therapy](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cabal+Therapy). He played [Deep Analysis](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deep+Analysis) last turn, so there's a fair chance he may have drawn into a dredge card. Now what? Do we:


* Pass the turn?
* Tap [Gemstone Mine](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gemstone+Mine) and crack [Chromatic Sphere](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chromatic+Sphere)?
* Tap [Geothermal Crevice](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Geothermal+Crevice) and crack [Chromatic Sphere](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chromatic+Sphere)?
* Sacrifice [Geothermal Crevice](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Geothermal+Crevice) for 2 mana and crack [Chromatic Sphere](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chromatic+Sphere)?

Let's first rule out passing the turn. Generally, a reason to keep [Chromatic Sphere](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chromatic+Sphere) in play is that you need the colorfixing the turn you go off. If, for instance, in a given situation you are sure that your opponent won't win or disrupt us next turn, *and* you really need that colorfixing for the big [Mind's Desire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mind%27s+Desire) turn, then you're better off passing the turn and banking the Sphere, until you draw a [Mind's Desire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mind%27s+Desire) and are sure to go off. However, in the situation in this game that is not applicable. With a [Gemstone Mine](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gemstone+Mine) and [Lotus Bloom](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lotus+Bloom), we won't need the colorfixing, so we can draw a card with no downside attached. If there is a [Burning Wish](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Burning+Wish), [Infernal Tutor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Infernal+Tutor), or [Mind's Desire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mind%27s+Desire) lurking on the top of our deck, we won't miss out on the chance of going off this turn.



![Chromatic Sphere](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Chromatic+Sphere)

Then how do we pay the one mana to sac the Sphere? If there's Desire enabler on top, then we want to get as much mana as possible this turn. That would imply sacrificing [Geothermal Crevice](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Geothermal+Crevice) and using the last counter on our [Gemstone Mine](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gemstone+Mine). However, if such a combo card is not on top but rather 2-3 cards down, then the last thing we want to do this turn is to lose any lands. So we want to balance these risks, taking into account how many turns we still have in this game. We're still at a high life total, and our opponent doesn't have a real clock, just a zombie token. He did draw some cards with [Deep Analysis](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deep+Analysis) next turn, so there's a good chance he found a dredge card and can start going nuts, but I'd expect we still have a few turns. So going for a low-risk play seems preferable. Imagine we would just tap [Geothermal Crevice](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Geothermal+Crevice) and sacrifice the Sphere.

That would certainly be the best play if the top card of our deck is not a Desire-enabler. But what if we *do* draw into a [Mind's Desire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mind%27s+Desire), [Infernal Tutor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Infernal+Tutor), or [Burning Wish](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Burning+Wish)? Well, then we turn the red mana from [Geothermal Crevice](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Geothermal+Crevice) into another red mana, plus one black from [Gemstone Mine](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gemstone+Mine), plus three blue from [Lotus Bloom](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lotus+Bloom). Then we use one blue and one black for [Cabal Ritual](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cabal+Ritual), proceed to spend two black and a red on [Seething Song](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seething+Song), which equates to ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227130159im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/red.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227130159im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/red.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227130159im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/red.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227130159im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/red.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227130159im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/red.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227195556im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/black.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161115194122im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/blue.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161115194122im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/blue.gif). That way, we can always cast [Burning Wish](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Burning+Wish), [Infernal Tutor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Infernal+Tutor), or [Mind's Desire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mind%27s+Desire) if we draw it. Seems good. The last thing we have to consider is what happens if we draw into another [Chromatic Sphere](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chromatic+Sphere) or [Chromatic Star](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chromatic+Star). That's pretty awkward, but if it happens we'll just cast it, pass the turn and see what happens next.


So the verdict is to tap [Geothermal Crevice](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Geothermal+Crevice) and sacrifice [Chromatic Sphere](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chromatic+Sphere) for red. We draw ... drumroll .... [Chrome Mox](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chrome+Mox). Bah! We end our turn with one mana burn.


Our opponent apparently didn't find a dredge card, as doesn't use his [Zombie Infestation](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Zombie+Infestation). After his draw, he plays plays [Tolarian Winds](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tolarian+Winds) (discarding [Chrome Mox](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chrome+Mox) and [Putrid Imp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Putrid+Imp)), leaving [Watery Grave](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Watery+Grave) open. He then attacks with the Zombie token, plays [Putrid Imp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Putrid+Imp) and yields.


Our draw step is uncomfortable.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/mtgcom/fcpics/online/FK25_6.jpg)


[Chromatic Sphere](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chromatic+Sphere)? Pffft. Going into the think tank now. The situation is similar to last turn, but there are a couple key differences; (1) we have to pay two mana to play Sphere and see another card; the Sphere isn't in play yet (2) [Cabal Ritual](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cabal+Ritual) will get tresholded this turn (3) if we survive two more turns, then [Lotus Bloom](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lotus+Bloom) will come in play. So as I see it, we have the choice between the following actions:


* Pass the turn.
* Tap [Geothermal Crevice](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Geothermal+Crevice), play [Chromatic Sphere](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chromatic+Sphere), and pass the turn.
* Tap [Gemstone Mine](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gemstone+Mine) and [Geothermal Crevice](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Geothermal+Crevice) for 2 mana, then play and sacrifice Sphere.
* Sacrifice [Geothermal Crevice](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Geothermal+Crevice) for 2 mana, then play and sacrifice Sphere.

Passing the turn may be good if we survive our opponent's next turn unscathed. If [Mind's Desire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mind%27s+Desire) is the second card down in our library, then holding on to that Sphere will give us an extra storm copy. Especially with a thresholded [Cabal Ritual](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cabal+Ritual), that one mana needed to play [Chromatic Sphere](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chromatic+Sphere) won't be a problem.



![Mind's Desire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Mind%27s+Desire)

Playing [Chromatic Sphere](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chromatic+Sphere) and passing is best if we are want to play for that Desire 2 cards down, without exposing the Sphere to a [Cabal Therapy](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cabal+Therapy). However, it means that we have one less storm copy, and I doubt our opponent will flashback [Cabal Therapy](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cabal+Therapy) on [Chromatic Sphere](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chromatic+Sphere) in this spot. Even if he does do it, his damage clock will decrease in speed, so that's not all bad.

The other options (sacrificing Sphere this turn) are of course better if Desire/Wish/Tutor is the top card, but they're not *much* better than not sacrificing the Sphere this turn, as we will probably win anyway if a combo enabler is on top. And they're *much* worse if [Mind's Desire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mind%27s+Desire) is the second or third card down. We're not under a fast clock yet, so we don't *have* to try and combo now. Sure, our opponent *may* have [Golgari Grave-Troll](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Golgari+Grave-Troll) in hand and start the nuts dredging next turn, but there's no guarantee and if he doesn't have it, we should still have at least one or two turns.


Taking all of this account, my play is to... simply pass the turn. At this point my opponent reaches across the table and strangles me for thinking a full two minutes without actually playing anything in the end, but that's the sad life of a TEPS player.


Alright, at the end of our turn Wust\_ doesn't discard anything. No dredge card or [Ichorid](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ichorid); who-hoo!


He attacks me down to 11, flashbacks [Cabal Therapy](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cabal+Therapy) on [Seething Song](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seething+Song) (he still knew that one, so that seems reasonable), and then casts [Psychatog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psychatog). Alright.


On to our turn 6. We draw [Seething Song](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seething+Song). Heh.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/mtgcom/fcpics/online/FK25_7.jpg)


Soooo, that's the exact same situation as last turn? Well, not completely. He now has a real threat in play! Last turn we felt we still had some time. Now that [Psychatog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psychatog) has entered the scene, things change. In order to figure out our play, we have to do [Psychatog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psychatog) math for our opponent. Are we certainly dead next turn or what's the deal? Let's see. Imagine the card in his hand is a blank (a land, for instance) and that he doesn't find a dredge card for sake of simplicity. Our opponent will discard the card in his hand to [Psychatog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psychatog) in his upkeep, then activate [Cephalid Coliseum](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cephalid+Coliseum) (hoping to draw into a dredge card, which he can pitch to [Psychatog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psychatog) still in his upkeep, then dredge back in his draw for mass pumps). If he doesn't draw a dredge card and goes all-in (pushing his hand and grave into his [Psychatog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psychatog)), it grows to a 9/10 size. Wurst\_'s team (including [Putrid Imp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Putrid+Imp)) then attacks for 10. 11.


But what if he has a dredge card in hand or on top of his deck? We can safely deduce the card in his hand is not a dredge card. First, he didn't have a dredge card last turn, otherwise he would have discarded it back then. Furthermore, we know that he did not flashback the [Cabal Therapy](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cabal+Therapy) left in his graveyard last turn. That is important information. Put yourself in Wurst\_'s shoes. If the card in your hand is a dredge card ([Golgari Grave-Troll](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Golgari+Grave-Troll) or [Stinkweed Imp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stinkweed+Imp), for instance), turning that [Psychatog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psychatog) into a 100% sure kill next turn, then why wouldn't you flashback the Therapy last turn? All I can do to stop his game plan is to go off next turn, and that [Cabal Therapy](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cabal+Therapy) can take out one spell at least. Keeping [Cabal Therapy](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cabal+Therapy) around in the graveyard won't help to prevent a big Desire next turn.



![Cephalid Coliseum](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Cephalid+Coliseum)

So he just has three chances for a dredge card: the three cards from [Cephalid Coliseum](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cephalid+Coliseum) in his upkeep. Three cards out of forty-six, and assuming a total of 9 dredge cards, basic statistics allow us to see that it is roughly a one-in-two chance of finding at least one. That's pretty high. Better sacrifice the Sphere this turn then, right? Well, there's a problem. If we miss (as in, draw a ritual-type card), then we have to mana burn down to 10, offering our opponent the certain kill even without a dredge card.

We could also just pass and wait until next turn to go off. That brings that suspended [Lotus Bloom](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lotus+Bloom) in play. In other words, going off next turn will give us a higher chance of winning than this turn, as there is another spell for the storm count coming in.


The last thing we have to consider is the Therapy that is still lurking in his graveyard. He hasn't been too quick to flashback Therapies, but if we just pass the turn without doing anything and he can only put me down to 1 next turn on his attack, then the best play for him is to sacrifice [Putrid Imp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Putrid+Imp) and flashback [Cabal Therapy](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cabal+Therapy) on [Chromatic Sphere](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chromatic+Sphere). If I don't do anything this turn, he knows we didn't draw [Burning Wish](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Burning+Wish), [Infernal Tutor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Infernal+Tutor), or [Mind's Desire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mind%27s+Desire), so we probably drew a ritual-type card. He can't do anything against us topdecking a [Mind's Desire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mind%27s+Desire) next turn, but if that Desire (or Wish/Tutor) is two cards down, then taking out our [Chromatic Sphere](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chromatic+Sphere) wins him the game.


Taking that into account, a fair option is to just cast [Chromatic Sphere](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chromatic+Sphere), keeping it safe from [Cabal Therapy](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cabal+Therapy), then passing the turn. Pfff... This is kinda tough.


If this were a real-life game, at this point a judge would be impatiently tapping his toes, telling me to speed up and make a play. I could easily have been thinking a couple minutes about all the factors already, so it's time to make a decision.


Let's put everything in perspective. Here is a matrix that highlights the optimal play based on the location of a Desire enabler ([Mind's Desire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mind%27s+Desire), [Burning Wish](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Burning+Wish), [Infernal Tutor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Infernal+Tutor)) on the top of our deck and whether or not our opponent can kill us with [Psychatog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psychatog) next turn.




|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | Opponent finds a dredge card (~50%) | Opponent doesn’t find a dredge card (~50%) |
| Desire enabler on top, second card down doesn’t matter (23%) | We have to play and crack the Sphere now. | Doesn’t matter, we win. |
| No Desire enabler on top, but there is one in the next draw (18%) | Doesn’t matter, we lose. | We should play the Sphere and pass the turn. |
| No Desire enabler in the top 2 cards (59%) | Doesn’t matter, we lose. | Doesn’t matter, we lose. |

This also abstracts away from the probability of truly winning when we play Desire, but for sake of argument let's just assume that casting Desire equals a win. As it is, I think we have to go for it this turn. I sacrifice [Geothermal Crevice](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Geothermal+Crevice), play [Chromatic Sphere](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chromatic+Sphere) and turn it into a red mana. We draw ... [Tinder Farm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tinder+Farm). Boooh. I burn down to ten. He of course sees the [Cephalid Coliseum](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cephalid+Coliseum) play and attacks for the kill.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/mtgcom/fcpics/online/FK25_8.jpg)


Good game.


Alright, let's review the sideboard. [Ichorid](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ichorid) typically doesn't run any hate cards (like [Stifle](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stifle)) that we have to answer. Furthermore, [Duress](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress) or [Orim's Chant](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Orim%27s+Chant) won't help against [Ichorid](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ichorid)'s strategy. They won't care if they can't play the spells in their hand, they'll just dredge and attack with [Ichorid](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ichorid)s. There is no reason to adjust our deck, so we just present the same 60 cards again, keeping a solid consistent combo deck.


Time for game number two. We choose to play first and look at our opening hand.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/mtgcom/fcpics/online/FK25_9.jpg)


Some lands, some mana cards, a [Mind's Desire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mind%27s+Desire), that's everything we need. We keep. Our opponent keeps his hand as well for a change, and we're off to go.


The game plan with this hand is to go off on turn four. We suspend [Lotus Bloom](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lotus+Bloom) right away, then on turn four we plan to sacrifice all our lands and the [Lotus Bloom](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Lotus%2BBloom), play [Cabal Ritual](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cabal+Ritual) and any other spells we might have drawn in the meantime, then finish with a [Mind's Desire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mind%27s+Desire).


We play [Geothermal Crevice](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Geothermal+Crevice) as the land for our turn. It doesn't really matter which one you play here, but I chose Crevice because it sacs for black mana, which matches the [Cabal Ritual](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cabal+Ritual) in our hand.


Our opponent starts with [Watery Grave](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Watery+Grave), [Chrome Mox](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chrome+Mox) (imprinting [Putrid Imp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Putrid+Imp)), and [Zombie Infestation](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Zombie+Infestation) on his first turn. Not bad.


We draw [Burning Wish](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Burning+Wish), then play [Irrigation Ditch](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Irrigation+Ditch). Why [Irrigation Ditch](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Irrigation+Ditch)? Well, once again it doesn't really matter, but in case we draw [Channel the Suns](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Channel+the+Suns) next turn and somehow decide to go off next turn, we need the extra blue that [Irrigation Ditch](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Irrigation+Ditch) can provide. But it's very unlikely that will happen; even if we draw [Channel the Suns](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Channel+the+Suns), we will probably still wait a turn for the [Lotus Bloom](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lotus+Bloom) to kick in.



![Ancient Grudge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Ancient+Grudge)

At the end of our turn, our opponent activates [Zombie Infestation](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Zombie+Infestation) twice, discarding [Psychatog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psychatog), [Stinkweed Imp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stinkweed+Imp), [Ancient Grudge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ancient+Grudge), and [Golgari Grave-Troll](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Golgari+Grave-Troll). Yup, there we go. The [Ancient Grudge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ancient+Grudge) is going to be interesting, though. If he finds a green mana in time, he will probably be very happy to nail my [Lotus Bloom](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lotus+Bloom) in my upkeep. I won't really care; with so many saclands already available, I don't truly need [Lotus Bloom](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lotus+Bloom) mana. To me, that [Ancient Grudge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ancient+Grudge) is slightly annoying, but mostly just another card that adds towards my storm count. \*Insert diabolical laughter here\*

Our opponent dredges back [Golgari Grave-Troll](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Golgari+Grave-Troll) in his draw step, dumping, amongst others, another [Golgari Grave-Troll](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Golgari+Grave-Troll) and [Cabal Therapy](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cabal+Therapy) in his grave. He attacks me down to 16 and passes the turn. Note that he doesn't flashback [Cabal Therapy](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cabal+Therapy) yet, but that makes sense. Judging by that [Lotus Bloom](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lotus+Bloom) floating around, I will most likely try to go off on my fourth turn. If I don't go off next turn, then it's safe to wait around with Therapy for one turn. The main advantage of doing that is that I may draw the card that he is going to name in my next draw step, and it gives him more information in case he dredges another [Cabal Therapy](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cabal+Therapy) in his graveyard next turn. Lastly, he gets another attack out of the Zombie token that would have fell to a flashback otherwise.


Alright, my turn three. I draw [Chromatic Sphere](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chromatic+Sphere). This is how the game state looks now in my main phase.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/mtgcom/fcpics/online/FK25_10.jpg)


Our opponent has [Golgari Grave-Troll](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Golgari+Grave-Troll) in hand, and the notable cards in his graveyard are [Ancient Grudge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ancient+Grudge), [Cabal Therapy](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cabal+Therapy), and [Golgari Grave-Troll](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Golgari+Grave-Troll). His beatdown force consists of two puny zombie tokens. Note that his [Chrome Mox](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chrome+Mox) gives black mana. We have [Geothermal Crevice](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Geothermal+Crevice) and [Irrigation Ditch](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Irrigation+Ditch) in play. Our hand is [Mind's Desire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mind%27s+Desire), [Cabal Ritual](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cabal+Ritual), [Tinder Farm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tinder+Farm), [Tendrils of Agony](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tendrils+of+Agony), [Burning Wish](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Burning+Wish), and [Chromatic Sphere](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chromatic+Sphere). We will remove the last time counter off [Lotus Bloom](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lotus+Bloom) in our next upkeep.


So what do we do? We can't go off yet. Four mana from our lands plus [Cabal Ritual](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cabal+Ritual) doesn't add up to six. The question, though, is whether to play [Burning Wish](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Burning+Wish) or [Chromatic Sphere](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chromatic+Sphere). Let's think about what our opponent is going to do next turn. He will dredge back [Golgari Grave-Troll](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Golgari+Grave-Troll), attack with his guys, then flashback [Cabal Therapy](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cabal+Therapy). He may dredge into a second Therapy (a reasonable chance), and he may also dredge into [Riftstone Portal](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Riftstone+Portal), which enables [Ancient Grudge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ancient+Grudge) (less likely, since I expect he only plays one copy of that land).



![Tinder Farm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Tinder+Farm)

Based on that, let's rule out casting [Burning Wish](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Burning+Wish). He has a [Cabal Therapy](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cabal+Therapy) in his graveyard, so we don't want to give away any free information on our hand. He's going to name whatever card we get. I know that he will probably name [Burning Wish](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Burning+Wish) if we don't play anything, but he may just randomly name [Seething Song](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seething+Song) and whiff. No need to present him with a 100% sure hit. How about [Chromatic Sphere](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chromatic+Sphere)? I don't see any reason to do so. If everything goes right, we have 10 mana (6 from 3 lands, plus 3 from [Lotus Bloom](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lotus+Bloom), plus 1 from [Cabal Ritual](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cabal+Ritual)) next turn, and we can easily fit one mana for [Chromatic Sphere](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chromatic+Sphere) and an extra storm spell in there.

So we simply lay [Tinder Farm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tinder+Farm) and say go.


As expected, our opponent dredges back [Golgari Grave-Troll](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Golgari+Grave-Troll). The notable cards that hit his graveyard are [Riftstone Portal](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Riftstone+Portal), [Ichorid](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ichorid), and [Coffin Purge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Coffin+Purge). This means that he can now flashback [Ancient Grudge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ancient+Grudge), and that [Coffin Purge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Coffin+Purge) may come in handy against any [Sins of the Past](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sins+of+the+Past) we may have.


Wurst\_ attacks with his zombie tokens, then plays [Cabal Therapy](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cabal+Therapy) from the graveyard. He chooses [Burning Wish](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Burning+Wish). It's a hit.


In our turn, we plays [Lotus Bloom](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lotus+Bloom). Still in the upkeep step, Wurst\_ plays [Ancient Grudge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ancient+Grudge) from the graveyard targeting [Lotus Bloom](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lotus+Bloom). He saw the play, not allowing me to use [Lotus Bloom](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lotus+Bloom) mana in my main phase. We'll have to let it resolve. We draw our card for the turn and then ponder.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/mtgcom/fcpics/online/FK25_11.jpg)


This turn we'll certainly try to go off. Two spells have already been played this turn, which are free Desire copies. Furthermore, our opponent doesn't really have any disruption. He has 2 [Golgari Grave-Troll](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Golgari+Grave-Troll) in hand and the only interactive card he has is the [Coffin Purge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Coffin+Purge) in his graveyard (his [Chrome Mox](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chrome+Mox) is black, so he can play it). So let's do it. In order to keep oversight over the entire combo sequence, I listed everything in a table.




|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Play sequence** | **Mana** | **Spells** |
| 1. We sacrifice all our lands. |  | 2 |
| 2. Play [Chromatic Sphere](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chromatic+Sphere), spending a white because there are no white cards in our deck. |  | 3 |
| 3. Sacrifice [Chromatic Sphere](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chromatic+Sphere), minus one green (the only green card in our deck is [Channel the Suns](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Channel+the+Suns)), plus one blue (for [Mind’s Desire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mind%E2%80%99s+Desire)). We draw [Rite of Flame](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rite+of+Flame). |  | 3 |
| 4. Cast [Rite of Flame](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rite+of+Flame). |  | 4 |
| 5. Resolve [Rite of Flame](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rite+of+Flame) |  | 4 |
| 6. Cast [Cabal Ritual](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cabal+Ritual) (thresholded at exactly 7 cards). Our opponent could respond with [Coffin Purge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Coffin+Purge) to remove threshold, but opts not to. Seems fair – It would only be an extra spell for our Desire, and waiting for a [Sins of the Past](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sins+of+the+Past) is more valuable. |  | 5 |
| 7. Resolve [Cabal Ritual](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cabal+Ritual). |  | 5 |
| 8. Cast [Mind’s Desire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mind%E2%80%99s+Desire) for 6. Leave  in pool. The double black is important for the [Tendrils of Agony](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tendrils+of+Agony) still in our hand. The other mana we leave up is probably irrelevant, and if possible I usually try to leave one blue in my pool, as it may come in handy if a specific situation arises (can't do that here though). In particular, if our initial Desire “misses” and just hits upon a combination of lands, [Cabal Ritual](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cabal+Ritual)s, [Seething Song](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seething+Song)s and a [Chromatic Sphere](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chromatic+Sphere). In that case, we can cycle Chromatic Sphere for a second blue mana, and if we topdeck a [Mind’s Desire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mind%E2%80%99s+Desire) then we can play it. This is planning ahead for a very unlikely situation, but sometimes it can matter. In this situation, we cannot keep a blue mana open, so we'll keep . |  | 6 |

Remember we still have [Tendrils of Agony](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tendrils+of+Agony) and [Geothermal Crevice](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Geothermal+Crevice) in hand. We flip into...


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/mtgcom/fcpics/online/FK25_12.jpg)


Ding! The win is straightforward from here. We cast everything, then play the Tendrils in our hand to finish it once and for all.


### On to Game 3... Or Maybe Not


I was now planning to highlight my third game (which I won, wheee!), but this walkthrough process turned out to be more length than I expected, and I have a flight to Geneva to catch. So with that, today's column must end. What did you think of the walkthroughs? Would you like to see how Game 3 unfolds, or perhaps a completely different deck, or did you hate the whole concept? Share your opinions on the message boards, and feel free to give suggestions. I learned from the experience of writing this. If I do this again, I would probably include a couple more screenshots and less text. I believe this type of thing has a lot of value, and think it doesn't get done enough. I hope you enjoyed it, and thanks for reading.
