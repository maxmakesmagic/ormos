Happy holidays from all of us here at **magicthegathering.com**!

Thanks to axial tilt, cultural traditions, and a generous benefits package, Wizards of the Coast offices are closed for the holidays! To give the Daily MTG writers and staff a chance to spend time with their families, celebrate holidays as applicable, and of course play a ton of **Magic**, we spend the last two weeks of each year revisiting some of the year's best articles and features.

The daily articles and weekly feature article will showcase each author's favorite articles of the year, and the feature article and Arcana slots will run some staff favorites. Card of the Day and Daily Decks are on hiatus until the site returns to regular updates.

And if your computer isn't feeling festive enough, you could deck the virtual halls with the wallpaper of this year's holiday card, [Snow Mercy](http://www.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/arcana/605), and wallpapers of the [previous four holiday cards](http://www.wizards.com/magic/magazine/article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/arcana/340).

As for this slot, here's the daily activity we recommend for all of you: Have a great holiday season, stay safe, and enjoy quality time with your loved ones. Bonus points if that quality time involves playing **Magic**!

We'll return on Monday, January 3 with all-new articles, and *Mirrodin Besieged* previews start soon after that. See you then!
