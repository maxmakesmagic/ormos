Gone but not Forgotten Ancient

**Magicthegathering.com’s** very first [You Make the Card](/en/articles/archive/you-make-card-wrapup-2002-12-06) feature produced [Forgotten Ancient](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forgotten+Ancient), a powerful and fun green elemental creature of increasingly unwieldy size. During its creation, its art concept was selected (“A humanoid elemental of moss supports itself with a hand against a dead tree. From where the elemental touches, it spreads wild regrowth”) and Mark Tedin was selected as the artist for the job. Mark then produced this art of “Mr. Babycakes”:

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/global/images/mtgcom_feature_109_pic2_en.jpg)Three years later, Mark Tedin found himself facing this art description for a *Dissension* card:


> 
> 3WW  
>  Creature – Elemental  
>  Flying  
>  Whenever you play an enchantment spell, put a +1/+1 counter on each creature you control.  
>  3/3
> 
> 
> *Location: Ravnica “skyline” at night  
>  Action: Show a strange winged creature of your design, maybe 12' tall, that looks like it's “made of night.” Show it perched on the top of a spire, wings spread. It's darker than the night (or dusk) sky behind it, and its body contains many stars of varying brightness.  
>  Focus: the winged “starry night” elemental*
> 
> 
> 

An elemental creature with an ability that grants +1/+1 counters? That sounds familiar! Mark took the opportunity to hearken back to his original [Forgotten Ancient](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forgotten+Ancient) art when he submitted the sketch for this new critter. Check out the facial similarities.

  
  
![Celestial_Ancient_640](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/cardart/DIS/Celestial_Ancient_640.jpg)The creative team liked the connection, and even named the card to be reminiscent of the player-created *Scourge* elemental.

[Forgotten Ancient](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forgotten+Ancient)[has a chance](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/selecting10e/6) to be in *Tenth Edition*—but even if it loses out, at least you’ll have [Celestial Ancient](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Celestial+Ancient) around to keep the faith.
