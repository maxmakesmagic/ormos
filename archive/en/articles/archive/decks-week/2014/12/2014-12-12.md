Last week was epic for *Magic* lovers, as 2014 Worlds Week provided five days and over 55 hours of live video for viewers to enjoy. While Denmark won the 2014 World *Magic* Cup in glorious fashion in their final game against Greece, Shahar Shenhar of Israel made *Magic* history by winning a second, consecutive World Championship title.



Both tournaments featured a wide variety of decks, many of which you can find by following the link below.



Meanwhile, if you're looking to qualify for an upcoming Pro Tour, there are two options available to you. Preliminary Pro Tour Qualifiers for the Pro Tour in Vancouver on August 2015 have already begun, and Standard Constructed [Pro Tour Qualifiers for Pro Tour *Dragons of Tarkir*](http://magic.wizards.com/en/content/qualifiers-pro-tour-dragons-of-tarkir) have already begun, so be sure to [find a PTQ near you](http://magic.wizards.com/en/protour/qualifierlist) and maybe we'll see you at the Pro Tour in Brussels, Belgium April 10-12!
