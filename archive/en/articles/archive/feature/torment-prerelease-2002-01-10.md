Prereleases have always been some of my favorite tournaments. They combine all the elements that are great about **Magic**. You get the excitement of competition, the discovery of opening new cards, and the community feeling with a huge group of players that are all sharing this cool experience with you.

My first prerelease was the *Alliances* one in Toronto. Ever since then, I've been hooked. Prereleases have just gotten better over the years with the cool giveaway card and better organization. I've put together a list of reasons to attend the *Torment* prerelease this January.

### Top 5 Reasons to Attend the *Torment* Prerelease

| Odyssey prerelease card*This premium Arabic Stone-Tongue Basilisk was given to everyone that played in the Odyssey prerelease* |

1. You get *Torment* cards before anyone else, which means you can bring your [Nantuko Shade](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nantuko+Shade) back to your local store and trade it for 4 [Shadowmage Infiltrator](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shadowmage+Infiltrator)s! (Or maybe just one.)
2. You can play in a low-key sanctioned tournament and maybe even earn some rating points. If you do well enough, you can even earn byes at Grand Prix through your rating.
3. You get a cool premium rare from *Torment* as a free gift, just for entering the prerelease. The last four prerelease cards have been in exciting languages like Latin, Arabic, and Sanskrit.
4. The foil rare for this prerelease is in the Russian Cyrillic alphabet. You have a chance to see what the world would be like if the Russians won the Cold War.
5. Prereleases are always the best deal around. For a fairly cheap price, you get a Tournament Deck, 3 boosters, a premium rare card in an exclusive language and the opportunity to win prizes in a fun tournament. Plus, you have the option to play in side events and drafts all day with the new set.

I hope you enjoy your local prerelease. I will be playing at the Wizards
of the Coast staff prerelease in a couple of weeks - wish me luck.

Best wishes,
