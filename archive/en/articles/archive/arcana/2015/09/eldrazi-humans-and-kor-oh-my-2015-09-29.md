By now, you've seen the sweet new art and cards of *Battle for Zendikar*. You might even have gotten to play with some of said new art and cards at the Prerelease. Today, we'd like to share some of the concept art from behind the scenes.


ELDRAZI

The majority of the Eldrazi in *Battle for Zendikar* appear to be of Ulamog's lineage. Here, you can see the color palettes, creature structures, and some initial spawn concepts.


THE RACES OF ZENDIKAR
=====================

There are many races represented on Zendikar. Today, let's take a closer look at the kor and humans.


**Kor**

The kor are a primarily nomadic people, and are masters of ropes and hooks.

Kor weaponry and equipment is very distinctive and highly practical. Kor won't carry a sword when a climbing tool can serve just as effectively as a weapon.


**Humans**

The humans of Zendikar are incredibly resourceful, but their appearance is rather ragged, on account of the ongoing conflict and battle for survival.

Human weapons are more utilitarian and straightforward: A sword is a sword. Their weapons also have hollowed-out shapes to help reduce their weight, aiding mobility while climbing and adapting to Zendikar's ever-shifting geography.


If you'd like to see more art from the world of Zendikar, you can get a copy of the [Zendikar art book](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/arcana/announcing-art-magic-gathering-zendikar-2015-08-31), due out in January 2016. For those who can't wait, you can tide over your excitement by checking out our [Worldbuilding panel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1M0WgfrxcsI) from PAX Prime 2015, where we originally showcased some of this art!
