We've got a short and sweet update for you this week. For the bulk of what Organized Play has to say, I'd advise taking a look at [Hélène Bergeot's article on the State of OP](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/news/state-organized-play-2016-06-22), which was also published today.


2016 Word *Magic* Cup Qualifier #1 Results
==========================================


Last weekend featured this year's very first round of World *Magic* Cup Qualifiers, as over 70 countries determined the first person to join their team in the 2016 World *Magic* Cup.


A list of last weekend's winners can be found on the [2016 World *Magic* Cup Invitation List](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/premierplay/2016wmc/invitations).


Looking to see some of the Top 8 Standard decks that came out of each event? We have some of that info available to you, which you will find below.

May's Player of the Month: Raphaël Lévy
=======================================


Last weekend, I proposed a question to the community on who deserves May's Player of the Month honors between Seth Manfield and Raphaël Lévy. In the end, Chandra in his Green-White Tokens deck drew enough attention to Raph's Grand Prix victory, earning him the title as May's Player of the Month.

Raph's win was much more significant than simply being about his deck. In his career as a Pro Tour Hall of Famer, it marked his 21st Grand Prix Top 8 (he is now tied for 6th place in lifetime Top 8s), as well as his sixth win, putting him just one Grand Prix victory short of being tied with Kai Budde, Shuhei Nakamura, and Yuuya Watanabe for the most wins.


Congrats Raph, and we look forward to seeing your next tally mark among a lifetime of great achievements.
