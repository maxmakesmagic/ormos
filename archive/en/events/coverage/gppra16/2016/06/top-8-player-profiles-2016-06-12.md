### Niels Molle

**Occupation:** Project manager


**Hometown:** Dublin, Ireland


**Previous Magic accomplishments:**


Multiple cash finishes at Grand Prix.


**What deck did you play and why?**


Omni Sneak. I never play Legacy and Niels Noorlander said the deck was sweet.


**What changes would you make to your deck and why?**


Play a [Daze](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Daze) in the sideboard because nobody expects it anymore.


**What's the most important card in your deck?**


[Sneak Attack](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sneak+Attack).

### Alexander Hayne


**Age:** 27


**Occupation:** Traveling wizard


**Hometown:** Montreal, Canada


**Previous Magic accomplishments:**


Pro Tour Avacyn Restored champion, four Grand Prix wins. Co-founder of Team Face to Face. Once beat Seth Manfield in a match of Magic.


**What deck did you play and why?**


Grixis Delver. Ben Friedman told me to.


**What changes would you make to your deck and why?**


I would cut the main deck [Cabal Therapy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cabal+Therapy) for some blue spells. Maybe add [Abrupt Decay](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Abrupt+Decay) to the sideboard for all of these [Chalice of the Void](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chalice+of+the+Void) running around.


**What's the most important card in your deck?**


[Brainstorm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brainstorm).

**Occupation:** Video editor


**Hometown:** Madrid, Spain


**Previous Magic accomplishments:**


Won MKM Prague, won MKM Rome, won MKM Madrid, and won Ovino 2015.


**What deck did you play and why?**


Storm. Because counting to ten is easy.


**What changes would you make to your deck and why?**


I tested the deck a lot and would make no changes.

[Infernal Tutor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Infernal+Tutor).

### Lukas Blohon


**Age:** 26


**Occupation:** Tourist


**Hometown:** Prague, Czech Republic


**Previous Magic accomplishments:**


Pro Tour Top 8, Grand Prix win.


**What deck did you play and why?**


Shardless Sultai. My friend Zuzy had all the cards. I also didn't have much time to test and the deck plays all the good cards.


**What changes would you make to your deck and why?**


Probably play another deck. Or play this more and see if some matchups are solvable. Lands is a very bad matchup, Miracles isn't great. You actually don't have any great matchups.


**What's the most important card in your deck?**


[Deathrite Shaman](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deathrite+Shaman).

**What deck did you play and why?**


Miracles. To get [Counterbalance](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterbalance) banned.


**What changes would you make to your deck and why?**


Mountain in the sideboard wasn't very effective; Shardless Sultai plays more [Creeping Tar Pit](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Creeping+Tar+Pit)s and less Wastelands.


**What's the most important card in your deck?**


[Sensei's Divining Top](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sensei%27s+Divining+Top)/[Brainstorm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brainstorm). But the second Mentor got me the most wins, courtesy of Maxime Gilles.
