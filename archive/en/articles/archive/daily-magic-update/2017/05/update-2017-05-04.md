The May 4, 2017 Update
======================

The Daily *Magic* Update is a roundup of everything *Magic* you should know on May 4, 2017. Today's Update is brought to you by 1v1 Commander, a format so benign and casual that it creates no controversy whatsoever. None at all.


Today's Must
============


1. [Brian Weissman and The Deck](https://kitchentablemagic.org/2017/05/03/brian-weissman/) | Kitchen Table Magic | Sam Tang

Brian Weissman is best known for his creation of a deck so fundamental to *Magic* that it is simply known as "The Deck," because it was the first true control deck that championed the concept of card advantage.


Now, Weissman still plays *Magic*, but mostly plays Commander 1v1 on *Magic Online* (how [topical](#8)) and records videos of them for his [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/bekele2617). Learn more about Brian from the podcast, then check out his takes on 1v1 Commander.


After That, Read, Watch, or Listen to These
===========================================


1. [*Magic: The Gathering* Comes to *Minecraft*](https://minecraft.net/en-us/article/magic-gathering-comes-minecraft) | *Minecraft* | Tom Stone

Yup, this is a real thing. In the latest skin pack from *Minecraft*, you'll be able to add some Planeswalkers to your world. Liliana Vess, Archangel Avacyn, Emrakul, and more join the *Minecraft* universe. No word yet on anyone trapping Emrakul in a moon-like object, but it's certainly coming.


1. [*Amonkhet* First Impressions](http://lrcast.com/limited-resources-387-amonkhet-first-impressions/) | Limited Resources | Marshall Sutcliffe and Luis Scott-Vargas

Do Marshall and Luis think *Amonkhet* Limited is the best format of all time, not even close? Maybe. That would be a pretty controversial opinion, as their description claims. Only way to know what that controversy might be is to listen.


1. [Against the Odds: Solar Energy (Standard)](https://www.mtggoldfish.com/articles/against-the-odds-solar-energy-standard?src=wizards) | MTGGoldfish | SaffronOlive

Many astute players have noticed that [Approach of the Second Sun](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Approach+of+the+Second+Sun) and [Aetherworks Marvel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aetherworks+Marvel) actually work pretty well together. For one, only the second time you cast [Approach of the Second Sun](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Approach+of+the+Second+Sun) has to be from your hand, so the first time can certainly be off an [Aetherworks Marvel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aetherworks+Marvel) trigger. But, just as nice, [Aetherworks Marvel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aetherworks+Marvel) flips the top *six* cards of your library, whereas [Approach of the Second Sun](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Approach+of+the+Second+Sun) gets placed *seventh* in your library, meaning you can activate Marvel once after casting [Approach of the Second Sun](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Approach+of+the+Second+Sun) to immediately draw it next.


Is this better than just [Ulamog](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ulamog%2C+the+Ceaseless+Hunger)-ing people? Maybe, maybe not—but Seth (probably better known as SaffronOlive) is obviously going to investigate.


1. [*Amonkhet* Sealed Pointers](http://www.mtgmintcard.com/articles/writers/simon-nielsen/amonkhet-sealed-pointers) | MTGMintCard | Simon Nielsen

We've got three Sealed Grand Prix this weekend [taking place around the globe](http://magic.wizards.com/en/content/premier-events-schedule#/overview), so now's a good time to get a little Sealed advice from some of the best. Nielsen walks you through his approach to the format and what to prioritize.


And if you want even more Sealed advice, Brian DeMars over on ChannelFireball [claims to have the keys to the format](https://www.channelfireball.com/articles/keys-to-amonkhet-sealed/). Fortunately for people like me, those keys are not "open really well." I opened a good Sealed pool once. In like 2007.


1. [This Week in Legacy: MKM Frankfurt and the First Week Without Top](https://www.mtggoldfish.com/articles/this-week-in-legacy-mkm-frankfurt-and-the-first-week-without-top?src=wizards) | MTGGoldfish | Sean Brown

You might have moved on to Commander or still be pondering changes to Standard, but remember how a major shift occurred in Legacy with the banning of [Sensei's Divining Top](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sensei%27s+Divining+Top)? Remember that? It was so long ago, you might not. Like a week and a half. Basically ancient at this point. Anyway, Sean Brown checks out the first major Legacy results to see how that shift shook up the format and what it might mean going forward.


1. [*Amonkhet* Draft Guide—Blue-Black Cycling](http://www.hareruyamtg.com/article/en/category/detail/114) | Hareruya English | Jeremy Dezani

Dezani went deep here with a look at the blue-black cycling archetype in *Amonkhet* Draft. The link above goes to his detailed analysis of basically every card the archetype could potentially care about. [This link](http://www.hareruyamtg.com/article/en/category/detail/115), meanwhile, goes to the videos he created to highlight the archetype.

What People Are Talking About

The release of the [*Magic Online* Commander 1v1 Banned List](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/magic-online/1v1-commander-banned-list) (which also applies to MTGO multiplayer Commander, but was mostly created to support 1v1 Commander Friendly Leagues) caused a bit of stir yesterday and into this morning, as players debated the merits of the list as well as the merits of having a list at all. I did play three games of Commander yesterday, so I can report that no such argument broke out.


But, hey, I'm always up for a game of Canadian Highlander.


For further discussion from the MTGO team about the decision to keep MTGO to just one banned list, you can read [this Tumblr post](http://wizardsmtgo.tumblr.com/post/160278778069/mtgo-commander) from Chris Kiritz, senior product manager for *Magic Online*.


Deck of the Day
===============


1. [JacksonHicks1's Bountiful Ramp](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/mtgo-standings/competitive-standard-constructed-league-2017-05-01-1)

I never thought I'd ever see the day when a 21-land ramp deck made me salivate.


[Bounty of the Luxa](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bounty+of+the+Luxa) is a big part of that, and this deck is capable of not only casting it on turn four, but doing some pretty big things with the mana.


But let's go back to those 21 lands. We've seen, basically since *Kaladesh* was released, that [Attune with Aether](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Attune+with+Aether) slots in pretty well as additional lands, so we're already up to 25 virtual lands. Additionally, [Channeler Initiate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Channeler+Initiate) and [Servant of the Conduit](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Servant+of+the+Conduit) serve as mana sources along the way. Also, let's not forget that [Chandra, Torch of Defiance](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chandra%2C+Torch+of+Defiance) is a bit of a ramp spell herself, able to add *two* mana per activation. Combine that with [Bounty of the Luxa](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bounty+of+the+Luxa) and you could have five mana simply from an enchantment and a planeswalker. At that point, casting something like [Ulamog, the Ceaseless Hunger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ulamog%2C+the+Ceaseless+Hunger) or [World Breaker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=World+Breaker) is pretty trivial.


You should also note that this is something of a spiritual successor to either Marvel decks or Four-Color Copy Cat, substituting giant, game-ending creatures in place of a game-ending combo. Chandra, [Glorybringer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glorybringer), [Rogue Refiner](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rogue+Refiner), [Servant of the Conduit](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Servant+of+the+Conduit), [Whirler Virtuoso](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Whirler+Virtuoso), [Attune with Aether](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Attune+with+Aether), and [Harnessed Lightning](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Harnessed+Lightning) were all staples of that archetype, and [Tireless Tracker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tireless+Tracker) was often somewhere in the 75 as well. If you're trying to pivot off of that old list, this is a good place to start.
