In an untamed format, no stone is left unturned and no card remains untested. Though Jeskai and Abzan are the giants at the moment, players are digging through time to find answers. The sideboards here are Grand Prix Los Angeles have some really interesting choices, and the players know that every round they might face a card that destroys them that they had yet to consider.


Here are the cards some players are fearing the most from their opponents 75 cards.

***Craig Wescoe** – [Deflecting Palm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deflecting+Palm). That card is real good in the Jeskai mirror match.* 


![](https://media.wizards.com/2014/events/gpla14/QH%20-%20Wily.jpg)
***Willy Edel** – I really don't want to see [Perilous Vault](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Perilous+Vault) and counterspells. [Nullify](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nullify) is a nightmare against me.*

***Matt Sperling**  – [Clever Impersonator](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Clever+Impersonator). (Eric Froehlich chimed in, "Oh, your cards are so good, the only card that can beat you is your card?")* 


![](https://media.wizards.com/2014/events/gpla14/QH%20-%20EFro.jpg)
***Eric Froehlich** – What am I not afraid of?! [laughs] How about this: There's no good sideboard cards against Jeskai.* 











![](https://media.wizards.com/2014/events/gpla14/QH%20-%20Stern.jpg)
***John Stern**  – [Hushwing Gryff](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hushwing+Gryff). Because then I can't drain them for three [with [Siege Rhino](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Siege+Rhino)]. That's bad.* 


![](https://media.wizards.com/2014/events/gpla14/QH%20-%20Wilson%20and%20Pardee.jpg)
***(22) Jacob Wilson and Sam Pardee**  –Sam: "We have [Thoughtseize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtseize), so I'm not really afraid of anything. Oh, wait, [Dark Betrayal](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dark+Betrayal). It's so cheap. I'm scared of that. But no one's playing it at all."*
