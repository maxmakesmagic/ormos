After 9 rounds, the field of 793 was boiled down to 266. That's still a healthy representation of the mature Standard metagame and we're here to share the Top 12 Archetypes with you.

Most of the numbers here correspond to the [numbers from yesterday](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/gptai16/day-1-metagame-breakdown-2016-06-25), but what we'd like to delve into a little more is the conversion rate.


For example, 171 players showed up with Green-White Tokens yesterday, putting 71 players through to Day 2. This represents a 40% conversion rate, which is an indication of the deck's performance yesterday.




|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Archetype | Quantity | % in Day 2 | Conversion % from Day 1 |
| Green-White Tokens | 71 | 26.69% | 40.80% |
| Bant Coco | 30 | 11.28% | 61.22% |
| Bant Humans | 29 | 10.90% | 31.18% |
| Humans (White Weenie) | 26 | 9.77% | 30.23% |
| Red-Green Ramp | 15 | 5.64% | 37.50% |
| Sultai Control | 15 | 5.64% | 75.00% |
| Black-White Control | 11 | 4.14% | 21.57% |
| 4-Color Rites | 7 | 2.63% | 21.88% |
| Naya Control | 7 | 2.63% | 24.14% |
| Abzan | 7 | 2.63% | 41.18% |
| Seasons Past Control | 6 | 2.26% | 17.65% |
| Blue-Red Ulamog | 6 | 2.26% | 25.00% |
| Others | 36 | 13.53% |  |
|  | **266** | **100.00%** |  |

Looking at the data above, Humans has got a poor conversion rate of only 30%. Despite it being potentially very explosive, it doesn't quite stack up in the mid-to-late game once things spiral out of control and the board gets gummed up. A few of the lists lurking around the top tables are playing as many as 20 one-mana creatures, increasing the effectiveness of [Thalia's Lieutenant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thalia%27s+Lieutenant) significantly, but this "all-in" approach is literally make or break.

Bant Coco and Bant Humans lend strength from [Collected Company](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Collected+Company), a superbly powerful card that allows creature-loving players to cheat on mana costs, dig for a specific utility creature, populate the board or rebuild it after suffering heavy losses from [Languish](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Languish) or [Tragic Arrogance](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tragic+Arrogance). In particular, Bant Company spots a 60% conversion rate, which indicates that it is a force to be reckoned with.


Nearly a quarter of all players in Day 2 are sporting this format-defining instant, and the trend will likely stay this way until *Dragons of Tarkir* rotates.

Of note are also the Sultai Control decks, which have been serving their pilots very well. Some of the [Seasons Past](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seasons+Past) Control players are also splashing Blue to include [Dragonlord Silumgar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragonlord+Silumgar) as a tool to beat the Planeswalkers found in Green-White Tokens, which means that almost 20 players have adopted this strategy.


Black typically gives the control access to quality spot removal ([Ultimate Price](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ultimate+Price), [Grasp of Darkness](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grasp+of+Darkness) and [Dead Weight](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dead+Weight)) and mass removal ([Languish](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Languish)), but one crucial part of the puzzle is the ability to run [Dark Petition](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dark+Petition). This enables the control deck to play silver bullets and a toolbox sideboard, opening up the doors to usually narrow options such as [Virulent Plague](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Virulent+Plague) for instance. You'll also be able to find [Seasons Past](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seasons+Past) to regrow your entire graveyard, or grab the best card you need if you find yourself in a fix.

As we step into Round 12, the Top 8 is starting to shape up.
