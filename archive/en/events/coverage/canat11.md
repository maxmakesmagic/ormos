Anderson Reigns in the Great White North!
=========================================




August 20-21, 2011











2011 Canada National Championship
---------------------------------


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration//mtg/images/daily/events/canat11/blurb_end.jpg)Marc Anderson is your 2011 Canadian National Champion! After sweeping the draft portion with a perfect 6-0 record, Anderson put up the 1-1 necessary to draw into the Top 8 in the final round. Unfortunately for him, he was paired down against veteran and former National Team member Jon Boutin, who could guarantee Top 8 with a win. They split the first two games, but with everything on the line, Anderson pulled out a win. In the Top 8, his Twin-Pod deck was the bane of his opponents, giving him quick 2-0 wins over first Paul MacKinnon and then Dan Lanthier.


In the finals he faced Noah Long, who had Top 8'd last year's Nationals. Long was playing Valakut, and it had served him well all weekend. They started off 1-1, and then Anderson mulliganed to five, and things were looking grim. However, it proved to be a golden grip, giving him everything he needed to steal the third game. In the fourth, he went for a gutsy unprotected Deceiver-Twin kill, and caught Long without Dismember.


Anderson and Long will be joined by teammates Dan Lanthier and Marcel Zafra. Lanthier, the 2008 National Champion, edged out Zafra for third place in a grueling five-game series.


Congratulations to Marc Anderson and the Canadian National Team!
