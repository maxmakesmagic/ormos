Both of these players are most likely unfamiliar to the average reader, but with two rounds to go they just need to win one more round to make the top eight. Bastien is playing blue-green and Alexandre has a very strange mono-black control deck with lots of creatures..

### Game 1

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/natfra03/a935.jpg)Bastien got a good draw with a second turn [Wild Mongrel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Mongrel) and a third turn [Arrogant Wurm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arrogant+Wurm). Alexandre also had creatures on both turns two and three; [Nantuko Shade](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nantuko+Shade) and [Rotlung Reanimator](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rotlung+Reanimator). He didn't block and went down to eleven on turn four. Perez added a [Merfolk Looter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Merfolk+Looter).

Perez got rid of the [Mongrel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mongrel) with [Chainer's Edict](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chainer%27s+Edict) and attacked with the Rotlung to make the life totals 16-11 in Perez' favor. With the Shade hanging back to block, Bastien decided not to attack with the [Arrogant Wurm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arrogant+Wurm) as they would only trade. He only had three lands in play, so he couldn't flash back the [Roar of the Wurm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Roar+of+the+Wurm) discarded to Looter either.

Peset attacked with his [Nantuko Shade](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nantuko+Shade) and traded with the [Arrogant Wurm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arrogant+Wurm), then played a second Shade. Bastien finally found his fourth land, and made the 6/6 Wurm. Alexandre had only two uncastable [Corrupt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Corrupt)s in his hand so did nothing. Perez then drew a very timely [Careful Study](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Careful+Study), putting [Wonder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wonder) in his graveyard, and giving him a [Centaur Garden](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Centaur+Garden). This allowed him to attack with the [Roar](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Roar), [Aquamoeba](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aquamoeba) and Looter for exactly eleven damage.

Bastien Perez 1 – Alexandre Peset 0

### Game 2

This time Alexandre's draw was rather better. He played a second turn [Withered Wretch](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Withered+Wretch) and [Rotlung Reanimator](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rotlung+Reanimator), and had two [Chainer's Edict](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chainer%27s+Edict)s for both of Bastien's two mana madness outlets.

![Graveborn Muse](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Graveborn+Muse)This left Perez with only uncastable [Arrogant Wurm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arrogant+Wurm)s and [Roar](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Roar)s with only had three lands in play. He conceded when Alexandre made a turn six [Graveborn Muse](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Graveborn+Muse) as he was only on eight and nothing in his deck could save him.Bastien Perez 1 – Alexandre Peset 1

### Game 3

Both players went down to six cards, but Bastien's still wasn't very good. He busted out a first turn [Basking Rootwalla](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Basking+Rootwalla) and pumped it once before it ran into [Chainer's Edict](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chainer%27s+Edict). That was the only spell he managed in the game, as he had a handful of blue cards with no [Island](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island)s. Alexandre made the game very quick by dropping two [Nantuko Shade](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nantuko+Shade)s, and Bastien conceded on his fifth turn.

**Final Result:** Alexandre Peset defeats Bastien Perez 2 – 1

That ensures Alexandre a top eight slot, but Bastien may still make it in if he wins the final round.
