Part of the look of *Time Spiral's* black-aligned environments is the dripping carcasses of Phyrexian horrors. When [Karn, Silver Golem](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Karn%252C%2BSilver%2BGolem) became the manifestation of the assembled [Legacy Weapon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Legacy%2BWeapon) and blasted Yawgmoth to smithereens, Phyrexian invaders of all shapes and sizes perished throughout Dominaria. What you see in the background of many *Time Spiral* black cards represents the viscera and vehicular wreckage of those Phyrexians.

  
*From the Time Spiral style guide: Phyrexian remains*

Check out the environment around [Gorgon Recluse](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gorgon+Recluse) or the volcanic battleground depicted in [Molten Slagheap](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Molten+Slagheap).

In addition, every basic [Swamp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swamp) in *Time Spiral* depicts Phyrexian bio-wreckage extremely well. Check out the toxic sludge-fens in these [Swamp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swamp) pieces. You can see hulls of ships, organs still sluicing ichor, even claws or ribcages of individual invaders that almost feel like they're about to get up and resume their destruction of life on Dominaria.
