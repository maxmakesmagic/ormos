**Information for Finals Competition**  

Important information for players making the on-camera finals:





1. Coins, card sleeves, and premium cards cannot be used on the table because of glare from the lights.
2. Note pads can be used on the table.
3. A make-up advisor will be on site for hygiene issues such as hair, nails, shaving, and so on.
4. Finals players may be required to change their shirts. Our criteria include, but are not limited to, non-white, non-offensive language, and designs agreeable to the camera.
5. Players will be asked to play with permanents in certain arrangements, such as lands below other permanents, cards closer together, and so on.
6. Players will receive instructions during play, such as being asked to move their hands back.
7. Players will be asked to wear microphones. We therefore ask that there be no swearing and that players refrain from saying things that could be considered grossly offensive.
