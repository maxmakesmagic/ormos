Magic Online Celebrates its 11th Anniversary!
=============================================


 








My name is Mike Turian (on Twitter @mturian). I am the newest member of the **Magic Online** Business team in the role of Digital Product Manager. Before joining **Magic Online**, I worked as a Producer for Wizard's technology department, a Product Manager for Organized Play, and as a R&D lead developer on sets such as *Future Sight*, *Worldwake*, and *Scars of Mirrodin*. I have played **Magic Online** since it came out in 2002 and **Magic** since *The Dark*. I am excited to be a part of the **Magic Online** community and working with Worth Wollpert (@mtgworth) and Chris Kiritz (@CKiritz) for a long time to come.


Today, as part of my second week on the job, I get to share some exciting news! **Magic: The Gathering Online** is celebrating its debut to the world, eleven years ago on June 20, 2002, with special events!


This year we have created a weekend featuring special 11-Booster Phantom celebration events that offer you the chance to play Sealed Deck with one booster pack from each fall **Magic** expansion that has been released on **Magic Online**, beginning with *Onslaught* and going through *Return to Ravnica*.


In addition, **Magic** R&D will be running a special R&D Challenge Standard Event on Friday, June 21, that you can play your favorite Standard deck in. The event will be hosted by Ryan Spain and Jon Loucks on [TwitchTV](http://www.twitch.tv/magic) where they will be streaming their Challenge matches.
