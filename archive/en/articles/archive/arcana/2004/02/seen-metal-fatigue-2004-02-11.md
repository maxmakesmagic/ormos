The art of the *Darksteel* card [Metal Fatigue](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Metal+Fatigue) features many artifact creatures feeling down in the dumps, having been sapped of their power by the force of the spell. Many *Mirrodin* artifact creatures are recognizable in the art.

The busted artifact creatures include: [Rust Elemental](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rust+Elemental), [Clockwork Dragon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Clockwork+Dragon), and [Clockwork Beetle](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Clockwork+Beetle) - all other artifact creatures illustrated by the artist, Arnie Swekel! The creature in the center is original to [Metal Fatigue](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Metal+Fatigue).
