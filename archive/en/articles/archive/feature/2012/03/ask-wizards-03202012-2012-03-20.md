Ask Wizards is a weekly feature that allows you to ask us questions! If you'd like to submit your question please email it to AskWizards@wizards.com. We aren't able to answer every question we receive but if your question is good then it might show up in the coming weeks!

  
**Thomas L. asks:**

Hi Wizards, I'm a young artist in school and want to know that down the road how can I apply to do art for Magic or Dungeons and Dragons?

**Trick answers:**

You'll find the information you need on our [Submission Guidelines](http://www.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=contactinfo/artsubmission) page which talks about not only how artists submit their portfolios but also those interested in submitting games and those who are interested in possibly writing fiction. This is a page that I actually had an email discussion about making the page easier to find so your question is an excellent opportunity to point people to it.

  
From the Ask Wizards archives we pull this fun question.

**Q: When you have an infinite combo in Standard, do you consider it a triumph or a defeat?**  
 â€“Tom, Appleton, WI, USA

**A: From Mark Rosewater, Magic head designer:**

Tom,  
 That's a different question based on whether you ask design or development. As Head of Design, I'll answer for the former. What makes Magic such an intriguing game is its modular design, the fact that each player can find new and different connections to explore. The fact that there exist compelling "Holy Grails" such as an infinite combo definitely enhances the game. Well, from a design standpoint at least. As long as the combo isn't blatantly obvious and too simple to pull off, I'd put it in the triumph camp.
