In this recurring sub-feature of Magic Arcana we keep track of everybody's favorite bane of trivia to see what creature types it has gained and/or lost.


Last time we checked in with the Ultimus [after the release of Ravnica](/en/articles/archive/mistform-ultimus-watch-ravnica-edition-2006-01-05), just before *Guildpact* previews were getting ready to kick off. Since then *Guildpact*, *Dissension*, and *Coldsnap* have all joined the mix. On top of all that, *Visions* was released on ***Magic** Online* in April, which also brought some changes. So, since we last checked in, the Ultimus has also become a Construct, a Cyclops, a Nephilim, a Weird, and, at long last, a Juggernaut! (Thanks [Gruul War Plow](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gruul+War+Plow)!) 


While picking those types up, the Ultimus lost the following:


* Butterfly ([Giant Caterpillar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Giant+Caterpillar)'s token is still *named* Butterfly, but the token's type is Insect now, as of the MTGO release of *Visions*.)
* Lichenthrope (The *Visions* card [Lichenthrope](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lichenthrope) was consolidated to type Fungus.)
* Lion ([Savannah Lions](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Savannah+Lions) (*9th Edition*), [Mtenda Lion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mtenda+Lion) (*Mirage*) and [Jamuraan Lion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jamuraan+Lion) (*Visions*) have all been reprinted now with type "Cat".)
* Mindsucker ([Urborg Mindsucker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Urborg+Mindsucker) from *Visions* was the only creature of its type, so it was consolidated to Horror.)
* Mistfolk (Only *Ice Age's* card [Mistfolk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mistfolk) had this creature type. It's now an Illusion like [Thalakos Mistfolk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thalakos+Mistfolk).)
* [Necrosavant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Necrosavant) (Now a Zombie Giant!)
* Warthog (The *Visions* and *Sixth Edition* card [Warthog](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Warthog) is now a Beast to match his buddy [Giant Warthog](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Giant+Warthog).)
* Wildebeest (Also now a Beast as of *Visions* joining ***Magic** Online*.)

[Mistform Ultimus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mistform+Ultimus) is a Weird Fungus, an Oyster Paratrooper, a Walking-Dead Waiter, an Expansion-Symbol Designer, a Giant Squirrel Farmer, a Banshee Mime, and a Master Gamer. Speaking of Master Gamer, it's also an Archer Assassin Barbarian Cleric Druid Monk Ranger Paladin Thief Ranger Wizard. (Someone's been adventuring a little too long.)


All together, as of *Coldsnap*, [Mistform Ultimus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mistform+Ultimus) is a:
