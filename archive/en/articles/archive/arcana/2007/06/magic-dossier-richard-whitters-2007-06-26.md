![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/mtgcom/arcana/Dossier_Richard_Whitters.jpg)**Name:** Richard Whitters


**Job title and duties:** Concept Artist for **Magic the Gathering**. It's my job to take random and crazy ideas and make them cool visually. My work day is basically two faceted, imagine and draw. I dig that.


**Age:** born in 1971 (The same year Canada separated from Mongolia)


**Education:** NBCCD Fredericton, New Brunswick, Canada. I took graphic design and illustration. During the same period I also learned most of my ninja/kung fu skills.


**Began working at Wizards:** April, 2007


**Previous job:** In reverse order: Project Coordinator, Freelance Fantasy Artist, Web & Print Graphic Artist/Designer, Video Store Asst. Manager, Drugstore Clerk, Headstone Engraver, Lawn Mower, Driveway Shoveller, Jobless Child.


**How you got your job here:** I did a 24 hour pencil test for art director Jeremy Jarvis and then sent him sixty pounds of gold bullion, a case of back bacon and half a bottle of vodka and BOOM, I had the job.


**Magic accomplishments prior to working here:** I once bent a spoon with my mind but it made me pass out in my bowl of Rice Krispies. There is really nothing besides that.


**Expansions or projects you've worked on:** I've worked on the Jelly style guide and have done various random fantasy illustration work in the past.


**Favorite part of your job:** Hands down my favorite part thus far is drawing. I haven't had the luxury of drawing and making up ideas all day since college and I completely enjoy it.


**Least favorite part of your job:** There's this one guy who is about three feet tall and lives under my desk. That little fellow keeps pestering me to buy him stuff from the candy machine but I won't, I don't even know that guy! They tried to tell me he's just a figment of my imagination or a delusion, but what kind of delusion is named Rupert Hapsworthy the Third?


**Thing you've worked on that you're most proud of:** To date I have helped create one style guide and I thoroughly enjoyed the experience, even though I came in after the project was underway. I am looking forward to watching the next project develop from the ground up.


**Other games you currently enjoy playing:** I play **[D&D](/en/articles/archive/event-coverage/2006-champs-limited-2006-06-27-15)** periodically as well as Starfarers of Catan, Balderdash, and on some occasions I've even played **Magic**. I also enjoy creating my own board and card games. 


**Favorite Magic card(s):** The [Chub Toad](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chub+Toad). Out of all **Magic** cards this guy is the coolest, he's just sitting there with his enemy in his mouth. He's like a cross between a Jedi and a â€¦ a big toad.
