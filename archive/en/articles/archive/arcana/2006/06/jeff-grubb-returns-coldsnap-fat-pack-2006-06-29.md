We've already told you that you'll get a copy of Book 1, *The Gathering Dark*, in the [*Coldsnap* Fat Pack](/en/articles/archive/coldsnap-fat-pack-2006-05-22). But what you might not know is that there's a **new original story by Jeff Grubb** included with the *Coldsnap* Player's Guide, inside that very same Fat Pack.


The piece tells the story of the events since *The Shattered Alliance* from the perspective of a certain legendary wizard named Heidar and his mad—but strangely understandable, when you read it in his own words—quest to refreeze the continent of Terisiare. You may have learned something about Heidar in [Matt Cavotta's preview article](/en/articles/archive/i%E2%80%99m-mr-100-below-2006-06-28) yesterday, but you owe it to yourself to pick up a Fat Pack and read Jeff Grubb's treatment of *Coldsnap's* centerpiece villain.
