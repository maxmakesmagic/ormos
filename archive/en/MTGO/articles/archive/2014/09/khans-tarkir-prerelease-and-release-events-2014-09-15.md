*Khans of Tarkir*   

**Prerelease Begins:** 10:00 a.m. Friday, October 3  

All times are Pacific (for UTC, add 7 hours)



Raise Your Banner
Five warrior clans vie for dominance on the field of battle on the plane of Tarkir, where ancient tyrannical dragons have been hunted to extinction.



The time to raise your banner and join the khans is almost here! Will you throw your support behind the scheming Sultai? Perhaps you choose to seek enlightenment with the Jeskai. Maybe you just want to punch bears with the Temur. Whatever your choice, the time to make it draws near. *Khans of Tarkir* Prerelease Events begin 10:00 a.m. Friday, October 3, on *Magic Online*!


The Prerelease will run from 10:00 a.m. Friday, October 3, until Monday, October 6, at 10:00 a.m. We've got a whole host of Prerelease events for players to sink their teeth into *Khans of Tarkir* for the first time. *Magic Online* players will have a chance to see how the set handles in a Draft with the [Prerelease Swiss Draft](#preswissdraft), or choose your clan and pick up the associated "Battle" Prerelease object to compete in two varieties of Prerelease Sealed Events going on throughout the weekend: [Competitive](#precompetitivesealed) and [Friendly](#prefriendlysealed).





Introduced with the *Magic 2015* Prerelease, the Friendly Prerelease Sealed Event allows players to ease into the waters of Tarkir with a leisurely Sealed tournament amongst friends. The Competitive Prerelease Sealed Event is for a fiercer breed of warrior, but rewards those who come out on top with a steeper prize payout.




When you enter one of the Prerelease Sealed Events, you will receive five regular packs of *Khans of Tarkir*, as well as one special seeded booster pack. This seeded booster contains a run of commons and uncommons from the clan corresponding to your selected "Battle" object, as well as one rare or mythic rare that is also associated with your chosen clan. Once you crack them open, the last step is assembling the best deck possible from your available forces. Participation in any Prerelease Event will reward players with a [Sorin, Solemn Visitor avatar](#avatars). Mark your calendars and play in Prerelease weekendâ€”once it's over, Release Events begin!


![](http://www.wizards.com/mtg/images/digital/magiconline/KTK_Object_Spread_v2.png)[Release events](#release) pick up after the Prerelease comes to a close at 10:00 a.m. Monday, October 6, and run until the downtime on Wednesday, October 22. Release Queue events run on demand and will be available for the duration of the Release. Make sure to keep your eye out for the two scheduled Release events, the [64-Player with Top 8 Draft](#64playerdraft) and the [Swiss Sealed with Top 8](#swisssealed) Events, so that you catch them while they're running. Participating in any Release Event will get you the [Sarkhan, the Dragonspeaker avatar](#avatars) for your collection!
