The Vintage Super League is back tonight with Week 2 of the Play-In tournament that will determine the new tenth member of the league.

There was some great *Magic* last week, and we even had a first-turn kill from Reid Duke!

First-turn kills are actually pretty rare in Vintage, though multiple players chose to run variations on the Storm strategy in this tournament, and Eric Froehlich won the Power 9 Challenge over the weekend with a Dark Petition Storm deck fairly similar to the one David Williams is using in this event. Maybe the restriction of Chalice of the Void is going to lead to more first-turn kills...


Tonight marks the second of three weeks for the Play-In tournament. Four players will get eliminated and four will come back for the final week. You can see all the decklists [here](http://magic.wizards.com/en/MTGO/articles/archive/vintage-super-league-play-decklists-2015-11-24).
