Fate Reforged preview season is in full swing. We've already had a week's worth of exciting card unveilings. I had the opportunity to sit down with some of the best players in the game to ask which of the previewed cards they're most excited about! 


"Which of the Fate Reforged previews are you most excited about for Standard?"

***Josh McClain:** "Brutal Warchief seems like a very powerful card in a vacuum that also combines well with a lot of powerful cards we already have in Standard. For example, [Hordeling Outburst](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hordeling+Outburst) curves into it perfectly. It's the type of card that wins the game on its own if it goes unanswered."*

***Sam Pardee:** "Flamewake Phoenix is really exciting. The card combos very nicely with [Butcher of the Horde](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Butcher+of+the+Horde), we'll always have at least one of the abilities for butcher and we won't lose any damage. With Flamewake Phoenix and [Bloodsoaked Champion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodsoaked+Champion) in the format it seems like [Butcher of the Horde](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Butcher+of+the+Horde) will be better than ever."*
