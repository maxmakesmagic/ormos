*Grixis Cube* Ends Tomorrow
---------------------------


The latest cube in the popular Spotlight Series ends tomorrow, September 4. It's Ryan Overturf's ([@RyanOverdrive](https://twitter.com/RyanOverdrive) on Twitter) *Grixis Cube*. Pretend that green and white don't exist for one more day and draft a Cube with deep archetypes and deeper dives into the three (and a half) supported colors! Click [here](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/magic-digital/cube-spotlight-series-grixis-cube-2019-08-13#Cubelist) for a full card list and design article talking about the Cube and the details of its awesomeness.

Modern Cube Starts Tomorrow
---------------------------


The Modern Cube is a great way to try out all the iconic cards and synergies that shape one of *Magic*'s most dynamic formats. Modern Cube can be found in the Limited Leagues section of the Play Lobby and will run through September 26, with the start of *Throne of Eldraine* events. Here are some words from Reggie Valk of *Magic* R&D about this year's Modern Cube:


*"The guiding principle behind this last batch of changes was to introduce relevant cards from the sets that came out since [Modern Cube] was last updated (November 2018), which ended up including RNA, WAR, MH1, and M20. Aside from including a lot of the more obvious inclusions due to iconic status and Modern playability (like Urza, Wrenn and Six, etc.), I also tried to update the Cube to have some cards and strategies that align with popular Modern strategies currently, which is why things like Arclight Phoenix and Duskwatch Recruiter were introduced. I also was cognizant of the amount of planeswalkers in this cube as that has been its largest criticism by far, so despite WAR adding a lot of cool new PWs, the number stayed the same and, if anything, should only go down from here."*
