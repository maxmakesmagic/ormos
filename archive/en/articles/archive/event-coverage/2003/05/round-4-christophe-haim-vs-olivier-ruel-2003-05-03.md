Judging by the way the draft went, this should be a mismatch. "I have one of way of dealing with his Kamahl, [Wrath](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wrath). I have one way of dealing with [Goblin Sharpshooter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Sharpshooter), [Wrath](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wrath)," said Olivier. Christophe also has [Menacing Ogre](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Menacing+Ogre) and [Lavaborn Muse](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lavaborn+Muse). 

### Game 1

![Akroma's Vengeance](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Akroma%27s+Vengeance)Christophe went first but Olivier had all the early plays, busting out a turn one [Wall of Hope](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wall+of+Hope), and second turn [True Believer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=True+Believer). Christophe then played [Timberwatch Elf](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Timberwatch+Elf), presumably another card that Olivier needs [Akroma's Vengeance](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Akroma%27s+Vengeance) to deal with, although at least he could race it in he air.Ruel made [Gustcloak Harrier](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gustcloak+Harrier) and [Dive Bomber](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dive+Bomber), and used his [Wall of Hope](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wall+of+Hope) to gain three life to push the race further in his favor. Christophe dropped [Krosan Vorine](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Krosan+Vorine) to try and stop the aerial beats so Olivier said go holding [Gempalm Avenger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gempalm+Avenger).

Christophe provoked the Believer with his Vorine and revealed his morph to be [Skirk Commando](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skirk+Commando), Ruel used the Avenger to save his [Dive Bomber](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dive+Bomber). Olivier's next attack dropped Christophe to six. He also made a [Swooping Talon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swooping+Talon) so the game looked rather bad for Haim.

Haim summoned [Crested Craghorn](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crested+Craghorn) and killed the [Swooping Talon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swooping+Talon) and [Gustcloak Harrier](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gustcloak+Harrier) with provoke, then used a morphed Patron to kill all of Olivier's remaining creatures and leave him with seven lands in play and one card in hand. Fortunately for Olivier that card in hand was [Akroma, Angel of Wrath](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Akroma%2C+Angel+of+Wrath), and he ripped the land immediately to end the game.

### Game 2

Christophe made turn three and four morphs, which looked like they would be held up by Olivier's 4/4 [Daru Stinger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Daru+Stinger). Haim played [Crested Craghorn](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crested+Craghorn) and attacked for another four. Ruel cast [Windborn Muse](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Windborn+Muse) and then [Gempalm Avenger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gempalm+Avenger) and [Crowd Favorites](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crowd+Favorites), which certainly managed to stop the attacks for a while.

![Treespring Lorian](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Treespring+Lorian)Haim unmorphed [Treespring Lorian](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treespring+Lorian) and attacked again while Olivier was tapped out. Ruel opted no to block as he didn't want to lose the Favorites. Ruel dropped his eighth land into play with a flourish, but he didn't have Akroma this game. Instead he played [Gustcloak Skirmisher](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gustcloak+Skirmisher) and used the other four mana to tap [Treespring Lorian](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treespring+Lorian). Haim swung instead with [Blade Sliver](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blade+Sliver) and his morph. This created problems for Olivier because of the Sharpshooter, but of course he had to block. With three creatures dying Haim got to knock Olivier down to four with the Sharpshooter. Ruel therefore had to keep mana open for his [Crowd Favorites](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crowd+Favorites) every turn.Ruel attacked with [Crowd Favorites](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crowd+Favorites), the Muse, and the [Gempalm Avenger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gempalm+Avenger) putting Haim on seven. He used the Favorites to tap both potential attackers, meaning that Christophe had to have two blockers to survive. Luckily he drew [Lavaborn Muse](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lavaborn+Muse) as his hand at that point had been [Crested Craghorn](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crested+Craghorn) and a morph.

This changed the game around in one turn, as now Oliver couldn't kill Haim, and had nowhere near enough mana to stop him attacking with two suicidal creatures that would allow the Sharpshooter to kill Olivier. He drew a card that wasn't [Akroma, Angel of Wrath](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Akroma%2C+Angel+of+Wrath), and conceded.

### Game 3

Olivier kept a very shady hand of five [Plains](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plains), [Secluded Steppe](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Secluded+Steppe), [Daru Healer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Daru+Healer), while Haim had to mulligan his draw. His six card hand was significantly better, with a turn two [Wellwisher](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wellwisher) and turn three [Timberwatch Elf](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Timberwatch+Elf). That was all the land he had though, and so he couldn't take full advantage. Olivier stopped him attacking with a [Windborn Muse](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Windborn+Muse), and then Haim had to sit there as he could only play morphs, and Ruel got to eight mana and dropped [Akroma, Angel of Wrath](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Akroma%2C+Angel+of+Wrath) again. All the morphs in the World would have been unable to help Christophe at that point, unless three of them were [Exalted Angel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Exalted+Angel)s. This wasn't the case.

**Final Result:** Olivier Ruel defeats Christophe Haim 2-1
