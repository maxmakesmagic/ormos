![Dementia Summoner art (click to enlarge)](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/mtgcom/arcana/DementiaSummoner_tiny.jpg) The *Odyssey* and *Torment* stories (and the card sets) revolve heavily around people called Dementia Summoners, which are mages employed by the Cabal to create fierce creatures for their pit fights. But there is no card called "Dementia Summoner," so where are they in the game?


Take a look at the Dementia Summoner reference from our internal styleguide. It shows all the planning and detail that went into these charactersâ€¦ and it should help you recognize them in the card art. Aside from the obvious (like [Braids, Cabal Minion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Braids%2C+Cabal+Minion)), Dementia Summoners appear quite often, such as on the *Odyssey* cards Painbringer and Sadistic Hypnotist.
