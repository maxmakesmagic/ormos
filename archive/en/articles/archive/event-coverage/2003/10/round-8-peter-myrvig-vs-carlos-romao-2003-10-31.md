![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/ptno03/a919.jpg)Both of these players came into this round at 4-3; the winner plays tomorrow, and the loser will have plenty of time to see New Orleans. 

### Game 1

Romao's first turn [Grim Monolith](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grim+Monolith) was countered with [Force Spike](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Force+Spike), and [Metalworker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Metalworker) was [Smother](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Smother)ed. Even a second Monolith was countered with [Mana Leak](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak), as all of Romao's attempts at early mana acceleration were thwarted. [Chalice of the Void](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chalice+of+the+Void) was [Counterspell](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterspell)ed, and it seemed that [Grim Monolith](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grim+Monolith) and [Voltaic Key](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Voltaic+Key) could help [Myr Incubator](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Myr+Incubator) resolve, but Myrvig responded with [Cunning Wish](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cunning+Wish) and added [Annul](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Annul) to the stack to counter it.

A turn later, [Tinker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tinker) got [Mindslaver](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mindslaver) into play, and Myrvig cast [Intuition](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Intuition) to get three [Accumulated Knowledge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Accumulated+Knowledge) and gain massive card advantage. [Brainstorm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brainstorm) helped protect Myrvig's most important cards from the [Mindslaver](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mindslaver), which didn't let Romao do much since he only had two [Smother](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Smother)s and a [Force Spike](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Force+Spike) to work with. The best Romao could do was play and activate [Polluted Delta](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Polluted+Delta) to deal a point of damage and shuffle back the top cards if they were important. As an added bonus, Myrvig took a point of damage, and Romao chose not to search out a land. The relevant part of all this was that it left Myrvig tapped out, which allowed [Upheaval](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Upheaval) to resolve with two colorless floating. [Metalworker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Metalworker) along with an island came back down, putting Romao far ahead in resources.

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/ptno03/a917.jpg)Still, Romao was lacking threats, and couldn't capitalize on the reset button. [Tangle Wire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tangle+Wire) slowed things down a bit, but he would need to draw a threat right away before Myrvig had access to his mana and could use countermagic. [Cunning Wish](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cunning+Wish) searched up [Corpse Dance](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Corpse+Dance), and with a previously discarded [Psychatog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psychatog) in the graveyard along with plenty of cards to fuel it, the spell was looking very threatening. Romao played a [Stroke of Genius](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stroke+of+Genius) to draw two cards on end step, leaving one mana floating to play around [Force Spike](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Force+Spike) since Myrvig only had one land untapped. He took his turn, and his only out was [Upheaval](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Upheaval), which left him with no mana untapped. Sure enough, Myrvig had the [Force Spike](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Force+Spike) to counter it, took his turn, and cast [Corpse Dance](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Corpse+Dance) on the [Psychatog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psychatog) to win the first game.

Myrvig- 1 Romao- 0

### Game 2

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/ptno03/a918.jpg)Romao opened with [Chalice of the Void](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chalice+of+the+Void) set to one, and on the following turn played another Chalice set to two, which Myrvig had a [Counterspell](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterspell) for. [Thran Dynamo](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thran+Dynamo) resolved, and on end step Myrvig cast [Intuition](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Intuition) to get three [Accumulated Knowledge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Accumulated+Knowledge). He then untapped and played [Psychatog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psychatog), missing his fourth land drop. With Myrvig tapped out, Romao was given the perfect opportunity to play [Clockwork Dragon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Clockwork+Dragon) and have it resolve. Myrvig drew some more cards with his Knowledge, and the [Psychatog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psychatog) attacked and killed the Dragon in combat, surviving as a 6/7. Soon after, Myrvig played the fourth [Accumulated Knowledge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Accumulated+Knowledge), which was enough for Romao to concede.

**Final Resut:** Myrvig- 2 Romao- 0
