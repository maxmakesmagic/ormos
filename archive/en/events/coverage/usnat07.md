2007 US NATIONAL CHAMPIONSHIP
-----------------------------


Cheon Conquers All at U.S. Nationals
====================================




July 27-28











![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/usnat06/banner.jpg)If you're searching for cutting-edge **Magic**, the U.S. National Team is the place to look. U.S. National Champion Paul Cheon headlines a three-man national team on the vanguard of the game, both in the U.S. and the online community. Joining him on the team are Ben Lundquist and Luis Scott-Vargas, with Ben Zoz as the alternate.


NATIONALS COVERAGE

* [U.S. Nationals](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgevent/usnat06/welcome)
* [England Nationals](/en/events/coverage/final-champion-crowned)
* [Italy Nationals](/en/node/575686)

Cheon's deck of choice, the blue-white-black reanimator concoction known to some as Solar Flare, certainly reinforced its impact on the Standard game. Rocking Australian Nationals the previous weekend, it put three players into the Top 4 here in Atlanta. Cheon outdueled Lundquist's blue-red 'Tron in five games, with Luis Scott-Vargas and Ben Zoz battling in the mirror match in the third-fourth matchup. Scott-Vargas took the spot on the team in five tight matches.


The national team has special significance to Cheon and Scott-Vargas, friends and playtest partners from California. Cheon, from Los Angeles, qualified via Regionals and his Oakland buddy Scott-Vargas came along thanks to his standing in the Pro Players Club. Expect more than a few late nights of preparation in California heading toward the 2006 World Championships in Paris. Unfortunately for their third teammate, Lundquist lives roughly 3,000 miles away in Gloversville, New York. But since all these guys live on **Magic**  *Online* 24/7, that gap should be made up in no time.


As Sunday started, much of the Top 8 field was made up of what seemed like unknown players. However, as soon as spectators around the feature match pit heard what many of these players' **Magic**  *Online* screen names were, a sudden rise in respect followed. These were those guys taking on all comers in premier online events, and this weekend proved that skill translated to the pressure-packed stage of Sunday **Magic**. Not only were these the players regularly ripping it up online, but they came using some of the freshest online deck tech as well.


Over at the JSS Championships, Arthur Stewart and his [Magnivore](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Magnivore) deck defeated Blaine Hatab's Heartbeat creation. Interestingly enough, both players chose their decks for their matchup strength against Solar Flare, which featured so heavily in the main event.


Congratulations to all the winners at the 2006 Magic Weekend!
