The Kamigawa block is suffused with setting, story, and flavor - and Magic Arcana will be one key way to discover the world behind the cards. Watch this space for behind-the-scenes concept art, rich storyline info, a glossary of Japanese terms relevant to Kamigawa, a look behind the flavor text of Kamigawa block, and more. 

Today we focus on a single man whose destiny was central to the set's main tale. Rei Nakazawa's [feature article this week](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/feature/227) previews **Konda, Lord of Eiganjo**, the card representing the patriarch of a powerful ruling family in the world of Kamigawa. Haven't read Rei's article yet? [Go read it!](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/feature/227)

| Lord Konda was a *daimyo* - a feudal lord and landowner who commanded a host of samurai soldiers. He ruled from Eiganjo Castle - hence "Konda, Lord of Eiganjo." 
 To the left you can see a concept sketch for Konda by Ittoku, an artist responsible for a lot of the look of the Kamigawa block. Ittoku is the illustrator of [Rude Awakening](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rude+Awakening), [Arcbound Fiend](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arcbound+Fiend) and a few other cards in *Mirrodin* block.  |

Below you can see a concept illustration of Eiganjo Castle and its surrounding lands: the purview of Lord Konda.
