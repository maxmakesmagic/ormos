The *Magic Online* community is abuzz with the arrival of the newly redesigned [Legacy Cube](http://magic.wizards.com/en/MTGO/articles/archive/new-magic-online-legacy-cube-2014-11-3) and the Vintage Super League season is still going strong. Are you anxiously waiting for Legacy Cube events to begin? Don't have enough Vintage in your life? We've got you covered there. For three days straight, November 11, 12, and 13, you'll be able to find streamers broadcasting their Vintage and Legacy Cube experience. Read on to see all the ways you can experience *Magic Online* vicariously, via streaming!


The block of streaming events begins on Tuesday, November 11, with another edition of the Vintage Super League. The Vintage Super League features ten *Magic* celebrities playing *Magic*’s oldest and wildest format. It has been running on Tuesday nights for three months, and the playoffs have now begun. This week features a semi-final match between Hall of Famer Luis Scott-Vargas and Platinum Pro Eric Froehlich, with Vintage specialist Stephen Menendian waiting for the winner in the finals. The show airs live every Tuesday at 7:00 p.m. Pacific (UTC-8), but you can also catch up on previous action on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/user/randybuehler/playlists) or read about the league on [VintageSuperLeague.com](http://vintagesuperleague.com/).



Tune into Vintage Super League on Tuesday, November 11, for an announcement regarding upcoming *Magic Online* events!



On Wednesday, November 12, we switch gears away from Vintage and give *Magic Online* players an early peek at the Legacy Cube! To explore what the Legacy Cube has to offer, and to give players insight into how the Cube plays, popular *Magic Online* streamers and Wizards of the Coast employees will compete in two special 8-player Swiss Draft events. These events will run on each streamer's Twitch channel on Wednesday, November 12, and Thursday, November 13, at 5:30 p.m. Pacific (UTC-8). Check out the table below for the list of competitors and links to where you can watch their Twitch channels!
