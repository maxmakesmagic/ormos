Earlier this morning, we asked the Twitterverse for interesting questions to be answered by the pros here at Grand Prix Paris. We selected the following one, which ties in to the recent popularity and success of [Deathmist Raptor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deathmist+Raptor) and [Den Protector](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Den+Protector).

**Platinum level pro Martin Jůza:** It's definitely the most-played color right now, and it has access to many good cards. But in a vacuum, [Dig Through Time](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dig+Through+Time) and [Elspeth, Sun's Champion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elspeth%2C+Sun%27s+Champion) are still more powerful than any of the green cards. It also changes from week to week.

**Two-time Pro Tour Top 8 competitor Lukas Blohon:** Yes.

**Pro Tour *Gatecrash* finalist Joel Larsson:** Yes. Eighty percent of the decks play green. Even Mono-Red splashes green!

**2010 Dutch National Champion Bas Melis:** No. The Esper colors are the best.

**Grand Prix Kraków 2015 finalist Robin Dolar:** Yes. [Den Protector](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Den+Protector) is super good and it goes into four tier-one decks.

**Gold level pro Fabrizio Anteri:** Yes, by a mile. It has the tools to beat both blue and red decks.
