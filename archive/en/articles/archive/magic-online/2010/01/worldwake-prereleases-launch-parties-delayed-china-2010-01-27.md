Due to a massive iceberg off the northeastern coast of China, the vessel carrying *Worldwake*  product will not reach China in time for this week's Prerelease events and next week's Launch Parties.


The [Prereleases](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/TCG/Events.aspx?x=mtgcom/events/prerelease-facts) in China have been rescheduled for February 6-7 and [Launch Parties](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/TCG/Events.aspx?x=mtgcom/events/release-facts) will be held February 16-17. 


Wizards of the Coast apologizes for the inconvenience.
