Ongoing global supply issues have resulted in a delay for a portion of English-language *Double Masters 2022* Collector Boosters.


A portion of English-language *Double Masters 2022* Collector Boosters will be delayed in North America for approximately 1â€“2 weeks after set release due to ongoing production challenges.


As a result of this delay, English-language Collector Boosters may have limited availability at set release.


Thank you for your understanding as we work to supply fans and stores as soon as possible.
