Since*Lorwyn* is about to be released, it's time for another round of updates to the Comprehensive Rules and the Oracle card reference. This one is kind of a doozy, since over 1200 cards got errata.

That's not a typo.

Well, it's a typo if it doesn't say "over 1200 cards" for some reason. That's because it's supposed to say *"over 1200 cards."*

In case you're wondering whether I've finally gone crazy (sadly, you're off by a decade or two), the following table of contents should clear things up.

This document is divided into three sections, hyperlinked for your convenience.

* [**Comprehensive Rules Changes**](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/feature/424a1)
* [**Normal Oracle Changes**](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/feature/424a2). This covers 48 cards, only 11 of which have functional changes.
* [**The Grand Creature Type Update**](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/feature/424a3). The big one, covering 1197 cards! Some of you will approve, others won't. But it had to happen.
