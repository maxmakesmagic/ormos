Grand Prix–Nashville will not only let you have rich experiences playing **Magic**, but it will totally immerse you in one of the most unique and historic cities in the South.

Visit [www.tnlg.net](http://www.tnlg.net/) for more information about the public events schedule as well as the latest announcements about the event. Don’t miss the Grand Prix event of the year.


*The **Magic: The Gathering**  Grand Prix tournament series is a great reason to get out of the house, catch up with old friends, meet some new ones, and play **Magic**. Grand Prix tournaments are world-wide open events that allow all **Magic**  players to participate and experience the thrill of a large-scale competition. In addition to $30,000 in cash prizes, Pro Tour invitations for the top 16 finishers, and exclusive foil promo cards for participants, Grand Prix feature a host of other activities, including public events and artist signings (prizes subject to change).
