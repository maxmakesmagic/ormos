Kithkin children remember stories from *The Book of Kith and Kin* as some of their earliest memories, and kithkin elders quote it to their dying day. *The Book of Kith and Kin* is a sort of kithkin almanac that collects together bits of wisdom, short tales, legends, practical advice, aphorisms, and superstitions written for kithkin, about kithkin, and by kithkin. Luckily for you, Planeswalker, a copy of this book has surfaced at a bazaar on Kephalai, giving you the chance to flip to a random page and read what's written there.
