Flavor is a powerful factor in the design of **Magic** -- in the Kamigawa block in particular. The original concept behind *Betrayers'* 
**[Indebted Samurai](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Indebted+Samurai)** is a lone samurai becoming consumed with vengeful ire at the death of his samurai comrades (in the background of the [art](#art) you can see a pile of fallen samurai).  During *Betrayers* development, a change was proposed to the card's mechanic, so that it would get a +1/+1 counter when another samurai came into play, instead of when one went to the graveyard. However, since that would have interfered with the flavor of the vengeful samurai, the card was printed as originally concepted.
