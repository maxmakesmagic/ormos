Proteus Inc., one of the leading wireless services and applications companies, is working with Wizards of the Coast to offer **Magic: The Gathering** wallpaper for your cell phone! 


The wallpapers are available now for download [via their e-store](http://magic.ecms.proteus.com) and cost $1.99. Carriers include AT&T Wireless, Cingular Wireless, Sprint PCS, and Verizon and their website has a list of supported cell phone models and manufacturers.


Right now, there are 28 Wallpapers available in four categories: New **Magic** Art (from *Ravnica: City of Guilds*), Kamigawa Block Art, Iconic Cards, and Core Set Favorites. But stay alert, because not only will we be adding more and more cards (including classic cards and *Guildpact* images -- before the set is even released!), we're constantly adding more and more cool features.
