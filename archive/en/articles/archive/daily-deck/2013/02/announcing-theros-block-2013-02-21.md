PAX East was this past weekend and during our **Magic** panel we announced this September's new set: *Theros*. But not only did we announce Theros, we also announced the two other sets in the *Theros* block: the February, 2014, set which was code-named "Romans," is called *Born of the Gods* and the May, 2014, set, code-named "Countrymen," is called *Journey into Nyx*.

Now let's talk about just the details for this fall's set:
