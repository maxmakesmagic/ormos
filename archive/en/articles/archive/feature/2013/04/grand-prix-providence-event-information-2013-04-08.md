![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/promo/grandprix_2013.jpg)*Get your promo card by playing in the Grand Prix (while supplies last).* Welcome to Providence, Rhode Island and the first three-person team Grand Prix in the eastern United States in nearly a decade! Get together with your friends and see if you have what it takes to be a Grand Prix team champion. 


 Providence combines the accessibility and friendliness of a small town with the culture and sophistication of a big city. Providence is the capital and most populous city in Rhode Island and was one of the first cities established in the United States. With a thriving arts community, vibrant and diverse neighborhoods, outstanding hotels, a renowned restaurant scene (Travel + Leisure readers voted Providence one of America's Favorite Cities, ranking the city #2 in the U.S. for food) and so many things to do, Providence is the perfect place to visit. The city's compact size and convenient location make it easy to get to and hard to forget. 


 Grand Prix Providence is open to the public and all players are invited to come and participate. Grand Prix Providence is a two-day event featuring *Return to Ravnica* Block Team Sealed Deck on Saturday and *Return to Ravnica* Block Team Draft on Sunday. In addition to the main event, the Grand Prix weekend offers one of the largest schedules of public events ever brought to a Grand Prix — including an opportunity to win a VIP trip to Seattle in January 2014! Public Events and Last-Chance Grand Prix Trials start Friday, June 7 at noon. Visit [www.professional-events.com](http://www.professional-events.com/Magic/GrandPrix/Providence2013/) for more details about public events. 


Can you tame the three-headed beast at Grand Prix Providence? If you didn't already have enough reasons to attend Grand Prix Providence just to play the amazing Team Sealed Deck format, the first 250 teams that register on-site Friday will receive exclusive playmats by Steve Prescott. For those players who have attended Grand Prix Atlantic City and Pittsburgh, you'll recognize the seasonal pattern continuing with the "Summer" theme to this playmat!

* Saturday, June 8: Grand Prix Providence begins at 9 a.m.
* Sunday, June 9: Day Two begins at 9 a.m.


**Sleep-In Special**


 Does your team have some byes and don't want to get up to register your deck at 9 a.m.? If you have byes and register any time before 10 p.m. on Friday, you are eligible for the "Sleep-In Special". An additional charge of $45 for your team buys you more sleep and a pre-registered deck. 


 You may ONLY skip the player meeting and deck registration/construction if you paid for the Sleep-In Special.   
  
 Cost of the Sleep-In Special is $45 USD per team regardless of number of byes. 


 Additionally, teams that pay for the Sleep-In Special receive additional benefits as outlined on the Professional Event Services [Grand Prix Providence website](http://www.professional-events.com/Magic/GrandPrix/Providence2013/). 


 Once you have paid for the Sleep-In Special, a sealed deck card pool will also be registered and verified on your behalf. Instead of arriving at 9 a.m. for the player meeting, you will check in prior to your first round of play and receive a preregistered pool. Preregistered decks are chosen at random for each team from the selection of preregistered decks. From the point when you get the pool, you will have 60 minutes to construct your decks and turn in your decklists. You begin play for the proper round after your byes and continue as normal. 


You will need to report a minimum of 30 minutes PRIOR to the start of your first round of play. The estimated round start times for Saturday are 11:30 a.m. (Round 1) and 12:30 p.m. (Round 2).


 Check the Professional Event Services [Grand Prix Providence website](http://www.professional-events.com/Magic/GrandPrix/Providence2013/) for more details about the Sleep-In Special and how to register for the Sleep-In Special if you can't make it on-site until Saturday. 


 The main tournament at Grand Prix Providence is open to **Magic** players of all ages. 


 Players must have a signed publicity release form to be included in Wizards of the Coast's official online event coverage. Forms can be downloaded [here](http://www.wizards.com/dci/downloads/publicityrelease_grandprix_2011.pdf) (15k PDF) and will be available onsite. Minors must have a parent or guardian’s signature on this form. Publicity releases will be collected during registration.
