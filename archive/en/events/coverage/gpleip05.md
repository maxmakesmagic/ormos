GRAND PRIX LEIPZIG 2005
-----------------------


Rustam Leaves Leipzig in Ruins!
===============================




March 25-27











![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gpleip05/win.jpg)Rustam Bakirov is the winner of Grand Prix Leipzig and becomes the first Russian player to win a Grand Prix!


As it's the holiday weekend, Leipzig wasn't quite the monster anticipated although the turnout was still a hefty 900 players. On Day One, the field was split into a more manageable two tournaments and we got an early finish for a change. The few big-name players that made the trip had a fairly rocky time of it although most of them still managed reasonable finishes.


After six rounds of Booster Draft we were left with a fairly inexperienced Top 8, with only three previous Grand PrixTop 8 appearances between them (and included two amateurs). The biggest name, Bernado Da Costa Cabral, fell in the quarters as his green-black deck featuring Kokusho did not hold up against Niki Jedlicka's snake family special. But the day belonged to Rustam Bakirov and a red-blue deck that contained [Kumano, Master Yamabushi](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kumano%2C+Master+Yamabushi) and an amazing four copies of [Yamabushi's Flame](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Yamabushi%27s+Flame).


Rosario Maij faced off against Bakirov in the finals with a solid black-white deck. The first game was a virtual non-event as the German player mulliganed to four. It looked like Bakirov would roll him in the second game before Maij pulled off a stunning ambush with [Call to Glory](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Call+to+Glory) to turn the game right around. He simply had no chance in the third game though, as Bakirov pulled off a perfect curve from turn one before dropping Kumano on turn five.


Congratulations to Rustam Bakirov!

Sunday, March 27: 7:13 pm - A (Very) Brief Who's Who of the Top 8
-----------------------------------------------------------------


The top 8 of Grand Prix Leipzig has been decided. It features players of five nationalities and two amateurs.


Perhaps the most well known is the Belgian player Bernardo Da Costa Cabral. Da Costa Cabral has the best previous finish as he made the final of Grand Prix Madrid 2004, losing to Kai Budde in the final. Da Costa Cabral was recently seen in action on a team with Kai at PT Atlanta although it was not a successful tournament for them.


Niki Jedlicka, from Austria, has a quarter-final appearance from Grand Prix Birmingham 2004, where he lost to his older brother and eventual tournament winner Stefan Jedlicka.


Level two judge Rustam Bakirov proves wrong the old adage that judges can't play. This isn't new territory for him as he made the quarter-finals of GP Moscow back in 2001.


The remainder of the top 8 are unfamiliar names to me. Mateusz Dabkowski is from Poland. Sune Ellegaard is one of two amateurs in the top 8 and hails from Denmark.


The other amateur is Philip Fetzer, one of three German players in the top 8. He had a blazing run with a perfect record that was only broken in round 13 by Bakirov. The other two German players are Maximilian Bracht and Rosario Maij.
