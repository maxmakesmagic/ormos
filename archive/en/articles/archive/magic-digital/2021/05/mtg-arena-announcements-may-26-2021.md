*Jumpstart* Your June and July!
===============================


*Jumpstart* is returning to *MTG Arena* June 4 through July 8! It will be the same *Jumpstart* you loved before: [the same themed 20-card packets](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/feature/jumpstart-decklists-2020-06-18), with [the same card swaps](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/news/jumpstart-cards-being-replaced-mtg-arena-2020-06-17) made for the previous *MTG Arena* release.


*Jumpstart* mashes together themes from throughout the history of *Magic* and lets you skip the deck-building part. You pick one packet from a set of three themed 20-card packets, and then pick a second packet from a different set of three. Your two chosen packets are shuffled together to create a 40-card deck you can start playing with right away!


Cards in each packet you select become part of your collection. Plus, each packet contains a basic land card with art that is exclusive to *Jumpstart*—you can only get these in *Jumpstart*!


**Dates**: June 4–July 8, 2021


**Entry**: 2,000 gold or 400 gems


**Rewards**: After the first two wins per entry, a random rare or mythic rare individual card reward is granted when resigning.


**Event Record**: Play as much as you like! Resign when you want.


After resigning, you may pay the entry again to rejoin and select packets!
