**MTGO.com Article Schedule Changes**


This week marks the beginning of some article schedule changes for both [DailyMTG](http://magic.wizards.com/en/content/articles) and [MTGO.com](http://magic.wizards.com/en/content/magic-online-products-game-info). Instead of posting articles on Monday like we've done in the past, articles that explore all ways to play *Magic* digitally, including *Magic Online*, will be posting to DailyMTG every Wednesday morning!


MTGO.com will still be the home of the Weekly Announcements and the Bug Blog, so keep checking in to read those. Plus, all *Magic Online* articles that post to DailyMTG will also be posted to MTGO.com, so there's no need to change up your routine if you're used to heading directly to *Magic Online*'s home page for news and updates.


Stop by this Wednesday for details about *Magic Online Oath of the Gatewatch* Prerelease and Release Events!

**December MOPR Promo Error and Resolution**


When the December MOPR promos were granted on January 6, players who are qualified to receive the promo may have noticed that the [Accumulated Knowledge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Accumulated+Knowledge) that was added to their accounts is not the version advertised in the original December [MOPR card announcement](http://magic.wizards.com/en/MTGO/articles/archive/magic-online/magic-online-announcements-november-17-2015), but uses the *Nemesis* art shown below.


![](https://media.wizards.com/2015/mtgo/card_promo_MOPR_accumulated_knowledge.png)
The above promo was mistakenly flagged for the December MOPR grant and was the version that players received during the January 6 downtime. Unfortunately, due to testing and quality assurance schedules, the advertised version will not be prepared for a promo grant until January 27. We apologize for this inconvenience and are granting qualified players both versions of the promo. The version shown above was granted on Wednesday, January 6, and the previously advertised version will be granted on Wednesday, January 27. Thank you for your understanding and sorry for the confusion!

The *Magic Online* promo being granted on January 27 uses the same art as the above card, but will have the *Magic Online* expansion symbol and a *Magic Online* frame.

**Build Notes**


**General**


* Leagues | Improvements have been made to the matchmaking algorithm that should reduce the number of times players with very different match records will be paired against one another.
* Collection | If a player’s computer enters sleep or hibernation while editing a deck, any changes made will now be saved automatically.
* Collection | If a player drags a card from the rightmost column to create a new column, the new column will now be created regardless of where the card is dropped.
* General | If a player selects a group of cards and drags them to a different pane (for example, moving cards from the sideboard to the main deck), the grouping selection is no longer incorrectly removed.
