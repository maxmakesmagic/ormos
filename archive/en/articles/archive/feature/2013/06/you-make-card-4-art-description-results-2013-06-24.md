### [Waste Not]



> 
> Color: Black Spell  
> 
> Location: A nasty trash heap outside a small settlement  
> 
> Action: We see a RAG MAN, a hunched and withered humanoid figure who appears to be held together by frayed ropes and worn leather straps. The being is standing triumphantly atop a heap of bones, broken armor and weapons, and other less identifiable trash. It is holding up a skull in one hand; the other hand clutches a filthy sack that is bulging with "treasures." A glow of purplish power surrounds the Rag Man and the skull.  
> 
> Focus: The glowing figure.  
> 
> Mood: Creepy yet eco-friendly.

Now, while R&D continues to test and tweak the card, **Magic** art director Jeremy Jarvis will be commissioning a series of sketches from an artist of his choice. The next poll will either be on a series of tweaks from R&D after playtesting, or for you all to choose which sketch you prefer from the artist Jeremy has chosen.


Either way, we'll be back in the coming weeks!
