At Gamescom today we were excited to announce that we'll be bringing *MTG Arena* to millions more players around the world. And that all starts with Epic. This winter we'll be partnering with Epic to bring *MTG Arena* to the Epic Games Store on PC, and shortly after we'll be introducing a Mac version. We'll have more info on both as we get closer to the release dates.


**What does this mean for existing players?**


Nothing changes for anyone currently playing *Magic: The Gathering Arena*. When *MTG Arena* launches on the Epic Games Store, it will continue to be available for direct download from [MTGArena.com](https://magic.wizards.com/en/mtgarena). Existing players on the Wizards platform will not be required to create Epic accounts.


**Will *MTG Arena* be exclusive to Epic Games on PC?**


We are thrilled to be partnering with Epic to expand *Magic*'s reach to new gamers from around the world. The Epic Games Store will be our exclusive third-party PC download partner (*you will still be able to directly download the game from MTGArena.com*).


**Can friends play together if they download via the Epic Games Store or directly through the *MTG Arena* site?**


Yes, you will be able to play with one another regardless of where you downloaded the game.


**What about other platforms?**


The plan has always been to bring *MTG Arena* to millions of players around the world. Currently, we're fine-tuning the game during its Open Beta on PC, but bringing the game to the Epic Games Store will be a great first step in taking *Magic* to new places.


After our launch on Epic, we will follow shortly after with a release for Mac.


In the meantime, if you haven't yet tried *MTG Arena*, now is a great time to get started. Simply visit [MTGArena.com](https://magic.wizards.com/en/mtgarena) to learn more and download the best way to play digital *Magic*.
