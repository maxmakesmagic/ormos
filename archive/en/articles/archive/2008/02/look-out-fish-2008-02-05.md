Here at Magic Arcana, we have a lot of different missions. Sometimes we want to show you a preview of an upcoming product. Other times, we're giving you a deeper look at the world of **Magic**. There are even times when we announce a contest.


Today, though, things are simpler. There are times when you just want to look at a kithkin getting hit by a brick tied to a fish.

Here's the direction the artist was given:



> Action: Show a closeup of a kithkin's face at the moment he's hit hard in the back of the head by a stinky fish tied to a brick or rock (thrown by an out-of-frame boggart). The kithkin's eyes are just starting to flutter -- he's going to get knocked unconscious.


And here, for no reason other than the amusement of the Magic Arcana staff, is a close-up of the fish:

Wham! Man, that's fun.
