**The Players**


Ken Yukuhiro spent 2013 becoming the Next Big Thing in Japanese **Magic**, demonstrating that his Top 4 finish at Pro Tour *Avacyn Restored* was no fluke. He's put up a number of Grand Prix Top 8's, but has yet to claim the trophy. He's hoping this weekend will change that.


Jun'ichi Endo is an amateur hunting for a breakout performance. He's been making the rounds of the Japanese GPs, but hasn't been able to convert a Day 2 appearance into something more.


**The Decks**


Yukuhiro has brought a slow, defensive-minded Green-White-Red deck with cards all over the power spectrum. [Astral Cornucopia](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Astral+Cornucopia) and [Traveler's Amulet](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Traveler%27s+Amulet) help with the mana as he works towards a big monster.


Endo is with a faster Red-White deck, hoping to steal games with speed backed by a couple powerful finishers in the form of [Ornitharch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ornitharch) and [Hammer of Purphoros](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hammer+of+Purphoros).


**The Games**


It was all haymakers all the time in this match. Game one saw Yukuhiro build a 5/5 [Observant Alseid](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Observant+Alseid) with [Ordeal of Nylea](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ordeal+of+Nylea) and then use the extra lands to threaten monstrous with [Nessian Asp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nessian+Asp). Endo's ragtag collection of beaters held out as long as they could, but were overpowered.

**Yukuhiro 1 - Endo 0**


Both players went to their sideboards. Endo, considering the way the first game had gone, swapped out a [Pillar of War](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pillar+of+War) for a splashed [Sudden Storm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sudden+Storm). Yukuhiro decided to go even more defensive and sought help from the [Guardians of Meletis](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Guardians+of+Meletis). It all came into play as Endo's slow start turned into a [Cyclops of One-Eyed Pass](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cyclops+of+One-Eyed+Pass) with [Observant Alseid](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Observant+Alseid) on it, too big for Yukuhiro to stop with the Guardians. He decided to risk falling to six, and was surprised by the [Sudden Storm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sudden+Storm) cast off [Temple of Enlightenment](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Temple+of+Enlightenment).


**Yukuhiro 1 - Endo 1**


Endo matched answers to Yukuhiro's early threats. They hit the midgame on a nearly empty board, and Endo started working towards ruling the skies with [Wingsteed Rider](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wingsteed+Rider) and [Ornitharch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ornitharch). Yukuhiro had a [Vulpine Goliath](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vulpine+Goliath), and tapped five for a backbreaking [Hunter's Prowess](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hunter%27s+Prowess). Endo, ever the gentleman, let Yukuhiro draw the full nine, and conceded on the following turn.
