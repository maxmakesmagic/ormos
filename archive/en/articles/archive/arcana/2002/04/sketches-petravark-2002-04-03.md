Today's card is Wayne England's [Petravark](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Petravark), a type of land destruction card in its own right. Wayne has been illustrating **Magic** cards since *Prophecy*.

### 1. Art Description

The card was known in playtesting as "Mini Dementia Firebeast." These are the instructions given to the artist:

"This is a dementia creature (See style guide for reference). It should be shown as red, not black, and as causing the land to shake."

### 2. Sketch

This is the preliminary rough sketch submitted by Wayne.

### 3. Final Art

Here is a large version of his final painting.

### 4. Card

Finally, here is the card as you all know it today. The art was flipped horizontally because the [Petravark](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Petravark) looked too much like one of Wayne's other red creatures -- [Ember Beast](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ember+Beast) -- from across the table.
