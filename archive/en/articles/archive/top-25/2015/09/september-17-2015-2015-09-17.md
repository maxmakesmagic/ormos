Welcome to our weekly look at the *Magic* Top 25 Pro Rankings. There were Grand Prix in both Europe and North America last weekend, so let's see what impact they had on the standings. First, the simple: Only three members of our Top 25 came to Grand Prix Madrid, and of those three neither Joel Larsson nor Ondřej Stráský could make it out of Sealed Deck play on Day One. No points for them, and both slide down one slot on the table as a result. Antonio Del Moral León, however, had an excellent weekend, reaching the Top 8 and climbing three places to No. 16.


Grand Prix Oklahoma City, meanwhile, did plenty to shake up the rankings. Let's begin with two players who ended up exactly where they started. Eric Froehlich maintains his No. 1 ranking, thanks to a 43rd-place finish in Oklahoma City that netted him one point. That was enough to keep Seth Manfield at bay, who made it as far as Day Two but couldn't convert that into Pro Points on Sunday. The two major successes came from Brad Nelson and Steve Rubin. Both recent World Championship competitors, they fell just short of the Top 8 in Oklahoma City. Nonetheless, Nelson rose three spots to No. 8, and Rubin—the biggest mover of the week—is up four to No. 13.


In terms of results, it was Paul Rietzl who had the best performance at Oklahoma City. He added another Grand Prix Top 8 to his Hall of Fame career, which widened the gap between himself and Sam Black but left Rietzl still sitting at No. 4.


The rankings are due to go quiet for a few weeks now, since we're approaching the Prerelease for *Battle for Zendikar*. But the preparations will begin in earnest after that, as we build towards the Pro Tour in Milwaukee. Join us again next week for all the latest from the *Magic* Top 25 Pro Rankings.
