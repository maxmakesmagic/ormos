![Symbol of Phyrexia](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/global/images/mtgcom_arcana_503_pic1_en.jpg)In the distant past ([2004](/en/articles/archive/symbol-phyrexia-2004-02-16) and [2005](/en/articles/archive/yawgmoths-demon-2005-07-26), anyway), we showed the Symbol of Phyrexia and where it appeared on [Order of Yawgmoth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Order+of+Yawgmoth), the *Seventh Edition* [Yawgmoths Edict](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Yawgmoths%2BEdict), and the *Ninth Edition* [Yawgmoths Demon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Yawgmoths%2BDemon).


And since that symbol has [shown up again](/en/articles/archive/announcing-duel-decks-phyrexia-vs-coalition-2009-10-14), we thought it would be fun to spotlight a couple of cards that have the symbol even though they're not directly Yawgmoth-related. So return with us now to those thrilling days of yesteryear!
