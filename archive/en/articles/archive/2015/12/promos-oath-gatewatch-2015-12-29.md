Psst. Come here. Yeah, you. You with the shiny trade binder. Yeah, you with the 20 copies of the Gift Box promo [Scythe Leopard](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scythe+Leopard) bracketing your prize Elesh Norn, Grand Cenobite written in the Phyrexian language. Want to see some promos?
