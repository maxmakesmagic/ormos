In his way is Pierre "Caribou" Malherbaud, one of France's best. Malherbaud bested William Jensen in the first round, who was playing [Tinker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tinker) just like Maher. He's confident in his Sligh deck. 

### Game 1

A mulligan for Malherbaud, and they were off. Maher started with island and Key. Malherbaud showed mountain and Lackey. Maher betrayed none of the weakness in his hand, playing Monolith and a second Key. Malherbaud summoned the pain, Lackeying out a Piledriver, then playing [Jackal Pup](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jackal+Pup) and [Seal of Fire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seal+of+Fire). Maher needed something, and fast. He had [Upheaval](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Upheaval) in hand, but decided to wait another turn and eat the six damage. He dropped a Dynamo and passed it back.

Malherbaud bashed in and dropped Fanatic and Port. Maher untapped, drew, and calmly laid [Masticore](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Masticore).

"Look what I drew." – Bob Maher

Malherbaud gave him a golf clap for his accomplishment. With a million mana on board, Maher was able to ride [Masticore](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Masticore) to victory.

Maher 1 – Malherbaud 0

### Game 2

Malherbaud mulliganed a sketchy one-lander into a much better one-lander. Maher also mulliganed. Malherbaud again opened with Lackey, but Maher had the [Seal of Removal](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seal+of+Removal) to slow it down. Malherbaud replayed it, showing he hadn't draw a second land.

Maher exploded. He dropped [City of Traitors](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=City+of+Traitors), then [Grim Monolith](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grim+Monolith), then [Tinker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tinker) for Dynamo, and finally [Masticore](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Masticore). Malherbaud still didn't have a second land. He nodded sagely.

"Much better than Jensen." – Pierre Malherbaud

The farce was mercifully short-lived.

**Final Result:** Bob Maher defeats Pierre Malherbaud 2-0
