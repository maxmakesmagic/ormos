M**agic** is full of black cards that put your opponents in some unpleasant situations. You can give them [Smallpox](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Smallpox), or a [Shrieking Affliction](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shrieking+Affliction). If you want them to suffer more, you can [Wrench their Mind](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wrench+their+Mind), [Blackmail](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blackmail) them, or put them into [The Rack](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=The+Rack). I would not want to face someone with all of these tools at his or her disposal!



![Smallpox](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Smallpox&options=)This deck starts with the all-star lineup of black cards, [Thoughtseize](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtseize), [Dark Confidant](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dark+Confidant), and [Liliana of the Veil](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Liliana+of+the+Veil). After that, the goal is to use additional discard spells to get rid of your opponent's options and make your opponent play off the top of his or her deck. Once your opponent has an empty hand, [The Rack](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=The+Rack) and [Shrieking Affliction](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shrieking+Affliction) will pile up the damage very quickly and cheaply. One of the best things about this deck is how much thought has gone into answering potential issues. Sometimes, creatures can sneak under discard. [Ensnaring Bridge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ensnaring+Bridge) can take care of those. The graveyard can also be a valuable resource against a deck with lots of discard, so [Bojuka Bog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bojuka+Bog) and [Nihil Spellbomb](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nihil+Spellbomb) are here to take care of that.

This mono-black discard deck contributes to the great diversity of Modern. Many different archetypes have the power to win a tournament. In fact, there are so many powerful archetypes in Modern that they can't all be popular enough to prepare for them. **Magic Online** user tonifm took advantage of this to place 3rd in a recent **Magic Online** Premier Event.
