We're less than two weeks away from what is to be one of *Magic*'s most memorable weekends.



![](https://media.wizards.com/2015/images/daily/LI20150506_MM2.png)



[*Modern Masters* Weekend](http://magic.wizards.com/modernmastersweekend) is set to be one of the biggest face-to-face trading card game events to take place worldwide. Comprised of three epic Grand Prix taking place across three different continents, each with a main event featuring thousands of players partaking in the *Modern Masters 2015 Edition* Limited format, *Modern Masters* Weekend will also feature one of our biggest live video broadcasting weekends. Ever.



Here's a breakdown of what you can expect.





---

Live Video Coverage
===================



Live video coverage will be taking place starting with *Round 1* at all three Grand Prix, and it's going to be round-the-clock coverage that begins with Day One of Grand Prix Chiba and ends Sunday night with the finals of Grand Prix Las Vegas, along with plenty of awesome matches, memorable stories, and a whole lot more in between.



Let's go down the schedule on when you can expect coverage of an event to begin, and when.





---

**Day 1**



![](https://media.wizards.com/2015/images/daily/GP_City_Chiba.png)



The live video coverage of Modern Masters Weekend begins with Day One, Round 1 of [Grand Prix Chiba](http://magic.wizards.com/en/content/fact-sheet-grand-prix-chiba-2015)'s main event on the [Twitch *Magic* channel](http://www.twitch.tv/magic) at the following times, based on your time zone:




> 
> **Friday at 7 p.m. PT**
> 
> 
> **Friday at 10 p.m. ET**
> 
> 
> **Saturday at 2 a.m. UTC**
> 
> 
> **Saturday at 4 a.m. CET**
> 
> 
> **Saturday at 11 a.m. Local Time (JST)**
> 
> 
>

While Grand Prix Chiba is going on, [Grand Prix Utrecht](http://magic.wizards.com/en/content/fact-sheet-grand-prix-utrecht-2015) coverage will be kicking off over on the [Twitch *Magic*2 channel](http://www.twitch.tv/magic2) at the following times, based on your time zone:




> 
> **Saturday at 2 a.m. PT**
> 
> 
> **Saturday at 5 a.m. ET**
> 
> 
> **Saturday at 9 a.m. UTC**
> 
> 
> **Saturday at 11 a.m. Local Time (CET)**
> 
> 
> **Saturday at 6 p.m. JST**
> 
> 
> 




Grand Prix Chiba will still be streaming when GP Utrecht coverage begins, giving you double the *Magic* to watch for a few hours.

Double the *Magic* is taken to a new level with Vegas. [Grand Prix Las Vegas](http://magic.wizards.com/en/content/fact-sheet-grand-prix-las-vegas-2015) is of such an epic size that it will consist of *two* main events rather than one! You can catch all of the action from the first main event starting with Round 1 on the [Twitch *Magic* channel](http://www.twitch.tv/magic#_blank) at the following times:




> 
> **Saturday at 11 a.m. Local Time (PT)**
> 
> 
> **Saturday at 2 p.m. ET**
> 
> 
> **Saturday at 6 p.m. UTC**
> 
> 
> **Saturday at 8 p.m. CET**
> 
> 
> **Sunday at 3 a.m. JST**
> 
> 
> 




Meanwhile, you can catch all of the action of the second GP Vegas main event from our friends at [ChannelFireball](http://www.twitch.tv/channelfireball), where they'll be bringing dedicated coverage of that event all weekend.

Day Two of the *Modern Masters* Weekend main events will see a bit of a shift of where each event will air, so pay attention!

Day Two of Grand Prix Chiba will stream on the [Twitch *Magic*2 channel](http://www.twitch.tv/magic2) (NOTE: that is different from Day One) at the following times:

The Flashback
=============



Last weekend showcased three events across three continents that were not directly tied to any of the "three events, three continents" discussion earlier in this article. Let's start with the highlight event:





---

![](https://media.wizards.com/2015/images/daily/MTGO_Championship_logo.png)



Last weekend was the 2014 *Magic Online* Championship, a flagship invitation-only event from *Magic Online* where the sixteen winners from last year's *Magic Online* Championship Series events flew to Seattle, Washing, to compete for a $25,000 first prize, Gold status in the Pro Tour Players Club, and a spot in this year's World Championship.



In the end of the three-day competition, Magus Lantto came out on top, primarily thanks to the early advantage that his Vintage preparation gave him in the swiss rounds as well as in the final's best-two-out-of-three-matches structure. The Grand Prix Milan 2015 champion has added a big win to his resume, and he'll be returning to Seattle in a few months for the World Championship.

Also part of last weekend's triple-threat of events was Grand Prix Shanghai, a Standard spectacle that brought some of Asia's best *Magic* players to China for the weekend. Aside from introducing some seriously awesome brews into the Standard metagame, thanks to some of Japan's greats, the story of the weekend was all about Japan in general, with new superstar Yuuki Ichikawa taking home the trophy with Abzan Control. This mark's the two-time Pro Tour Top 8 competitor's first Grand Prix win.

Last weekend also showcased this season's Team Limited Grand Prix in Florence. Team Limited always brings out the biggest teams and some of the most skill-intensive games of *Magic*, and last weekend was no exception. The Top 4 of this event featured two countries: Germany and England. When the semifinals ended, the two British teams were gone and left in the finals were six players all hailing from Berlin. In the end, the trio of Rasario Maij, Adrian Rosada, and Frank SchÃ¤fer took home the trophies for the weekend.
