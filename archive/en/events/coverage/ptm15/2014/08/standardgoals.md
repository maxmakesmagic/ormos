 When practicing for a Pro Tour, it's important to have direction. Bashing random decks into one another and recording the results gives players some information, but a lot more progress can be accomplished in a shorter period of time if a player knows what they want their deck to do before the tournament. I sat down with a number of different players and asked them what their particular goals for Standard were coming into Pro Tour *Magic 2015*.



I started by asking, "Which decks were the most important to test against?"


Christian Calcano took aim at White-Black Midrange, Black Devotion variants, Blue Devotion, and Jund Monsters. His most important goal coming into the event was to beat Blue Devotion. He stated quite plainly that he refused to play a deck that didn't have a strong match-up against the Blue Devotion deck. 





*Christian Calcano had his testing sights set on taking down Blue Devotion.*
