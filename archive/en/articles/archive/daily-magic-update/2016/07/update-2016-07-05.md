The Daily *Magic* Update is a roundup of everything *Magic* you should know on July 5, 2016. Today's Update is brought to you by Zombies, Liliana, and the final week of *Eldritch Moon* previews. We're nearly to the end, but we've still got plenty of strong, flavorful, and just plain awesome cards left to show off. The full set will be shown off at 8 a.m. PT this Friday in the [Card Image Gallery](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/card-image-gallery/eldritch-moon).


Today's Previews
================


Throughout preview season, I'll use this space to highlight the day's previews that can't be found on DailyMTG. Worried you might miss something? We'll make sure to have it here.


1. [Exclusive *Eldritch Moon* Preview—Grim Flayer](http://manadeprived.com/exclusive-eldritch-moon-preview-grim-flayer/) | Mana Deprived | Kar Yung Tom and Jay Lansdaal

I'm going to be honest here—I had no idea Mana Deprived had previewed [Rakshasa Deathdealer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rakshasa+Deathdealer). Sometimes I'm really good at creating this kind of symmetry between preview seasons. This one was just a happy little accident.


1. [Breaking the Crypt in Standard and Commander](http://www.mtggoldfish.com/articles/breaking-the-crypt-in-standard-and-commander) | MTGGoldfish | SaffronOlive

Zombies get a kick-start with this one-drop previewed at the drop of midnight last night.


1. [Selfless Spirit](http://emn.bigmagic.net/) | BigMagic.net (Japanese)

Japan lives in the future, so if you've been paying attention, you've likely already seen this. But it's a pretty exciting Spirit, so it's certainly worth calling out. If you can't read Japanese (for shame), you can get a pretty accurate translation on the [Reddit thread discussing it](https://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/4r7l1i/emn_translation_for_spoiler/).


1. [Exclusive LR *Eldritch Moon* Preview Cards](http://lrcast.com/exclusive-lr-eldritch-moon-preview-cards/) | Limited Resources | Marshall Sutcliffe

Four new uncommons to set you on your way in Draft. I wonder if Marshall has opinions on them?


1. One more to go today...

That's everything for today (well, everything you haven't already seen on [DailyMTG.com](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles)), but [Mark Rosewater](https://twitter.com/maro254) has a Twitter preview for you today. Chances are good he'll make you work for it. #whereismypreviewcard


After Those, Read, Watch, or Listen to This
===========================================


1. [Episode 8: Brian Braun-Duin—*Magic: The Gathering* Video Podcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-43rTnEP8k) | Magic the PROthering | Maria Bartholdi and Meghan Wolff

Well isn't this timing great. Brian Braun-Duin just took over first in the Grand Prix Master rankings in the run-up to the World Championship, and here he is, right on your screen. It's like they planned this.

What to Watch Tonight
=====================


1. [Vintage Super League](https://vintagesuperleague.com/)

Week 6 (of nine, plus the playoffs) starts tonight at 5 p.m. PT / 8 p.m. ET on [twitch.tv/magic](https://www.twitch.tv/magic). There are still a few weeks left, but the playoff picture is starting to come into focus. Unless you're Luis Scott-Vargas, in which case nothing is in focus because you have a newborn and probably aren't sleeping much.


What People Are Talking About
=============================


1. > 
> Cool to see Romao and co win the Grand Prix in Brazil. Former World Champion and MOCS champion that I did not know still played

We had a [Team Grand Prix in South America](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/gpsao16) over the weekend, and coming out of the woodwork to win it all was former World Champion Carlos Romao alongside Francisco Barciella and Eloi Pattaro. It was a really cool win for the [Psychatog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psychatog) master, but it was only part of the weekend.


Check out the [Top 5 Moments article](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/gpsao16/top-5-moments-2016-07-03) for a surprising amount of news coming out of this tournament, including updates in the race for Grand Prix Master and a World Championship slot, plus two long-time pros leveling up.

> This weekend is the Eldritch Moon PrePreRelease. Tell your friends![#LRREMN](https://twitter.com/hashtag/LRREMN?src=hash) [pic.twitter.com/q9RG20SjVs](https://t.co/q9RG20SjVs)

If you're itching for *Eldritch Moon*—well, you should probably get that checked out. An itch is how it all started with Brisela...


But if you're interested in seeing some *Eldritch Moon* before you can even Prerelease, LoadingReadyRun is running their Pre-Prerelease, just as they did for *Shadows over Innistrad*. Check it out this Saturday on [twitch.tv/loadingreadyrun](https://www.twitch.tv/loadingreadyrun).


Decks of the Day
================


1. [Mark Nestico's New Pet Card](http://www.starcitygames.com/article/33219_My-New-Pet-Card.html)

Today's card to brew with is Harmless Offering, which Mark Nestico has grabbed on to and started running with. The new red version of [Donate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Donate) enables all kinds of wacky and not-so-wacky brews. Check out [the article on StarCityGames.com](http://www.starcitygames.com/article/33219_My-New-Pet-Card.html) to see all the ways Nestico plans to give his opponents a gift they do not want.
