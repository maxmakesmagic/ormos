If you attend this weekend's [*Ravnica* Release Events](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=events/magic/release), you'll get a special, promotional, premium **[Dimir Guildmage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dimir+Guildmage)**:

We took photos from a couple angles to show you how it's foiled-out. *Behold the shininess.*

How do you get one? Simple.

1. Click [these words right here](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=events/magic/release) to view the Release Event fact sheet.
2. Find a release event near you at the top of that page.
3. Go to your chosen event(s) and play some *Ravnica* sealed deck. You'll get your uber-foily [Dimir Guildmage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dimir+Guildmage) there, while supplies last.
