What do a dapper Zombie, a wise Sphinx, a squid-like Illusion, and a Frog Lizard have in common? If you read the title of this article, then it's not much of a surprise, but let's stick with the literary device.


They're tokens in *Ravnica Allegiance*!


If you haven't seen the cards that make these twelve tokens and one emblem yet, be sure to check out the [Card Image Gallery](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/card-image-gallery/ravnica-allegiance-2018-12-17)!


Behold, and enjoy a dapper Zombie and friends.
