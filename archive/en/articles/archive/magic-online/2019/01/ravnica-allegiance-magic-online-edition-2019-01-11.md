Ravnica Allegiance: Magic Online Edition

Welcome back, *Magic Online* players! *Ravnica Allegiance* is almost upon us, bringing with it the five guilds not in *Guilds of Ravnica* and a huge pile of sweet new cards. We're going to have a full suite of Leagues available, including the *Ravnica Allegiance* version of the Prerelease-style Guilded League.


And for *Magic Online*, of course, an article about a new set means we've got some additional updates to talk about.


SAVING TARGETS
==============


First, let's talk about an update from last set that didn't get much time in the spotlight. Players can now "save targets," meaning that when you choose targets for a triggered or activated ability, you can set that ability's target to automatically be chosen in the future.


For example, let's say you have a Persistent Petitioners and you're trying to mill your opponent out. You can left-click the Petitioners to start the activation, then click your opponent's avatar to choose them as the target player. That much isn't changing. However, you can now right-click the Petitioners to get an expanded action menu, where you'll see a line under each activated ability labeled ". . . and save targets." Choosing that action is exactly like choosing the line right above it, but whatever you choose for the target will be automatically chosen the next time you activate this ability. You'll know that your permanent has a saved target if it has a small yellow triangle with a target icon inside.


![](https://media.wizards.com/2018/images/daily/xgUncjtSKK.png)


This will work for all future activations of that ability by that permanent, as long as the target is legal when it's time to choose. However, this won't work if your permanent (or the target) leaves the battlefield and re-enters, because when anything re-enters the battlefield, it's a new game object with no memory of its previous existence.


Similarly, when you're choosing targets for a triggered ability, if you right-click the trigger instead of left-clicking it in the trigger area, you'll be able to choose to save your targets as well.


Changed your mind? No problem. Just right-click the permanent that's doing the auto-targeting and choose "Clear auto targets." Next time you start activating the ability or the trigger asks you for a target, you'll be able to choose your target again normally.


This is most useful when you're targeting the same thing many times, of course, but that comes up a lot in *Magic*. Especially when you look at older formats, or Chaos Draft, this can save clicks in combos or just free you from worrying about misclicks: how often is your Hedron Crab or Drowned Secrets going to target a different player than it did last time? Or Blood Artist?


Save time, save clicks, save targets. Available *right now*.


FORMAT POINTS
=============


As we stated in the [*Magic Online* Championship Series 2019 announcement](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/magic-online/2019-magic-online-championship-2018-11-12), we have new Format Focus events that can let you play your non-rotating format of choice all the way to the *Magic Online* Championship *and* the Mythic Championship. Format Points are a key part of that, and we've been tracking them since December 2, 2018 at 8 a.m. PT. Starting with *Ravnica Allegiance*, we're going to be putting them into your account, and you can track your progress yourself.


In the future, we're going to be shifting toward letting you track more things. We're currently planning to have League trophies and MOCS leaderboard points shifted in this way too (though, we'll still keep the leaderboard page up for easy comparisons).


NEW PLAY LOBBY
==============


Well . . . almost. We've talked about this one before, so I wanted to provide an update: we had hoped to get the new play lobby out the door with this release, but as we worked, it became clear that it wasn't going to be ready for release with *Ravnica Allegiance*. Rather than release such a significant upgrade before it's ready to ship, we're going to take the time to make sure it's finished before shipping.


Our current plans are to release the new play lobby later in Q1. It's intended to maintain current functionality while greatly simplifying the process of getting into a game, and we think you'll be happy with it when it arrives.


EARLY DRAFT IS BEST DRAFT
=========================


So, drafting is fun you say? \*cue everyone groaning in agreement\*


And you want more drafting? \*cue eyerolls\*


Okay. Seriously, okay. We'll give you more drafting.


*Ravnica Allegiance* drafts will be available on Friday, January 18. That's right, the day after the set releases. We're not waiting until Monday anymore, friends. This time, play Sealed on Thursday, play drafts on Friday, and keep playing as much as you want.

PRESTIGE AVATARS

Prizes are great, but what good are they if other people can't see them? Win enough trophies in Leagues, and you'll get something your opponents will take notice of: a prestige avatar for the season. Here's what you can earn, to be delivered after the next Standard-legal set releases.


Remember, prestige avatars are *only* available this way. They can't be traded, so you can be sure that anyone with one of these avatars earned their way to it.

ALTERNATIVE PLAY
================


*Ravnica Allegiance* is a sweet set, and there's a lot to explore. So, we're going to let the set have a month in which it's the primary way to play before diving into some other formats.


* Starting on February 13, CHAOS DRAFT! makes its triumphant return. So triumphant, in fact, that it'll be sticking around for *two weeks*, until . . .
* . . . February 27, when we get a palate cleanser. Ravnica is awesome, and RNA will still be available and a lot of fun, but some people can already tell that we've been on Ravnica for months now. For this week, we're going back to the halcyon days (not [Halcyon Glaze](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Halcyon+Glaze), that's still Ravnica) of triple-*Lorwyn* drafting. Faeries, Elves, Goblins, Treefolk, ~~Humans~~, and, of course, Changelings are waiting for you.
* Lots of you really enjoyed *Ultimate Masters*, so much so that we took a planned two-week run for the set and extended it by almost another a month. So as soon as we're past *Lorwyn*, starting on March 6, *Ultimate Masters* is coming back for another week. Enjoy one of the most popular Draft formats in recent years all over again after an absence of . . . less than two months.
* On March 13, we're going to launch a special event called Ravnica Remix. *Guilds of Ravnica* and *Ravnica Allegiance* weren't built to be drafted together, but who says they can't be? Fresh from *Magic* R&D, the Ravnica Remix takes *Guilds of Ravnica* and *Ravnica Allegiance* and combines them into a single Draft experience. We'll have more details on that later, but in the meantime, you can plan to have two full weeks of Ravnica Remix available.
* And then, to round out the season, the *Legacy Cube* will return on March 27 and run right up until the next Standard-legal set release.

TREASURE CHESTS
===============


Starting with *Ravnica Allegiance*, we're going to make a few changes to Treasure Chests. We're dropping the Standard-legal commons and uncommons sheet, so you won't be getting any more of those. Instead, we're going to turn the third slot in each chest into a guaranteed 5 Play Points, so even if you don't like any of the cards in the pack, you're going to get something useful. And, based on a request we heard more than a few times, we're moving the Treasure Chest Avatars to be their own thing: if you get one, you get one, but you won't miss out on anything else just because you got an avatar.


Speaking of Treasure Chest avatars, here are the two for this season:



![Sharktocrab Avatar](https://media.wizards.com/2018/images/daily/S8B7SNlP0E.png)Sharktocrab

![Bitey Avatar](https://media.wizards.com/2018/images/daily/HXgNeI7Qlj.png)Bitey the Carrion Imp
You'll be able to check out the full details on the Treasure Chest page closer to the release. Until then . . . Bitey!
