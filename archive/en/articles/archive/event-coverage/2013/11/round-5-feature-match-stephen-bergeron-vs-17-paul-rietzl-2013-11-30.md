It's a double feature! In this round, two tables, each featuring contemporary masters of *Magic* currently in the Top 25 Ranked Pros, face off against local players who made the trek out to Grand Prix Toronto.


The first feature match featured Stephen Bergeron against No. 17 Ranked Player Paul Rietzl. Bergeron is a Toronto local that plays Grand Prix events that take place near his area. He's been playing casually since *Odyssey* block and has continued to hit up Grand Prix events that take place in this region of Canada.

Rietzl, an American pro, is currently making a run for Platinum Pro status following his Top 8 finish at Pro Tour *Theros*. Will he follow up his quarterfinal finish from last weekend at Grand Prix Albuquerque?


### The Games


Bergeron started off with his back against the wall and accepted the attacks coming in from Rietzl's [Observant Alseid](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Observant+Alseid), bestowed with a copy of the same creature. However, things reversed when he reached five lands and cast [Prophet of Kruphix](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Prophet+of+Kruphix), giving him a creature and a multitude of instant speed options.


Rietzl, however, refused to be left as the only one playing fair, and he cast his own copy of the rare blue-green creature. However, it quickly became outclassed when Bergeron's Prophet was giving two copies of [Ordeal of Heliod](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ordeal+of+Heliod) and an [Ordeal of Nylea](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ordeal+of+Nylea). It attacked in, and one of the [Ordeal of Heliod](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ordeal+of+Heliod)s went to the graveyard and put Bergeron to 20 life.

However, Burgeron's shields were down. The coast now clear to resolve a mid-combat creature, Rietzl cast [Mistcutter Hydra](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mistcutter+Hydra) for six, taking out Bergeron's Prophet, which still succumbed to Rietzl's blocking creatures despite the triple Ordeals.


Things went downhill from there, and Bergeron quickly conceded to the growing board and Rietzl's powerful players fueled by the [Prophet of Kruphix](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Prophet+of+Kruphix)'s effect.


The second game went even more favorably for Rietzl, who had a third-turn [Fabled Hero](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fabled+Hero) and an [Ordeal of Heliod](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ordeal+of+Heliod) to follow. When Nimbus Naid came down on the fifth turn bestewed onto the powerful double striker, Bergeron offered the handshake.
