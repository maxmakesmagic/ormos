When cards are first designed, they often have placeholder names, that just define the card's abilities in a flavorless (but easy to remember) fashion. Other times, as with Planeswalkers, the card designers know pretty much what the card is going to be called.

But sometimes a **Magic** card designer's creativity comes bubbling out in the name. There's usually some kind of joke or connection between the jokey name and the ability. So with that in mind, for how many of these *Worldwake* playtest names can you identify the final card?
