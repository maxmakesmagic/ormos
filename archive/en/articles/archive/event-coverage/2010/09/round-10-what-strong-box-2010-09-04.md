Kevin Grove vs. Paul Rietzl
---------------------------


"In my younger days, I used to do a lot of trash talk," Paul Rietzl said, breaking the silence during shuffling. Rietzl has one Pro Tour Top 8 to his name, from Honolulu, and is no doubt looking for a repeat here.


"And you grew out of it?" asked his opponent, Kevin Grove, last year's Netherlands National Champion.


"Nah, I just figured I couldn't back it up anymore."


### Game 1


Rietzl won the die roll, chose to play first, and had the first play with [Gargoyle Sentinel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gargoyle+Sentinel). Grove just played a third [Mountain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mountain) and passed the turn. Rietzl summoned [Howling Banshee](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Howling+Banshee) to put both players at 17, Grove made just another [Mountain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mountain) and passed again. But when Gargoyle and [Banshee](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Banshee) ventured into the red zone, the latter took a terminal hit from [Chandra's Outrage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chandra%27s+Outrage). (Grove at 14, Rietzl at 15.)

Grove put down a fifth [Mountain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mountain) and cast [Magma Phoenix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Magma+Phoenix). The big fiery bird proceeded to attack, while Rietzl made [Gravedigger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gravedigger) to return [Howling Banshee](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Howling+Banshee). With Rietzl at 12, [Magma Phoenix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Magma+Phoenix) went unblocked one last time. [Fling](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fling) provided an additional 3 points of damage, as did the Phoenix's triggered ability, as did Grove's [Lightning Bolt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt).


Grove 1, Rietzl 0


### Game 2


Once again, Rietzl had the first play, with [Whispersilk Cloak](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Whispersilk+Cloak) on turn three. Grove's first was not as passive, though, and [Goblin Chieftain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Chieftain) took Rietzl down to 18. Rietzl cast [Canyon Minotaur](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Canyon+Minotaur), which was in turn burned away via [Chandra's Outrage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chandra%27s+Outrage) to put Rietzl at 14. He made [Gargoyle Sentinel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gargoyle+Sentinel) and equipped it, and his opponent cast [Sorcerer's Strongbox](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sorcerer%27s+Strongbox). Rietzl had [Pyroclasm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyroclasm) to kill [Goblin Chieftain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Chieftain) and [Liliana's Specter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Liliana%27s+Specter), which had forced Grove to discard [Berserkers of Blood Ridge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Berserkers+of+Blood+Ridge).


Grove lost the die roll on [Sorcerer's Strongbox](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sorcerer%27s+Strongbox), then cast [Fiery Hellhound](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fiery+Hellhound). Rietzl summoned [Berserkers of Blood Ridge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Berserkers+of+Blood+Ridge) and equipped it with [Whispersilk Cloak](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Whispersilk+Cloak). Grove cast [Act of Treason](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Act+of+Treason) targeting [Gargoyle Sentinel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gargoyle+Sentinel), then used [Fling](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fling) to get rid of both the [Sentinel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sentinel) and [Liliana's Specter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Liliana%27s+Specter) indefinitely. Meanwhile, he missed out on yet another die-roll with his [Sorcerer's Strongbox](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sorcerer%27s+Strongbox). He also attacked with [Fiery Hellhound](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fiery+Hellhound) with two red mana up, and Rietzl chose not to block. Rietzl went to 10, but then had [Corrupt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Corrupt) on his turn to both kill the Hellhound and replenish his life total.

[Berserkers of Blood Ridge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Berserkers+of+Blood+Ridge) went on the offense, and Grove missed yet again on his Strongbox. What a strong box indeed! The [Berserk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Berserk)ers attacked once more, and left Grove in range of [Howling Banshee](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Howling+Banshee).


Grove 1, Rietzl 1


### Game 3


For a change, Grove had the first play, but his [Chandra's Spitfire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chandra%27s+Spitfire) immediately caught [Doom Blade](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Doom+Blade). Then his [Vulshok Berserker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vulshok+Berserker) traded with [Gargoyle Sentinel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gargoyle+Sentinel). Rietzl summoned [Liliana's Specter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Liliana%27s+Specter) to which Grove discarded [Magma Phoenix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Magma+Phoenix).


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/ptams10/r10_rietzl.jpg)*Quick PT pronunciation lesson: American Paul Rietzl's name is pronounced the opposite of how it would be if he were German.*
Grove cast [Sorcerer's Strongbox](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sorcerer%27s+Strongbox) and made a face. Rietzl attacked with the Specter and continued the pressure with [Berserkers of Blood Ridge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Berserkers+of+Blood+Ridge). Grove activated (and obviously failed at) his Strongbox, then summoned [Goblin Chieftain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Chieftain). The Goblin, however, couldn't really do anything about the [Berserk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Berserk)ers or the Specter coming his way.


Grove finally managed to crack the amazingly strong Strongbox and summoned [Fire Servant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fire+Servant). Rietzl, however, had [Act of Treason](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Act+of+Treason) to take the [Fire Servant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fire+Servant), supposedly until end of turn—in fact until the end of the game.


Rietzl 2, Grove 1
