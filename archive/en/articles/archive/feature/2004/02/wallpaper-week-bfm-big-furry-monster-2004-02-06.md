* What black card comes first in the alphabet (in English)? - [Abandon Hope](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Abandon+Hope)
* What black card comes last in the alphabet (in English)? - [Zombify](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Zombify)
* What black creature has the highest sum of power/toughness (again, Unglued's B.F.M. aside)? - [Devouring Strossus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Devouring+Strossus)
* What black card has the highest converted mana cost (outside of Unglued)? - [Hypnox](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hypnox)
* What is the most common black creature type? - Zombie, by far, with 97 cards. Horror is next with 42, and in third is Minion with 39. Monoblack legends: 21.
* What card has the most creature types of any black creature? - [Balthor, the Defiled](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Balthor%2C+the+Defiled) (who is a Zombie Dwarf Legend).
* What black Wall has the highest sum of power/toughness? - Tie between [Wall of Putrid Flesh](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wall+of+Putrid+Flesh) and [Wall of Vipers](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wall+of+Vipers), which are both 2/4.
* What monoblack Legend has the highest sum of power/toughness? - [Greven Il-Vec](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Greven+Il-Vec).
* What card is the most-reprinted black creature? - Tie between [Bog Wraith](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bog+Wraith) and [Scathe Zombies](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scathe+Zombies), both in 11 sets.
* What card is the most-reprinted black sorcery? - [Raise Dead](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Raise+Dead) (12 sets).
* What card is the most-reprinted black instant? - Depends how you count. If you consider [Dark Ritual](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dark+Ritual) an instant, which it now is according to its Oracle text, then it is the winner with 13 sets. If you stick to the idea that it's sometimes an Interrupt (like in [Beta](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Beta)) and sometimes a Mana Source (like in [Fifth Edition](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fifth+Edition)), then [Terror](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Terror) is the big winner, with 11 sets.
* What card is the most-reprinted black enchantment? - [Pestilence](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pestilence) (9 sets including *Battle Royale*).
* What card was the first black card banned from **Magic** tournaments? - *Alpha's* black ante cards were the first cards banned: [Contract from Below](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Contract+from+Below), [Darkpact](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Darkpact), and [Demonic Attorney](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Demonic+Attorney). ("[Black Lotus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Black+Lotus)" doesn't count!)
* What black card generally has the highest value on the secondary market? - [Juzam Djinn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Juzam+Djinn).
* What black card has the "blackest" art -- meaning, having the most black filling up the card's illustration frame? - This is a bit of a subjective question, but it's probably either [word of command](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=word%2Bof%2Bcommand) or [demonic hordes](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=demonic%2Bhordes)!
