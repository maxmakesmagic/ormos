*Magic Online 2015 Core Set*   

**Prerelease Begins:** 10:00 a.m. Friday, July 25  

All times are Pacific (for UTC, add 7 hours)



Hunt Bigger Game
Push yourself to the limit with *Magic: The Gathering*, the world’s premier trading card game. Customize your own *Magic* deck with potent spells and creatures, then challenge your friends to see who's the fiercest predator!


The *Magic 2015 Core Set* is coming to *Magic Online*! Much like a new year, a new Core Set is cause for celebration. But what’s the best way to ring in the new *Magic 2015 Core Set*? Host a whole bunch of Prerelease and Release events? Sure, right, but what else? How about hosting new events, increasing Prerelease prizes, and holding the biggest giveaway *Magic Online* has ever seen?


[Millions of Phantom Points and "Hunt" entry objects are being awarded to *Magic Online* users](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/magic-online-v3-date-and-new-client-update-2014-06-26), but what can they use them for? [Prerelease Events](prerelease) begin Friday, July 25 at 10:00 a.m. and continue through 10:00 a.m. Monday, July 28. Two new Prerelease Events—[Friendly Sealed](#prefriendlysealed) and [Competitive Sealed](#precompetitivesealed)—will include Phantom Points as one of their entry options! Join the new Friendly Sealed Event if you're looking to experiment with the new set, have fun, and have a better chance at walking away with a booster or two. If it's fierce competition and a steeper prize payout you're after, the Competitive Sealed Event will be more your speed. To be clear, unlike other events that use Phantom Points as an entry option, players will be able to keep their cards from these Prerelease Events after they end! Not only is your entry fee being covered for one of these events, but we’ve also increased prize payout for the Competitive Sealed compared to the  [Journey into Nyx Prerelease Events](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/other/04212014/journeyevents). Not interested in participating in the Prerelease Events at all? Your Phantom Points can be used in any regular *Magic Online* Phantom event, like our Holiday Cube (in July!), which will be running from Wednesday, July 16 to Friday, July 25. For more information about the Phantom Point and "Hunt" object giveaway, refer to [Worth's V3 Off Article](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/magic-online-v3-date-and-new-client-update-2014-06-26).



Please note, due to the "Hunt" Entry Object giveaway, M15 Prerelease Entry Objects will not be refundable.
Prerelease comes to a close and [Release Events](#release) begin on Monday, July 28 at 10:00 a.m., running until 12:00 a.m. on Wednesday, August 13. Two [*Magic 2015* Premier Events](#premier) are planned during the release period as well: [Premier 64-Player Single Elimination Draft Events](#premier64playerdraft) begin alongside Release Events on Monday, July 28, and run until Wednesday, August 13 at 10:00 a.m. [Premier Swiss Sealed Events](#premierswisssealed) begin on August 1 at 4:00 a.m. and run until Sunday, August 10 at 6:00 p.m.


More details about these and all the *Magic 2015* Prerelease and Release events can be found in the event tables below!
