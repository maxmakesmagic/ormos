**Can you draft a good non-red, non-black deck after *Legions*?**




|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Osyp Lebedowicz**:
 Yes, blue and white are both better, and there are fewer Sparksmiths. | **Dave Williams**:
 A good deck? No. | **Gary Wise**:
 I always said you could, and Legions makes it easier. |

**Who will surprise the world by Top 8'ing this Grand Prix?**




|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Alex Shvartsman**:
 Andy Stokinger | **Bob Maher**:
 David Bachmann | **William Jensen**:
 Eric James |

**What is the strongest color combination in draft, post-*Legions*?**




|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **PTR/JC**:
 Still Red-Blue. All the colors are good in Legions, so the status quo is the same. | **Zvi Mowshowitz**:
 Black-White. White is underappreciated, and black has the best removal. | **Matt Vienneau**:
 No idea, I've never drafted it. If it's not on ***Magic** Online*, I don't play it. |

**What's more important in Sealed Deck, consistency or power?**




|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Bob Maher**:
 It depends on how many rounds there are. Today, it's power. | **Brian Kibler**:
 Consistency. With nine rounds, if you only rely on your bombs, you won't win. | **PTR/JC**:
 It's irrelevant. Just play all your Provoke creatures and you'll do fine. |

**Who is the strongest player here without three byes?**




|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Gary Wise**: Ryan Fuller | **Alex Shvartsman**: Matt Vienneau | **Dave Williams**: Me, obviously. |

**Is Sealed Deck better after the inclusion of *Legions*?**




|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Zvi**: No, there aren't enough non-creature spells. The games go too long. | **Gary Wise**: No, with *Legions*, the turn three land drop is more important than ever. | **Darwin Kastle**: Yes, the bigger the card pool, the better. |
