The January 25, 2016 Update
===========================

The Daily *Magic* Update is a roundup of everything *Magic* you should know from over the weekend of January 23–24. Today's Update is brought to you by the [perfect 5/7 streamers](#streamers).


Two Tournaments Highlight the Weekend
=====================================


1. [Super Sunday Series](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/2016SSSC) | Wizards of the Coast

First up, the Super Sunday Series Championship took place this weekend at Wizards of the Coast's headquarters in Renton. Since that's the place where I put this message in the internet tube machine, I actually got to hang out with some of the crew over the weekend. On Saturday night, while we ate and played games and made merry, I asked Sam how he was doing.


"First," was all he replied. He had that look in his eye. So it wasn't terribly surprising when he walked away with the trophy the next day. You can see [all of the coverage here](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/2016SSSC) or view the two-minute recap video below.

1. [StarCityGames.com Atlanta Open Weekend](http://www.starcitygames.com/events/230116_atlanta.html) | StarCityGames.com

In the first Standard action with *Oath of the Gatewatch*, once again everyone underestimated red decks and let the ~~villain~~ fast, aggressive strategy win. It seems like the first week of Standard is often dominated by reliably focused red decks, and Korey McDuffie proved that fact once again.


Please, for the love of Heliod, start packing more Arashin Clerics.


The Open also contained the first Modern action of the season after the bannings took effect, and the winner was—Temur Delver! The Top 4 decks were Delver, two Merfolk, and a Jund list. You can check out the [full Top 16 here](http://sales.starcitygames.com/deckdatabase/deckshow.php?&t%5BC1%5D=28&start_date=01/24/2016&end_date=01/24/2016).


After Those, Read, Watch, or Listen to These
============================================


1. [The Top 5 *Magic: The Gathering* Twitch Streamers](http://www.manaleak.com/mtguk/2016/01/the-top-5-magic-the-gathering-twitch-streamers-by-joseph-dunlap/) | manaleak.com | Joseph Dunlap

The title is a tad misleading, as there was a three-way "tie" for fifth. So Top 7 streamers. This begs the question—what is our obsession with even numbers and multiples of five? Top 7 streamers would have been more factually accurate, and would indicate that more information as contained in the article—all good things—but I guarantee "The Top 7 Magic: The Gathering Twitch Streamers" would have gotten fewer clicks. People are weird, man.


But this man, Joseph Dunlap, is pretty spot-on with his Top ~~5~~ 7 list of streamers. I won't spoil his list ([click on it already!](http://www.manaleak.com/mtguk/2016/01/the-top-5-magic-the-gathering-twitch-streamers-by-joseph-dunlap/)), but it's pretty close to the list the Daily *Magic* Update would put together.


1. [Noah Bradley AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/42ku1x/artist_illustrator_week_im_noah_bradley_ama/) | Reddit

Noah Bradley, *Magic* artist extraordinaire (oh, and he does art for other fantasy titles, too, I guess), did an AMA (Ask Me Anything) on Reddit this morning. Illustrator of 42 *Magic* cards—including the enemy color *Expedition* shock lands—Bradley's [vision](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=394742) [resonates](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=370670) from [sea](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=401922) to, um, [Island in the sea](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=383147).


1. [Drafting with Numot: Legacy Cube #6](http://www.gatheringmagic.com/kenjiegashira-012516-drafting-with-numot-legacy-cube-6/) | GatheringMagic |Kenji Egashira

Your time to draft Legacy Cube is almost up! On Friday, [*Oath of the Gatewatch* events begin on *Magic Online*](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/magic-online/magic-online-oath-gatewatch-prerelease-and-release-events-2016-01-13), which means the Legacy Cube turns off on Friday (*Editor's Note, who is also the writer: Some moron put Wednesday here earlier. He's been taken out back and shot)*. Want one more chance to be the mono-red bad guy? One more chance at a turn two Griselbrand? One more chance to pass Mentor of the Meek fourteenth? Jump in now!


What Else You Might Have Missed This Weekend
============================================


1. [The Returning Champ: Luis Salvatto](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/2016SSSC/the-returning-champ-2016-01-23) | Wizards of the Coast

Luis Salvatto nearly ran it back at the Super Sunday Series Championship this weekend, but fell in the semifinals. Clearly there's something about the air in Renton that brings out the best in Luis Salvatto. We breathe excellence here.

>  &mdash; Canadian Highlander (@CanHighlander) [January 23, 2016](https://twitter.com/CanHighlander/status/690816347375325185)


I'll excuse you if you haven't jumped on the Canadian Highlander bandwagon yet, because the name is a touch misleading. The format is anything but friendly. It's cutthroat. It's ruthless. And it's possibly the best format ever created by Canadians.


At any rate, the Canadians responsible for this format hold a year-end Top 8 tournament, and that tournament happened! You can view [their stream here](http://www.twitch.tv/canhighlander/v/37463435).


1. [*Magic: The Gathering* Office Hours—Chandra Nalaar](https://youtu.be/sl7_WblWwDk) | Tolarian Community College

The Professor and Christine Sprankle team up to hold office hours for the one and only Chandra Nalaar. Well, kind of one and only.

1. [Top 10 *Oath of the Gatewatch* Cards for CUBE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qtlFRxxB-8) | Milo: The Gathering

Milo: The Gathering? You had me at the pun in your channel's name. Then I stayed because it was a fun discussion of both powered and a beginner-focused cube.

Deck of the Day
===============


1. Temur Delver in post-bannings Modern

While you were watching Carson Palmer implode, Todd Anderson was showing off one of the Temur decks that doesn't need Twin to win in the first major Modern action prior to the Pro Tour. [The Top 16 of the Modern Classic](http://sales.starcitygames.com/deckdatabase/deckshow.php?&t%5BC1%5D=28&start_date=01/24/2016&end_date=01/24/2016) was quite diverse, so I recommend checking that out faster than you can blind-flip a Delver.
