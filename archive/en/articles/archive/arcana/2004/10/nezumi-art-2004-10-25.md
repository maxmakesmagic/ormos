From the [Kamigawa Glossary](/en/articles/archive/kamigawa-glossary-part-1-2004-09-14):


> **nezumi** (nay-ZOO-mee) Rat. In Kamigawa, short for nezumi-bito, meaning “ratfolk.”

During Kamigawa's war with its own kami, the black-aligned [nezumi](http://gatherer.wizards.com/default.asp?term=rat&fields=%7Ctype&format=KamigawaBlock&color=All&output=summary&sort=name&first=1) mostly looked out for their own interests. They lived in Takenuma Swamp among the rotten bamboo, scavenging shabby equipment from the swamp or stealing goods from travelers. They favor [Kusari-Gama](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Kusari-Gama), such as this burly fellow.

The nezumi were greedy, treacherous opportunists, mercenaries and thieves -- often involved in deals with other races who needed to get the nastiest sorts of jobs done.

The nezumi were also talented shamans (check out the great shamanic details here -- the fish strapped to his thigh armor and the lizard hanging from his staff)...

...and in some cases, worked their way up from common graverobbers to legendary necromancers.
