The fourth format at this year's Invitational is Standard. That sounds rather simple. But here at the Invitational we always have a little twist. The Standard being played at this tournament is Standard as it will appear on November 1st. Odyssey is rotated in and Masques block is rotated out.


As this will be the first tournament ever to use this format, deck construction should prove quite challenging. What are the good cards from Odyssey? What new archetypes does Odyssey create? How does Masque block's departure change the metagame? The sixteen competitors will have to answer these questions and many more.
