### Collector's Highlights


We gathered four of the best decks from the 2004 World Championships held in San Francisco, California. Each of these decks was constructed by a Pro Tour player for the Standard Constructed envrionment at the time, which included the *Onslaught* and *Mirrodin* blocks as well as the *Eighth Edition* Core Set. Each deck features a 60 card main deck, 15 card sideboard, 12 proxy cards along with a decklist, and factsheet. These cards are gold bordered and feature the 2004 World Championship Deck backing. 




### Game Features


The 2004 World Championships was dominated by the powerful "Affinity" deck, which was almost entirely composed of artifacts from the *Mirrodin* block. Aeo Paquette took this deck all the way to the finals, where he was stopped by Julien Nujiten's green-white "[Astral Slide](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Astral+Slide)" deck. Nujiten used Eternal Witness to gain great card advantage and became the youngest World Champion ever!


Manuel Bevand played a combo deck based around [Krark-Clan Ironworks](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Krark-Clan+Ironworks), which was good enough to get him to the semifinals. In the quarterfinals, Gabriel Nassif's blue-white control deck met its end, but not before beating numerous Affinity decks along the way.
