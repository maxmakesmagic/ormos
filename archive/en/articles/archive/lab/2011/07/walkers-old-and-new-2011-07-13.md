Welcome back to the Lab. Finally, a reprieve of sorts. After the triple whammy that was *New Phyrexia*, ***Magic: The Gathering** Commander*, and ***Magic** 2012*, I've finally calmed down some. Summer's supposed to be relaxing anyway.

Around this time last year, I wrote a column called [Authority Figures](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/magazine/article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/ftl/99), which dealt with the cool planeswalker referencing cards in ***Magic** 2011*. ***Magic** 2012* carries this tradition one year further, although there are already some slight changes. The first big change was the actual 'walker lineup for this summer. I had always privately speculated on which of the original planeswalkers would get rotated out. When I saw the ***Magic** 2012* feature poster (with [Gideon Jura](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gideon+Jura) dead center, and [Sorin Markov](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sorin+Markov) lurking in the background), I figured the rest had survived the cuts.

Turns out, I was right and wrong. While [Jace](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace%2C+Memory+Adept), [Chandra](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chandra%2C+the+Firebrand), and [Garruk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Garruk%2C+Primal+Hunter) all returned, they did so with some new gadgets and gizmos. Specifically, new art, converted mana costs, loyalty amounts, and abilities. In short, all five planeswalker cards this summer are new to the core set, which is a nice surprise.

I could do a traditional three-deck column featuring all three new 'walkers, but I tend to shy from building around planeswalkers. They're ridiculous enough on their own. Instead I'll examine a cycle of cards I hinted at a couple paragraphs ago. These cards were designed to match up with their chosen planeswalker in subtle but powerful ways. Luckily enough, they also stand alone as intriguing cards that I'm willing to probe today. Let's dive in.

The First Avenger
Okay, maybe not the actual first one (there have been fourteen other [Avengers](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?action=advancedamp;name=+[avenger]+![scavenger]) in **Magic** history), but I couldn't resist the reference to an upcoming movie. Superhero movies have let me down this summer, I'll be honest, but I'll see anything with Hugo Weaving in it.
