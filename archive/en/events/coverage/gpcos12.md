Grand Prix Costa Rica 2012
--------------------------


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration//mtg/images/daily/events/gpcr12/winner_620.jpg)


The battle ground may have been Costa Rica, but the victors came from far and wide. Shuhei Nakamura and Ben Stark led nearly the entire way through the tournament, from perfect runs on Day 1 to staying near perfect throughout the Draft portion of the tournament. Rounding out one of the best Top 8s ever to share a Draft table were Americans Josh Utter-Leyton, David Ochoa, David Sharfman, AJ Sacher, and Canadian Pascal Maynard. The lone Latin American representative in the Top 8 is the most experienced player from the region in the field, Brazilian Willy Edel. But it was the Hall of Famer Nakamura who navigated through this star-studded field to capture his fourth Grand Prix title.

Quarterfinals - David Sharfman vs. David Ochoa and Josh Utter-Leyton vs. Ben Stark
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


*by Nate Price*
David Ochoa was not particularly happy as I sat down to begin watching his Quarterfinals match.


"I'm on the play, and I mulled down to five, so make sure that when I lose, the coverage adequately reflects that. 'Ochoa fought valiantly, but in the end, his two-card deficit proved too difficult to overcome...'"


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration//mtg/images/daily/events/gpcr12/QF%20Sharfman%201.JPG)*David Sharfman*Ochoa got started with a bang, five card hand or no, running a [Krenko's Command](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Krenko%27s+Command) out and began smashing. Sharfman made a [Harbor Bandit](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Harbor+Bandit), but declined to block one of the tokens when given the opportunity.


"I fear the [Trumpet Blast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Trumpet+Blast)," he admitted.


"You know, I've played one of thise when I wasn't the attacking player. It did not go well for me," Ochoa laughed.


Sharfman was right to fear the [Trumpet Blast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Trumpet+Blast), as Ochoa used it to great effect when Sharfman tried to block with a [Watercourser](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Watercourser) on the following turn. Unfortunatly for Ochoa, he fought valiantly, but the two card deficit seemed too difficult to overcome. Stuck with only red sources, Ochoa had only played those two cards for the first six turns of the game. Sharfman, on the other hand, added a [Chronomaton](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chronomaton) and [Vedalken Entrancer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vedalken+Entrancer) to his side, attacking for a large chunk of Ochoa's life total each time. Without casting a third spell in the match, Ochoa conceded to Sharfman in the first game of the Top 8.


David Ochoa 0 â€“ David Sharfman 1


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration//mtg/images/daily/events/gpcr12/QF%20Stark%201.JPG)*Ben Stark* Meanwhile, on a table not too far away...


Ben Stark and Josh Utter-Leyton were in a slugfest of a match. Utter-Leyton had a [Silklash Spider](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Silklash+Spider) in play, but it was hiding under an [Oblivion Ring](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oblivion+Ring). Stark had a few dorks in play, including a [Furnace Whelp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Furnace+Whelp), [Mogg Flunkies](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mogg+Flunkies), and a [Timberpack Wolf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Timberpack+Wolf). Utter-Leyton only had an [Akroma's Memorial](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Akroma%27s+Memorial) in play, freshly cast, which prompted a "that's a good card" admission from Stark. Stark had Utter-Leyton down to a very low life total, however, and after one swing, he was in peril of dying on the following attack, He didn't have enough things to slide into play to stop the onslaught, and Stark was able to find a way arQF Stark 1ound the one creature Utter-Leyton did play, taking the first game in their Quarterfinal match.


Ben Stark 1 - Josh Utter-Leyton 0


For the second game, Ochoa once again had to mulligan. Sharfman started out with a [Chronomaton](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chronomaton) and a [Kraken Hatchling](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kraken+Hatchling), allowing him to begin growing his robot straight away. On the other side, Ochoa had an interesting start of two Rings of Valkas. Unfortunately, he didn't have anything to follow them up with, while Sharfman made a [Wind Drake](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wind+Drake) and began attacking with his [Chronomaton](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chronomaton) for two.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration//mtg/images/daily/events/gpcr12/QF%20Ochoa%202.JPG)*David Ochoa*  Things were oddly reminiscent of the first game, where Ochoa played two spells and then the match was over. Sharfman had a huge advantage on the board, and things got even more out of hand as he played a [Mark of the Vampire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mark+of+the+Vampire) on the [Wind Drake](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wind+Drake) and moved to attack. He only sent the Drake, prompting Ochoa to [Unsummon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Unsummon) it mid-combat. This gave Sharfman leave to pass the turn with one mana up, which he used to pump his [Chronomaton](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chronomaton) after Ochoa passed the turn right back.


Ochoa was dropped to 10, and still hadn't added anything else to the board. When he finally did make a commitment, it was an [Arms Dealer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arms+Dealer), which he put one Ring on, leaving two mana available. This allowed him to block the 3/3 [Chronomaton](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chronomaton) and sacrifice the [Arms Dealer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arms+Dealer) to kill a freshly-cast [Faerie Invaders](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Faerie+Invaders). Still, Ochoa dropped to 7. Sharfman kept adding more threats to the board, and Ochoa kept doing nothing. Within two more attacks, Ochoa was disappointed and dead.


"My deck does do more than this, I swear," he said with a sad look on his face. He didn't even really get to play **Magic** as he mulliganned into oblivion.


"Three one-land hands, three mulligans," he lamented after the match.


David Ochoa 0 â€“ David Sharfman 2

Stark had a [Volcanic Strength](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Volcanic+Strength) on a [Timberpack Wolf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Timberpack+Wolf) that was eating away at the green/red Utter-Leyton. I didn't get to sit down for long before the 4/4 beatings became lethal.

Quarterfinals - Willy Edel vs. Pascal Maynard
---------------------------------------------


*by Marc Calderaro*
### Game 1


Willy Edel opened with a [Knight of Infamy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Knight+of+Infamy), his White-Black Exalted-like deck, hoping to get there against Pascal Maynard's White-Green assault. Edel continued with a [Attended Knight](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Attended+Knight) and kept things cruising.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration//mtg/images/daily/events/gpcr12/QF%20-%20Maynard%20and%20Edel.JPG)Maynard Captain's Call was the first play from him, but he followed with a [Crusader of Odric](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crusader+of+Odric) and a [Warclamp Mastiff](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Warclamp+Mastiff). That seemed all right until a [Healer of the Pride](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Healer+of+the+Pride) started to get Edel's life total out of control. It was 21-13 in his favor when he swung with a double-exalted Knight thanks to another [Aven Squire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aven+Squire).


This continued for a few turns while Maynard tried to add enough creatures to stop Edel's madness. Around 5 life, thanks to a timely Captain's Call and [Aven Squire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aven+Squire), making the [Crusade](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crusade)r very big, Maynard stabilized with the totals 13-5. The only reason Edel was so low himself was because he'd taken some hits rather that lose any of his critical guys giving him the advantageous board.


Eventually the [Aven Squire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aven+Squire)s traded, while Maynard sunk to two life. He was still close but with the board now stalled he just needed for find an answer, and his deck had them.


However, it was Edel who found it. A [Sign in Blood](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sign+in+Blood). Edel targeted the Canadian and Edel earned the first game.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration//mtg/images/daily/events/gpcr12/QF%20-%20Maynard.JPG)*Pascal Maynard*Willy Edel 1 â€“ 0 Pascal Maynard


### Game 2


Ajani's Sunstriker and an early Timberpack Wolves traded for the two players and a growing [Chronomaton](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chronomaton) from Edel hit an [Oblivion Ring](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oblivion+Ring) from Maynard.


And then a weird little thing happened â€“ two [Pillarfield Ox](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pillarfield+Ox) faced off against one another. Maynard turned to me and said, "Yes, this is a Top 8 match."


Edel neglected to weigh in on the matter; he was busy suiting up his own Ox with a [Mark of the Vampire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mark+of+the+Vampire) and bashing in. This scared Maynard enough that he tried to double-block, but Edel had the blowout [Divine Verdict](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Divine+Verdict) and the Ox remained alive.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration//mtg/images/daily/events/gpcr12/QF%20-%20Edel.JPG)*Willy Edel* Oh, had I failed to mention that the two decks also both had [Healer of the Pride](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Healer+of+the+Pride)? So after attackers the score was still 24-22 in Edel's favor. After another Ox attack it became 17-29.


With an [Angelic Benediction](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Angelic+Benediction) and a [Ring of Thune](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ring+of+Thune) to back this Ox up, it might just get there. Maynard was despondent. He was starting to only draw land. He had an Ajani's Sunstriker a Garruk's Packleader and that [Healer of the Pride](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Healer+of+the+Pride) and he was still losing. After an [Attended Knight](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Attended+Knight) from Edel, Maynard at least started looking like he was losing to a respectable board state.


The Ring only stayed on the Ox long enough to make it a 5/7. He moved it to the knight to create an acceptable blocker. Maynard was still bleeding life. It was 28-10. How was he losing to a blood-thirsty Ox? Could he ever stop drawing land? There are many answers in his deck to a [Pillarfield Ox](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pillarfield+Ox).


4-34. Maynard was still trickling life points. He had now drawn six land in a row.


He never drew out of it.


Willy Edel 2 â€“ 0 Pascal Maynard



Quarterfinals - Shuhei Nakamura vs. A.J. Sacher
-----------------------------------------------


*by Marc Calderaro*
It's good to see A.J. Sacher back in the Top 8 of a Grand Prix. The last time he was up here was back in Denver in 2008. Before then and since then he has been a perennial face and is a prolific streamer. To qualify for the next Pro Tour, all he has to do is beat Shuhei Nakamura sporting a deck with [Talrand, Sky Summoner](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Talrand%2C+Sky+Summoner), [Jace, Memory Adept](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace%2C+Memory+Adept) and a crap-ton of instant-awesomeness. Easy peasy, right?


### Game 1


Sacher opened with a [Duty-Bound Dead](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duty-Bound+Dead) into a [Knight of Infamy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Knight+of+Infamy). He quickly took some points off Nakamura's slower deck which just played out a [War Priest of Thune](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=War+Priest+of+Thune).


After sustaining some blows, Nakamura tried to go for the long game with [Talrand, Sky Summoner](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Talrand%2C+Sky+Summoner). It'll be hard, but if he could get some key spells off he can profitably trade with Sacher's less powerful creatures. Nakamura made a 2/2 Drake with an [Essence Scatter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Essence+Scatter) stopping a [Bloodthrone Vampire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodthrone+Vampire), but he was still falling behind.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration//mtg/images/daily/events/gpcr12/QF%20-%20Nakamura.JPG)*Shuhei Nakamura*Sacher was still swinging in. He made the totals 8-24 thanks to [Mark of the Vampire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mark+of+the+Vampire) on the double-exalted Knight. Nakamura fought back with Captain's Call to net another Drake. But it was going to be hard to block a creature with Protection from White with a bunch of White dorks.


Sacher gave Nakamura some tokens to work with to represent the Soldiers. The tint of them was yellow, so Nakamura threw one in front of the Pro-White knight saying, "It's Yellow, right?"


A.J. was not biting. "No. It still counts as White."


Nakamura smiled, but it must have been hard to keep smiling with a giant knight beating you into submission. A turn later, Nakamura submit.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration//mtg/images/daily/events/gpcr12/QF%20-%20Sacher.JPG)*A.J. Sacher*A.J. Sacher 1 â€“ 0 Shuhei Nakamura


### Game 2


A [Watercourser](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Watercourser) came from Nakamura and his next-turn [Augur of Bolas](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Augur+of+Bolas) whiffed, throwing three cards to the bottom. Sacher pumped his fist. His own board contained a [Tormented Soul](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tormented+Soul) and a [Bloodthrone Vampire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodthrone+Vampire). Any change in board state would not favor him. The Soul beat Nakamura to 16.


The Japanese player didn't mind too much about missing with Augur, or going down to 16, because he found a [Talrand, Sky Summoner](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Talrand%2C+Sky+Summoner) right on time. And thanks to another Captain's Call Nakamura had tons of tokens. Oh wait, did I say one Captain's Call? I meant two. Two Captain's Calls. That's eight tokens in two turns.


Sacher had a [Giant Scorpion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Giant+Scorpion), [Ravenous Rats](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ravenous+Rats) and [Duty-Bound Dead](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duty-Bound+Dead) for him. A [Servant of Nefarox](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Servant+of+Nefarox) came soon after, pumping the [Tormented Soul](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tormented+Soul) for an inevitable clock. 3/3 Unblockable is nothing to sneeze at â€“ just ask [Riverfall Mimic](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Riverfall+Mimic).


However, I'm not a doctor, but a constantly produced stream of 2/2 Drakes also seems like a decent clock. And a [Riverfall Mimic](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Riverfall+Mimic) would likely confirm that as well.


The [Tormented Soul](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tormented+Soul) knocked Nakamura down until it was 15-11, but the Drakes were in the air and the Soldiers were on the ground. It was elementary from there. Sacher could find the way to stop the token inevitability. And Nakamura tied the games at one.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration//mtg/images/daily/events/gpcr12/QF%20-%20Nakamura%20token%20pile.JPG) A.J. Sacher 1 â€“ 1 Shuhei Nakamura


### Game 3


Nakamura started with his Planeswalker in his opening grip. If he could get to Jace and protect it, he could advance to the semifinals. If he could do it. Sacher was going to make sure that couldn't happen. Even though there was a mulligan to five, Sacher's deck looked to provide some early threats. His [Walking Corpse](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Walking+Corpse) traded with the [War Priest of Thune](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=War+Priest+of+Thune), and two Goblins from Krenko's Command started to work on Nakamura's life total.


[Servant of Nefarox](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Servant+of+Nefarox) and [Duskmantle Prowler](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duskmantle+Prowler) made for big attackers, but Nakamura had an [Aven Squire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aven+Squire) and a [Griffin Protector](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Griffin+Protector) back to block when he played the [Jace, Memory Adept](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace%2C+Memory+Adept) and drew a card. Nakamura landed the 'walker while still at a high life total, but had a hand of land and a single [Encrust](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Encrust). Even though Nakamura started two cards up, if they are just going to be land, it doesn't really matter.


Another [Augur of Bolas](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Augur+of+Bolas) whiffed, and although the Japanese player was surviving he was yet to win. It was 13-18. Sacher was still putting up some decent threats and was making Nakamura work for everything. Nakamura threw one creature after the next in front of Jace, as the amount of counters grew to seven. That's ultimate amount, my friends.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration//mtg/images/daily/events/gpcr12/QF%20-%20Naka%2C%20Jace.JPG)However, Nakamura was all-but out of creatures. He tapped out to make a Talrand Sky Summoner and an [Encrust](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Encrust) on the [Duskmantle Prowler](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duskmantle+Prowler). After that, he had only land in his hand.


Sacher attacked with everything. The [Griffin Protector](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Griffin+Protector) jumped in the way and died for the cause. Jace sunk to 3 counters. Talrand and [Aven Squire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aven+Squire) continued to just chump-block. Sacher's chin rested on his first. His opponent's life total still hadn't changed. However, after a Captain's Call, Nakamura felt comfortable to take four life off Sacher. It was A.J.'s turn to start losing life, and there were 19 cards left in Sacher's library.


After a second Captain's Call, Nakamura felt comfortable not just attacking his opponent, but destroying him. A.J. Sacher drew for his turn and saw his Semi-final hopes disappear. He extended his hand to the Hall of Famer.


He fought well for a five-card hand, and almost overwhelmed a Jace. But "almost" only counts in [Cruel Ultimatum](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cruel+Ultimatum)s and [Chaos Orb](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chaos+Orb)s.


Shuhei Nakamura 2 â€“ 1 A.J. Sacher



Semifinals - Shuhei Nakamura vs. Willy Edel
-------------------------------------------


*by Marc Calderaro*
"So you have the Jace I opened?" Willy Edel joked. "I told this guy [points to me] before the match that I would die to that card." Shuhei Nakamura had indeed received that Planeswalker, and used it to dismantle A.J. Sacher to get here. Edel was the lone representative from the southern hemisphere left in the tournament. And from the man who was considering leaving the game just a short time ago, finds himself qualified for the next Pro Tour and with some significant Pro points, with a Top 32 finish at Pro Tour Barcelona and two Top 16 Grand Prix finishes at Vancouver and Sao Paolo.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration//mtg/images/daily/events/gpcr12/SF%20-%20Naka%20and%20Edel.JPG)I don't think we'll be seeing Willy Edel leaving anytime soon. Although he might be leaving soon from this specific tournament. Shuhei Nakamura's deck is fierce, real fierce.


### Game 1


Willy Edel started with plays on turns one, two and three even after some nasty mulliganing. [War Falcon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=War+Falcon), Ajani's Sunstriker and a [Ring of Thune](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ring+of+Thune). Sadly, he hadn't found the third land to equip the Ring yet so it sat alone.


Nakamura's start was as defensive as could be. Just what his deck wanted. An [Aven Squire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aven+Squire), [Watercourser](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Watercourser) and [Divination](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Divination). This allowed him to get set up for the mid-game while Edel was still stuck in the early portions of the game still. The Japanese player made a [Talrand, Sky Summoner](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Talrand%2C+Sky+Summoner) and then two [Augur of Bolas](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Augur+of+Bolas), each netting an [Essence Scatter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Essence+Scatter). For the foreseeable future, the creatures on Edel's board would have to do.


Edel was at least growing his Sunstriker, but with a three-power Drake attacking each turn (thanks to the Exalted trigger on the [Aven Squire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aven+Squire)), and without the ability to cast another creature (at least not for the next two summonings), things weren't looking good.


A 4/4 Ajani's Sunstriker attacked, with the aid of [Angelic Benediction](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Angelic+Benediction), but Nakamura had things under wraps. He used a [Show of Valor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Show+of+Valor) on his Talrand and the legendary creature made short work of the cat. Oh, and Nakamura got another Drake for his efforts.


Nakamura untapped started taking away chunks of Edel's life in four-point increments and won the first game.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration//mtg/images/daily/events/gpcr12/SF%20-%20Edel.JPG)*Will Edel*Shuhei Nakamura 1 â€“ 0 Willy Edel


### Game 2


The Brazilian started this game out with [Chronomaton](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chronomaton). It grew into a 4/4 before anything else was cast. This game was a bit of a slow-burn.


Nakamura opened with a Captain's Call, then [Divination](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Divination) and [Augur of Bolas](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Augur+of+Bolas). For the third time in the Top 8, the Hall of Famer's Augur failed to find an instant or sorcery, though Nakamura got excited for a minute and revealed his [Talrand, Sky Summoner](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Talrand%2C+Sky+Summoner) as if it were going to his hand before chuckling and putting it on the bottom. Oops.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration//mtg/images/daily/events/gpcr12/SF%20-%20Nakamura.JPG)*Shuhei Nakamura*Nakamura composed himself and acted as if it ain't no thang, casting a [Jace, Memory Adept](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace%2C+Memory+Adept) with the Soldiers and Augur to block. By this time, Edel had made an [Attended Knight](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Attended+Knight), using it, the [Chronomaton](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chronomaton) and the 1/1 Solider to knock Jace down to two counters immediately. Now, I say "immediately" but I actually mean, "after Edel put ten cards from his library into his graveyard."


The next turn the same thing happened. Ten more cards hit the bin. Edel at least had a [Pacifism](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pacifism) for the [Augur of Bolas](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Augur+of+Bolas), but Nakamura had [War Priest of Thune](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=War+Priest+of+Thune) to add not one, but two more blockers, killing the aura in the process.


Ten more cards hit the bin. Edel had no way to remove the Jace. He thought about his outs for a minute, but then extended his hand.


"I told you that Jace would kill me!" Edel smiled. Though he would've loved to go to the finals, he had just earned himself a trip to the next Pro Tour. He was excited enough.


Nakamura wryly scooped up his cards and let out a slight smirk. He was on to yet another Grand Prix finals. And with the way his deck looks, it might just be another win.


Shuhei Nakamura 2 â€“ 0 Will Edel



Semifinals - Ben Stark vs. David Sharfman
-----------------------------------------


*by Nate Price*
There was an incredible amount of hilarious banter between all of the American players as they sat around watching Stark and Sharfman shuffle before the game.


Stark started recounting his matches. "I played literally everyone I know over the course of the tournament. Though I guess that's kind of how these things go. I'm like 2-2 against Ochoa, and like 0-10 against Kibler," who was walking nearby.


"Well we're all 0-10 against Kibler," chimed in Josh Utter-Leyton from a nearby chair.


Stark started off with a mulligan, prompting a round of jokes about how much each player had forced their opponents to mulligan.


"Ochoa mulliganned three times against me," Sharfman pointed out.


"Yeah, Wrapter [Utter-Leyton] mulliganed both games against me, too."


### Game 1


Stark was the first to attack, playing a [Reckless Brute](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reckless+Brute) and attacking for 3. Sharfman made a [Scroll Thief](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scroll+Thief), but chose not to block as Stark crashed in again. Stark passed the turn with four lands available, likely signaling something. Sharfman bit and attacked in with his [Scroll Thief](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scroll+Thief). Stark tapped his lands and virtually windmill slammed his [Yeva, Nature's Herald](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Yeva%2C+Nature%27s+Herald) into play, blocking the likely surprised [Scroll Thief](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scroll+Thief). After combat, Sharfman replaced the Thief with a [Harbor Bandit](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Harbor+Bandit). When Stark attacked in with his team on the following turn, Sharfman curiously let himself go down to 7. After combat, Stark added a [Krenko, Mob Boss](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Krenko%2C+Mob+Boss), to his side, prompting a chuckle from a nearby Brian Kibler.


At this point, Stark was miles ahead. Sharfman made a move to get back into thing with a [Mark of the Vampire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mark+of+the+Vampire) on his Bandit, giving him a 5/5 lifelinking critter to stem the tide. Stark attacked in with just his Brute, and Sharfman was more than happy to block. After combat, a [Flames of the Firebrand](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flames+of+the+Firebrand) finished the big lifelinker off. Sharfman drew his card, played a land, and immediately fired off a [Public Execution](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Public+Execution), not giving Stark a chance to activate Krenko. That left Stark with a lone [Yeva, Nature's Herald](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Yeva%252C%2BNature%2527s%2BHerald) in play. [Yeva, Nature's Herald](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Yeva%252C%2BNature%2527s%2BHerald) began the beats, dropping Sharfman to within a single remaining lethal attack. When Sharfman tried to make a pair of blockers, a [Watercourser](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Watercourser) and a [Vedalken Entrancer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vedalken+Entrancer), Stark used [Prey Upon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Prey+Upon) to kill the Entrancer, forcing Sharfman to have to block with his [Watercourser](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Watercourser), once again clearing his board. On the following turn, he came up with nothing, and Stark took the first game thanks to a backbreaking [Yeva, Nature's Herald](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Yeva%2C+Nature%27s+Herald).

### Game 2


"I've only ever seen one person play around [Yeva, Nature's Herald](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Yeva%252C%2BNature%2527s%2BHerald), and that's Shuhei [Nakamura]. He did it to me in the Swiss," Stark explaine. "I had a pair of [Forest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest)s and [Mountain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mountain)s open, passed the turn right back to him after he played a three-drop, and he just passed it right back. It was insane. Like 99% of people don't play around it there, so I didn't expect you to, either."


Stark started the final game off with an incredibly fast start. His [Arbor Elf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arbor+Elf) allowed an early [Canyon Minotaur](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Canyon+Minotaur), but Sharfman kept ahead of it with a [Scroll Thief](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scroll+Thief) bearing a [Mark of the Vampire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mark+of+the+Vampire). The 3/5 lifelinker was quite the obstacle and negated any potential damage Stark could do at the moment to boot. Stark cast a [Mindclaw Shaman](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mindclaw+Shaman), revelaing a hand of good blue creatures, including a [Watercourser](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Watercourser), [Vedalken Entrancer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vedalken+Entrancer), [Faerie Invaders](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Faerie+Invaders), and [Archaeomancer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Archaeomancer), but no spells to cast for free. By this point, Sharfman was forced to stop attacking with his [Scroll Thief](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scroll+Thief), as Stark had enough creatures to kill it if he gang blocked, and it was much more worth it to have a 3/5 lifelinking blocker. Stark added a [Furnace Whelp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Furnace+Whelp) to his team, giving him a way to rise above the ground stall, but he knew Sharfman held a [Faerie Invaders](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Faerie+Invaders) in his hand. Unwilling to attack into it, Stark just passed the turn until Sharfman dropped it into play. Sharfman had also taken the time to play the [Watercourser](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Watercourser) and [Harbor Bandit](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Harbor+Bandit), making his board a bit more impressive than Stark's.


With the Invaders now in play, Stark used [Flames of the Firebrand](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flames+of+the+Firebrand) to push it out of the way, clearing the way for his [Furnace Whelp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Furnace+Whelp) to begin whittling away at Sharfman's life total. Sharfman started pressing his advantage sending the [Watercourser](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Watercourser) and an unblockable Bandit. The [Mindclaw Shaman](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mindclaw+Shaman) traded with the Courser, but Sharfman still dropped Stark to 8.


Stark began to battle back, and in a big way. The [Mogg Flunkies](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mogg+Flunkies) and [Canyon Minotaur](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Canyon+Minotaur) he added to his side were given free rein to attack after a [Turn to Slag](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Turn+to+Slag) removed the 3/5 lifelinking [Scroll Thief](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scroll+Thief) from the equation. With such massive creatures at his disposal, he looked to soon be able to make mincemeat of Sharfman's life total. A big swing dropped Sharfman to 9. At the end of Stark's turn, Sharmfan used his Entrancer on himself in an attempt to get something into his graveyard that the [Archaeomancer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Archaeomancer) he was holding could return, but he hit nothing of value. Sharfman decided to attack with his remaining two creatures, a [Harbor Bandit](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Harbor+Bandit) and [Vedalken Entrancer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vedalken+Entrancer), dropping Stark to four. After combat, he simply unloaded his hand, an [Archaeomancer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Archaeomancer) and a [Watercourser](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Watercourser), providing enough defense to survive the turn, and a big enough threat that Stark couldn't attack for fear of the lethal counterattack. Stark simply passed the turn. When Sharfman drew a [Tricks of the Trade](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tricks+of+the+Trade) for his turn, he had all the unblockable damage he needed to finish the second game.

### Game 3


"You win again," Stark asked Shuhei Nakamura as he walked over to hecck out the match?


When Namakura gave him the thumbs up, Stark broke into laughter. "So fast! He just crushes everybody in like five minutes." At least the players in this match knew who they were going to be facing in the finals. Not that they felt any better...


Sharfman was the first on the board with a [Watercourser](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Watercourser), but Stark was the first to attack, his [Reckless Brute](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reckless+Brute) fearlessly attacking into the Courser for 3. Sharfman attacked back for 3, pumping his [Watercourser](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Watercourser) once before playing a [Harbor Bandit](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Harbor+Bandit). Respecting the power of the unblockable Bandit, Stark immediately offed it with [Flames of the Firebrand](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flames+of+the+Firebrand). Stark kept building his board with a [Canyon Minotaur](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Canyon+Minotaur), but things soon took a decidedly different turn.


Sharfman played [Sands of Delirium](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sands+of+Delirium), giving him an alternative to winning the game through pure damage. Despite the new route to victory, Sharfman pressed the advantage he had, using his mana to cast more creatures, such as a [Faerie Invaders](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Faerie+Invaders), [Harbor Bandit](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Harbor+Bandit), and [Wind Drake](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wind+Drake), presenting a large amount of unblockable damage. When he added a [Kraken Hatchling](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kraken+Hatchling) to his side, he had enough defense to prevent Stark from trying anything funny. Even with the Sands on the table, Sharfman was more than content to ride his evasion to the victory, winning through the tried and true method of damaging his opponent to death.


Ben Stark 1 â€“ David Sharfman 2



Finals â€“ Shuhei Nakamura vs. David Sharfman
-------------------------------------------


*by Marc Calderaro*
"Don't beat me took quickly, please." David Sharfman smiled as if he were joking, but I don't think he was. Nakamura's deck has been a beast and a looming shadow over the over everything throughout this Top 8.


Ben Stark chimed in from the crowd to no one in particular, "We'll be going to dinner soon." I'm sure that didn't help Sharfman's confidence level. "Five minutes, tops."


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration//mtg/images/daily/events/gpcr12/Finals%20-%20Sharfman%201.JPG)However things looked up for Sharfman early and he could do nothing but smile when Shuhei Nakamura had to mulligan to five cards. This was an early-game victory for him. He told me not to put that into the coverage. I didn't listen.


### Game 1


Nakamura stuck a [Watercourser](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Watercourser) as his first play of the game. Sharfman was able to get an early [Chronomaton](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chronomaton) and a [Harbor Bandit](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Harbor+Bandit) on the board and used the latter to take Nakamura to 17 and deal the first points of damage in the game. Sharfman used Nakamura's mulligans to press an advantage.


The Japanese, though down on cards, showed the sheer power of his deck by hitting a turn-four Talrand's Invocation with an [Aven Squire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aven+Squire), [Show of Valor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Show+of+Valor) and [Redirect](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Redirect) still in his hand. Before Sharfman untapped, his [Chronomaton](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chronomaton) grew into a 2/2.


Sharfman left everything untapped and had attacked with nothing, choosing to keep five mana open for whatever Nakamura could throw at him. Naka threw the two Drakes and his [Watercourser](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Watercourser). Sharfman played a [Faerie Invaders](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Faerie+Invaders), but Nakamura had a trump in [Show of Valor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Show+of+Valor). After the 3/3 Flyer died, Nakamura ruled the skies.


After two attacks the total went from 17-14 to 17-8. Sharfman was on back-peddling. Not out of the game by a long shot, but he couldn't hold back attackers anymore and still expect to win. Heeding my hive-mind advice, he swung in with his [Chronomaton](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chronomaton) and [Harbor Bandit](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Harbor+Bandit), taking Nakamura to 12, while leaving back a 2/2 [Wind Drake](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wind+Drake).


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration//mtg/images/daily/events/gpcr12/Finals%20-%20Nakamura.JPG)Nakamura attacked with one Drake (pumped by the [Aven Squire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aven+Squire)). Sharfman thought for a bit, then cast a Public Execution. He pointed the card at the non-attacking Drake. "This guy." The token disappeared and Shuhei passed the turn without having done any damage.


Most people observing at this point posed the question why Shuhei didn't use his [Redirect](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Redirect) on the Public Execution. It was a stumper for everyone except for Shuhei. The wording on [Public Execution](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Public+Execution) reads "Destroy target creature an opponent controls", so casting [Redirect](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Redirect) would do little good. It was amazing that Nakamura knew that well enough to not even give a second thought, as most other people in the room where confused by that play.


Though Nakamura had ended his turn without having dealt damage, the same could not be said for Sharfman. He attacked with his Drank and [Harbor Bandit](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Harbor+Bandit) before dropping a [Watercourser](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Watercourser). The totals were 7-8.


Nakamura had his [Talrand, Sky Summoner](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Talrand%2C+Sky+Summoner) and Captain's Call sitting in his hand, but not nearly enough mana to cast them both in the same turn. He started tapping damage out on the table.


He made three Soldier tokens and dropped Sharfman to 5 with a 3/3 Drake attack. Sharfman drew two cards from [Divination](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Divination) and retreated into his brain. He had four mana left open. He used two of it to make [Harbor Bandit](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Harbor+Bandit) unblockable at take Nakamura to 4. [4-5]. He had a [Negate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Negate) in his hand, awaiting a juicy target.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration//mtg/images/daily/events/gpcr12/Finals%20-%20Naka%20sleeping.JPG)A Drake crack-back made it 4-2. Nakamura cast Talrand. He had a [Watercourser](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Watercourser), [Aven Squire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aven+Squire), three tokens and a the legend to block. Sharfman had a [Harbor Bandit](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Harbor+Bandit) that could go past all of them. He tapped two, made it unblockable and took Nakamura to one.


Sharfman went for the win. He used his remaining mana on an [Essence Drain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Essence+Drain) leaving nothing open for the [Negate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Negate). Against mere mortals, this would have been more than enough for the win, but Nakamura had the craziest trump sitting in his hand. Remember it? It was [Redirect](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Redirect).


This deck was so ridiculous, Nakamura mulliganed to five and he was gifted the right cards at the right time, played the right way to still get the win.


Granted, that [Redirect](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Redirect) could have been a boring old [Negate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Negate), because with the extra 2/2 Drake from Talrand, Nakamura was still likely to earn the "W', but still. C'mon...[Redirect](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Redirect) for the win? Awesome.


Shuhei Nakamura 1 â€“ 0 David Sharfman


### Game 2


After having to think about keeping his two-land opener, Sharfman kept. The Floridian was going to have to draw well, as Nakamura started off with [Aven Squire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aven+Squire) and Captain's Call right on time. A turn later, there were two Drake tokens on the field thanks to Talrand's Invocation. He had eight-power-worth of creatures on turn five. And Sharfman was about to find his third land.


Though Sharfman stumbled on his third and fourth land drops, he hit them on subsequent turns. He made a [Scroll Thief](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scroll+Thief) and [Wind Drake](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wind+Drake). He started to catch himself up on the board, but was obviously wary about the time of hand Nakamura had waiting him, and the life deficit where he already found himself.


The Japanese player bounced Sharfman's Drake and knocked his opponent to 9. All Nakamura had to do now was keep his opponent off-balance enough, and he would have this Grand Prix sewn up.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration//mtg/images/daily/events/gpcr12/Finals%20-Sharfman%202.JPG) Behind me, Ben Stark sighed. He was rooting for his state-mate as hard as he could, but even he knew the situation was dire. Sharfman had a desperate play of [Mark of the Vampire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mark+of+the+Vampire) on his [Scroll Thief](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scroll+Thief). He was hoping the ifelink could buy him the time he needed.


But without any other support, the fliers ([Aven Squire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aven+Squire) and two Drakes) took him to 7, then 2. Nakamura was waiting with two [Essence Scatter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Essence+Scatter) in his hand. Sharfman tried to make something happen. But sadly, those somethings were in creature form. And so with four quick taps of land, and two quick flashes of counterspells, Nakamura was back on top of the world.


Shuhei Nakamura 2 â€“ 0 David Sharfman


Shuhei Nakamura, after just missing the Top 4 at the Player's Championship on tie-breakers, gets receives justice and picks up his fourth Grand Prix win.


Congratulations, Shuhei!



The Top 5 Cards of Grand Prix Costa Rica
----------------------------------------


*by Event Coverage Staff*
Â 


![Talrand's Invocation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Talrand%27s+Invocation)


Â 

### 5. [Talrand's Invocation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Talrand%27s+Invocation)


Four power of flying creatures for four mana.


Seems legit.


This card is absurdly powerful, and it has the power to single-handedly win games, dropping a large amount of flying beef onto the table for a minimal mana commitment. Add in the fact that it can be brought back by [Archaeomancer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Archaeomancer), and you have a recipe for a winning deck. This card was a major player in every successful blue deck of the weekend, including Shuhei Nakamura's winning decklist. In a format where evasion rules, such as this one, the most efficient evader rules the roost, and in this case, it's the incredibly powerful [Talrand's Invocation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Talrand%27s+Invocation). If you could only have it in the same deck as [Talrand, Sky Summoner](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Talrand%2C+Sky+Summoner)...like Nakamura did...twice...


Since evasion rules this format, it is hard to overlook how important the flying on the Drakes is. Able to fly over any defenses an opponent can set up the Drakes from Invocation are capable of ending the game in a mere five turns. Support them with any sort of defense, and they will hand you the game. They are also exceptional at defense, able to trade with many of the important smaller creatures of the format, or at least able to deter an army of 1/1s from attacking if left back. Since the creatures come as a pair, you are free to attack for 2 with one while leaving the other back as a defender. This incredible versatility combined with the utter power the card possesses really shined this weekend in multiple of Shuhei Nakamura's decks.


  

Â 
Â 


![Jace, Memory Adept](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Jace%2C+Memory+Adept)


Â 

### 4. [Jace, Memory Adept](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace%2C+Memory+Adept)


Jace seems like kind of a cheaty inclusion here in the Top 5 cards because he is so obviously powerful. I mean, he's a Planeswalker, which is one big point, and he has an ability that is ludicrously more powerful in Limited than Constructed (the mill), which is a second big point. Add to that his key role in both the 8-0 deck Ben Stark used to roll through Day 1 and Shuhei Nakamura's tournament winning deck, and you have an easy inclusion into the Top 5 cards. The utter power of his mill ability, which ends the game after two or three activations, is understated, even as powerful as it is, until you see a player take an unwinnable game and just turn it around simply because they played a Jace. He may be the single most unfair card in the format, moreso than [Thundermaw Hellkite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thundermaw+Hellkite), more than [Thragtusk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thragtusk) and [Sands of Delirium](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sands+of+Delirium). Jace just ends games, and he did so this weekend in spectacular fashion, so he gets to be in the Top 5.


  

Â 
Â 


![Silklash Spider](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Silklash+Spider)


Â 

### 3. [Silklash Spider](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Silklash+Spider)


It's fitting that both [Silklash Spider](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Silklash+Spider) and [Talrand's Invocation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Talrand%27s+Invocation) should make the Top 5 cards when they were the two cards that Ben Stark was deciding between in his first pack of his first Draft on Sunday. Especially when you consider that whichever he didn't pick ended up in Shuhei Namakura's deck, siting just to his left.


He picked the Spider. Shuhei won the tournament.


Now now, before you ride me, Stark crushed that pod, riding his massive, 2/7, long-legged Spider into a Top 8 berth. David Ochoa used it to great effect in his first Draft deck, and Josh Utter-Leyton managed to get it stuck under an [Oblivion Ring](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oblivion+Ring) twice in his Quarterfinals match against Ben Stark. What makes the card so good is that all of that talk about evasion being important? Well [Silklash Spider](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Silklash+Spider) kills fliers dead. Hell, it kills blue decks dead. Add to that it has an enormous toughness, and you have a nasty critter. When was the last time you saw someone bash through a seven toughness without some ridiculous tricks? It's impossible for the blue decks to beat, difficult for the green decks to bash through, and it's hard for the red decks to burn away. Simply put, the Spider is a boss.


  

Â 
Â 


![Captain's Call](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Captain%27s+Call)


Â 

### 2. [Captain's Call](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Captain%27s+Call)


There is something to be said for spending four mana for more than one creature. [Captain's Call](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Captain%27s+Call) is reminiscent of [Lingering Souls](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lingering+Souls) in its flexibility. Sure, the tokens don't fly. Sure, it costs four mana at once rather than over two turns. Sure, it only makes three tokens.


But bear with me.


First, look at how it performed in Pascal Maynard's Top 8 deck. With an aggressive white base, the tokens served as part of an attacking army, as well as a powerful way to pump his [Crusader of Odric](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crusader+of+Odric). In this light, it can be seen to be an aggressive wunderkind, filling the role of enhancer and attacker all in one. In addition, the card creates multiple attackers, allowing armies to slip through cracks to bleed opponents to death, making it easier to sneak in for the last few points of damage later in the game.


Then, compare that to how it functioned in Shuhei Nakamura's winning deck, where he used it in conjunction with [Talrand, Sky Summoner](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Talrand%2C+Sky+Summoner), to create a Drake to attack with while hiding behind the Soldiers on the ground. In this role, it demonstrates how making multiple tokens can be very beneficial when a deck needs a defensive timeout. As long as the opposing team doesn't have trample, [Captain's Call](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Captain%27s+Call) acts ,at worst, as a [Fog](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fog), providing a one turn reprieve, and at best as three turns of chump blocking, which is often enough for the deck to either gain control or finish things off in the air. Both combined, you have a very solid card, one that earned its keep here at Grand Prix Costa Rica.

![Mark of the Vampire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Mark+of+the+Vampire)


Â 

### 1. [Mark of the Vampire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mark+of+the+Vampire)


It's rare that an Aura makes the list in a Limited format, but this is one time that an exception must be made. The format itself is rather light on hard removal, making creature enchantments like this and [Tricks of the Trade](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tricks+of+the+Trade) very powerful. What gives Mark the edge is the lifelink. There were many points over the course of the weekend where we saw players who had been pushed into a corner land a [Mark of the Vampire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mark+of+the+Vampire) on a creature and lifelink their way back into the game, often to a win. It works well with the evasion creatures, it works well with the beefy green creatures... it even works well on cards like [Scroll Thief](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scroll+Thief), which David Sharfman discovered as he used the combo to great success on his way to the Finals. This format is one perfectly positioned for Auras to shine, and [Mark of the Vampire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mark+of+the+Vampire) is the best of the bunch.
