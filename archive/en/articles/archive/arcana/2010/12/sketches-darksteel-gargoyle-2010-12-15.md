Welcome back to once again to Sketches! It's Darksteel Week, so we're digging deep into the vault to bring you a Darksteel card that's also a *Darksteel* card!

### Artist Portfolio

Artist [Ron Spencer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?action=advanced&artist=%5B%22Ron+Spencer%22%5D) has been around forever and has illustrated 226 cards in **Magic** history. He's still around, as evidenced by his ***Magic** 2011* card [Crystal Ball](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crystal+Ball).

### Art Description

The first step of the creation of a card's art is its art description. The art description tells the artist what the card will do, what its flavor is, and what the mood of the illustration should be. Here were the instructions Ron was given for [Darksteel Gargoyle](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Darksteel+Gargoyle):


> 
> Color: Artifact Creature
> 
> 
> Location: Inside the "Lumengrid" in a secret chamber
> 
> 
> Action: Show a darksteel gargoyle atop a pedastal that can become animated when charged with mana.
> 
> 
> Focus: The Gargoyle made of "darksteel" magic metal
> 
> 
> Mood: Wait â€˜til I come to life 
> 
> 
> 

### Sketch

Armed with that art description, Ron submitted a sketch to **Magic**'s creative team, complete with annotations.
