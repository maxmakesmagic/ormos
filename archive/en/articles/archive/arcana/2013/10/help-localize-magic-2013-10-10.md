Patrick "Trick" Jarrett oversees web content and social media for Magic, and acts as the publisher of DailyMTG.com and Magic content on the web. He's an ardent Commander player and lover of the game he's played since Ice Age. 







There's lots of moving parts to making **Magic** the awesome game it is today. For example, did you know that **Magic** is printed in eleven languages? We call the process of translating from English to one of the other ten languages "localization" because more goes into it than just a simple machine-translated algorithm. We want to convey the same sense and feeling from English into French or German or Korean or any of our other languages.

To accomplish this, we work with an organization called AlphaCRC. Whether it is cards, text on packaging, web content such as Planeswalker Points, or anything else, we work with them to get it localized. The difficulty comes from the fact that **Magic** is a complicated product and we greatly benefit from having people familiar with the game involved with the localization.

If you're interested in potentially working as a freelancer with AlphaCRC, you can go visit [their application](http://31.221.13.117:88/NewAlphaCareers/Careers.php) and fill out your information. Make sure you check "Translator (Games)."
