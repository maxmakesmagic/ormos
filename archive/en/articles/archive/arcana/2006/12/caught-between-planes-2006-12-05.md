Rath was Yawgmoth’s ever-expanding plane of flowstone. When it merged with parts of Dominaria as part of Yawgmoth’s interplanar invasion tactics during the Rath (*Tempest*) Block storyline, some Dominarian races became trapped in the interstitial void between the two planes.


You know these unfortunates as “shadow creatures.”


What would it look like to *become* a shadow creature? Check out the art of [Shadow Rift](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shadow+Rift) to see a person being drawn into the void between the planes.

These races could sometimes see and hear images in one or the other plane, but interaction was difficult. Here’s a shot of a Soltari creature trying to contact [Ertai, Wizard Adept](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Ertai%252C%2BWizard%2BAdept):

*Time Spiral* revived *Tempest* Block’s visual cues for shadow creatures along with the mechanic. Check out the effect of being “trapped between planes” on [Shadow Sliver](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shadow+Sliver) and [Looter il-Kor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Looter+il-Kor)—swirls of substance peel off of the creature, almost as though they’re being stretched between the boundaries of the overlapping planes.
