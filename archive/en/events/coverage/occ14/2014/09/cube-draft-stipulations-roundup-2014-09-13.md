CUBE DRAFT WITH STIPULATIONS ROUNDUP
====================================

 A longtime member of the Pro Tour and Grand Prix coverage staff, Nate Price now works making beautiful words for all of you lovely people as the community manager for organized play. When not covering events, he lords over the @MagicProTour Twitter account, ruling with an iron fist. 






This may have been the most anticipated format of the entire tournament, and it couldn't have come with stakes higher. The Wizards team had stormed back to within one point, and momentum was now on their side. It was all down to this final format: Cube Draft with Stipulations. There were a total of fifteen different stipulations to alter the draft, with one being duplicated such that each team had one drafter adhering to it. [Here](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/occ14/cube-draft-stipulations-2014-09-13) are a list of the stipulations.


Team representatives Scott MacCallum and Aaron Forsythe approached moderator Lee Sharpe to select their sealed set of stipulations. As the visiting team, the Community Team chose their weapons. After a Price is Right-style selection method of picking the envelope that got the most "oohs", the teams returned to their respective areas to see what they drew. The teams then had a very limited amount of time to assign the various stipulations to a member of the team.



 On camera, Ryan Spain and Sean Plott drafted the judged stipulations. Spain was forced to draft the card that appeared the least threatening, while Plott (appropriately) selected the card that sounded the most like an arcade game. Judging flavor for Spain was his ex-Limited Resources partner Marshall Sutcliffe.

There was no shortage of trolling between these two guys.

Meanwhile Sean Plott had to draft under the watchful eye of Brian David-Marshall.

In the end, it was clear that watching players have to justify their picks was a viewer favorite, especially the semantics of flavor drafting.

Once play began, things got frisky. Bjorn Andreasson was the first to strike blood.

Tom LaPille was one of the big winners on the Wizards Team, getting to play a Stipulation that required him to play no creatures. Mike Turian put it, "Tom didn't have a stipulation." Frank Lepore saw things differently.

With things so close, both teams began to throw every mind they had at the opposing teams. It was an incredibly intense affair.

Bjorn Andreasson struk first, dispatching his opponent and really putting the Wizards Team's backs to the wall.

Some of the Wizards Team were less than happy with their decks.

In the end, however, the Community Team was able to hold on, mostly due to some of these incredible decks!
