Both Philadelphia resident Ralph Betesh and Florida local Ryan Grodzinski were armed with brutally efficient aggro decks. While Betesh had seen his success with Abzan Aggro, it was Ryan Grodzinski's Mono-Red Aggro that gave him a great start to the day after going 9-0 in Day One. 



That great start became a greater weekend, as Grodzinski found himself qualified for Pro Tour *Magic Origins* and just three matches from a trophy. Betesh was in the same spot, and both were hungry to advance.



**The Games**



Grodzinski's one-two punch of [Searing Blood](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Searing+Blood) and a dashed [Goblin Heelcutter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Heelcutter) made quick work of Betesh's first game opening of two 2-mana creatures, bringing them to sideboarding in a matter of minutes.

The first game was about as fast, but this time it was Betesh in the driver's seat. [Rakshasa Deathdealer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rakshasa+Deathdealer) followed by [Anafenza, the Foremost](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Anafenza%2C+the+Foremost) quickly shut the door on on Grodzinski's start.



In the third game, a [Fleecemane Lion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fleecemane+Lion) from Betesh proved to be a shaky blocker against Grodzinski's [Goblin Heelcutter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Heelcutter), which allowed it and the first-turn [Monastery Swiftspear](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Monastery+Swiftspear) that he played to crack in for some more damage. However, that damaged reversed with a [Siege Rhino](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Siege+Rhino), which followed an [Anafenza, the Foremost](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Anafenza%2C+the+Foremost).

When Grodzinski opted to build his board with [Eidolon of the Great Revel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eidolon+of+the+Great+Revel) and Bloodrinker Satyr, Betesh sent in his creatures. A [Wingmate Roc](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wingmate+Roc) sat on top of Betesh's deck due to a scry, but the creatures in play forced Grodzinski into chump-blocking mode. It didn't take much more for Betesh to earn the handshake.



**Ralph Betesh defeats Ryan Grodzinski 2-1 and advances to the semifinals!**
