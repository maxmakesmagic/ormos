### Chinese Taipei



![](https://media.wizards.com/legacy/mtg/images/daily/events/wmc12/top8chinesetaipei.jpg)  



Exactly two players finished Day One 7–0, and thankfully for the Chinese Taipei team, their national champion and consummate pro Tzu-Ching Kuo threw the team on his back and carried them to a 4th seed overall and the 1st seed in Pool 4. With his teammates finishing 4–3, 4–3, and 3–4, it was Kuo's herculean effort that secured the team's spot in the Top 32. But from there, the whole squad gelled, rolling through the group with a perfect 3–0 record, defeating Sweden, Portugal, and Austria. Chinese Taipei then demolished the competition in Standard as well, eliminating the United States on a fortunate, topdecked [Bonfire of the Damned](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bonfire+of+the+Damned) one turn from losing the match to the powerful American squad. With their spot secured, even a final round loss to Hungry couldn't dampen their nearly perfect day. The team is one to watch out for, as Kuo is clearly a monster, representing the country for a fifth time and having recently finished 10th at Pro Tour *Avacyn Restored* in Barcelona.

It's a dream come true. I just played *Magic* for half a year. So it's a miracle to myself. I'm very pleased to play with a variety of players from around the world.

It's a huge honor. I hope that winning the World *Magic* Cup would attract more people to learn *Magic* in my country.

### Croatia



![](https://media.wizards.com/legacy/mtg/images/daily/events/wmc12/top8croatia.jpg)  
*Croatian National Team* 


Sheer, utter dominance. These words succinctly sum up how Croatia has performed at this inaugural World *Magic* Cup. Team captain Grgur Petric Maretic utterly destroyed the competition in his 7–0 run. His team supported him well, with Toni Portolan and Stjepan Sucic managing 5–2 records, ending Day One with a 3-point lead that they would never relinquish. Captained on Day Two by Goran Elez, the Croatians ran their first pool into the ground, managing a perfect record in the Team Sealed stage. When they dropped the first match of their second stage, things got a little dicey, but they bounced back in style, winning two close matches against the Philippines and Portugal to ensure their advancement into the Top 8.




### Stjepan Sucic


**Age:** 24  
**Hometown:** Sisak  
**Occupation:** Wizard


 

**Other previous *Magic* accomplishments:**  

Top 24 Worlds 2010, Top 10 Grand Prix Paris


**What Constructed format and deck are you playing, and why?**  

Standard, Mono-Green Infect, because it is the best deck in the format and because I'm too bad to play anything else.


**What has been your best memory of the World *Magic* Cup so far?**  

My first turn-two kill in Standard.


**What would winning the first World *Magic* Cup mean to you and your country?**  

It would be great since we put in so much effort and it might encourage people in our country to play more Magic.

### Grgur Petric Maretic

**Occupation:** PhD Student (research assistant)


 

**Other previous *Magic* accomplishments:**  

10th place Pro Tour Hollywood, 18th place PT New Orleans, 32nd place Worlds San Francisco 2005, three-time National Champion, six (or seven) times on the team


**What Constructed format and deck are you playing, and why?**  

Block Constructed, Jund. It's a powerful deck and simple to play, so I can help the others in their matches. We had no time to test the format.


**What has been your best memory of the World *Magic* Cup so far?**  

The whole tournament was amazing, even if I disregarded our success. I'm torn between the moment in which I saw Croatia 1st in the standings at the end of Day One and the moment I won the match for Top 8.


**What would winning the first World *Magic* Cup mean to you and your country?**  

Even yesterday's result had the whole community extremely excited. I actually got a message from a friend who has stopped playing [saying] that he will start playing again. I have been close to a Top 8 both in PTs and GPs, and already the Top 8 feels amazing. Winning it would be surreal.

**What Constructed format and deck are you playing, and why?**  

UW Talrand Delver. I thought I'd see many Delver decks and this has a positive matchup. Also, it's very consistent.


**What has been your best memory of the World *Magic* Cup so far?**  

Other than being Top 8, I took 100 pictures and had a great time with friends. Really good organization of both *Magic* and Gen Con convention.


**What would winning the first World *Magic* Cup mean to you and your country?**  

I [have been] playing *Magic* for years. It would be a crown to a great time I have had so far. And, of course, the community gets bigger if you bring success home.

**What Constructed format and deck are you playing, and why?**  

Modern, Delver RUG. I like flipping Delver turn two! When played tightly and with a bit of luck (no flooding) it's unbeatable.


**What has been your best memory of the World *Magic* Cup so far?**  

When Grgur Petric Maretic topdecked Nicol Bolas to kill Garruk on 6 counters (last possible turn before ultimate).


**What would winning the first World *Magic* Cup mean to you and your country?**  

It would help our community develop even more because the players' motivation would rise greatly. For me, it would be simply amazing. Playing *Magic* and traveling was always fun for me and I would be able to get a reward for all the hours I invested in Magic.

### Hungary



![](https://media.wizards.com/legacy/mtg/images/daily/events/wmc12/top8hungary.jpg)  
*Hungarian National Team* 


Hungary finished in the middle of the pack at the end of Day One, largely off the back of a 6–1 performance from Tamas Glied. The most exciting of Hungary's team Sealed Decks on Saturday was a Blue-Black Control deck with three copies of [Murder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Murder) and a trio of [Archaeomancer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Archaeomancer)s to get them back. This was enough to sneak them into the Constructed stages, but still as a low seed.


In the Constructed stage, Hungary rattled off three wins in a row, meaning that in spite of being low seeded in the Top 8, they have proven their Constructed mettle already (including against Chinese Taipei, who they could face in the semifinals).




### Tamas Nagy


**Age:** 30  
**Hometown:** Balmazvavaros  
**Occupation:** IT Manager


 

**Other previous *Magic* accomplishments:**  

GP Top 8 four times; National Champion in 2007, 2009, 2011, 2012


**What Constructed format and deck are you playing and why?**  

Block, 4-Color Jund. Everybody plays this because it is the best.


**What has been your best memory of the World *Magic* Cup so far?**  

Scotland winning their 3rd round team.


**What would winning the first World *Magic* Cup mean to you and your country?**  

It would put Hungary on the map of *Magic* and be an experience that I and my country will never forget.

### Philippines



![](https://media.wizards.com/legacy/mtg/images/daily/events/wmc12/top8philippines.jpg)  
*Filipino National Team* 


The Philippines National Team came in as relative underdogs prior to the weekend, with only Gerald Camangon having significant pro-level experience. But it was Andrew Cantillana who paced the team on Day One, rattling off an impressive 6–1 record to help the team finish the day as the 7th seed overall. That gave them the top seed in Pool 7. They then cruised through the Team Sealed portion of the event, defeating Romania and Uruguay in succession before a draw with the Netherlands locked them into the Top 16. However, they stumbled briefly in Team Constructed and were on the verge of elimination, needing a win against Finland in the final round to leapfrog the Finnish team. And, fittingly, it was Camangon who delivered the final points of damage to secure a Top 8 berth.




### Andrew Cantillana

**Hometown:** Philippines  
**Occupation:** Field Engineer

### Poland



![](https://media.wizards.com/legacy/mtg/images/daily/events/wmc12/top8poland.jpg)  
*Polish National Team* 


At the 4th seed in the Top 8, Poland has had quite the journey for this event. They ended the first day as the 18th seed, due largely to the fairly even performance from their team during the individual rounds. Tomek Pedrakowski went 5–2, while his team all went 4–3. They began their climb to the Top 8 during Day Two, where, in Stage 1, they defeated the Dominican Republic and Peru while losing to the Slovak Republic. And then in Stage 2 they defeated Scotland, Slovenia, and Estonia to sweep into the Top 8. Kopec and Pedrakowski will be in the forefront as they battle for the World *Magic* Cup.




### Jan Pruchniewicz

**What Constructed format and deck are you playing, and why?**  

I played Delver on Day One, because it was the deck I won the WMCQ with and was pretty confident in the mirror match. I was coaching today.


**What has been your best memory of the World *Magic* Cup so far?**  

Making top 8. Team match with the Slovak Republic had great atmosphere.


**What would winning the first World *Magic* Cup mean to you and your country?**  

Winning the first World *Magic* Cup would be the greatest moment in Polish history. Following this event, the position of Poland as an economic superpower would be established.

**What Constructed format and deck are you playing, and why?**  

Modern, because only I know anything about the format. I'm playing RUG Midrange because it has no bad matchups, and this is very important in team play.


**What has been your best memory of the World *Magic* Cup so far?**  

The match against Slovakia, because the similarity of our languages mean there were a lot of jokes and funny situations… well, actually making Top 8 was better…


**What would winning the first World *Magic* Cup mean to you and your country?**  

For me it would just be another great success. However our prizes would double Polish GDP.

**What has been your best memory of the World *Magic* Cup so far?**  

Just topdecks, no skills. It's about me.


**What would winning the first World *Magic* Cup mean to you and your country?**

### Puerto Rico



![](https://media.wizards.com/legacy/mtg/images/daily/events/wmc12/top8puertorico.jpg)  
*Puerto Rican National Team* 


To say that this has been a magical journey for Puerto Rico would be an understatement. And a terrible pun. But it would be true nonetheless. Captained by César Soto, who has two Pro Tour appearances to his credit, the Puerto Rican team was one of the teams with the least experience coming into this tournament. But that hasn't stopped them from taking down some of the biggest teams, including France and Canada. After starting in 31st place at the beginning of Day Two, Soto, joined by his teammates Jorge Iramain, Gabriel Nieves, and Jonathan Páez, steamrolled their way to a 2–1 record in the Team Sealed Stage of the tournament before finishing strong, defeating France and Ukraine on their way to earning a Top 8 berth. As they will tell you, this Top 8 performance isn't cause for surprise; it's cause for a party!




### Jorge Iramain


**Age:** 30  
**Hometown:** Guaynabo, Puerto Rico  
**Occupation:** Unemployed Electrical Engineer


 

**Other previous *Magic* accomplishments:**

**What Constructed format and deck are you playing in why?**  

Modern Affinity. It's a great, aggressive, and fast deck.


**What has been your best memory of the World *Magic* Cup so far?**  

Making Top 32 along with the Dominican Republic team, and exceeding our Top 16 aspirations.


**What would winning the first World *Magic* Cup mean to you and your country?**  

That we'd achieved the highest level of play, as well as demonstrating that we're more than just a 100 miles by 35 miles island.

**What has been your best memory of the World *Magic* Cup so far?**  

Making Day Three! Top 8, baby!


**What would winning the first World *Magic* Cup mean to you and your country?**  

Everything. We worked so many hours and sacrificed so much to get here. It's only Day Two, and they're already partying in Puerto Rico. Imagine if we win!!!

### Scotland



![](https://media.wizards.com/legacy/mtg/images/daily/events/wmc12/top8scotland.jpg)  
*Scottish National Team* 


Scotland came into the World *Magic* Cup with some kilts and a modicum of past Worlds experience, but not the greatest weight of expectation on their shoulders. They had tested with the English and Welsh teams to some extent, and were ready to battle. Stephen Murray went deep on Day One with a flawless draft record and backed it up with a strong performance using White-Blue [Delver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Delver)—a deck whose mirror match he is well used to.


Once it came to Team Sealed, Scotland was already highly seeded, which remained true throughout the day. Their sealed decks included something of a theme deck, with six copies of [Duty-Bound Dead](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duty-Bound+Dead) and some [Rancor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rancor)s as seasoning. By the time Scotland got to its last match of the day in Constructed, it was already a lock for Top 8 and the team members were quick to run around the room wearing their Scottish flags as capes, getting high-fives wherever they could. Scotland got into the Top 8 as the 2nd seed, which might well prove a substantial advantage.

**What Constructed format and deck are you playing, and why?**  

Standard with Pike Delver. I've played a lot of Delver lately, and I am comfortable with it.
