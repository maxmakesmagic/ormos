Back in October, Patrick Dickmann won Grand Prix Antwerp, the most recent Modern GP, playing [Splinter Twin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Splinter%C2%A0Twin), and this weekend he again picked up his [Pestermite](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pestermite)s and [Deceiver Exarch](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deceiver+Exarch)s. So far he managed a 4-0 start into the tournament, but so did his opponent, Frenchman Mikaël Rabie, playing a [Birthing Pod](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Birthing+Pod) deck of the [Melira, Sylvok Outcast](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Melira%2C+Sylvok+Outcast) variety.


While nominally two combo strategies, both of these decks have an amazing ability to kill without their respective combination, especially when facing heavy disruption. The [Birthing Pod](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Birthing+Pod) deck is chock-full of creatures anyway, and Dickmann's Twin version in particular, with its [Vendilion Clique](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vendilion+Clique)s and [Grim Lavamancer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grim+Lavamancer)s, can go the beatdown route as well.

*Patrick Dickmann*
**Game 1**


Here, the two decks delivered on their promise, as there was no fast combo kill but instead a long and slow grind. On one side, Dickmann's [Grim Lavamancer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grim+Lavamancer) was working overtime, killing, alongside [Lightning Bolt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt)s and Electrolyze, [Birds of Paradise](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Birds+of+Paradise) as well as [Voice of Resurgence](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Voice+of+Resurgence) and its token. On the other side, however, Rabie's defense mechanisms proved quite a problem for Dickmann's creature control. When [Grim Lavamancer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grim+Lavamancer) tried to kill [Melira, Sylvok Outcast](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Melira%2C+Sylvok+Outcast), for example, [Restoration Angel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Restoration+Angel) intervened, and when Dickmann tried to off the Angel, [Chord of Calling](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chord+of+Calling) intervened by getting [Spellskite](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spellskite).


Slowly, Rabie was eking out an advantage on the board, and cemented it when [Birthing Pod](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Birthing+Pod) searched up [Orzhov Pontiff](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Orzhov+Pontiff) to destroy Dickmann's [Grim Lavamancer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grim+Lavamancer) plus [Pestermite](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pestermite). Meanwhile, Dickmann had lost a lot of life to his lands and to incidental attacks, and needed to make a move. In a last-ditch effort, he attempted [Splinter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Splinter) Twin on his [Deceiver Exarch](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deceiver+Exarch) with neither any preparation nor back-up. Rabie's [Abrupt Decay](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Abrupt+Decay) then ended the game.


**Game 2**


The second game began in similar fashion. Rabie's [Shriekmaw](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shriekmaw) killed a turn-three [Pestermite](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pestermite), and various [Lightning Bolt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt)s, Electrolyze, and [Grim Lavamancer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grim+Lavamancer) activations proceeded to kill, among others, [Voice of Resurgence](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Voice+of+Resurgence), [Viscera Seer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Viscera+Seer), and [Melira, Sylvok Outcast](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Melira%2C+Sylvok+Outcast).


But when Rabie drew a fourth land, [Linvala, Keeper of Silence](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Linvala%2C+Keeper+of+Silence) proved a problem for Dickmann's strategy. Unable to use his Lavamancer or his combo, Dickmann was soon digging for answers. [Anger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Anger) of the Gods plus [Lightning Bolt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt) finally dealt with Linvala, but at that point Dickmann was already down to 5 life.

*Mikaël Rabie*
Both players' resources were very much depleted at this point, and when Dickmann tried to pull ahead with [Splinter Twin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Splinter%C2%A0Twin) on [Snapcaster Mage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snapcaster+Mage), Rabie had [Abrupt Decay](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Abrupt+Decay) at the ready. In fact, as he later revealed, Dickmann had hoped to draw out [Abrupt Decay](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Abrupt+Decay) this way: With [Kiki-Jiki, Mirror Breaker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kiki-Jiki%2C+Mirror+Breaker) still in hand and eight lands on the battlefield, a topdecked [Pestermite](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pestermite) may have still gotten him the win then. Alas, no [Pestermite](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pestermite) showed up before [Kitchen Finks](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kitchen+Finks) and [Murderous Redcap](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Murderous+Redcap) had reduced his life to zero.


"Usually, I'd say, the match-up is rather even," said Dickmann after the match. "But in both games, he simply stopped drawing lands after his fifth, even without any library manipulation, whereas I went to eight and nine. There was nothing to be done there."
