You didn't think we wouldn't come back to this, did you?


Earlier, if you'll recall, we looked at [some of the results from the first draft](http://www.wizards.com/magic/magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/eventcoverage/ptjou14/day1analysis%5Danalyzed) to see if we could pick out some of the trends among the 3-0 draft decks.


In order to get a bit more data to corroborate or enhance those results, we took the same look at the Day Two drafts, adding an additional 29 data points to yesterday's 43 3-0 lists.


So, without further ado...numbers!


**Day 2 Color Selections**




|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Black | 18 |
| Blue | 14 |
| Green | 12 |
| Red | 8 |
| White | 7 |

Day One was pretty even across the board when it came down to simple color selection, as all five colors were fairly equally represented. That wasn't the case on Day Two where black was featured in more than twice as many decks as both red and white, the two runts of the litter.


Combining those results with the Day One numbers gives us:


**Day One + Day Two Color Selections**




|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Black | 38 |
| Blue | 32 |
| Green | 28 |
| Red | 24 |
| White | 24 |

We get a much clearer picture here of the stratification of the colors. Black is significantly ahead, blue and green represent the second tier, and red and white bring up the rear. That said, no color appears unplayable in a vacuum.


So, you can still play any color, but black, green, and blue appear to be the most consistent winners. What about archetypes?


First, a reminder of what Day One's breakdown looked like.


**Day One Archetypes**




|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| White-Red | 8 |
| Blue-Green | 7 |
| White-Black | 6 |
| Black-Green | 5 |
| Blue-Black | 5 |
| Black-Red | 3 |
| Blue-Red | 3 |
| White-Blue | 2 |
| Red-Green | 1 |
| White-Green-Red | 1 |
| White-Green | 0 |

Now here's Day 2, listed in the same order for comparison's sake:


**Day Two Archetypes**




|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| White-Red | 2 |
| Blue-Green | 5 |
| White-Black | 3 |
| Black-Green | 2 |
| Blue-Black | 8 |
| Black-Red | 4 |
| Blue-Red | 0 |
| White-Blue | 0 |
| Red-Green | 2 |
| Blue-Black-Green | 1 |
| White-Green | 2 |

That looks quite a bit different. The darling of Day One, White-Red, falls way back in the pack. Blue-black, a middle-of-the-pack finisher on Day One, stepped up its game on Day Two.


The more important numbers, however, are when we combine the two to get data on a full 72 3-0 draft decks, again listed in the same order for comparison's sake.


**Day One + Day Two Archetypes**




|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| White-Red | 10 |
| Blue-Green | 12 |
| White-Black | 9 |
| Black-Green | 7 |
| Blue-Black | 13 |
| Black-Red | 7 |
| Blue-Red | 3 |
| White-Blue | 2 |
| Red-Green | 3 |
| Multicolor Green | 2 |
| White-Green | 2 |

We have a pretty stratified selection here. The top tier is clearly made up of, in some order:


White-Red


Blue-Green


White-Black


Black-Green


Blue-Black


Black-Red


Those six archetypes represent 58 of the 72 decks, or slightly more than 80 percent. Each archetype individually makes up about 10 percent or more. None of the bottom four archetypes (nor Multicolor Green decks) even crack 5 percent.


All of the usual caveats about small samples sizes apply, but 72 drafts is enough to see some clear patterns in the numbers. It's surprising to see White-Blue do so poorly when that heroic archetype seemed to be pushed so hard in *Theros*, but losing multiple packs of [Wingsteed Rider](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wingsteed+Rider)s and [Battlewise Hoplite](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Battlewise+Hoplite)s – not to mention all-star [Hopeful Eidolon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hopeful+Eidolon) – just can't be made up for, not even with all of the [Lagonna-Band Trailblazer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lagonna-Band+Trailblazer)s and [Akroan Skyguard](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Akroan+Skyguard)s in the world.
