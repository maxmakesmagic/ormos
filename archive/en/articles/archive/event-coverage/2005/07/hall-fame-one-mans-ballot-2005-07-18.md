### Michael "elf" Feuell, Magic Online Developer/Level 3 Judge

The Hall of Fame voting certainly has generated a huge uproar, almost all of it focused on the Mike Long discussion. I'll get right to the point for you then, I didn't vote for Mike (I can picture [Elaine cheering in the background](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgevent/hof/ballot6) already).

When it came down to it, I had to stop and weigh a number of things. Did I want my vote to reflect pure accomplishments? How do I weigh accomplishments? Is lifetime earnings more important than Pro points? Is median finish more important than number of Top 8s? Or do I want to vote for people I'd like to see back on the Tour again? Should I be looking at lifetime overall accomplishments or just looking for peak accomplishments? Mark Justice and Olle Rade were two of the best ever â€“ when they played. But does that mean they get in ahead of MikeyP or Steve O., both of whom had better overall accomplishments?

In the end I took a combined approach. First, I [looked over some data](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgevent/hof/stats1) from Pro Tour finishes.

**Top 10 lifetime Pro Points:**  
 Jon Finkel  
 Darwin Kastle  
 David Humpherys  
 Steven O'Mahoney-Schwartz  
 Robert Dougherty  
 Tommi Hovi  
 Michael Pustilnik  
 Alan Comer  
 Michael Long  
 Scott Johns

**Top 10 "best players" by median finish:**  
 Tommi Hovi  
 Mark Justice  
 Olle Rade  
 Michael Long  
 Alan Comer  
 Jakub Slemr  
 Svend Sparre Geertsen  
 David Humpherys  
 Jon Finkel  
 Chris Pikula

**Top 10 "best players" by average points per Pro Tour:**  
 Olle Rade  
 Jon Finkel  
 Mark Justice  
 Tommi Hovi  
 Steven O'Mahoney-Schwartz  
 Darwin Kastle  
 Robert Dougherty  
 Jakub Slemr  
 Alan Comer  
 Scott Johns

**Top 10 career winnings:**  
 Jon Finkel  
 Darwin Kastle  
 David Humpherys  
 Robert Dougherty  
 Tommi Hovi  
 Michael Long  
 Michael Pustilnik  
 Scott Johns  
 Jakub Slemr  
 Steven O'Mahoney-Schwartz

**Top 10 most persistent (most PTs attended):**  
 Darwin Kastle  
 David Humpherys  
 Jon Finkel  
 David Price  
 Michael Pustilnik  
 Robert Dougherty  
 Steven O'Mahoney-Schwartz  
 Michael Long  
 Alan Comer  
 Terry Tsang

**Players who are in the top 10 in 3+ of those lists:**  
 Jon Finkel (5)  
 Tommi Hovi (4)  
 Steven O'Mahoney-Schwartz (4)  
 Robert Dougherty (4)  
 Michael Long (4)  
 David Humpherys (4)  
 Darwin Kastle (4)  
 Alan Comer (4)  
 Scott Johns (3)  
 Michael Pustilnik (3)  
 Jakub Slemr (3)

That gives me a nice list of the "top players" to work with.

From there I cast my votes by picking the five favorites I'd most like to see back on the Pro Tour.

- Jon Finkel

- Tommi Hovi

- Alan Comer

- Rob Dougherty

- David Humpherys

I'd like to tip the hat to Olle Rade and Mark Justice, each of whom had wonderful median and average performances but only attended 18 total Pro Tours each. It would have been interesting to see if they could keep up the high level of play if they had of stayed on the Tour longer. Scott Johns and Steve O both nearly made my list, with me making the hard cuts at the last minute.
