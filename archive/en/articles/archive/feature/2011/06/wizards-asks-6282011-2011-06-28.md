![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/mtgcom/authorpics/authorpic_kellydigges.jpg)**Kelly Digges:** M12 has a lot of sweet new art on both new cards and reprints, like Goblin Grenade, Quicksilver Amulet, and Spirit Mantle (not to mention the delightfully disturbing new art of Distress). It's also got a rogue's gallery of amazing returning art, from [Inferno Titan](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inferno+Titan) to [Serra Angel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Serra+Angel) to the Boros & Sziksai [Incinerate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=134751) from *Tenth Edition*.

Ultimately, though, two pieces are tied for first. No, don't make me pick! I can't possibly. They're both dragons: the fantastic new art for the returning Volcanic Dragon, which glows with its own fiery heat, and the surreal, cloudy menace of the new Phantasmal Dragon.
