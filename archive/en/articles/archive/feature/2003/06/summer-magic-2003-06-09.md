Wizards of the Coast has opened its vaults and released lots of exciting product from the past. Once the dust is removed, you can be sure, there will be lots of mind blowing tournament formats around! You never had the chance to experience older sets or you want to play that one particular set one more time? Now is the time to do it. Contact your local store for more information. Not only will there be exciting prizes to be won during those first 2 weekends, but every participant will receive a voucher that he can turn in at any *8th Edition* Launch Event in return for an exclusive **Magic: The Gathering** 10th Anniversary life counter (as long as supply lasts).

Highlight of the **Summer of Magic** is definitely the worldwide *8th Edition* Launch Event on July 26 – 27th. You will be able to play with the brand new Core Set featuring the new **Magic** card face and lots of old and new cards. Every participant will receive a special Foil card. The format will be Sealed Deck with 5 boosters 8th Edition. [Check this list for an 8th Edition Launch Event near you.](/en/articles/archive/2003-06-27)
