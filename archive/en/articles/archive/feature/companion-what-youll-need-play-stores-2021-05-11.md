In-store play [returns to the US on May 28, with more locations on the horizon](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/news/welcome-summer-legend-2021-05-06). Soon, even more *Magic* fans around the world will be able to safely gather again, tearing Draft Boosters open, turning Tarmogoyfs sideways, and getting back to playing *Magic* the way we've all missed.


As you return to your favorite game store, you might notice some improvements and updates for in-store play that we've been getting ready during the pandemic. I'm here to introduce those changes!


Your Wizards Account
====================


Joining a *Magic* tournament is easier than ever. You now have three ways to register for an event:


* Using your Wizards Account
* Using the *Companion* app (which we'll get to in a moment)
* Entering as a guest

Your Wizards Account is the key to "officially" joining an event, and it's the access point to most things Wizards moving forward. In fact, you may already have a Wizards Account! If you've signed up for *Magic: The Gathering Arena*, are an early adopter of our in-development games, or used our customer service portals, you're already signed up with a Wizards Account. If you don't have a Wizards Account yet, you can [sign up for your free account here](https://myaccounts.wizards.com/). Once you've got your Wizards Account, you'll simply tell your tournament organizer your ID, which is the email address associated with your Wizards Account, pay the entry fee if applicable, and you'll be ready to go!


Guest players only need to provide a first and last name to participate, but after 24 hours, there won't be a record of their participation in the event (in most cases). If you don't have your Wizards account info handy, you can still playâ€”but you won't have the benefits of the *Companion* app available.


Your *Magic* *Companion*
========================


The *Magic: The Gathering* *Companion* app is our new experience for participating in *Magic* events where you live. It allows you to register for an event, view your round, pairings, and standings information, get text notifications for when the next round is beginning, submit match results, track life totals, and even organize your *own* tournaments at home! Plus, it's free.


![Companion Key Art](https://media.wizards.com/2021/images/daily/sFprptgTuv.jpg)


You can download *Companion* on both [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/magic-the-gathering-companion/id1455161962?src=dailymtg) and [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wizards.winter_orb&src=dailymtg).


To join an event, click the "Join" icon:


![Join](https://media.wizards.com/2021/images/daily/Article_Join.jpg)


You'll be prompted to enter the event code. That's a six-digit alphanumeric code you'll receive from your tournament organizer. It may be displayed on a screen, posted on a sign, or in a pinch, you can simply ask your friendly store staff for the code. It looks like this:


![Event Code](https://media.wizards.com/2021/images/daily/Article_Event%20Code.jpg)


Enter the code, and you'll soon be off to the races! While you wait for everyone to get registered, you can use the life tracker feature to play a game against a friend. Life tracker allows you to track life totals for up to four players as well as important game stats like the storm count, mana, and poison. Here's what a two-player game looks like:


![Life tracker](https://media.wizards.com/2021/images/daily/Article_Life%20Tracker.jpg)


Once your event is underway, your seating for the first round, deck registration, or drafting will automatically update in the app. If you have push messaging turned on, we'll even ping you directly in case you had to step away for a moment. Here's what a first-round pairing looks like:


![First-round pairing](https://media.wizards.com/2021/images/daily/Article_First%20Round%20Pairing.jpg)


No more scanning a piece of paper to figure out where to sit or listening to shouted messages to determine who your opponent is! You have all the information you need right in the palm of your hands. You can even submit your match results right from *Companion*. Here's how that works:


![Match Slip](https://media.wizards.com/2021/images/daily/Article_Match%20Slip.jpg)


Remember: both you and your opponent will be able to see the results you submit, so make sure to submit them accurately! If you do make a mistake, tournament staff can correct it for you. In this new world, you can verify the results of a round at any time in the *Companion* app, empowering you to catch any errors and notify tournament staff. This was much more difficult before, but the *Companion* app improves tournament integrity in addition to helping things run more smoothly.


After the round is complete, you'll be able to see how you're doing right from the app:


![Standings](https://media.wizards.com/2021/images/daily/Article_Standings.jpg)


Finally, you can always organize your own events using the "Host" feature in *Companion*. Run your own event with up to sixteen players (make sure you're logged in to your Wizards Account to host all sixteen!) and handle pairings, standings, and reporting. Your friends with *Companion* can also use your event code to join your event and follow along on their own app.

*Companion* is a powerful new tool to improve the lives of *Magic* players everywhere, and it's optional for use at in-store events. The old methods of pairing, reporting, and overseeing events will still work.


Up Next
=======


The *Companion* team has been hard at work getting ready for the return to in-store play. We're so excited to share what we've been working on for the past year with the rest of the world! The best part? We're just getting started! Look forward to new features rolling out regularly with our next big release targeted for July.


Until then, I for one need to sleeve up my favorite Legacy deck and download the latest *Companion* update. I'll be ready to battle as soon as I can!
