Do you have friends? And are you tired of them always complaining because they don't have enough cards to compete with you at the kitchen table? Alternatively, are you just starting out in **Magic**? Do you worry that *you* don't have enough cards to start building decks?

Starting May 21, 2010, you can hook up a friend (or yourself!) with the *Deck Builder's Toolkit*, which will contain 100 land cards and 125 semi-random game cards, along with four 15-card booster packs from a variety of recent **Magic: The Gathering** sets for only $19.99. It's the perfect way to start a deck-building career!


The *Deck Builder's Toolkit* will also contain a card storage box, a guide containing dueling tips, and expert advice on how to custom build the deadliest and most effective decks possible. And since no two Toolkits are the same, each one presents its own unique deckbuilding challenges!
