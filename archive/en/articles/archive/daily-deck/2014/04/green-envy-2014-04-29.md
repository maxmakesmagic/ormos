Back at [Pro Tour *Theros*](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/magazine/article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/eventcoverage/ptths13/welcome), Makihito Mihara unleashed an explosive deck onto the rest of the Pro Tour, resulting in a semifinal appearance. Afterwards, Green Devotion has taken a backseat to both Blue Devotion and Black Devotion, but **Magic Online** user Gray Eyed Wanderer recently had success with Green Devotion with a 2nd-place finish in a **Magic Online** Premier Event.



![Nylea, God of the Hunt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Nylea,%20God%20of%20the%20Hunt&options=)One of the most powerful devotion cards is [Nykthos, Shrine to Nyx](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nykthos%2C+Shrine+to+Nyx), which allows for truly explosive turns fueled by large amounts of mana. Green Devotion decks take advantage of this more than any other color. The primary reason for this involves [Voyaging Satyr](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Voyaging+Satyr) allowing for multiple uses of the legendary land, but green decks feature enough mana acceleration to get permanents in play faster than other decks.

*Born of the Gods* gave us [Courser of Kruphix](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Courser+of+Kruphix), which generates some extra card advantage while providing some additional synergy with [Domri Rade](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Domri+Rade). *Journey into Nyx* provides [Hydra Broodmaster](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hydra+Broodmaster), which is capable of generating an incredible amount of creatures. If you've ever activated [Polukranos, World Eater](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Polukranos%2C+World+Eater)'s monstrous effect for X=17, then I think Green Devotion might be the deck for you.
