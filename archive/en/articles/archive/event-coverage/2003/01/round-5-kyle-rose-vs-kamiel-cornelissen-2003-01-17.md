Kyle won that time around, so Kamiel is looking for revenge. Both are 2-2 so with their backs against the wall of elimination. 

### Game 1

Kamiel won the toss, but it's Kyle with the first play. A turn 2 [Lightning Rift](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Rift)

"That card is good, I want that card! What do you think Kamiel?" – Chris Benafel on the neighboring table

Kamiel plays a [Wirewood Herald](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wirewood+Herald) that gets cycled away by Kyle. Next up is a [Snarling Undorak](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snarling+Undorak), but that too gets Rifted away. The third threat to hit the table is an [Elven Riders](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elven+Riders). Kyle answers that with a [Menacing Ogre](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Menacing+Ogre), with Kamiel winning the bid 5 to 3. Both 3/3's then trade in combat, leaving the board empty except for the Rift. 

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/ptchi03/a895.jpg)Kyle makes a [Riptide Biologist](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Riptide+Biologist) and a [Mistform Dreamer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mistform+Dreamer) to start nibbling away at Kamiel's life, whose plays are a [Krosan Tusker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Krosan+Tusker) and [Venomspout Brackus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Venomspout+Brackus) in consecutive turns. A [Ghosthelm Courier](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ghosthelm+Courier) allows the Dreamer to attack regardless. Kyle's [Tribal Golem](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tribal+Golem) solidifies the defenses some more. Next attack, Kamiel [Smother](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Smother)s the [Ghosthelm Courier](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ghosthelm+Courier) to allow him to shoot the Dreamer with the [Venomspout Brackus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Venomspout+Brackus). Still Kamiel is at 5 life – making that Rift look very dangerous. Kamiel sends in his two beasts in a last ditch effort. Kyle blocks the Tusker with the Biologist, allowing Kamiel to [Vitality Charm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vitality+Charm) that Tusker and [Tribal Unity](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tribal+Unity) for five.... dealing exactly 20 damage to Kyle.

Kamiel 1 – Kyle 0

### Game 2

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/ptchi03/a893.jpg)Kyle tries to lock up the ground pretty quickly next game, with a turn 3 [Mistform Wall](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mistform+Wall). It gets Skilled up on his next turn, only to be [Smother](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Smother)ed by Kamiel. In the meanwhile, Kamiel made a turn 3 [Snarling Undorak](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snarling+Undorak) thanks to a [Wirewood Elf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wirewood+Elf). Kyle comes back with a [Menacing Ogre](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Menacing+Ogre), again losing the bid: 4 to 3. It gets chumped by a [Wirewood Herald](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wirewood+Herald) which fetches an [Elven Riders](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elven+Riders). That hits the board next turn but Kyle plays another bomb in [Sparksmith](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sparksmith) – which isn't too impressive considering all of Kamiel's creatures are 3/3's. [Spitting Gourna](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spitting+Gourna) changes that statistic a bit for Kamiel, adding a nice 3/4 to the situation. Undaunted, Kyle then plays a [Mistform Skyreaver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mistform+Skyreaver) but goes down to a Dirge of the Dead on Kamiel's side.

"I sure messed that first game up" - Kyle

**Final Result:** Kamiel 2 – Kyle 0
