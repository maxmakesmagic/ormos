 Artur Villela has a strong claim to *Magic* fame: At Grand Prix Rio de Janeiro last year, he conceded to his longtime friend Jose Francisco de Silva in the Finals. It was a gracious act of generosity that put Francisco de Silva into Gold status for the season. Now, over a year and a half later, Villela has climbed back into a Grand Prix Top 8 chair and extended his qualification to the Pro Tour.



If karmic justice is a thing this is assuredly an anecdote in its favor. Of course, pulling a 6-0 record through the drafts today played its (large) part too.



 Frank Lepore, writer and personality in the *Magic* Community, was coming off his team's victory at the *Magic Online* Community Cup. Testing and playing alongside the skilled likes of Melissa DeTora and more, Lepore has moved a step beyond being a personality and into the world of professional *Magic* competitor. His 5-0-1 draft result – drawing with teammate and fellow Top 8 contender DeTora – put an exclamation on his rise this weekend.




**The Decks**




 Villela's plan was a simple one: Play just two colors. Pairing white with green meant Villela wasn't playing any multicolor cards. Instead, he settled for the consistency of multiple copies of cards like [Alpine Grizzly](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Alpine+Grizzly), [Sagu Archer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sagu+Archer), [Kin-Tree Warden](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kin-Tree+Warden), [Dragonscale Boon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragonscale+Boon), and [Kill Shot](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kill+Shot). Without a rare to be seen, Villela had traded raw power for absolute consistency.




 Lepore, however, took the colorful road to the draft. With [Abzan Ascendancy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Abzan+Ascendancy) and two copies of [Abzan Guide](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Abzan+Guide), Lepore spread his deck across white-black-green. With just three nonbasic lands to support his choices he skewed heavier on white and black cards to compensate. There were plenty of creatures to cast in both colors, along with removal to support them. Even without the thin line of green, Lepore would have plenty to do.




**The Games**




[Abzan Ascendancy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Abzan+Ascendancy) to beef up a [Mardu Hateblade](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mardu+Hateblade) was Lepore's early line, but [Alpine Grizzly](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Alpine+Grizzly), [Tuskguard Captain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tuskguard+Captain), and two morphs from Villela threatened to overrun in reply. After blocking the second big attack, Villela's [Dragonscale Boon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragonscale+Boon) put a quick end to Lepore's battle.
