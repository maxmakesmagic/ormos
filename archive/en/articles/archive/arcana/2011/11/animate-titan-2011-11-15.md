Last week, we [took a look at](/en/articles/archive/what-animate-dead-says-2011-11-08) the version of [Animate Dead](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Animate+Dead) that appears in *Premium Deck Series: Graveborn*. We mostly talked about the text, but the art is of some interest, too. Let's look at that card again!

Yes, it's an animated [Sun Titan](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sun+Titan). It's a good thing it was buried with that giant shoulder spike! The original sketch was a little more oblique about it. Here's Anthony Jones's original take:
