*What's your favorite creature card in **Magic**?*

![Mike Turian](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/mtgcom/authorpics/authorpic_miketurian.jpg)**Mike Turian:** My favorite creature is [Spitting Slug](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spitting+Slug). [Preacher](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Preacher) comes in a close second. As you can probably guess, I started playing **Magic** during *The Dark*. Green and white have always been my favorite colors.

| Spitting Slug | Preacher |

I really enjoyed playing [Spitting Slug](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spitting+Slug) (a 1GG 2/4) in tournament **Magic**. It doesn't have the beefy stats of most creatures, but the ability to turn a "last striker" into a creature with first strike sent many [Ball Lightning](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ball+Lightning)s to their slightly early death. I played a deck called "Slugageddon" in quite a few Pro Tour Qualifiers, and multiple people qualified with the deck. The deck didn't have [Armageddon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Armageddon) in it, but the name intimidated people!

I love taking a **Magic** card that most others dismiss and finding the perfect deck for that card. [Spitting Slug](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spitting+Slug) filled that role perfectly.
