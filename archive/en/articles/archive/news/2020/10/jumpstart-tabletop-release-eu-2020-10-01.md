*Jumpstart*, the quickest way to play *Magic: The Gathering*, launches October 16 for tabletop in the EU. Simply combine two booster packs, and you're ready to go!


**London, UK – October 1, 2020**: Following news about production and shipping delays, we're happy to announce today that *Jumpstart* is launching in the EU in tabletop form on October 16, 2020. The physical release in the EU follows the launch in other regions and a limited-time event that took place on *Magic: The Gathering Arena* back in July. *Jumpstart* has been designed to be played quickly and easily, making it one of the best ways to pick up and play the game.

*Jumpstart* lets players experience *Magic*'s rich history and exciting gameplay in a quick and accessible manner. No assembly or deck building is required, as players just need to open two of the individually themed packs of cards and combine them to create the deck they play with, allowing for over 100 different combinations. Jumpstart is the most accessible way to dive into the fun of *Magic: The Gathering,* and the themed boosters make it the perfect choice for fun and exciting matches with friends.


The selection of 500 cards taps into the game's huge existing library and also adds 37 brand-new cards, including some exciting new legendary creatures. On top of the immediate playability with the combination of two *Jumpstart* packs, all cards from the set are legal for all Eternal formats, including Commander.


**Some stores in the EU may receive their product ahead of the October 16 release date, so reach out to your local game store for availability.** More details about the design principles of *Jumpstart* [can be found here](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/card-preview/behind-scenes-designing-jumpstart-2020-06-17), as can more details about [the story of the new legendary creatures of the set here](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/feature/lore-jumpstart-cards-2020-06-22). A full list of all the [*Jumpstart*](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/card-image-gallery/jumpstart) [cards can be found here](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/card-image-gallery/jumpstart).


Outside of the EU, the amount of *Jumpstart* boosters available to stores is less than intended due to the challenges of creating and shipping this set while facing complications due to COVID-19. We know fans are eager to get their hands on more *Jumpstart*, and we're working as hard as we can to release more into the world as soon as possible. Thank you for your patience, and we can't wait for you to get the chance to shuffle up more packs and get to playing—especially if you haven't had the chance already.
