* [**Friday, 10:55 a.m.: The Metagame Runaround, New Extended Remix**](http://webcast2.wizards.com/podcasts/10amsterdam/amsterdam1.mp3) (16.6 MB)
It's always fun to check out what the Pros are playing on the first morning of the Pro Tour. It's even more exciting when there's a totally brand new format waiting to be explored, and that's the shape of New Extended – completely unknown. In a frantic fifty minutes of information gathering, we talk with the great and the good. Will it be Combo, Aggro, or Control that dominates?


* [**Friday, 3:10 p.m.: How to be Good at Magic**](http://webcast2.wizards.com/podcasts/10amsterdam/amsterdam2.mp3) (11.9 MB)
So many different things go into making a good **Magic**  player, but what are the really important things that separate the great from the good, and the good from the merely average? Bram Snepvangers, Quentin Martin, Kenny Oberg, Adam Yurchick, Brett Blackman, Simon Gortzen, Olivier Ruel, and AJ Sacher share their thoughts. Illuminating stuff. 


* [**Saturday, 11:22 a.m.: Working for Wizards**](http://webcast2.wizards.com/podcasts/10amsterdam/amsterdam3.mp3) (12.7 MB)
Nobody ever said it would be easy, but looking around at the website, the Pro Tour, at every new expansion, tells you that – yes, gasp, really! - actual people work for Wizards of the Coast. Undoubtedly the number one question we get asked is how to get a foot in the door. It can seem like an impossible dream, but everyone who gets the Wizards of the Coast shirt lives that dream, and if you really want it, so can you. We talk with website editor Kelly Digges about he went about fulfilling an ambition he's had since he was eleven. Fun chats, and lots of good advice. Want to work for Wizards? Click here. 


* [**Saturday, 6:20 p.m.: Unreal Top 8 Looms**](http://webcast2.wizards.com/podcasts/10amsterdam/amsterdam4.mp3) (10.7 MB)
I can say this with confidence – the lineup for the top 8 of Pro Tour Amsterdam is going to be amazing. I can say this too with confidence – nobody yet knows who will be in that lineup. The good news is that round fifteen is going to provide us with a bunch of answers. Brad Nelson faces the Belgian Jan Van Nieuwenhove. Guillaume Wafo-Tapa and Marijn Lybaert go at it for a slot. Brian Kibler faces Hall of Famer Kamiel Cornelissen. And guess what? The ultimate **Magic**  Pro, Kai Budde of Germany, is still going. Now all he has to do is beat Conley Woods. Who hasn't lost a match of New Extended. Ever. 


* [**Interview with Winner Paul Rietzl**](http://webcast2.wizards.com/podcasts/10amsterdam/amsterdam5.mp3) (13.8 MB)
It was called one of the greatest Top 8s in Pro Tour history. It was the debut of the new Extended format. And Paul Rietzl wrote his name in the **Magic** history books by going 3-0, 3-0, 3-0 in the Top 8 with his White Weenie deck to become the first person to sweep a Constructed Top 8. Paul shares his thoughts on victory and his evolution as a **Magic** player in this exclusive interview recorded immediately following his victory.
