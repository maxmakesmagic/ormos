### Game 1

Alex won the die roll but chose to go second. Both players made a first turn [Seal of Fire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seal+of+Fire). Caunes played a couple of creatures but they were killed by another [Seal of Fire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seal+of+Fire) and a [Firebolt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Firebolt). The German was the first player to find the most important card, [Cursed Scroll](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cursed+Scroll). In addition to this problem, Benjamin had drawn too much land and he couldn't put up any resistance at all.

Alex Mack 1 â€“ Benjamin Caunes 0

### Game 2

Alex realised that Benjamin would be siding in [Stone Rain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stone+Rain)s, and so decided not to bring in his [Savage Firecat](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Savage+Firecat)s for fear they would be stolen by [Threaten](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Threaten). Alex went first and this time it was Benjamin with the [Cursed Scroll](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cursed+Scroll). Mack tried to keep it from being active with a couple of [Stone Rain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stone+Rain)s, and then drew his own [Cursed Scroll](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cursed+Scroll) to level the playing field. Benjamin managed to play [Threaten](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Threaten) in the final of a constructed GP, but all it achieved was one damage to him as Alex sacrificed the [Mogg Fanatic](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mogg+Fanatic).

Alex gained the advantage with his third and fourth [Stone Rain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stone+Rain), leaving Caumes with only two [Wasteland](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wasteland)s in play. Benjamin didn't draw a red source in time and was Scrolled out.
