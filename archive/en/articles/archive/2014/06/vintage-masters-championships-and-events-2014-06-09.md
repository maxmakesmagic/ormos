=========================================

Ever since the [*Vintage Masters* Prerelease/Release announcement](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/other/05192014/vma), I'm sure that you've all been waiting to hear how you'll be able to put your growing *Vintage Masters* collections to work outside of the [Limited Prerelease and Release Events](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/other/05192014/vma#release). Worry no more! I'm here to announce an array of Constructed events that will let you flex your *Vintage Masters* deck-building muscles while utilizing your entire collection. We’ve planned plenty of events that will allow players to experience the Vintage format in **Magic Online** now that it’s here.


To start off, there will be Constructed events for Legacy and Vintage formats that run every day! Beginning after downtime on Wednesday, June 11; Vintage Constructed Dailies will run at 5:30 AM, 3:30 PM, and 6:30 PM (PDT). Legacy Constructed Dailies will run at 7:00 AM, 11:00 AM, 4:30 PM, and 8:00 PM (PDT). The full details for those events can be found in the [event tables below](#scheduledevents).


On the topic of upcoming event changes, beginning Friday, June 13, the [Vintage Premier Constructed Event](#vintagepremierconstructed) will take the place of the *Theros* Block Constructed Events, and continue to run on the same schedule that *Theros* Constructed is running currently. Alongside the Vintage Premier Constructed Event is the [Legacy Premier Constructed Event](#legacypremierconstructed) that begins on the same day and runs Fridays at 11:30 PM, as well as 1:30 PM (PDT) on Saturdays and Sundays. If that’s not enough Vintage and Legacy Constructed for you, we’re also running [Vintage and Legacy 2 and 8-player Constructed Queues](#queueevents) that begin after the downtime on Wednesday, June 11.



To round out the updates *Vintage Masters* brings to **Magic Online**, all Legacy and Vintage Constructed events will award *Vintage Masters* booster packs beginning on June 11!

**On the Horizon**



When it comes to Limited *Vintage Masters* events, we will be introducing *Vintage Masters* Sealed Daily Events. The Dailies will run at 7:30 AM, 2:30 PM and 7:30 PM every day starting after downtime on Wednesday, July 2. You’ll still be able to get that *Vintage Masters* experience in a Limited environment, even after the *Vintage Masters* Limited Release Events come to a close.


Fast-forward two months from now. You've become a *Vintage Masters* Limited legend! A Constructed colossus! What to do now? How can you prove that you're truly the best on **Magic Online**?

The *Vintage Masters* Championships are coming later this year! The *Vintage Masters* Limited Championship Qualifiers begin Wednesday, August 13 and the *Vintage Masters* Constructed Championship Qualifiers begin Wednesday, August 20.


The player who wins either the title of Limited or Constructed Champion will walk away with two full sets of *Vintage Masters*, one foil and one regular, as well as 15 *Vintage Masters* booster packs, and 15 QPs! Stay tuned for more details to come, but know that the Championships are on the horizon.
