*You get to add the "Leyline" text to one existing **Magic** enchantment. What's the worst one you can think of?*

**From Magic R&D:**

This is one of those joking thought exercises that crops up in R&D from time to time, like "useless super powers that could still make you a fortune." Say you got to add the "Leyline" text from *Guildpact*'s [Leyline cycle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?name=+%5Bleyline%5D)—"If this is in your opening hand, you may begin the game with it on the battlefield."—to any existing **Magic** enchantment. What's the worst choice you can think of?

As you can see, people followed a few different definitions of "worst," and not everyone stuck to enchantments.

Oh, and the text below "Leyline of [Battle of Wits](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Battle+of+Wits) reads, "4x Leyline of BoW, 4x Serum Powder, 227x Blank Card (would play this)." And, well, wouldn't you?

You get to add the "Leyline" text to one existing **Magic** enchantment. What's the *worst* one you can think of? Click the Discuss link below to tell us your story and then see what everybody else has to say!
