 There's new royalty at the Grand Prix main events and the Pro Tour. Crowned by feats of individual strength in tournaments before, Day One begins with a King of the Hill to claim dominion over a table in the feature match area. As the tournament progresses the dominion of King of the Hill expands, rising in rank and standing until the cut to Top 8 where the King of the Hill will always be the top seed going into the end.



Today's King of the Hill path is a hero's journey that left plenty of fallen players in the wake.



**Round 1: (11) Shaun McLaren loses to Andrea Mengucci** 




 Defending Pro Tour *Born of the Gods* champion and No. 11 Ranked Player Shaun McLaren got off to a rocky start by immediately falling off the throne as King of the Hill.






*Andrea Mengucci was able to de-throne Pro Tour*  Born of the Gods *Champion Shaun Mclaren from the King of the Hill in Round 1. And as the tournament progressed, Mengucci made sure to keep that same seat warm personally all day.*
