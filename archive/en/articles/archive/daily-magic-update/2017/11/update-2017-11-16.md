The Daily *Magic* Update is a roundup of everything *Magic* you should know on November 16, 2017. Today's Update is brought to you by [Half-Kitten, Half-Kitten, or the more egregious Ninja Constrictor](https://magic.wizards.com/en/products/unstable#jumblemorph).


What to Watch Tomorrow
======================


1. Wizards of the Coast *Unstable* preview stream | [twitch.tv/magic](https://www.twitch.tv/magic) | 1 p.m. PT/4 p.m. ET/8 p.m. UTC

Join myself, Trick Jarrett, and *Unstable* lead developer Ben Hayes as we preview somewhere between one and twelve cards on a stream tomorrow. We're not even sure how many we'll be previewing ourselves, as things might get a little—dicey.


Today's Previews
================


Every day I'll highlight the day's previews found elsewhere on the interwebs (read: not on DailyMTG).


1. [Spoiler *Unstable* @MagicLleida](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRDXvAaYM7c&feature=youtu.be) | MagicLleida

The video is in Spanish, but the card has already trampled its way into our hearts.

1. [Druid of the Sacred Beaker](http://www.hareruyamtg.com/article/category/detail/4693) | Hareruya | Atsushi Ito

My Japanese is a bit rusty (nonexistent), but we *do* know it's previewing a Deer Bird Ape Druid, and that's in English.


1. [*Unstable* Preview](http://www.gatheringmagic.com/snacktimewithmikeandant-11162017-snack-time-59-unstable-preview/) | SnackTime | Gathering Magic | Mike Linnemann and Ant Tessitore

SnackTime asks for Dogs, they get Dogs. Now who's a good Hydradoodle?


1. [岩SHOW マジック：ザ・ギャザリング『Unstable』プレビュー](http://mtg.bigmagic.net/article/2017/11/article/preview/MTGUn3.html) | BigMagic.net

I have no idea what any of these words say, but the card is in English! And it will take your creature on a journey of discovery.


1. [UNsTaBLe pReViEw: Part 3](http://www.starcitygames.com/article/36184_UNsTaBLe-pReViEw-Part-3.html) | StarCityGames.com | Unstable Danny West

After days of literally assembling images of Contraptions, StarCityGames.com finally ends the teasing and . . . what's this? More teasing?!

Mer-MAN! Mer-MAN!


Previews to Watch For
=====================


1. [Blogatog](http://markrosewater.tumblr.com/) | Mark Rosewater

Yup, we pretty much just let Mark preview as many cards as he'd like. Blogatog is getting in on the action today.


1. [*Magic: The Gathering* Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/MagicTheGathering/) and [*Magic: The Gathering* Tumblr](http://wizardsmagic.tumblr.com/)

We have two, yes *two* social challenges to reveal preview cards today. Watch Tumblr and Facebook for how you can uncover these cards.


1. [@BlakePR](https://twitter.com/blakepr)

Bet you're wondering what some of those host/augment card in the spinner do, huh? I'll show you a bit later. When I'm good and ready.


After Those, Read, Watch, or Listen to This
===========================================


1. [At the Multiverse: "The Shapers" – "Something Else Entirely" – *Magic: The Gathering* Lore Reviewed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMovj7Q1Aqo) | Tolarian Community College | The Professor and Michelle Rapp

Prof has started a new series called "At the Multiverse" that's all about lore. This is the second such episode, and it's highly entertaining and informative for anyone who loves lore. And for those who are big fans of "Who's on first?"
