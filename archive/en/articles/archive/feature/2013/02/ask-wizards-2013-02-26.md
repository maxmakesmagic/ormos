**I watched some of the coverage from GP Charlotte this weekend. The hosts talked about how awesome it was to be at the largest **Magic** event ever and I was wondering what the other biggest events were? â€” Scott** 




**A:** 



Well, as you noted this past weekend's *Gatecrash* Limited [Grand Prix Charlotte](/en/events/coverage/skarren%E2%80%99s-skarrg-rampage-charlotte) set a new record with 2,693 players, and was won by Frank Skarren. Before that the previous record was set on February 27, 2010 by [Grand Prix Madrid](/en/events/coverage/m%C3%BCller-magical-madrid) which brought 2,228 Legacy players together and was won by Andreas Muller.


In 2011 we nearly set a new record at [Grand Prix Paris](/en/events/coverage/sharfman-triumphs-paris) on February 12, 2011, which was part of the Magic Weekend Paris. The Magic Weekend was an experimental event that hosted both a Pro Tour and a Grand Prix during the same weekend. The *Scars of Mirrodin* Limited Grand Prix was won by David Sharfman.


Thanks for asking!
