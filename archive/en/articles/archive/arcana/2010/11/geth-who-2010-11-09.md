You are, of course, aware of Geth, the mighty legend from *Scars of Mirrodin*. He and his throne both appear in the set.

But Geth is actually a holdover from the first time **Magic** went to Mirrodin (in *Mirrodin*).

In fact, you know the vault that Geth is the lord of? That's the same one as [Disciple of the Vault](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Disciple+of+the+Vault)!

Here are the pre-*Scars of Mirrodin* flavor text references to Geth.

### *Mirrodin*

### Arcana Flashback!

*Mirrodin* came out seven years ago, but **magicthegathering.com** was already here. So here's a snippet from [October 20, 2003](/en/articles/archive/mirrodin-environments-black-2003-10-20) that seems relevant today. Say hello to the original concept art for Ish Sah, the Vault of Whispers!

![Ish Sah, the Vault of Whispers](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/global/images/mtgcom_arcana_435_pic3_en.jpg)**Right:** A concept illustration of Ish Sah, the so-called [Vault of Whispers](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vault+of+Whispers) by Mark Tedin, which became black's artifact land. The Vault is a huge metallic structure with architecture reminiscent of metal skeletons. The interior of the Vault is shrounded in mystery, but is said to be the lair of a black-aligned warlord named Geth who commands many Nim. (Geth does not appear on a *Mirrodin* card directly, but is referred to in the flavor texts of [Barter in Blood](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Barter+in+Blood), [Terror](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Terror), and the [Vault of Whispers](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Vault%2Bof%2BWhispers) itself.)
