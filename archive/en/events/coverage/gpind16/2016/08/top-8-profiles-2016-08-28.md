**What Modern deck are you playing, and why did you choose it?**


Affinity, it's my baby. Been playing it for years and felt it was still well positioned.


**What was the most important card in your main deck and why?**


[Mox Opal](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mox+Opal), because without it, the deck has a very hard time putting everything together.


**What was the most important card in your sideboard and why?**


[Chalice of the Void](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chalice+of+the+Void). Nobody expected it and it gave me free wins.

**What Modern deck are you playing, and why did you choose it?**


[Death's Shadow](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Death%27s+Shadow) Aggro. This deck is busted, and I basically rolled a dice to choose which deck I was going to play today.

The deck is effectively 48 cards with those, and consistent.
