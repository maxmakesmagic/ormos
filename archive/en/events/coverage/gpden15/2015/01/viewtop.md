This morning, 1497 players came to Denver with hopes of bringing home a trophy. Now, with seven rounds in the books, only 18 remain undefeated. Let's take a look at the archetypes that have managed to make it through unscathed in an effort to better understand the current state of Standard. 


Here's a breakdown of the undefeated decks after round seven. 


4 Abzan Aggro  




 The most interesting thing about the top tables is the diversity we're seeing therein. A lot of very good players brought aggressive Abzan strategies to battle this weekend, so it's no surprise that those decks are doing particularly well. What might be surprising is the general lack of decks that take advantage of [Sidisi, Brood Tyrant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sidisi%2C+Brood+Tyrant). One of the most exciting things we're seeing is the success of Jeskai strategies that have generally fallen off the radar as of late.

 The diversity of the top tables speaks volumes about the *Khans of Tarkir* Standard format. It's been a very long time since we've seen a Standard format with this many unique and viable archetypes clawing their way to the top tables.

 Coming into this weekend, one of our last forays into *Khans of Tarkir* Standard, we excitedly awaited our chance to observe where the dust would settle. The Sun will set on *Khans of Tarkir* Standard, but it looks like the wind is still blowing. What archetype will rise to the top of the pack here in Denver? Stay tuned to continuing coverage to find out!
