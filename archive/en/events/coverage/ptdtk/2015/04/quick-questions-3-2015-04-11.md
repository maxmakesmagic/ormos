**Adrian Sullivan, *Magic* Theorist/Writer/Veteran:** Definitely *not* blue-black. I guess I would say red-green, based on [Sabertooth Outrider](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sabertooth+Outrider). The card is so strong that I'm then picking [Ainok Artillerist](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ainok+Artillerist), [Gore Swine](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gore+Swine), and basically anything that helps turn on formidable. The best first pick for the deck might just be [Sabertooth Outrider](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sabertooth+Outrider) itself, actually.
