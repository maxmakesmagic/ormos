 **Q: How does Hydra deal with Planeswalkers? — Ben L.**  


**A: Matt Tabak, Magic rules manager:**


Greetings Hero,


One of the rules for the Battle the Hydra Challenge Deck is if the Hydra has to make a decision, you make that decision for it. This includes redirecting damage to one of your Planeswalkers. In many cases, this lack of free will on the Hydra's part [can](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=can)[be](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=be)[abused](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=abused).


But what sort of heroism is this? Battling the Hydra is meant to be a fun experience for a variety of play styles and a variety of decks. You can adjust the challenge accordingly, and in some cases you can put yourself in the Hydra's shoes (or hats) and make the decision that is most difficult for you. Just imagine the glory you'll enjoy! So keep in mind the first rule: when in doubt, do what's the most fun.
