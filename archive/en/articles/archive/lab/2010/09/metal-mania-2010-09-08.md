Hello and welcome back to the Lab! Here at the official laboratory of crazy combos and overall wackiness, I've previewed many a broken artifact during many spoiler seasons. ([Master Transmuter](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/ftl/22) and [Time Sieve](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/ftl/34) especially come to mind.) And now that we're in the thick of previews for *Scars of Mirrodin* (surely the most artifact centralized block since its 2003 predecessor, *Mirrodin*) it would seem fitting that the pattern be continued. Right?

Apparently, the **Magic** gods have a thing for 'fitting', so indeed I do have the honor of unveiling another broken artifact. Kuldotha Forgemaster is a master of many things: Forging, Tinkering, and Not Appearing to Be a Creature At All. To see his (her? its?) likeness, simply click here and be amazed.

In a strange way, Kuldotha Forgemaster reminds me of my previous metallic previews. [Time Sieve](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Time+Sieve) could sacrifice other artifacts for a beneficial effect. [Master Transmuter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Master+Transmuter) could efficiently pop expensive artifacts onto the battlefield (and was a master too). But Kuldotha Forgemaster can carve out its own niche of broken artifactness, and I'm here to guide it along the path.

The Newest Tinker Toy
Kuldotha Forgemaster does have one characteristic that separates it from my other preview cards: The lack of novel-length FAQs. It's true that Kuldotha Forgemaster is relatively straightforward. First and foremost, it's a 3/5 artifact creature for five colorless mana. Easy enough.
