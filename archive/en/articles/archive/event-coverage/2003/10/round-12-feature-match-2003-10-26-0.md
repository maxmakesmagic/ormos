![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gplyo03/a885.jpg)This all-french match is between two of France finest: Pierre Malherbuad and Frederic Courtois. Both of them are at a 8-3 record, and their decks are 1-1 in this draft.

Pierre won the die roll, and kicked off with a mana Myr and [Krark-Clan Grunt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Krark-Clan+Grunt). Frederic started this game with an Aether Spellbomb and Lighting Greaves. He decided to make it an interesting game by playing a potentially suicidal [Dross Harvester](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dross+Harvester). Lighting Greaves made it possible to attack for 4 right away. Pierre attacked with his Grunt, and played [Shatter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shatter) on the Lighting Greaves. He then mumbled something in French, tapped three mana, and played [Arrest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arrest) on the [Dross Harvester](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dross+Harvester). But Frederic reminded him that it had protection from white, so the [Arrest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arrest) was an illegal play. Frederic asked if Pierre could do anything else with his three mana, but Pierre argued that the mana shouldn't be in his pool since his [Arrest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arrest) was an illegal play. They called over a judge, who called over his team leader, who called over the head judge. He ruled (in French, so I didn't understand most of it) that Pierre didn't have to take mana burn.

After this whole situation was resolved, it was time for Frederic to take his turn. He played a mana Myr, [Frogmite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Frogmite), and attacked with [Dross Prowler](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dross+Prowler). Pierre now had a legal target for his [Arrest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arrest): the [Frogmite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Frogmite). His [Krark-Clan Grunt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Krark-Clan+Grunt) was chumpblocked by the Myr, providing 2 life for Frederic. Frederic's attack made the life totals 11-8 in his favor, and he played a Clockwork " Lava Axe" Condor. Pierre had another [Arrest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arrest) for that creature, and attacked with his Myr and the Grunt. That attack would take Frederic down to 4. He didn't like that idea with a Dross in play, so he bounced the Grunt with his Aether Spellbomb. But Frederic had nothing left to do the last damage, and died two turns later to his Dross.

### Game 2

Frederic kicked off with, yet again, a turn 2 Lighting Greaves. Pierre made a mana Myr, which immediately got Dominated by Frederic. Pierre had a [Shatter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shatter) for the [Lightning Greaves](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Greaves), and added an [Atog](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Atog) and [Vulshok Gauntlets](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vulshok+Gauntlets) to the board. Frederic [Terror](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Terror)ed the [Atog](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Atog) to leave Pierre creatureless. That [Terror](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Terror) was the last spell to be played in a while: Frederic only had creature removal in his hand, and Pierre was stuck on 6 mountains and a [Vulshok Gauntlets](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vulshok+Gauntlets) in play and 4 white cards in his hand.  
 Frederic attacked with his (or actually, Pierre's) Myr for a couple of turns. Eventually he drew [Thirst for Knowledge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thirst+for+Knowledge), netting him three new cards. He added [Clockwork Condor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Clockwork+Condor) and [Somber Hoverguard](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Somber+Hoverguard) to the board to put on some pressure. Pierre's next draw steps provided him with a second [Vulshok Gauntlets](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vulshok+Gauntlets) and [Mountain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mountain). Shaking his head, he scooped.

### Game 3

Pierre played first, but had to start off with a mulligan to 5. Frederic's Myr accelerated him into a 1/1 [Nim Shrieker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nim+Shrieker), while Pierre made [Yotian Soldier](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Yotian+Soldier) and [Atog](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Atog). Great, 4 one-power creatures on the board: we're in for a fast game here. Frederic played [Clockwork Condor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Clockwork+Condor) and served with his 2/1 Shrieker. Pierre had an [Arrest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arrest) for it.

Frederic had another [Clockwork Condor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Clockwork+Condor), which was destroyed by [Soul Nova](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soul+Nova). Frederic wasn't out of gas though: [Somber Hoverguard](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Somber+Hoverguard) and an Aether Spellbomb to turn his 1/1 Condor into a 3/3 again. The flyers came in again and finished Pierre off, whose mulligan to 5 came back to haunt him.

**Final Result:** Frederic 2 – Pierre 1
