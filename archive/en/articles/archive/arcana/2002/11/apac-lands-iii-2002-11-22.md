A few years ago, we gave away promotional basic lands to people in the Asia-Pacific region as a promotion. There were fifteen such lands, each depicting a scene from various countries in the region in an attempt to connect players from that part of the world to the **Magic** universe.

The lands were grouped in packs of five. Below are the contents of the second of the three available packages. Wednesday's [Arcana](/en/articles/archive/apac-lands-i-2002-11-20) looked at the first group, [yesterday's](/en/articles/archive/apac-lands-i-2002-11-20) looked at the second.

The Plains shows the Great Wall of China, the Island depicts Singapore, the Swamp is Indonesia, the Mountain is Fujiyama in Japan, and the Forest is from Korea.
