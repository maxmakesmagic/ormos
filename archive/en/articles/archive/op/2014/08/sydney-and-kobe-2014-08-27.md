Looking Back


Last weekend featured a Grand Prix double-header on the western side of the Pacific Ocean, as the tournament circuit visited Australia and Asia.


**Sydney**


[Australia's Grand Prix](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/gpsyd14) took place at the Sydney Olympic Park, where 813 players registered to play in the weekend's *Magic 2015* Limited event. Day One of course started with nine rounds of Sealed play, with 84 players moving on to Day Two for two Booster Drafts.


Limited formats can be a tough nut to crack, and it's why you often see familiar faces in the Top 8 for events that test a player's Sealed Pack and Booster Draft mastery. Sydney did not disappoint in this expectation.


Among the Top 8 was two-time Australian Grand Prix champion James Zhang, proving his mastery of navigating his home continent's GPs. [Grand Prix Minneapolis](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/magazine/article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/eventcoverage/gpmin14/welcome) champion Park Jun Young also earned his career fourth GP Top 8. And of course, Japanese pro Tomoharu Saito made an appearance, having secured his incredible *twentieth* Grand Prix Top 8 in Sydney along with a really awesome profile photo.

In the end, however, none of the seasoned veterans hoisted the trophy. Instead, it was the man who had the following answer to his profile question of what his top *Magic* event finish was:



"This GP."


That man? Paul Jackson. The 23-year-old rookie from Perth paid no heed to a stacked Top 8 and, with a Spectra Ward-powered white-blue deck, barreled through his three opponents in the Top 8 to claim the trophy.

[You can catch the full coverage here](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/gpsyd14), but here are a couple of highlights from the weekend:



[Drafting with Tomoharu Saito](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/gpsyd14/saito)—New reporter Neale Talbot sits down with Tomoharu Saito during his first draft of Sunday to take a look at how it goes, reflecting on some of his key picks as well as how his deck ended up.


[Interview with an Apex Predator](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/gpsyd14/garruk)—One of the lighter pieces of the weekend, as well as an example of Ray "Blisterguy" Walkinshaw's humor, the key point was highlighting some of the cosplayers who came to Sydney. Also, that mask sure does look familiar. Didn't we see that on Saito earlier?


**Kōbe**


Meanwhile, Japan hosted a return to Modern with [Grand Prix Kōbe](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/gpkob14). The turnout for the event was Japan's largest yet, featuring 2,270 players, who brought their best Modern decks on Saturday. Out of the huge number of players who arrived on Saturday, only 243 of them returned Sunday.


What many may not have expected was some interesting innovations out of the weekend's Modern field. A couple of key storylines popped up featuring new takes on old archetypes, as well as a couple of new ones. Also, if you look at the Top 8 decklists, you may just wade across one list featuring [Sundering Titan](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sundering+Titan) and a singleton [Urborg, Tomb of Yawgmoth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Urborg%2C+Tomb+of+Yawgmoth) together in an RG Tron deck. Techy!


Another key story came out of the Top 8, and it's the increasingly amazing year that Yuuki Ichikawa has had. The popular online NicoNico streamer has followed up his [back](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/ptjou14)-to-[back](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/ptm15) Pro Tour Top 8s with his first GP Top 8, giving him an excellent start to the 2014–2015 Premier Play season. It's becoming clear that Ichikawa may well be the new face of modern Japanese *Magic*.


However, it was ultimately Teruya Kakumae who burned himself in the minds of many, when his Modern Burn deck earned him the trophy at the end of it all. Burn has been a popular archetype during the Pro Tour Qualifier season, and Kakumae's performance with the deck has only gone to show that Burn is here to stay in the Modern metagame.

[You can catch all of Kōbe's action here](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/gpkob14), but here are a couple of key points from the weekend:



[Kōbe Photo Journal](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/gpkob14/grand-prix-kōbe-photo-journal-2014-08-22)—This one is technically not a piece from our English coverage staff, but rather from Asako Seo, who provided a photo journal of the event. Ben Swartz, coverage reporter and fluent speaker of Japanese, provided the photos and the translations to give readers a glimpse into the big weekend.


[Deck Tech: Shouta Yasooka](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/gpkob14/deck-tech-shota-yasooka-2014-08-23)—Oh, Yasooka. You've always been a consistent supply of cool decks with blue in them. And this weekend, you did not disappoint. Yasooka continues his tradition of innovating with a unique Tezzeret deck that you may want to take a look at, as Ben Swartz highlights what the deck is doing and what it is capable of. Ultimately, Yasooka finished with a 13–2 record in Kōbe, good enough for 10th place and 3 Pro Points.


Looking Forward


Round 2 of the 2014 World *Magic* Cup Qualifiers take place this weekend, as thousands of players in 72 countries battle for one of the two remaining slots on their countries' World *Magic* Cup teams. You can find more information about the WMCQs [on this page](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/2014-world-magic-cup-qualifier-information-2014-06-06).


And as an added reminder, now's the time to book your travel for Grand Prix Orlando and Grand Prix Shanghai (both taking place October 3–5) if you have not done so already. Don't wait too much longer!


Also, Pro Tour *Khans of Tarkir*, taking place October 10–12, is also coming up quickly. This weekend marked people's last chance to qualify for it. Now, for players who have been invited to go, we recommend looking into your travel, *pronto.* And we look forward to seeing you in Honolulu in a few weeks as we kick off the new Standard format in style!


Speaking of *Khans of Tarkir*, while previews from the upcoming set will be running next week, Organized Play will continue with its regularly scheduled goodness. Check back next week for some WMCQ updates.
