Now, we've got a surprise for you. There's one more set that had Karn in it, but you've never seen it. That, of course, is *Unglued 2*, which got cancelled and then cannibalized for *Unhinged* ideas. And in *Unglued 2*, there was a card called "Jeopardy," which was illustrated by Phil Foglio. So here, for what is probably the first time anywhere, is that piece of art!
