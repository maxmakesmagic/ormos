MTG Arena Announcements, June 8, 2022
=====================================

Fix for Prerelease Codes
========================


There was an unfortunate issue with the *Commander Legends: Battle for Baldur's Gate* Prelease codes when redeeming them in *MTG Arena*. If this affected you, don't worry—your codes were not lost!


We implemented a fix last week that grants a voucher when you enter your Prerelease code. The voucher appears under the Packs tab. If you haven't yet redeemed a code, you may enter it to receive your voucher. Vouchers will be automatically converted to packs when *Alchemy Horizons: Baldur's Gate* is released on July 7. 


Update to Explorer Banned List
==============================


As you may have already seen, there was a ban announcement yesterday for the tabletop Pioneer format. *MTG Arena*'s Explorer format is, as much as possible, a reflection of Pioneer, and as such we will also be updating the ban list for Explorer:


Effective June 9, [Expressive Iteration](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Expressive+Iteration) is banned in Explorer.


In addition, the previously announced plan to unban and revisit [Winota, Joiner of Forces](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Winota%2C+Joiner+of+Forces) in the fall is no longer in place. This card will remain banned in Explorer as long as it is banned in Pioneer.


For more information on the reasoning behind these actions, please [refer to the Pioneer B&R announcement article](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/news/june-7-2022-banned-and-restricted-announcement-2022-06-07).


When logging in on June 9 or later, you will receive an uncommon wildcard for each copy of Expressive Iteration you have in your collection. Please note: the usual pop-up for banned cards will not appear for these wildcards due to an ongoing technical issue; however, your wildcard inventory will still be updated correctly.


Premier Draft New Capenna Alchemy Extended through June 13!
===========================================================


We're extending the run for the Premier Draft New Capenna Alchemy event through June 13. This event offers an opportunity to get Alchemy cards by drafting. (The Premier Draft New Capenna event remains available to play, too.)


Players draft three packs of *Streets of New Capenna*, but one common card in each pack is replaced with a card from *Alchemy: New Capenna*. This card can be any rarity, so some packs will have multiple rares!


Each Draft pack contains one card from *Alchemy: New Capenna*:


* 55% of packs contain an uncommon card.
* 38.57% of packs contain a rare card.
* 6.43% of packs contain a mythic rare card.
* Each rare appears twice as often as each mythic rare.

Premier Draft New Capenna Alchemy has the same entry and payouts as the familiar Premier Draft events and awards *Alchemy: New Capenna* packs.

If you want to get into more competitive play, on June 11 you'll have an opportunity during the one-day, Best-of-One [Qualifier Play-In](https://magic.gg/events/qualifier-play-in) event in the Explorer format!
