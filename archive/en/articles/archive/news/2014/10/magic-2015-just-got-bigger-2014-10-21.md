It's time to turn the tables, Planeswalkers, and Garruk is ready for you to help him get his revenge!



*Magic 2015—Duels of the Planeswalkers* latest expansion, *Garruk's Revenge*, puts Garruk's fate in your hands as you take on the plane of Alara. Featuring some of your favorite cards from the Alara block, the expansion is sure to challenge longtime and new *Magic* fans alike.



Playing through four new campaign nodes and one exploration node, you take on the role of Garruk, using his deck to battle your way through even more challenging foes, as Garruk's deck improves with each victory. Earn cards from Alara to later modify your own decks as you hunt your prey across the planes.

All Cards Are Now Earnable In-Game
==================================


You spoke, we listened! With the release of this expansion, players who have unlocked access to the game's five initial chapters (Innistrad, Theros, Ravnica, Zendikar, and Shandalar) now have the opportunity to earn additional cards by winning multiplayer matches.



Previously, some cards could only be acquired by purchasing a Premium Booster. Going forward, however, these cards will instead be available in Battle Boosters, which can be earned by winning multiplayer matches. Players with access to multiplayer mode also have the option to immediately unlock the full Battle Booster Collection for $9.99. The Battle Booster Collection provides the maximum number of copies of each Battle Booster card (4 copies of each common, 3 of each uncommon, 2 of each rare, and 1 of each mythic rare). Players who previously purchased 1–13 of the Premium Boosters will only earn the remaining cards in the card pool. Players who previously purchased all 14 of the Premium Boosters will not earn any additional cards.

Take the Next Step
==================


Players can gain access to multiplayer mode and the five pre-expansion chapters (Innistrad, Theros, Ravnica, Zendikar, and Shandalar) by purchasing the *Hunt Bigger Game* campaign for $9.99 in the in-game shop.



Our latest expansion, *Garruk's Revenge*, is available in the in-game shop for $4.99 for players who have purchased the *Hunt Bigger Game* campaign or equivalent content.
