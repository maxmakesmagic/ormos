What Are You Playing & Why?
===========================


With a metagame as diverse as Modern, the simple question, “What Are You Playing & Why?” can yield deceptively complex answers.  I talked to many different players and got completely different responses.  Even with format pillars like [Treasure Cruise](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treasure+Cruise), [Dig Through Time](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dig+Through+Time), and [Siege Rhino](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Siege+Rhino), there is still tons of play within this crazy-deep format.

**Craig Wescoe** – “Domain Zoo.  It plays [Wild Nacatl](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Nacatl)s, and that’s kinda my thing.”

**Matthias Hunt** – “Amulet Bloom Combo.  One year later, I still love the deck.  And [Chalice of the Void](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chalice+of+the+Void) is real good.”

**Nathan Holiday** – “Melira Pod.  [Birthing Pod](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Birthing+Pod) is still broken and [Siege Rhino](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Siege+Rhino) is great.”
