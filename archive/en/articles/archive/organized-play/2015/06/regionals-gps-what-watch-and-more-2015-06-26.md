We're in the final few weeks before *Magic Origins* kicks into action, and as we close out events with *Dragons of Tarkir*, we look ahead at what's to come. First up:



Regional PTQs—First Wave
========================



The first wave of [Regional Pro Tour Qualifiers (RPTQs)](http://magic.wizards.com/en/protour/rptqmil15) tied to qualifying for Pro Tour *Battle for Zendikar* takes place tomorrow in North America, Europe, and Japan. The remaining RPTQs take place the following Saturday.



Last week, we teased that some of the sweet stuff that you will (or *can*) get at a Regional Pro Tour Qualifier. As Kytheon's Irregulars has been revealed, [courtesy of SvenskaMagic](http://www.svenskamagic.com/articles/index.php?ID=1834), we are excited to reveal that the art from this *Magic Origins* card is featured on both the deck box and the playmat for this round!

*Everyone who participates in a Regional Pro Tour Qualifier this round receives an event-exclusive deck box featuring the art from Kytheon's Irregulars (while supplies last).*

*The Top 16 finishers at Regional Pro Tour Qualifiers taking place this round receive an event-exclusive playmat featuring the art from Kytheon's Irregulars (while supplies last).*



And of course, everyone who competes in an RPTQ will receive this spicy little Modern number:

*[Liliana of the Veil](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Liliana+of+the+Veil) is this year's Regional Pro Tour Qualifier participation promo.*



Want one of these Liliana promos? Want a chance to compete in the Pro Tour feature match area among the world's best? Then earn your qualification for the next round of Regional Pro Tour Qualifiers by winning a [Preliminary Pro Tour Qualifier (PPTQ)](http://magic.wizards.com/en/protour/pptq1st16) at a local store near you!

The Flashback
=============



Last weekend featured two different Constructed formats across two GPs in Europe and North America.



![](https://media.wizards.com/2014/images/daily/GP-City-Only-Copenhagen-Black%202.png)



In Copenhagen, 1,345 Modern fans from Europe and even a few Professional Point chasers from North America traveled to Denmark to compete in GP Copenhagen's two-day Modern main event. After a cut to a Top 8 that showcased seven different archetypes, it was Merfolk that reigned supreme as Przemek Knocinski took home the trophy.
