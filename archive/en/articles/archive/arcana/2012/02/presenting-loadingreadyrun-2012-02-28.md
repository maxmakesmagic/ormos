Hey! Do you like **Magic**? Do you like sketch comedy? Do you like clicking on a video when you are told to? Then click on this video!

  
  
That was "Friday Nights: Untap," the fine work of the people at [LoadingReadyRun](http://www.loadingreadyrun.com). There are three more videos coming in this series, and they're all great! At least, we assume they will be. We here at Arcana Headquarters haven't actually seen them yet. Theyâ€™ll be coming out every Thursday through March 15th.
