Ask Wizards is a weekly feature that allows you to ask us questions! If you'd like to submit your question please email it to [AskWizards@wizards.com](mailto:AskWizards@wizards.com). We aren't able to answer every question we receive but if your question is good then it might show up in the coming weeks! 

**Q:** I've always wondered, what's the difference between Vintage & Legacy? They both seem to cover Magic's entire history, so how are they differentiated?

**A:** From **Trick Jarrett**, Editor-in-Chief DailyMTG.com


Vintage and Legacy may look like the same format to the uninitiated but they are very different formats. While both formats permit cards from almost every set in Magic's history (excluding silver bordered cards and others.) The core difference being that Vintage has a Restricted list, that is a list of cards which you are only allowed to play one of (rather than the normal four.) For example the "Power Nine" are among Vintage's Restricted list: [Black Lotus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Black+Lotus), [Time Walk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Time+Walk), [Ancestral Recall](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ancestral+Recall), [Timetwister](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Timetwister) and the Moxes. The restricted list goes beyond these cards though including cards like [Brainstorm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brainstorm) or [Ponder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ponder). There is also a banned list for Vintage, but it is quite limited with only a dozen cards on it (as of when this was written.) Legacy doesn't have a Restricted list, it has a banned list which includes almost *all* of the cards on Vintage's Restricted list and additional cards which are banned in Legacy.


You can find the most up to date list of banned and restricted lists on these two pages:
