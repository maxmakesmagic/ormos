Longtime readers may remember a feature called Ask Wizards, predecessor to the current Wizards Asks. It was a daily Q&A with the people behind the scenes here at Wizards, from web devs to **Magic** developers to the occasional R&D Vice President. (Er, that is to say, Bill Rose has been the R&D Vice President pretty much the whole time, but only occasionally answered questions. He doesn't have phasing or anything.)

Why'd we stop? Believe it or not, because there weren't enough (good) questions! Some questions came up again and again, and we could only answer them so many times. Others were rules questions, which were (mostly) out of scope for Ask Wizards, while still others were asking about things we can't talk about, like the contents of upcoming sets. Filter all those out, and you end up with a lot of effort being spent to answer an ever-decreasing number of usable questions. And of course, once we stopped running them daily, the number of questions submitted went into a tailspin.

Readers and Wizards alike enjoyed the interactivity of Ask Wizards, though, and just because it's no longer a daily feature doesn't mean it'll never come again in some form. New questions turn up. Old questions could stand to be addressed again. A return to daily feature status isn't on the menu, but we'd still love to answer your questions from time to time.

How can you help? Good question. Click [here](javascript:makeWinXY('http://www.wizards.com/company/emailtoauthor.asp?author=Ask%20Wizards',500,455);) or use the link below to send us more good questions!
