One of the first cities in Japan to open its streets to foreigners, Yokohama is home to the largest Chinatown in the country, and its international connections are reflected in its architecture and food. The city is centered around the Minato Mirai 21 district, a business and commerce district that features the Landmark Tower, the nation's tallest building at 70 floors and nearly 296 meters. Another notable attraction in the city is the Ramen (Chinese noodle) Museum.

 Few cities in the world are as synonymous with **Magic**'s history as Yokohama. The first non-US location of the World Championships in 1999 (won by Kai Budde), Yokohama has since hosted a number of premier events. In 2005, the city was again host to the World Championships, which saw the "home team" dominate, with the titles of World Champion, World Team Champion, and Pro Tour Player of the Year all being captured by Japanese players. In 2008, as the home of defending champion Masaya Kitayama, Yokohama was the site of the Japan National Championship, which saw a resurgent Masashi Oiso take home the title. Come join us at Grand Prix Yokohama 2013 and witness another chapter written in **Magic** history in this scenic city by the sea! 

  

 *The **Magic: The Gathering**  Grand Prix tournament series is a great reason to step up your game, catch up with old friends, meet some new ones, and play **Magic**. Grand Prix tournaments are world-wide open events that allow all **Magic** players to participate and experience the thrill of a large-scale competition over three days. In addition to cash prizes, a high Planeswalker Points multiplier, and exclusive foil promo cards for participants, the Grand Prix features a host of other activities, including side events and artist signings. Side-event tournaments begin Friday, with the Grand Prix main event running Saturday and Sunday. Find out more about the Grand Prix [tournament schedule here](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/TCG/Events.aspx?x=grandprix/welcome#2013).*

**Tournament Structure** 


* Grand Prix Yokohama will be run over two days using modified Swiss-style rounds of 50 minutes each. The number of rounds on Day 1 will be determined based on the number of players registered, Players will be paired randomly against players with similar win-loss records, with match points accumulating throughout the event.
* If 799 or fewer players register for the event, all players with an X-2-0 or better record OR the top 64 players—whichever number is greater—will advance to the second day of the event.
* If 800 or more players register for the event, all players with an X-2-0 or better record OR the top 128 players—whichever number is greater—will advance to the second day of the event.
* The top 8 players after the final Swiss round on Day 2 will advance to the Top 8 single-elimination playoff round.
* Top 8 matches will be best 2 of 3.
* Top 8 playoff matches will be best 2 of 3, and have no time limit. (Players are still expected to play at a normal pace and complete playoff matches in a reasonable amount of time.)
* When necessary, standings as of the final Swiss round will be used to determine final order in the standings.
* For the first game of each match in the Top 8, the player that finished higher in the Swiss rounds chooses either to play first or to play second. For subsequent games in each Top 8 match, the usual Play/Draw rule applies (loser of the previous game decides whether to play first in the next game).

### Artist Information


**Due to a family emergency, Todd Lockwood will be unable to attend Grand Prix Yokohama as previously announced.**


Daarken, Raymond Swanland, and Min Yum will be in attendance at Grand Prix Yokohama.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/gpyok13/Daarken.jpg)*Daarken***Daarken**


 In the early years of his youth, Daarken attended the Academy of Art University in San Francisco. Most of his days were spent huddled over a sketchbook at a figure-drawing workshop or in a café, where he was affectionately known as "the guy that likes to draw deltoids". After three long years of drawing deltoids and video game playing, Daarken graduated Cum Laude with a BFA in traditional illustration.

Daarken began his career in 2004 when his incessant video game playing was interrupted by a phone call. The mysterious voice on the other end identified himself as someone from Wizards of the Coast. Daarken immediately blurted out that he would like to work for them. His overzealous nature was counters with the statement "but you haven't even heard what the project is yet".

And so began the lifestyle of creating monsters and zombies, with the occasional video game playing on the side. Daarken's true video game playing powers were put to the test when he was hired by Mythic Entertainment in 2007 as a concept artist for Warhammer Online: Age of Reckoning. His two loves combined into a gigantic ball of awesomeness, which he happily rolls around all day. He now spends his days freelancing full-time, creating monsters and zombies, and, of course, playing more video games.

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/gpyok13/Swanland.jpg)*Raymond Swanland***Raymond Swanland**
  
  
 Ever since his formative years in the sprawling cities of Southern California, Raymond Swanland has been exploring worlds of the imagination through his art. Inspired by artists ranging from Caravaggio to H. R. Giger, he has been drawn to create work both dark in subject and visceral in style.   
  
 Shortly out of high school, Raymond had the great fortune to start his professional art career with the video game company Oddworld Inhabitants. That job, which ranged from conceptual and character design to cinematic art direction, turned into a career that spanned all four Oddworld video games over eight years, from 1997 to 2005.   
  
 In addition to his career with Oddworld, Raymond gradually launched a freelance illustration career starting in 2001 with the covers for the Korean manhwa Priest (soon to be a feature film). From there, he's gone on to work primarily in books (Wizards of the Coast, TOR, Nightshade, Pyr) as well as comics (Dark Horse), advertising, and album covers. This strong foundation in fantasy and sci-fi illustration ultimately led him to be invited to join the many creative talents of the **Magic: The Gathering** card game, for which he has created nearly 70 pieces to help flesh out the rich and expansive universe.   
  
 Fans can follow Raymond's work on his personal web site [www.raymondswanland.com](http://www.raymondswanland.com) or on Facebook at [www.facebook.com/page/Raymond-Swanland-Official/155956251159151](http://www.facebook.com/page/Raymond-Swanland-Official/155956251159151).

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/gpyok13/Minyum.jpg)*Min Yum***Min Yum**
  
  
 Min was born in Seoul, Korea and grew up in Sydney, Australia. He was always fascinated with drawing but never quite chased after it. After a series of boring careers in office jobs and graphic design, he turned to drawing in his mid-twenties. Shortly after he started working at a game studio in Melbourne as a concept artist. Min has since worked on films such as "Wolverine" and "The Chronicles of Narnia: The Voyage of the Dawn Treader", and for clients like Animal Logic and Wizards of the Coast. He currently lives in Seoul and works as freelancer.
