The event coverage spotlight shines on four locations this weekend. The coverage staff has scattered across the globe to bring you the latest infomation, deck tech, strategies, and much more from the national championships in the United States, France, and Italy, as well as the Summer Series Grand Prix in Kobe and the Vintage Championship at Magic Weekend. 

Congratulations to the four new national champions, who will be representing their countries at the Magic World Championships on December 8-11 in Memphis.

Packed with a deck running all the best red creatures and burn spells, Michael Jacob took the first step in cleaning the slate from last year’s disappointing Worlds performance by capturing the 2008 United States National Championship at Magic Weekend in Chicago.

### [France National Championship](/en/events/coverage/2008-france-national-championship)

Christophe Peyronnel defeated Pro Tour legend Olivier Ruel in the finals to win the France National Championship.

### [Takahashi’s Faeries K.O. in Kobe](/en/articles/archive/event-coverage/japanese-coverage-2008-grand-prix%E2%80%93kobe-2008-07-30)

After taking home the title in Shizuoka earlier this year, Yuuta Takahashi has once again come out on top, with what practically amounts to the same deck. Showing an incredible aptitude with the archetype, he bested Katsuya Ueda in the mirror to take the quarterfinals, Masaya Tanahashi with Kithkin, also known as The Other best Deck in the semifinals, and Takayuki Takagi and his Doran, the Siege Tower deck in the finals.
