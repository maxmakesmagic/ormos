Revisiting an elegant combo for a more civilized age.
-----------------------------------------------------


They say that bad news comes in threes. Just ask Goldilocks. So with the recent departures of [Taste the Magic's Matt Cavotta](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/daily/mc105) and [Latest Developments' Aaron Forsythe](/en/articles/archive/latest-developments/round-goodbyes-2007-08-31), you just new that the proverbial third shoe would have to drop. I would like to announce right now that not only does my country boast some unusual proverbs, but I'm also leaving. Yes, it's true. If I don't get out the door right away, I'm going to be late for *Evil Dead: The Musical*. Don't worry, though. I'll be back in less than a paragraph.


### Last Call for Nostalgia


Did you miss me? Well, good, I'm glad. With *Lorwyn* previews right around the corner, and *Time Spiral* rotating out of, uh, Block Constructed, I decided to take this opportunity to explore the nostalgia theme one last time. By "explore the theme," I mean use up the last shred of nostalgia I have, tell my final unused anecdote, scrape the bottom of the personal-history barrel. I mean, I might as well. Are we ever going to see nostalgia like this again?


![Orcish Artillery and Circle of Protection: Red](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/mtgcom/fcpics/house/cm87_cardfan.jpg)When I got back into **Magic** oh so many years ago, I was going through my old cards looking for deck ideas. My collection at that point was made up of *Revised* and *Fallen Empires*, mostly, with a few stragglers from other sets like [Phyrexian Gremlins](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phyrexian+Gremlins), [Land Leeches](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Land+Leeches), and [Norritt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Norritt). It didn't take long to divvy up the cards into piles of sixty. The blue cards were once again paired up with the black cards, as were the green cards. That left the red ones and the whites ones and the [Obsianus Golem](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=+Obsianus+Golem)s to fend for themselves. After a little brainstorming session, I concluded that the stack of eight million copies of [Circle of Protection: Red](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Circle+of+Protection%3A+Red) could be used with my set of [Orcish Artillery](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Orcish%2BArtillery). With a Circle in play, the Orcs gain a sort of "activation cost" (the one mana needed to prevent the damage), but they lose their drawback. Eventually, the deck evolved to include [Earthquake](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Earthquake), [Flame Rift](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flame+Rift), [Orcish Cannoneer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Orcish+Cannoneer)s, and even [Aftershock](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aftershock), but at the time the only other card I owned that would deal damage to me in a preventable way was [Power Surge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Power+Surge). In it went.


There was [Manabarbs](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Manabarbs) as well, but it didn't do much with [Circle of Protection: Red](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Circle+of+Protection%3A+Red). But wait! "It doesn't work with the Circles," I thought, "but it sure works with Power Surge, at least in a diabolical, damned-if-you-do, damned-if-you-don't sort of way." [Manabarbs](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Manabarbs) punishes each player for tapping their lands, while Power Surge punishes them for not tapping their lands. For whatever reason, this kind of cruel but quick-to-backfire combo really appealed to my inner mad scientist. Naturally, I arrogantly explained the entire thing to my opponents, taking no one by surprise.


Well, I was happy to see that [Manabarbs](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Manabarbs) is back in *Tenth Edition*, still doing its thing, turning every land into a painland, painlands into shocklands, and shocklands into, uh, cone-of-flamelands. Sadly, Power Surge (or, heck, [Citadel of Pain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Citadel+of+Pain)) is nowhere to be seen.


[Manabarbs](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Manabarbs) is a tricky card. One good thing about it is that it's a reverse [Howling Mine](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Howling+Mine). With that card, and other symmetrical cards of its ilk ([Rites of Flourishing](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rites+of+Flourishing), say), your opponent gets the benefit before you do. They can happily draw their extra card, play their extra land, and blow up your "[Howling Mine](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Howling+Mine)," leaving you feeling like a dummy. Contrarily, if you play a [Manabarbs](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Manabarbs), your opponent gets to take the maiden voyage to painland. One bad thing about [Manabarbs](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Manabarbs) is that while it's great at sealing the deal and preventing miraculous comebacks, it's not particularly good if you've fallen behind in the game and you are trying to get back in it. Unless...


Huh? Oh, yeah, I kinda trailed off there. Here are a few things you can try to make the most of [Manabarbs](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Manabarbs).


### [Manabarbs](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Manabarbs) + Free Stuff


As I've explained in incredible detail above, [Manabarbs](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Manabarbs) makes paying for your spells painful. Of course, that is only true if you're using mana drawn from lands to do so. If you're playing your spells for free by pitching cards or sacrificing lands, you will be remarkably pain-free. Red is full of such analgesic spells. You've got [Cave-In](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cave-In), [Pyrokinesis](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyrokinesis), and [Fireblast](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fireblast), for instance. With a small initial investment, cards like [Arc Blade](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arc+Blade), [Seismic Assault](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seismic+Assault), and [Undying Flames](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Undying+Flames) become "free" sources of damage thereafter. The first two can be played or suspended pre-[Manabarbs](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Manabarbs). [Undying Flames](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Undying+Flames) can't, of course, being epic. Still, if you find yourself in a good position to play it, you can kill rather quickly since so many of your free spells have high mana costs. Another cheap-to-play card with an unwieldy mana cost is [Greater Gargadon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Greater+Gargadon).


I decided to use [Howling Mine](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Howling+Mine) to fuel all the card-pitching, largely because there aren't a ton of card-drawing options available in red. [Pyroclasm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyroclasm) and [Rhystic Lightning](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rhystic+Lightning) aren't free, but the former should give you a chance to get to four mana relatively unscathed, while the latter is just fun to aim at your opponent's head while you have a [Manabarbs](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Manabarbs) in play.

If mono-red isn't your cup of tea, or your bag for that matter, you can always use the pitch cards of another colour, like, say, white. The most notable free spells in white, at least for our purposes, are an alliterative duo: [Shining Shoal](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shining+Shoal) and [Sunscour](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sunscour). Pitch-Wrath doesn't require much explanation, but [Shining Shoal](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shining+Shoal) might. Unlike many damage prevention cards, which prevent the next instance of damage from a source, [Shining Shoal](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shining+Shoal) prevents the next X damage. That X damage doesn't have to occur at the same time for [Shining Shoal](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shining+Shoal) to be able to redirect it. This makes the Shoal effective against both strikes of a double striker, up to X activations of [Pyrohemia](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyrohemia) (as long as they occur "this turn"), and, most importantly, up to X damage from [Manabarbs](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Manabarbs). You can, for instance, pitch a six-mana white spell, choosing [Manabarbs](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Manabarbs) and your opponent as the two targets, then add six mana to your mana pool, blast your opponent for 6, and then use that mana pain-free.


As with the last deck, I decided to use some of the *Future Sight* re-suspenders (in this case, [Arc Blade](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arc+Blade) and [Chronomantic Escape](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chronomantic+Escape)) as well as some permanent sources of damage ([Honden of Infinite Rage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Honden+of+Infinite+Rage), aided by [Honden of Cleansing Fire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Honden+of+Cleansing+Fire)). [Darien, King of Kjeldor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Darien%2C+King+of+Kjeldor) makes for a nice win condition in any deck that deals a lot of damage to its user.

If Extended isn't your thing, here's a Standardized version of the deck using many of the same cards. You can use the ol' [Pariah](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pariah) + [Stuffy Doll](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stuffy+Doll) or [Pariah](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pariah) + [Cho-Manno, Revolutionary](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cho-Manno%2C+Revolutionary) "invincibility" combos to save yourself from [Manabarbs](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Manabarbs). With [Stuffy Doll](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stuffy+Doll) and [Pariah](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pariah), you can even kill your opponent at the same time.

### Manabarbs + Damage Prevention


While I've never used [Sphere of Law](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sphere+of+Law) with [Manabarbs](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Manabarbs), I have used it with [Overabundance](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Overabundance), *Invasion*'s answer to the question, "What happens when you cross [Mana Flare](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Flare) with [Manabarbs](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Manabarbs)?" That was a very fun but not very good multiplayer deck that used all kinds of "plankton" cards like [New Frontiers](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=New+Frontiers) and [Veteran Explorer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Veteran+Explorer), before ultimately killing with my lands courtesy of [Natural Emergence](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Natural+Emergence). [Urza's Armor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Urza%27s+Armor) is another good partner for [Manabarbs](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Manabarbs). Feel free to squeeze either one of those cards into the above decks.


 



![Circle of Affliction](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Circle+of+Affliction)

Since I want to branch out a bit from the white and red decks, I decided to look elsewhere for inspiration. Luckily, I didn't have to look far. Dang astigmatism. There's a card in *Planar Chaos* that is the ideal match for [Manabarbs](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Manabarbs): [Circle of Affliction](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Circle+of+Affliction). It's black's alternate-reality Circle of Protection. You get to choose a colour and fire off a one-mana [Last Caress](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Last+Caress) whenever you are dealt damage by a source of that colour. Contrary to what one might expect, or at least what I might expect, the player you target doesn't have to be the controller of the source that dealt damage to you. What this means is that you can damage yourself, with, I don't know, [Manabarbs](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Manabarbs), and then ping your opponent for one. The beauty of it is, you can use the one mana that caused [Manabarbs](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Manabarbs) to ping you to pay for the [Circle of Affliction](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Circle+of+Affliction) trigger. Effectively, you can now tap a land to cause your opponent to lose one life. Since you gain life with [Circle of Affliction](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Circle+of+Affliction), you are basically immune from [Manabarbs](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Manabarbs) as long as you are spending your mana this way.


Ideally, you'll want to have a lot of lands in play when you play out the combo, so to that end I included [Korlash, Heir to Blackblade](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Korlash%2C+Heir+to+Blackblade) and, to a lesser extent, [Herald of Leshrac](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Herald+of+Leshrac). Since Korlash, [Manabarbs](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Manabarbs), and two other cards I wanted to use ([Tendrils of Corruption](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tendrils+of+Corruption) and [Pyrohemia](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyrohemia)) all cost four mana, I added a set of [Dimir House Guard](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dimir+House+Guard)s. The rest of the deck is made up of cheap removal ([Dead](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Dead), [Skred](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skred), even [Soul Spike](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soul+Spike)) and some cards that further the "it hurts to play your spells" theme ([Pooling Venom](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pooling+Venom) and [Kaervek the Merciless](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kaervek+the+Merciless)). I also added a [Magus of the Mirror](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Magus+of+the+Mirror) for kicks, because [Manabarbs](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Manabarbs) gives you the ability to lower your life total at will.

### Manabarbs + Bounce


 



![Snapback](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Snapback)

If there's one thing more annoying than taking 5 damage to play a [Kavu Climber](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kavu+Climber), it's taking 10. That's the situation your Climber-playing opponent might find him- or herself in while playing against this deck. There is so much good bounce in Standard right now. Among others, you've got [Riftwing Cloudskate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Riftwing+Cloudskate), [Snapback](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snapback), and, uh, [Reality Strobe](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reality+Strobe). One is "free" while the other two come cheap by way of suspend. I wanted to use [Arc Blade](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arc+Blade) as well, which suggested that [Paradox Haze](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Paradox+Haze) might be a good idea. [Ancestral Vision](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ancestral+Vision) soon followed.


Something I haven't mentioned yet is that you can dodge [Manabarbs](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Manabarbs) by using mana from non-land sources, like Elves or [Coalition Relic](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Coalition+Relic)s. That's what I'm going to do here. With a pair of [Coalition Relic](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Coalition+Relic)s in play, you can play or suspend every card in the deck without tapping a single land. I also haven't brought up the possibility of using cards like [Worship](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Worship) or [Platinum Angel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Platinum+Angel) to keep you alive while your mana is barbed. Might as well do it now, with the in-colour [Fortune Thief](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fortune+Thief). Add a [Commandeer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Commandeer) and voila.
