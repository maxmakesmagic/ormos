***Magic Origins* Release Events End August 12**


*Magic Origins* Release Events are only around until the Wednesday, August 12, downtime!


For Draft fans, the [Pack-per-Win Swiss Draft](http://magic.wizards.com/en/MTGO/articles/archive/magic-online/magic-online-magic-origins-prerelease-and-release-events-2015-06-29#ppwdraft) makes its triumphant return and runs alongside the [8-4](http://magic.wizards.com/en/MTGO/articles/archive/magic-online/magic-online-magic-origins-prerelease-and-release-events-2015-06-29#84draft) and [4-3-2-2](http://magic.wizards.com/en/MTGO/articles/archive/magic-online/magic-online-magic-origins-prerelease-and-release-events-2015-06-29#4322draft) Single Elimination Drafts in the Limited Queues Room. Try out any of the three and you'll get the Nissa, Vastwood Seer Avatar just for participating. Once you have a feel for the set, raise the stakes with the *Magic Origins* Release [64-Player Single Elimination Event](http://magic.wizards.com/en/MTGO/articles/archive/magic-online/magic-online-magic-origins-prerelease-and-release-events-2015-06-29#64playerdraft), and get the Liliana, Heretical Healer Avatar while you're at it.


Prefer Sealed? Try out the [Release Swiss Sealed](http://magic.wizards.com/en/MTGO/articles/archive/magic-online/magic-online-magic-origins-prerelease-and-release-events-2015-06-29#releasesealed) and get the Kytheon, Hero of Akros Avatar—that's the only place you'll be able to earn it throughout Release Events.

The MOCS 2015 September Season runs from August 26, 2015, through September 30, 2015. The promo card is:


![](https://media.wizards.com/2015/mtgo/card_promo_MOCS_stifle.png)
[Stifle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stifle)


The September MOPR period runs from August 26, 2015, through September 30, 2015. Here are the promo cards:


![](https://media.wizards.com/2015/mtgo/card_promo_MOPR_mizzium_meddler.png)![](https://media.wizards.com/2015/mtgo/card_promo_MOPR_orator_of_ojutai.png)


|
|  |
| Event Promo | Store Promo |



---

**Note:** Since deploying *Magic Origins* on *Magic Online*, we've discovered that the promo version of [Mizzium Meddler](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mizzium+Meddler) made its way into the client without a set symbol. The set symbol will be added with the launch of *Battle for Zendikar*.




---

Play in one or more events during the September season, and you’ll get a nonfoil [Mizzium Meddler](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mizzium+Meddler). Five or more and you’ll get an additional foil [Mizzium Meddler](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mizzium+Meddler). Spend at least $20 total in the *Magic Online* Store during Season 9, and you’ll get a nonfoil [Orator of Ojutai](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Orator+of+Ojutai). By spending $40 or more, you’ll get an additional, premium, [Orator of Ojutai](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Orator+of+Ojutai).


And remember, this means it's your last chance to get the Season 9 MOCS and MOPR promos, like this full-art [Cryptic Command](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cryptic+Command).


![](https://media.wizards.com/2015/mtgo/card_promo_MOCS_cryptic_command.png)
Earning 15 Qualifier Points (QPs) will earn you a copy of this season's MOCS promo card. You get one promo for every 15 QPs you earn. Players can earn QPs from MOCS Events, PTQ Events, Release Events, and more! Get more details about the *Magic Online* Championship Series [here](http://magic.wizards.com/en/2015-magic-online-championship-series).


*Magic Online* Player Rewards (MOPR) promos are earned a bit differently. In the MOPR program, *Magic Online* players are rewarded for participating in tournaments of a sufficient size, as well as making purchases in the *Magic Online* Store. Learn about the specifics of the program [here](http://magic.wizards.com/en/content/2015-magic-online-player-rewards).

**Path to Exile Promo Miscommunication and Fix**


When Season 9 Promos were granted during last week's downtime, it came to our attention that there was a miscommunication regarding which version of the [Path to Exile](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Path+to+Exile) promo was being awarded to players as part of the [*Magic Online* Player Rewards](http://magic.wizards.com/en/content/2015-magic-online-player-rewards) program. We advertised one promo on the website and granted another during the Wednesday, July 29, downtime.


We apologize for this error in communication and would like to make it up to players by giving everyone who qualified for last month's MOPR reward the [Path to Exile](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Path+to+Exile) promo that was advertised on [MTGO.com](http://magic.wizards.com/en/game-info/products/magic-online) in addition to the version they already received during the Wednesday, July 29, downtime. Expect to find the advertised version of [Path to Exile](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Path+to+Exile) in your account following the Wednesday, August 5, downtime. Thank you for your understanding!

***Magic Origins* Known Issues**


**Gameplay Issues**


* Collection | When zoomed, *Magic Origins* planeswalkers display the incorrect card symbol.
* Duel Scene | Casting any red instant or sorcery automatically removes mana generated from [Pyromancer's Goggles](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyromancer%27s+Goggles) if the mana is already floating in the user’s mana pool.
* Duel Scene | Creatures selected for the activated ability granted by [Consecrated by Blood](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Consecrated+by+Blood) do not have a red highlight around the card. The number of creatures remaining to sacrifice is also incorrectly not displayed in the prompt box.
* Duel Scene | The delayed triggered ability of [Liliana, Defiant Necromancer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Liliana%2C+Defiant+Necromancer) incorrectly does not display association arrows with creatures sent to the graveyard.
* Duel Scene | The mana ability of [Fertile Ground](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fertile+Ground) and similar cards incorrectly provides mana when the enchanted permanent is tapped for zero mana.

**Client Issues**


* Cardset | The promo version of [Mizzium Meddler](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mizzium+Meddler) made its way to *Magic Online* without a set symbol. The set symbol will be added with the launch of *Battle for Zendikar*.
* Duel Scene | In some circumstances, users are not allowed to choose the order of multiple replacement effects.
* Duel Scene | [Nissa, Sage Animist](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nissa%2C+Sage+Animist)'s third loyalty ability has an extra apostrophe in the text.
* Duel Scene | The stack window incorrectly resizes only vertically and not horizontally.
* Duel Scene | When [Sakashima the Imposter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sakashima+the+Imposter) copies a [Timberpack Wolf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Timberpack+Wolf), it does not get +1/+1 for other [Timberpack Wolves](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=398445).

**Commander Issues**


* Duel Scene | In a Commander game, a *Magic Origins* planeswalker that is the player’s commander will not return to the battlefield transformed when its owner chooses to send it back to the command zone.
* Duel Scene | We planned to implement the Commander rule commonly referred to as the “tuck rule” with the *Magic Origins* release during the July 22 downtime. This rule, which allows a player to put his or her commander in the command zone if it would go the library or hand, is proving more difficult than originally expected to implement. Because of this, the Commander change will not go live at this time. We want to take time to ensure the rule functions correctly in a wide, wide variety of Commander game situations, and that will take more development time.
