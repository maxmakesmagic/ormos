As you [may have heard](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/tcg/article.aspx?x=mtg/tcg/magic2011/spoiler), [Juggernaut](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Juggernaut) is in ***Magic** 2011*. And that means this is an excellent time to take a look at the way Juggernaut technology and flavor has changed throughout the years.

### In the Beginning: Alpha through Revised

[Juggernaut](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Juggernaut) started life as a war machine driven by a shadowy creature. The flavor text was from the point of view of one of its terrified targets, one of whom is seen being crushed under a wheel in the foreground.


> *We had taken refuge in a small cave, thinking the entrance was too narrow for it to follow. To our horror, its gigantic head smashed into the mountainside, ripping itself a new entrance.*

### The Otarian Detour

After *Revised*, [Juggernaut](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Juggernaut) took a vacation from **Magic** for awhile, due to concerns that it was too powerful. It was even banned at one point, on the theory that it created an unstoppable problem if combined with [Invisibility](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Invisibility). So *Odyssey* showed the Juggernaut's [Otarian Juggernaut](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Otarian%2BJuggernaut). There's no room for flavor text, but the art suggests that this one was built by dwarves. And dig those cool smokestacks!

### *Darksteel*: The Return of Juggernaut

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/arcana/482_darksteel.jpg)[Juggernaut](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Juggernaut) | Art by [Arnie Swekel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&artist=%5B%22Arnie+Swekel%22%5D)

When *Mirrodin* block rolled around, the perception of [Juggernaut](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Juggernaut)'s power level was more reasonable, and it certainly seemed like a good fit. Its new look was more of an earth-mover and less "a parade float with spikes on the front". The flavor text revealed that this version was made by goblins.


> *The goblins built it far larger than the cave opening, but to their glee, it smashed into the mountainside, ripping itself a new exit.*

Note that it's still smashing into a cave opening, just as it did in its original form.

### *Tenth Edition*: The Juggernaut's New Flavor

[Juggernaut](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Juggernaut) madea triumphant return to the Core Set in *Tenth Edition*, with the same art as *Darksteel* but new, non-goblin flavor text.


>  *Built with neither a way to steer nor a way to stop, the juggernauts were simply aimed at an enemy's best defenses and told to charge.*

### Welcome to the Future: Juggernaut in *Magic 2011*

There was no [Juggernaut](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Juggernaut) in ***Magic** 2010*, but it's back! And with brand new art and a new story, too!


> *The mighty city of An Karras, with its rich history, built over thousands of years, fell in three hours.*

Let that be a lesson to you. If you don't want to end up like the mighty city of An Karras, don't put so many walls in your city.
