2016 World Championship FAQ

 Mike Rosenberg is a writer and gamer and has been part of the Magic text coverage team since 2011. He joined Wizards as organized play’s content specialist in June 2014. 






Starting *today*, the 2016 *Magic: The Gathering* World Championship will commence, featuring 24 of the world's very best players competing across a four-day bonanza. The prize pool is $250,000, and the winner will walk away from the tournament on Sunday with a $70,000 first-place prize and the title of *Magic: The Gathering* World Champion.


Oh, and a shiny new trophy. Emphasis on shiny. And new. As in, this is literally the first time we are giving away this trophy design.

Today, I'm going to run you through the basics of what to expect. For folks new to following *Magic* coverage, this will likely answer a lot of your questions. For veterans, this will help you plan out your week of watching coverage (and it may even answer a question or two that comes up).


And for Organized Play regulars, I have some Regional Pro Tour Qualifier numbers for you at the very bottom of this article. If you're just interested in that, scroll all the way down (or, you know, read everything because it's the *Magic* World Championship and this will be a helpful read).


2016 World Championship Basics
==============================


Normally, this is the section where I bullet out what this tournament is, and it's really long. Today, it's going to be much shorter—but you should check out [Rich Hagon's deep dive](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/feature/world-championship-preview-2016-08-29) if you want more!


* This tournament is invitation-only, featuring 24 players from all over the world.
* The prize pool is $250,000, with $70,000 going to the winner.
* You should bookmark the [2016 *Magic* World Championship coverage page](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/2016wc). Like, now. You'll be seeing a lot of coverage there the next few days. Also, in the pre-show coverage tab is all of the extra reading that will show you what to expect from *Magic* at PAX West, the World Championship, and more.
* It's four days of really, really good *Magic* on [Twitch](http://twitch.tv/magic), [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/user/wizardsmtg), [Niconico](http://live.nicovideo.jp/watch/lv272256786), and [BiliBili](http://www.bilibili.com/topic/653.html), at the Paramount Theatre in Seattle if you have a PAX West badge, and wherever you might want to watch online, so tune in.

That coverage page houses a lot more for you to read in the pre-show coverage section if you want to know about *Magic* at PAX West or the World Championship, so if you want to dive into the nitty-gritty, I advise checking that page out.


When Does Coverage Start?
=========================


Pay close attention. This isn't your typical *Magic* tournament.


* Day One coverage starts Thursday at 9 a.m. PT/noon ET/4 p.m. UTC and features three rounds of *Eldritch Moon*-*Shadows over Innistrad* Booster Draft followed by four rounds of Standard. All matches this day are best two out of three games.
* Day Two coverage starts on Friday at 2 p.m. PT/5 p.m. ET/9 p.m. UTC and features three rounds of *Eldritch Moon*-*Shadows over Innistrad* Booster Draft (although if you want to enjoy some *Kaladesh* goodness, I *reeeeeeeeally* recommend tuning in at 11 a.m. on [twitch.tv/magic](http://twitch.tv/magic) for the three hours prior to the start of Day Two). All matches this day are best two out of three games.
* Day Three coverage starts on Saturday at 10 a.m. PT/1 p.m. ET/5 p.m. UTC and features four rounds of Modern. All matches this day are best two out of three games. At the conclusion of those four rounds, we will cut to our Top 4 players.
* Day Four coverage begins on Sunday at 11 a.m. PT/2 p.m. ET/6 p.m. UTC. The Top 4 single-elimination playoff matches are Standard, and feature best-three-out-of-five-game matches.

Of course, if you follow our [Twitch channel](https://www.twitch.tv/magic), you can get notifications when we go live, so I also recommend doing that.


The Coverage Team

Where Can I Experience Coverage?
================================


The 2016 *Magic: The Gathering* World Championship will feature live video, articles, and plenty of tweets all weekend.


Watch the video coverage live on [twitch.tv/magic](https://www.twitch.tv/magic). Alternatively, you can also watch the live stream (in English) on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/user/wizardsmtg) and [Niconico](http://live.nicovideo.jp/watch/lv272256786). Japanese-language coverage can be found on Niconico, and Chinese-language coverage will be broadcast on BiliBili.


Articles will all be on the [coverage page](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/2016wc), and that includes decklists, pairings, results, and standings.


Additionally, you can join the conversation around the 2016 *Magic: The Gathering* World Championship on Twitter using the hashtag [#mtgchamp](https://twitter.com/hashtag/MTGChamp). Meghan Wolff will be on social media duties this weekend, and your tweets might make it into our live broadcast or our CoverItLive content wall (a new addition to our coverage page that we're trying out for the World Championship!).


When Will Decklists Be Published?
=================================


All of the competitors' Standard and Modern decklists will be published after the first round in which the players compete in that specific format. This means:


* All Standard decklists will be published after Round 4 on Thursday, September 1
* All Modern decklists will be published after Round 11 on Saturday, September 3

Draft Viewers from both drafts will be published once Round 3 and Round 10 are underway, respectively.


Should I Tune In to the World Championship?
===========================================


Yes, *of course* you should. See you in the [Twitch](http://www.twitch.tv/magic) chat later today! I'm sure you'll all be nice. Kappa.


(But seriously, be nice. We have chat rules and loving moderators who ensure those rules are followed.)


I guess that wraps up today's Organized P—oh, right. Regional Pro Tour Qualifier numbers!
