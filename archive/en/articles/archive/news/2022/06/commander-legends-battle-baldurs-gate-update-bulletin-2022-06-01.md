Greetings, adventurers!


The release of *Commander Legends: Battle for Baldur's Gate* is almost upon us. As usual, the set comes with some rules updates and some changes to the text of a few cards in the Oracle card reference. This document is written while the rules and card text changes are still going through editing, so it's possible they'll be a little different from the final changes. When the rules are finalized, you'll be able to see them on the [rules page](https://magic.wizards.com/en/game-info/gameplay/rules-and-formats/rules). Once the set is live, official Oracle card text for each card can be found on [Gatherer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/).


Alright, let's dive in!
