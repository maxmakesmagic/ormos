Masashi Oiso is the Japanese Gabriel Nassif. His deckbuilding skills and four Pro Tour Top 4 appearances have earned him respect both at home and abroad, with many Americans saying that they'd like to work with him more than anyone else. ![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/ptnag05/fm5.jpg)*Oiso dispatched Gadiel with great speed.*


Gadiel Szleifer is part of **Magic**'s new breed of stars. After giving up the JSS for the Pro Tour at only 14, he has gone on to achieve a startling amount of success, narrowly missing out on Rookie of the Year in 2004, and then kicking off the 2005 season with a Top 8 at Pro Tour-Columbus plus a Team Limited Grand Prix win as part of :B. Unfortunately for both of these players, their opening draft was rather unkind, forcing them to battle every round to stave off elimination from the tournament.


### Game 1


Gadiel quickly went down to the three-spell, nine-land draw to put him in a big hole in this struggle to survive. The 15-year-old suddenly found himself down a game only five minutes into the round, putting him precariously close to twiddling his thumbs waiting for the start of Pro Tour-Atlanta two months from now. And you thought your wait for the next round on **Magic Online**was long...

### Game 2


Oiso kicked off game 2 with [Nezumi Cutthroat](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nezumi+Cutthroat), a major problem for Szleifer's blue-white deck to deal with. [Mystic Restraints](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mystic+Restraints) solved the rat riddle after only four points of damage, but Oiso just followed that up with an even more troublesome [Marrow-Gnawer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Marrow-Gnawer). Things were not looking good for **Magic**'s teenage bad boy...


[Blood Rites](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Rites) from Oiso added an additional wrinkle, but the real problem was that Szleifer couldn't stop plucking lands for the second game in a row. Oiso used his [Blood Rites](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Rites) plus two [Ember-Fist Zubera](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ember-Fist+Zubera) and another gnaw from a fearful rat to finish any thoughts Gadiel had of a comeback, and keep his own hopes for Day 2 alive.
