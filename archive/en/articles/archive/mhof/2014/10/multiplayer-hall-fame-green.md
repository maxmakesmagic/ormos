Today we look at the very best multiplayer cards ever printed in green. As a long-time green mage, I'm honored to be able to present them to you! For those who might not know me, let me introduce myself. I've been playing multiplayer *Magic* since 1994, which was really the Wild West of *Magic: The Gathering*. Back then, we played for ante, so the more players we had the bigger the pile of ante cards and the bigger the potential stakes. I won my [Diamond Valley](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Diamond+Valley) and lost my [Mox Pearl](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mox+Pearl) in big ante games.



When Sheldon Menery brought a casual multiplayer format now called Commander to mainstream *Magic* players, I became a huge fan and write about it quite a bit in [my weekly column over at StarCityGames.com](http://www.starcitygames.com/tags/BennieSmith). In fact, I literally wrote the book on the format: *The Complete Commander, An Unofficial Guide* can be [downloaded as an eBook](http://www.starcitygames.com/pages/completecommander/), and you can check out a sample chapter of the book there too. Longtime readers of DailyMTG might remember when [I had weekly column here](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/magazine/archive.aspx?author=bennie%20smith) covering *Magic Online*, along with some other features like Single Card Strategy. I want to express my gratitude to Bruce Richard and Blake Rasmussen for giving me the opportunity to come back for something so awesome.


Enough about me—let's get to the cards!


The Champ: Sylvan Primordial
============================


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Sylvan Primordial)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sylvan Primordial)
Multiplayer Animal Rankings


**Rattlesnake**—These cards tell opponents to bother somebody who is not you.


**Gorilla**—They make an immediate impact on the game.


**Spider**—They surprise opponents in the nastiest ways.


**Pigeon**—They get better with more players.


**Plankton**—They give everybody resources like mana and life and cards.


**Cockroach**—They can't be kept down, providing good value.



It's hard to argue with [Sylvan Primordial](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sylvan+Primordial) being the best multiplayer *Magic* card ever printed. It checks off nearly all the boxes you want—a large creature that commands respect, impacts the board by knocking off problematic noncreature permanents, and provides you with additional mana resources. The "noncreature" clause is as broad as green can get, letting you take out Planeswalkers, artifacts, enchantments, or lands. The fact that his triggered ability gets progressively better with each opponent is really what pushes him over the top—if you have four opponents, being able to destroy four noncreature permanents and accelerating your mana by four is a giant benefit stapled to a 6/8 creature with reach.


Since [Sylvan Primordial](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sylvan+Primordial) is a creature card, it's pretty easy to build your deck in such a way to benefit from his triggered ability over and over—cards like [Conjurer's Closet](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Conjurer%27s+Closet) and [Deadeye Navigator](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deadeye+Navigator) spring to mind, and this interaction is likely what landed him on the [ban list for Commander](http://mtgcommander.net/rules.php).


The only real drawback in playing [Sylvan Primordial](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sylvan+Primordial) is his mana cost; seven mana is not totally unrealistic but it isn't easy. When playing [Sylvan Primordial](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sylvan+Primordial) you'll probably want to combine him with early mana acceleration such as [Sakura-Tribe Elder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sakura-Tribe+Elder), [Wall of Roots](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wall+of+Roots), and [Cultivate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cultivate). Another option is to have ways to "cheat" him into play, such as [Fist of Suns](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fist+of+Suns), [Elvish Piper](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elvish+Piper), or [Pattern of Rebirth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pattern+of+Rebirth).


Runner-Up: Seedborn Muse
========================


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Seedborn Muse)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seedborn Muse)
A close second is the relatively harmless-looking [Seedborn Muse](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seedborn+Muse). I've debated other multiplayer enthusiasts on just how overpowered this card is in multiplayer formats. They always seem to get fooled by being a relatively fragile creature for five mana, but that's just effective camouflage. When people are looking at the battlefield and evaluating threats, their eyes often roll right past this little 2/4 Spirit and settle on a creature that's larger or more directly threatening; that's a huge mistake. [Seedborn Muse](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seedborn+Muse) is a resource multiplier unparalleled to any other card in multiplayer games, getting exponentially better the more players there are.


The game of *Magic* uses tapping to limit the amount of resources cards can give you: a creature can either tap to attack or instead block for you; a [Trading Post](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Trading+Post) taps to provide you with just one of four different effects. Winning a game of *Magic* often comes down to carefully and effectively managing your limited resources, but if you've got a [Seedborn Muse](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seedborn+Muse) in play, those limits are dramatically reduced. You've got all your mana and any cards that tap to activate available to use on your own turn, and then again on each other player's turn. You can attack with your creatures, and then untap them and have them to block.


Now imagine you have a [Vedalken Orrery](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vedalken+Orrery) in play. You have almost no limits—you get your own turn to do stuff, and then you get a free turn concurrent to each opponent's turn to do everything except have a draw step, attack step, or play a land.


Harmless? Hardly! This is one of the best multiplayer cards ever printed, period.


Most Likely to Win Friends: Rites of Flourishing
================================================


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Rites of Flourishing)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rites of Flourishing)
The hallmark of a fun multiplayer card will often be when it has an effect that benefits everyone; the Top 50 list has more than a few. These are the sort of "how to win friends and influence people" cards that can sway choices in your favor when opponents are figuring out threat assessments; if each turn they're getting a benefit from having you around, maybe they'll keep you around a little longer.


At a small mana cost, [Rites of Flourishing](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rites+of+Flourishing) provides two very powerful effects for all players: each player gets to draw an extra card and play an extra land each turn. Together, these will increase the pace of your game and keep everyone's hands flush with cards to recover from sweepers and mass removal. The risk in running these sorts of cards is your opponents getting all the benefits before you do. While that is true with the extra card draw, when you play [Rites of Flourishing](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rites+of+Flourishing) you get to take advantage of the extra land drop right away. You get the best of both worlds—an immediate mana benefit while also looking like the hero to the table by spreading the wealth.


Shock and Awe: Biorhythm
========================


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Biorhythm)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Biorhythm)
In multiplayer *Magic*, green players often find themselves at a disadvantage. So much of green's power is tied up in creatures, but in multiplayer games it is often very wise for players to stuff their decks full of mass removal—cards like [Wrath of God](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wrath+of+God), [Damnation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Damnation), [Blasphemous Act](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blasphemous+Act), and [Evacuation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Evacuation) all take the steam out of plans that lean heavily on creatures. It's very rare that you can punish players for utilizing that strategy but [Biorhythm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Biorhythm) is a card that will do just that in spectacular fashion.


Say you attack with a bunch of creatures and your target smugly plays [Evacuation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Evacuation), forcing you (and everyone else) to return all your creatures to your hands. Tap your mana, replay your cheapest creature spell, then play [Biorhythm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Biorhythm)—congratulations, you've just beaten everyone else at your table!


Or say an opponent has managed to buffer his or her life total into the 100s and just has one or two creatures on the board. Cast [Biorhythm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Biorhythm) to bring that player back down to size, where your creature horde—or big tramplers—can quickly finish the job.


This powerful effect comes at a cost: eight mana is not a trivial amount, especially if you need to cast a creature or two yourself the same turn you want to cast [Biorhythm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Biorhythm). Of course, green provides many ways to generate a lot of mana—[Dictate of Karametra](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dictate+of+Karametra); [Mana Reflection](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Reflection); and [Rofellos, Llanowar Emissary](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rofellos%2C+Llanowar+Emissary) to name just a few—which is why [Biorhythm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Biorhythm) has been banned in the Commander format.


Truly Buzz-Worthy: Hornet Queen
===============================


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Hornet Queen)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hornet Queen)
When the world was introduced to [Hornet Queen](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hornet+Queen) in the very first *Commander* product, casual *Magic* players who were fans of green rejoiced! It's a rare thing for green to get a good flier and [Hornet Queen](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hornet+Queen) isn't just good, it's fantastic. Getting 6 power worth of flying creatures for seven mana is a great rate for the nonflying color green, but since it's spread out among five creatures, that makes your mana investment much less vulnerable to targeted removal spells. It'll take more than a [Terror](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Terror) to clear away your flying presence.


The crème de la crème is that each of the bodies has deathtouch, which effectively slams the brakes on any sort of offense pointed in your direction. Does your opponent want to send a huge attacker your way only to have it die to a 1/1 Insect token?


Veteran green mages also love deathtouch because of how beautifully it interacts with another green mainstay—trample! Basically, a creature with deathtouch and trample only needs to assign a single point of damage to a blocker, since that point of damage is considered "lethal," and all the rest of its power can be assigned to the player. This won't normally be that big of deal with 1/1 creatures, but if you can pump their power and give them trample—say, with activations from [Kamahl, Fist of Krosa](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kamahl%2C+Fist+of+Krosa)—then things get out of hand very quickly.


You can use [Hornet Queen](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hornet+Queen) as an engine of sorts to generate more and more 1/1 Insect tokens if you can keep setting off its enters-the-battlefield trigger. My favorite is [Nim Deathmantle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nim+Deathmantle), which lets you block and kill a creature with [Hornet Queen](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hornet+Queen), then pay the death trigger from [Nim Deathmantle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nim+Deathmantle) to bring [Hornet Queen](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hornet+Queen) back from the graveyard to make four more token creatures.


So how about a deck that features many of green's greatest hits? I'd be remiss if I didn't give you all a sweet Commander list built around one of the legendary creatures in the Top 50 list, and since we just talked about how nice it would be to pair up [Hornet Queen](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hornet+Queen) with [Kamahl, Fist of Krosa](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kamahl%2C+Fist+of+Krosa), let's see what we can cook up with our favorite Human Druid!

[Kamahl, Fist of Krosa](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kamahl%2C+Fist+of+Krosa) really is a fantastic multiplayer card. He's got [Overrun](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Overrun) on tap for each 2GGG you want to spend, and if you're lacking in creatures to boost he can recruit your own lands to attack! This can be particularly beneficial if you have an [Oblivion Stone](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oblivion+Stone) in play, since you can sacrifice [Oblivion Stone](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oblivion+Stone) to clear away all nonland creatures and potential blockers but leave your animated lands free and clear to attack. But that's not the best thing about Kamahl.


Remember above when I talked about [Biorhythm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Biorhythm), and how decks that rely on creatures can often fall prey to all the mass-removal spells that people often lean on in multiplayer games? Kamahl's activated ability to cheaply animate lands isn't limited to your own lands—you can animate lands your opponents control, so if someone casts [Wrath of God](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wrath+of+God) when you have Kamahl in play, you can punish that player for it by animating one of his or her lands for each green mana you have available. You can use this to set up a "rock and a hard place" scenario for an opponent, building up your board presence with creatures your opponent needs to kill, but forcing your opponent to cripple his or her own mana-base if using a mass removal spell.


Another Top 50 all-star is [Genesis](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Genesis), which has long been a multiplayer favorite. As a 4/4 for five he's not an insignificant board presence, but he also makes for a deterrent to large attackers or mass removal since he really shines once he's in your graveyard. One of the sweet spots you can find yourself in with this deck is [Genesis](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Genesis) in your graveyard and [Skullclamp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skullclamp) on the battlefield. Play [Eternal Witness](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eternal+Witness), get a card back from your graveyard, equip with [Skullclamp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skullclamp) to kill it and draw two cards. Then during your upkeep use [Genesis](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Genesis)'s ability to get [Eternal Witness](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eternal+Witness) back, cast it again, and retrieve something else from your graveyard. This is the sort of long-game inevitability that is hard to beat.


While [Sylvan Primordial](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sylvan+Primordial) and its predecessor [Primeval Titan](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Primeval+Titan) have been banned from Commander, there's a "fixed" version that was recently printed in *Conspiracy*. [Realm Seekers](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Realm+Seekers) does a nice [Multani, Maro-Sorcerer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Multani%2C+Maro-Sorcerer) impression when it first comes into play, gaining +1/+1 counters equal to the total number of cards in all players' hands. See how nice it is to feed everyone cards with [Rites of Flourishing](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rites+of+Flourishing)? After that, you can cash in a +1/+1 counter for three mana to search your library for any land you want and put it in your hand. There are many powerful lands in Commander—[Maze of Ith](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Maze+of+Ith), [Gaea's Cradle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gaea%27s+Cradle), and [Thespian's Stage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thespian%27s+Stage) spring to mind—and having a reusable way to search for them is fantastic, especially when it's tied to a really big creature. And when he's fitting to die you can use cards like [Cauldron of Souls](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cauldron+of+Souls) to bring him right back to do it all over again!


[Night Soil](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Night+Soil) is a dynamite card that gets better the more graveyards you have to plunder. The mana cost for activation is incredibly cheap, and there are a ton of cards in *Magic* that care about Saproling tokens—go to Gatherer and search for [Saproling in the card text](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&amp;method=visual&amp;action=advanced&amp;text=+%5bSaproling%5d) and you'll find a bunch of them. My favorite non-[Thallid](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thallid) one is [Elvish Farmer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elvish+Farmer)! In this deck, [Night Soil](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Night+Soil) mainly serves as a way to hose opponents who are relying on graveyard recursion, while also providing chump blockers or warm bodies to pump with Kamahl's [Overrun](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Overrun) activations.


The last card I wanted to highlight is the delightfully fun enchantment [Lurking Predators](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lurking+Predators). Each time your opponent casts a spell, you have a chance to reveal some creature card from the top of your deck, and if it's a creature, put it into play. The more opponents you have, the more spells get cast, and the more chances you have to reveal creatures you can put into play for free. But why leave it to chance? Use cards like [Sylvan Library](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sylvan+Library) and [Sensei's Divining Top](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sensei%27s+Divining+Top) to set up the top of your library with a steady stream of creatures, or cards you'd rather put on the bottom of your library than have to draw.


If you see cards on the Top 50 list you've never played before, do yourself a favor and give them a try. I think you'll be pleasantly surprised how good they are at your next multiplayer game! Are there any green multiplayer favorites of yours that didn't make the cut?
