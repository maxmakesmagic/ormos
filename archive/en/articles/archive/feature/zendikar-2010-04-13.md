 Lurking in the space between the aether and the physical plane, a great evil waits to emerge…

Zendikar is a land of danger and adventure, a world of deadly risks and priceless rewards. It is also a prison to one of the most deadly threats the Multiverse has ever known: the dreaded Eldrazi.

Nissa Revane, a Planeswalker and proud elf warrior, is witness to what they can do when she stumbles into a vanguard wave of the monstrous brood. What she doesn't know is that the brood is but a pale reflection of the titans that are still imprisoned. 

But the ancient vampire Planeswalker Sorin Markov knows all too well the power of the ancient Eldrazi titans. He was among the original jailers of the ancient scourge and he has returned to Zendikar to make sure they do not escape. 

Both have their own ideas about what is to be done, but neither knows what's in store as they set out across the land in search of the source of the Eldrazi uprising.
