In a previous installment of [Magic Arcana](/en/node/605791), we incorrectly reported that there would be 34 collectible box toppers associated with *Eighth Edition*.


We were wrong! Thanks to a last-minute decision to nix one of them, there are actually only 33 in circulation. The [Giant Badger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Giant+Badger) box topper was designed but never actually printed. Why? Well, since it didn't originate in an expansion set, there was no logo to put on the back of the card. The art team tried using "Shattered Chains," the name of the novel through which the card was originally available, but that looked a little awkward.


  
*The design for the back of the never-produced Giant Badger box topper.*
  
  
  
 Shattered Chains, *the 1995 novel that contained a coupon redeemable for a Giant Badger card.*
