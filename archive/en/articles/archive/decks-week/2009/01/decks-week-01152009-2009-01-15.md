The first full weekend of Pro Tour Qualifier-Honolulu has come and gone, and we've got an early look at some of the lists. Louisville checked in with a [Proclamation of Rebirth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Proclamation+of+Rebirth)/[Martyr of Sands](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Martyr+of+Sands) deck taking the top slot. Rounding out the Top 8 were some industry favorites (Zoo, Faeries, etc.) but there were more than enough surprises to keep things interesting. One thing is for certain: this year's Extended season promises to be an exciting one. To find a PTQ near you, visit [here](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/TCG/Events.aspx?x=mtgcom/protour/honolulu09-qualifiers).

Of course, there's more going on than just the Honolulu qualifiers. **Magic Online** events are firing around the clock, and we've got all the Premier Event Top 8 lists here for your perusal. What's getting big in Standard since the World Championships? Are there any wild new strategies you should be aware of prior to Friday Night **Magic** this weekend? We've got all the data you could hope for perusing!

As a special treat, Decks of the Week debuts 100 Card Singleton with a Premier Event from **Magic Online**. Find out what deck reigned supreme in this one-of-a-kind blast of a format.

Enjoy!
