![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gprim04/fm9_1.jpg)Both players have one loss and Blech tried to talk Ruel into a draw but the Frenchman declined as he would still make day two if he lost which doesn't seem to be the case of the German. Ruel is running mono green [Tooth and Nail](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tooth+and+Nail) and Blech is with Affinity. Blech (to me): "He's a bad man" (talking bout Ruel's refusal).  
 Me: "I would have done the same heh, sorry mbrah".


Ruel won the all mighty die roll and both players kept their hand, Ruel playing a [Forest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest) on his turn one while the German played a [Great Furnace](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Great+Furnace), a [Chromatic Sphere](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chromatic+Sphere) and an [Ornithopter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ornithopter). The land got [Oxidize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oxidize)d EoT and Ruel played a second [Forest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest) and Scried for a [Cloudpost](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloudpost). Blech played another artifact land along with a [Frogmite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Frogmite) and passed the turn. The Frenchman had another [Sylvan Scrying](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sylvan+Scrying) to get [Cloudpost](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloudpost) number two.


Blech: " Nice draw".


But Blech's draw seemed pretty good too as he summoned another [Frogmite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Frogmite) as well as a [Somber Hoverguard](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Somber+Hoverguard) on his next turn. Ruel chose to play a third [Forest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest) to be able to cast the [Oxidize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oxidize) he got back with his [Eternal Witness](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eternal+Witness). He traded it for one of the [Frogmite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Frogmite) but chose to keep his [Oxidize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oxidize) and went down to 13. Blech's only play was an Aether Vial, and Ruel summoned a [Solemn Simulacrum](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Solemn+Simulacrum) on his fifth turn. The German then peeled a [Thoughtcast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtcast) that gave him a [Disciple of the Vault](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Disciple+of+the+Vault), which was enough to bring Ruel down to 9 after he [Oxidize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oxidize)d an attacking Nexus. The French had the mana to entwine a [Tooth and Nail](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tooth+and+Nail) on his sixth turn and got [Platinum Angel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Platinum+Angel) and [Leonin Abunas](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leonin+Abunas). Most affinity players would generally scoop in this position but it seemed like Blech could deal with this situation as he chose not too. It didn't really matter as Ruel next got to [Mindslaver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mindslaver) the German and drew a timely [Arcbound Ravager](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arcbound+Ravager). This time, it was enough to make the German scoop his cards.


Blech didn't seem too happy to have lost this first game as he seems to think the pre-sideboard game should favor him.


Antoine Ruel 1 - 0 Reinhard Blech 


Neither player had to mulligan and Blech had three workers on board by turn two facing a [Relic Barrier](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Relic+Barrier) on Ruel's side of the board. The German followed with [Thoughtcast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtcast) and [Arcbound Ravager](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arcbound+Ravager) while all the Frenchman could do is Scry for a [Cloudpost](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloudpost).


Blech: "Nice draw by the way, so I have to think. I'm really jetlagged too…"  
 Ruel: " Yeah, yeah, take your time."


After thinking for a couple minutes, it turns out he had the kill in hand as Ruel was tapped out. He just played a [Disciple of the Vault](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Disciple+of+the+Vault) and an Aether Vial, and sac'ed all his stuff dealing lethal damage.


Antoine Ruel 1 - 1 Reinhard Blech


Blech: "Draw?"  
 Ruel: "No."


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gprim04/fm9_2.jpg)Both player kept their opening seven for the deciding game, and Antoine opened with [Forest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest), [Blinkmoth Nexus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blinkmoth+Nexus) and Scrying for [Cloudpost](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloudpost), while Blech had a Nexus and a Vial followed by a turn two [Frogmite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Frogmite) along with another Vial but Ruel was able to slow him down as he had a Shaman for Blech's [Great Furnace](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Great+Furnace) on his third turn. The German had no third land and flashed to me his double [Thoughtcast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtcast), double Plating, Hoverguard hand in disgust. Ruel had a turn four [Oblivion Stone](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oblivion+Stone) and got rid of the German's board (two Vials and an [Atog](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Atog)) on turn five. He followed up with two Witness on the following turn, and had double Shaman when Blech finally drew a third land to cast his Ravager.


Blech: " I probably win if I win the die roll."  
 Ruel: "Yeah…"


Antoine Ruel 2-1 Reinhard Blech.
