Welcome to the latest roundup of news from the *Magic* Top 25 Pro Rankings. So, cards on the table time—even the best players can't be the best players all the time. *Magic*, since you ask, is a card game, and sometimes that means that the wrong card ends up on top of your deck—a *lot*. If proof were needed of this, you should look no further than the results from Grand Prix in [Liverpool](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/gpliv15) and [Miami](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/gpmia15) last weekend. In total, eighteen of our Top 25 were in action. Here's how it breaks down:



* Wins, Finals, Semifinals, Top 8s—None.
* Top 16s—None.
* Top 32s—In Liverpool, Josh Utter-Leyton, who returns to the rankings at No. 24. In Miami, Seth Manfield, who remains at No. 13.
* Top 64s—Sam Black (No. 10) and Owen Turtenwald (No. 1) in Miami.
* Day Twos—No. 6 William Jensen, No. 12 Yuuya Watanabe, both in Miami.
* Out on Day One—Martin Juza, Stanislav Cifka, and Jérémy Dezani in Liverpool. Shahar Shenhar, Ari Lax, Jacob Wilson, Reid Duke, Ben Stark, Willy Edel, Alexander Hayne, Kentaro Yamamoto, and Chris Fennell in Miami.


That's right—*twelve* out of eighteen didn't make it to Day Two. That's the kind of carnage we really don't see very often. Next week, look for normal service to be resumed at Grand Prix in Cleveland and Auckland, where Limited takes center stage.



Definitely a week to forget for our *Magic* Top 25, and a reminder that bad beats happen to the best of us. See you all next week for more from the *Magic* Top 25 Pro Rankings.
