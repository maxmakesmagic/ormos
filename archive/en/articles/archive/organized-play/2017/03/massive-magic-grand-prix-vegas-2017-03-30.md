As we head into *Amonkhet* previews, Organized Play's weekly articles will be taking a short hiatus until the week of April 17 while everyone checks out all the new cards that will be coming out in a few short weeks.


However, as the next two weeks look ahead to *Amonkhet*, this week I'll be looking even further beyond that to Grand Prix Las Vegas. The event (or rather, events) will be taking place June 14–18, with *three* separate main events all happening in one week. Then, we'll take a quick look at the 2016–17 Pro Tour Team Series soft launch, with the late application deadline coming up and a very small revision to the rules.


We're going to kick off this week with something . . . well, massive.


Massive *Magic* at GP Vegas
===========================


A couple of years ago, a very special side event gave spectators and tournament goers of the Pro Tour an experience that was uh, living life large.

Massive *Magic* was an oversized experience where people played a game of *Magic*. Except, of course, the cards were massive, and because of the literal size of the game, it required the assistance of many spectators to necessitate the basic mechanics of a game of *Magic*.


These were some extraordinary combinations of *Magic* spectacle and audience participation, and Massive *Magic* is making a special return at Grand Prix Las Vegas!


On **June 16** at the Las Vegas Convention Center for Grand Prix Las Vegas, we'll be hosting a very special Massive *Magic* game for fans to participate in and enjoy in the evening. More importantly, it'll mark the beginning of *Hour of Devastation* previews, meaning GP Vegas attendees will get to see several *Hour of Devastation* cards for the very first time—and in oversized form, no less!


Interested in seeing a special preview edition of Massive *Magic* for yourself? Head on over to the [Grand Prix Las Vegas website](http://grandprixvegas.com/) for more info about the whole week, and maybe we'll see you in Vegas this June!


Team Series Late Application Deadline Approaching
=================================================


In Pro Tour Team Series news, the late application deadline for the 2016–17 Pro Tour Team Series soft launch is approaching. This is your official "LAST CALL" for any aspiring players who are qualified for [Pro Tour *Amonkhet*](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/premierplay/protour/ptakh), are not already on a team, and want to form one for 2016–17.


Coinciding with this, we've published a revision of the Pro Tour Team Series Rules and Eligibility, which you can find on the [Pro Tour Team Series program page](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/protour/teamseries). Nothing too big to highlight in this, and the specific changes can be found below:


* The previous version of the Team Series rules incorrectly did not include the prize to the Top 4 teams after Pro Tour *Amonkhet* mentioned in the [October 6 Organized Play article](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/organized-play/state-organized-play-pt-kaladesh-2016-10-06) from Hélène nor the stipulation of all six team members' Pro Point earnings at Pro Tour *Hour of Devastation* counting toward the team score for that Pro Tour only. Both are now in the rules to reflect what was previously announced. To clarify:
	+ The top *five* Pro Point finishes of the members of a team are added to a team's score in the 2016–17 season, *except* for Pro Tour *Hour of Devastation*, where all six Pro Point finishes are added to the team score.
	+ At the end of Pro Tour *Amonkhet*, the Top 4 teams are given invitations to Pro Tour *Hour of Devastation*.
* Some clarifications were added to the application process and team name, logo, and uniform design guidelines. These clarifications are in line with what was expected of team applications for Pro Tour *Aether Revolt*, and the rules were updated to provide more detail on those specifics.

We look forward to seeing teams in Pro Tour *Amonkhet* in a couple of weeks!
