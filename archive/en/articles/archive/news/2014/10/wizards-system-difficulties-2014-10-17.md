Today, Friday, October 17, 2014, Wizards of the Coast is experiencing issues affecting our database servers. These issues affect *Magic* systems such as *Magic* *Online* as well as our other systems, such as Wizards Event Reporter and the Store and Event Locator.



As of 12 noon PT we believe we have identified the problems causing these issues and are working diligently to restore our systems to full functionality. Currently we believe we will have these issues resolved prior to the start of Grand Prix Los Angeles.


More updates to come.
