### Richard Garfield, Inventor of Magic: The Gathering

[![Magic Pro Tour Hall of Fame](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/tournamentcenter/halloffame.jpg)](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgevent/hof/welcome)

*Editor's note: Over the course of the voting, we will occasionally be posting ballots of voters who wish to make their choices public, along with any additional analysis they used to come to their decisions. If other Selection Committee members wish to provide analysis and explanation of their votes for publication, [click here](javascript:makeWinXY('/company/emailtoauthor.asp?author=Hall%20of%20Fame%20Inbox',500,455);).*

I likely have a different perspective on what the Hall of Fame means than the typical voter or follower of this vote. I have been told that as a voter, I should determine what I want a Hall of Fame vote to mean to me and vote that way. This would contribute to how we the voters look at every future ballot. 

I weighed the following three categories and came up with my favorites based upon these categories:

Play, Deckbuilding, Community.

My list is:

1. Jon Finkel: Of course.  
 2. Darwin Kastle: Play & Deckbuilding  
 3. Alan Comer: Deckbuilding   
 4. Chris Pikula: Community   
 5. David Price: Community

All these players have shown excellence in play and spirit, and for me personally they are the top of this list, though it was a very difficult decision to make. There are people that I have left off that I hope to vote for in the future, because I really wanted more than five slots.
