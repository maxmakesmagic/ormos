Remember [last month](/en/articles/archive/alternate-mayors-2011-10-25) when we looked at the regular and prerelease versions of [Mayor of Avabruck](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mayor+of+Avabruck) (and [Howlpack Alpha](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Howlpack+Alpha)) and had a good time thinking about the differences in the way two artists interpreted the same art description? Let's do that again! This time, we'll use the *Innistrad* Launch Party card, which also gives us double-faced alternate fun.


### Ludevic's Test Subject



> 
> Color: Blue creature
> 
> 
> Location: An alchemist's lab
> 
> 
> Action: Show a large leathery egg suspended between metal spikes in an alchemistâ€™s lab. The grayish-blue egg is surrounded by an aura of jagged blue energy that emanates from the metal spikes. It's this energy that keeps the egg suspended. Glowing blue goo drips off the egg.
> 
> 
> Focus: The egg
> 
> 
> Mood: What happens when you cross an egg with electricity?

### Ludevic's Abomination



> 
> Color: Blue creature
> 
> 
> Location: The alchemist's lab from [Egg Experiment].
> 
> 
> Action: Use the creature in the styleguide p. 85A as your starting point. This creature has emerged from the egg pictured in [Egg Experiment]. It's an experiment that's gone horribly wrong because the monster almost fills the entire lab from ceiling to floor and is crushing equipment, cracking walls, and maybe even destroying the ceiling as it pushes up against it.
> 
> 
> Focus: The enormous monster.
> 
> 
> Mood: This wasn't how it was supposed to be!
>

And here, for easy comparison, are the four pieces of art as they appear on the two versions of the card!

...oh! You're still here? Were you wondering about that "creature in the styleguide p. 85A" from the art description of [Ludevic's Abomination](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ludevic%27s+Abomination)? It looked like this:
