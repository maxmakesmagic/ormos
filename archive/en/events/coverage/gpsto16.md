The Moon over Stockholm
=======================




An original field of 1,244 has been whittled down to just 352. Now it's time for Eldritch Moon/Shadows over Innistrad Booster Draft here at Grand Prix Stockholm!
















GRAND PRIX STOCKHOLM 2016

DAY 2 COVERAGE



The sun had risen at about four in the morning on this second day of Grand Prix Stockholm. But the celestial body foremost on everyone's mind was of course the Eldritch Moon. Magic's latest release had shaken up the Sealed Deck rounds the day before, now it was time to draft!


Of an original 1,244 players, 352 had managed the requisite record of 6-3 or better and qualified for the second day of competition. Most of the world's current best had already made the trip to Australia for next week's Pro Tour Eldritch Moon and this weekend's Grand Prix Sydney. Nevertheless, the field here in Stockholm included various notable players like Eliott Boussaud, Thomas Enevoldsen, Kenny Öberg, Anton Jonsson, Peter Vieren, Mark Dictus, Elias Watsfeldt, Max Sjöblom, Rosario Maij, Marc Tobiasch, Anatolii Chukhvichev, Nikolaus Eigner, Wenzel Krautmann, Steve Hatto, Jörg Unfried, Marijn Lybaert, Arnost Zidek, and Johan Sadeghpour, all still in contention.


Stay tuned for insight into the new draft format, for news and stories straight from the battlefield, and for the epic conclusion of Grand Prix Stockholm 2016!



  
  



DAY 1 COVERAGE



An Eldritch Moon has risen and cast its baleful influence over Stockholm. There was madness, delirium, and tentacled horrors bursting out of poor defenseless woodland critters everywhere. What there hadn’t been, surprisingly, was an abundance of big name players. With Pro Tour Sydney coming up, the majority of the world’s best players had opted to head Down Under for the Antipodean Grand Prix this weekend. Grand Prix Stockholm saw only two players with three byes, local Hall of Famers Anton Jonsson and Olle Råde (this might be a record).


However, with the bigger names elsewhere, the opportunity was there for newer players to make a name for themselves. And Elmer van Eeghen, Luke Southworth, and Conn Desax did just that by coming through day one unscathed with perfect 9-0 records. Joining them for the Booster Drafts on Sunday would be another 349 players, the only survivors from an original field of 1,244 players after nine hard-fought rounds of Sealed Deck.
