Grand Prix Paris 2009
---------------------


Trap Secures Rosada’s Monument in Paris
=======================================




November 7-8












Event Coverage
--------------


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/gppar09/final_opening_pic.jpg)Grand Prix Paris has been a monumentous success, and for none more than Adrian Rosada. At 1,961 players, it was the biggest **Magic**  tournament ever held, and after a total 6,767 matches over 19 rounds, he was left to hoist the trophy. The top 8 draft featured many new names and faces, but there was plenty of drama with powerful decks all around meaning that every match was hard fought, leading up to a truly thrilling final, where Rosada battled for his tournament life in one of the most exciting games of **Magic**  that this coverage team has ever seen.


Sixteen have won a slot at Pro Tour-San Diego, but before that we now have only Grand Prix Minneapolis before the World Championships. While the Pro Player of the Year race didn’t change much this weekend, Lino Burgold’s strong finish has put him in third place in Rookie of the Year, just two points behind the leader. As a member of the German national team, a strong finish at Worlds for him could mean a great shot at the title.


Such a big event as this one has taken a huge effort from a massive number of people, and it has run incredibly smoothly even with such a throng of players. As the crowds around the arena disperse, we must bid you adieu, and once again congratulate Adrian Rosada, our Grand Prix-Paris 2009 Champion!
