Welcome to the *Innistrad* Rules Quiz, where players like you get to show off your knowledge of some of *Innistrad*'s scarier rules questions. If this isn't too terrifying, let's get started:

**You control three [Walking Corpse](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Walking+Corpse)s and a [Gutter Grime](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gutter+Grime) with no slime counters on it. Your opponent casts [Blasphemous Act](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blasphemous+Act). What happens?**

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/arcana/arcana_gameState.jpg)  

> 
> A. [Gutter Grime](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gutter+Grime) triggers three times. After all three abilities resolve, you'll control a 1/1 Ooze token, a 2/2 Ooze token, and a 3/3 Ooze token.  
>  B. [Gutter Grime](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gutter+Grime) triggers three times. After all three abilities resolve, you'll control three 3/3 Ooze tokens.  
>  C. [Gutter Grime](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gutter+Grime) triggers once. When that ability resolves, you'll put three 3/3 Ooze tokens onto the battlefield.  
>  D. [Gutter Grime](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gutter+Grime) doesn't trigger at all.
> 
> 
> 

The correct answer is...

*B. [Gutter Grime](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gutter+Grime) triggers three times. After all three abilities resolve, you'll control three 3/3 Ooze tokens.*


The power and toughness of each Ooze token is updated as the number of slime counters on the [Gutter Grime](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gutter+Grime) that created that token changes. Bonus points if you said "I don't know" and expected to be slimed.

**You cast [Evil Twin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Evil+Twin), choosing to copy [Howlpack of Estwald](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Howlpack+of+Estwald) (the back face of [Villagers of Estwald](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Villagers+of+Estwald)). Which of the following is true of [Evil Twin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Evil+Twin)?**

> 
> A. It enters the battlefield as a copy of [Villagers of Estwald](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Villagers+of+Estwald), the front face of the card.  
>  B. Its mana cost remains ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161225105850im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless2.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161115194122im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/blue.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227195556im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/black.gif) and it will have a converted mana cost of 4.  
>  C. When activating its ability, you could choose either [Howlpack of Estwald](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Howlpack+of+Estwald) or [Villagers of Estwald](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Villagers+of+Estwald) as the target.  
>  D. If it would transform, nothing happens.
> 
> 
> 

The correct answer is...

*D. If it would transform, nothing happens.*


[Evil Twin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Evil+Twin) is not a double-faced permanent, even if it is copying one. It copies only the face of the card that's up and doesn't copy any of the characteristics of the other face, including name. Bonus points if you copy a creature with a goatee, throwing everyone off.


**You control [Rooftop Storm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rooftop+Storm). You want to cast [Skaab Ruinator](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skaab+Ruinator) from your graveyard. Which of the following is true?**

| Rooftop Storm | Skaab Ruinator |


> 
> A. You must still pay ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20211201201921im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless1.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161115194122im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/blue.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161115194122im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/blue.gif) and exile three creature cards from your graveyard.  
>  B. You must still exile three creature cards from your graveyard. You may pay ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20211201201921im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless1.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161115194122im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/blue.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161115194122im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/blue.gif), but you may pay ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20210707095534im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless0.gif) instead.  
>  C. You don't have to exile three creature cards from your graveyard. You may pay ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20211201201921im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless1.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161115194122im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/blue.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161115194122im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/blue.gif), but you may pay ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20210707095534im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless0.gif) instead.  
>  D. You must still pay ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20211201201921im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless1.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161115194122im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/blue.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161115194122im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/blue.gif), but you don't have to exile any creature cards from your graveyard.
> 
> 
> 

The correct answer is...

*B. You must still exile three creature cards from your graveyard. You may pay ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20211201201921im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless1.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161115194122im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/blue.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161115194122im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/blue.gif), but you may pay ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20210707095534im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless0.gif) instead.*


[Skaab Ruinator](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skaab+Ruinator)'s requirement to exile three creature cards from your graveyard applies no matter what zone you're casting it from. [Rooftop Storm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rooftop+Storm) allows you pay ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20210707095534im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless0.gif) instead of the mana cost, but mandatory additional costs must still be paid. Bonus points if you remember that [Phage the Untouchable](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phage+the+Untouchable) is now a Zombie when thinking about [Rooftop Storm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rooftop+Storm).
