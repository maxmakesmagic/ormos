**Jesse Hampton, Matt Nass, (19) Jacob Wilson vs. Pat Cox, Orrin Beasley, David Sharfman**



 As Jesse Hampton, Matt Nass, and No. 19 Jacob Wilson built their draft decks, they tried to assess what was going on. "One of them has to be Temur, right?" Hampton said, but he was glad that Nass at least could've taken the second-to-past-pick [Temur Charm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Temur+Charm), so they couldn't have it. But Nass had not taken it, and the opponents had gotten a very powerful last pick. Temur cards were very strong, and very late, if anyone had switched colors some people might be in trouble.



"Are they all in Temur?!" Hampton asked half-jokingly. Luckily, no one was on Temur.


"Well, we're not Temur, but at least we know they're not Temur," Pat Cox told me, when I sat down at their table. I asked him, and his teammates Orrin Beasley, and David Sharfman why.



 "Because I got a last-pick [Temur Charm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Temur+Charm)," Beasley flashed. However, at least three drafters were Mardu.



"This draft was really weird," Sharfman said. Everyone seemed to agree. They weren't too happy with their chances.


"Well, it was a good run," Cox said, well before the round actually started.


But with honor, the men lined up, like Napoleonic wars, and readied for battle. And just like Napoleonic wars, some of their weaponry was suspect. But it could still people deadâ€”and gruesomely too.



**First, Pat Cox v. Jesse Hampton, Game 1**




 Jesse Hampton, the man who started driving here in a snowstorm from Charlotte at 3 am Saturday morning, was on Mardu; so was Pat Cox. Cox had hits like [Ankle Shanker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ankle+Shanker) and [Mardu Charm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mardu+Charm), but had to skew high for two [Rite of the Serpent](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rite+of+the+Serpent) for more removal. This was because Hampton had taken up anything he could. He had a [Crackling Doom](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crackling+Doom), [Arc Lightning](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arc+Lightning) and three [Arrow Storm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arrow+Storm).
