Four hundred fifty-seven players were here to showcase the new Extended format. Would we see a lot of decks from the past, or would something fresh emerge from the minds of these talented competitors in Amsterdam?

[Scapeshift](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scapeshift) topped the list with 72 players. The most popular version took the aggressive approach of attacking with [Bloodbraid Elf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodbraid+Elf) and [Tarmogoyf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf) to soften their opponents then using the deck's namesake to finish them off. The more creative approach to the deck came in the form of blue-green-red [Prismatic Omen](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Prismatic+Omen) builds. With this enchantment in play, all of a player's land, including [Valakut, the Molten Pinnacle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Valakut%2C+the+Molten+Pinnacle), would be counted as each basic land type. Most importantly it would be a [Mountain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mountain). This deck could dish out 24 [Valakut, the Molten Pinnacle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Valakut%252C%2Bthe%2BMolten%2BPinnacle) triggers as early as turn four.

The second most popular choice on the day was Doran. Forty-five competitors felt this was their best chance at success as [Doran, the Siege Tower](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Doran%2C+the+Siege+Tower) led his entourage of [Treefolk Harbinger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treefolk+Harbinger), [Knight of the Reliquary](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Knight+of+the+Reliquary) and [Noble Hierarch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Noble+Hierarch) onto the battlefield. Some variants of this deck excluded mana producers in favor of creatures more resilient to [Punishing Fire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Punishing+Fire) like [Loam Lion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Loam+Lion).

Third and forth were two of the more dedicated combo decks in the field. [Angel's Grace](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Angel%27s+Grace)/[Ad Nauseam](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ad+Nauseam) accounted for 41 decks while [Pyromancer Ascension](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyromancer+Ascension) was piloted by 38 players. The former players used [Angel's Grace](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Angel%27s+Grace) to draw their entire decks with [Ad Nauseam](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ad+Nauseam). From there it was pretty easy to win the game as creatively as he or she wanted ranging from [Conflagrate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Conflagrate) with Flashback to [Fling](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fling)ing a [Death's Shadow](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Death%27s+Shadow). The [Pyromancer Ascension](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyromancer+Ascension) deck used cheap card drawing like [Preordain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Preordain) and [Ponder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ponder) to power up [Pyromancer Ascension](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyromancer+Ascension). Once online, copies of [Time Warp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Time+Warp) and [Punishing Fire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Punishing+Fire) would devastate their adversary.

Blue-black Faeries and Mono-red round out our top six decks. Faeries was one of the first decks expected to define the new Extended metagame. Thirty-five players were fulfilling their Pro Tour desires with [Bitterblossom](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bitterblossom) tokens and [Cryptic Command](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cryptic+Command)s. Thirty-four players felt that it was the "red deck that still won" and sleeved up [Mountain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mountain)s, [Goblin Guide](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Guide)s and [Lightning Bolt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt)s. While there was a splattering of [Kiln Fiend](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kiln+Fiend)s and Boggart Ram Gangs, most players opted for the full-on burn approach. There may have been sightings of Quest of the Pure Flame and [Needle Drop](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Needle+Drop) at the tables.

These were only the top 6 archetypes here in Amsterdam. Five more decks accounted for 5 percent of the field each, including White Weenie, Dredge, [Living End](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Living+End), Elves and [Mystical Teachings](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mystical+Teachings). Sixteen more archetypes make up over 80 rogue lists. This was quite the diverse field here on Day One. Will this diversity carry on through Saturday? Or will one deck rule them all?
