When we ran our interview with [Matt Cavotta](http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=mtgcom/feature/28), we listed all the cards he illustrated at the end.


Ok, not exactly. Since our database is sorted by the "artist credit," it didn't put *Odyssey*'s [Bash to Bits](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bash+to+Bits) on the list. [Bash to Bits](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bash+to+Bits) was originally called "Demolish," but it was renamed, and [Demolish](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Demolish) became another card… illustrated by Gary Ruddell. Somehow somewhere something got crossed-up in the files, and Gary got credited for both cards. Sorry, Matt!
