*Battle for Zendikar* previews are nearly over (the full set will be revealed this Friday!), which means you're starting to get a sense of the set, the art, the story, and just how the battle for Zendikar will shake out.

There are eleven tokens with *Battle for Zendikar*, plus three emblems from the planeswalkers you already know and love. Let's start there, with the cards that create them nearby for reference:

You'll notice that the Scion collector numbering starts at 2. What could possibly be in the first slot? Oh yeah, this guy:

That's all of them! You can get your hands on these tokens—not to mention the rest of the set—when *Battle for Zendikar* releases October 2. Or you can get a head-start beginning with the Prerelease on September 26!
