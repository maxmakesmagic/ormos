This week's "Sketches" focuses on a little-used blue instant from the *Onslaught* set, [Trickery Charm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Trickery+Charm). David Martin was the artist assign the task of illustrating this card.

### 1. Art Description

The card was called "Whimsy Charm" during development, which is an important detail. These were the instructions given to the artist:

"Blue mist in a glass charm shaped like a shell." That's it.

### 2. Sketches

Here is David's preliminary submission. Having very little to go off of, he extrapolated on the card's title, "Whimsy Charm," incorporating some odd and fanciful elements, like a butterfly and a harlequin face.

Of course, in a block dominated by the bad-ass-ifying [Mirari](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mirari), the art team saw no place for clowns and butterflies, and had David remove all of his whimsy. He opted instead to place the charm in a serene waterfall setting.

### 3. Final Art

Here is a large version of the final piece. No clown, no butterfly.

### 4. Card

Finally, here is the card as you can see it in booster packs.
