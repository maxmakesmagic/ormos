At [Pro Tour*Magic 2015*](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/ptm15), Jackson Cunningham took the tournament by storm, nearly winning the whole thing in his first Pro Tour and one of his first Constructed tournaments, *ever*.


If that sounds impressive, it certainly is. But it shouldn't necessarily be surprising given his lineage. Cunningham was taught to play *Magic* by his older brother, Jeff Cunningham, a longtime pro with 152 Pro Points and a Pro Tour Top 8 on his resume.


So that got us thinking about other brothers and family members in *Magic*. Not among players (that list at the top levels is actually pretty small), but among the cards.


There are, for example, just three brothers in all of *Magic*.

There are even fewer sisters.


[![](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Sisters+of+Stone+Death)](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sisters+of+Stone+Death) [![](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&multiverseid=1800)](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=1800)
Now, I'm not entirely sure how there are so few brothers and sisters but so very many mothers in *Magic*. Maybe the Multiverse is full of only children?

[![](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Phyrexian+Vatmother)](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phyrexian+Vatmother) [![](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Sakiko%2C+Mother+of+Summer)](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sakiko%2C+Mother+of+Summer) [![](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Wort%2C+the+Raidmother)](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wort%2C+the+Raidmother)



There are no "fathers," "dads," or the like in the game, although there are plenty of father-figures who aren't named as such. For example, this *Homelands* stalwart:


[![](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Baron+Sengir)](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Baron+Sengir)
Baron Sengir was a Vampire who created a sort of twisted "family" that included "daughter" (not really his daughter) Irini Sengir, and the one and only grandmother in *Magic* (also not actually his grandmother).


[![](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=IRINI+SENGIR)](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Irini+Sengir) [![](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Grandmother+Sengir)](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grandmother+Sengir)
Additionally, there are a number of cards that we know were fathers from the story, but that aren't necessarily represented as such on their cards. Jarad, Golgari Lich Lord, for example, had a son named Myc. Jared actually became a lich because he died saving his son from a Rakdos ritual. The other side of the father coin is Konda, Lord of Eiganjo, who was the father of Michiko Konda, Truth Seeker, both represented on cards. Michiko eventually teamed up with Toshiro Umezawa (who we also know became a father, as he is ancestor to Tetsuo Umezawa) to take down her father. So, you know, they had issues.


Also, *Magic* includes a nutty extended family, including a wacky aunt and uncle duo.

For the record, there are also no cards named "grandfather" in *Magic*, but that doesn't mean they've been forgotten.
