Twenty years ago, at a convention in Wisconsin, gamers gathered at GenCon and opened the very first packs of **Magic: The Gathering**. Twenty years ago, very first new pack smell from **Magic** cards was unleashed upon the world!


We've kept our twentieth anniversary celebrations fairly low-key, but with so much going on we've touched on it from to time. Such as sharing the [Usenet post by Peter Adkison](/en/articles/archive/twenty-years-ago-2013-01-23) twenty years to the day after it was posted.


We are marking the anniversary on Friday night, August 2, 2013, with International Crack-a-Pack Day!


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/arcana/arc1277_achievementunlocked_crackapack.jpg)**Magic** is a global game. We tried envisioning an event unifiying players around the world, and what is more universal in **Magic** than opening booster packs? Whether it's to seek out a new rare from a set, or as you sit around a table drafting with friends, the act of cracking a pack is well known.


So, on August 2, 2013, take part in International Crack-a-Pack Day, whether at your Friday Night **Magic** or just hanging out with friends. Wherever you are, be sure to share pictures of what you crack on Twitter or do a Crack-a-Pack video on Vine! Use the hashtag [#CrackaPack](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23CrackaPack).


I don't know about you all, but with all the packs people will bust to celebrate **Magic**'s birthday, I'm hoping to smell that new-pack smell in the wind.
