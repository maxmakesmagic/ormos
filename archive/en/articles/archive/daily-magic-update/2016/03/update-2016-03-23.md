The Daily *Magic* Update is a roundup of everything *Magic* you should know on March 23, 2016. Today's Update is brought to you by [decklists, oh-so-many decklists](#decklists).


Today's Previews
================


Every day during preview season, you can look to this section for any previews you might have missed, as we'll keep it updated with anything previewed somewhere other than DailyMTG. We've got a few more previews coming out later today in various places. If I were you, I'd pay attention to the [Wizards Twitter account](https://twitter.com/wizards_magic) and [Magic Mics](https://www.twitch.tv/magicmics), which airs tonight at 11 p.m. ET (8 p.m. PT).


1. [Prized Amalgam](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbZUVL4wXeM)

Tolarian Community College has some of the best preview videos on the web. This is great, and so is Prized Amalgam.

1. [Scourge Wolf](http://www.mtggoldfish.com/articles/exclusive-spoiler-seven-questions-with-scourge-wolf)

MTGGoldfish previewed this terrifying Wolf, ready to haunt our nightmares and our aggressive red matchups.


1. [Whatever the judges are doing](https://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/4bmqoz/soi_judges_previewing_a_card_piece_by_piece_on/)

Hmm, a preview card seems to be coming out piece by piece. Might even be up by the time you read this. Either way, it's a really cool way to preview a fun card.


1. [Inexorable Blob](http://www.jeuxvideo.com/news/463617/nouvelle-carte-magic-en-exclu-tenebres-sur-innistrad-masse-inexorable.htm)

"Cette nouvelle carte, Masse inexorable, fait partie de la première extension de *Ténèbres sur Innistrad*, prévue pour le 8 avril prochain."


Yeah, I have no idea what that says. But it's about Inexorable Blob! You can see an [English translation on Reddit.](https://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/4blvmo/new_spoiler_on_french_website/) Of the card, not that gibberish above.


After Those, Read, Watch, or Listen to These
============================================


1. Decklist extravaganza!

As we near the stretch run for *Shadows over Innistrad* (the full [Card Image Gallery](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/card-image-gallery/shadowsoverinnistrad) is out Friday), writers are starting to churn out decklist ideas for the brewers out there. Today, we have a veritable cornucopia of decklists from some brewers and builders out there to spark your curiosity.


* [The Ultimate Guide to *Shadows over Innistrad* Brews](http://www.starcitygames.com/article/32627_The-Ultimate-Guide-To-Shadows-Over-Innistrad-Brews.html) | StarCityGames.com | Michael Majors—Majors wins for having by far the most decklists of anyone. This will definitely get your brew juices flowing.
* [The Pillars of *Shadows over Innistrad* Standard](http://magic.tcgplayer.com/db/article.asp?ID=13180&writer=Ali+Aintrazi&articledate=3-23-2016) | TCGPlayer | Ali Aintrazi—Ali is a brewer's brewer, so it's no surprise he has a number of lists ready for you today.
* [An Early Frontrunner for the Deck to Beat in *Shadows over Innistrad* Standard](http://www.channelfireball.com/articles/an-early-frontrunner-for-the-deck-to-beat-in-shadows-over-innistrad-standard/) | ChannelFireball | Frank Karsten—Frank thinks there's a deck already ahead of the pack, one that you should definitely keep in mind while brewing.
1. [*Magic: The Gathering*—*Shadows over Innistrad* Preview](http://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2016/03/magic-the-gatheringshadows-over-innistrad-preview.html) | Paste | Cameron Kunzelman

Not strictly a card preview, this article actually highlights art *and*—here's the kicker—a page out of the *Shadows over Innistrad* art book (coming later this year) that you can't see anywhere else.


1. [All 61 Modern-Legal Planeswalker Rankings (Pt. 2/2)](http://www.rocketjump.com/listen/61-modern-legal-planeswalker-rankings-pt-22) | Masters of Modern | Alex Kessler and Ben Bateman

It's a week of part twos, apparently, as Alex and Ben return with the countdown to the number one planeswalker in all of Modern. My favorite is stuck at unlucky number thirteen.


Top 25
======


1. He'll always have Paris

Paris has always been good to Ben Stark. Back when [Jace, the Mind Sculptor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace%2C+the+Mind+Sculptor) was just starting to terrorize Standard, Ben Stark won [Pro Tour Paris](http://magic.wizards.com/en/content/pro-tour-paris-2011) with the first iteration of the Caw-Blade menace. Now, five years later, Stark came within one match of another Paris championship, losing in the finals to Petr Sochůrek—who, as it would happen, defeated [Pro Tour *Battle for Zendikar*](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/ptbfz) finalist Ryoichi Tamada in the semifinals.


Well, Sochůrek's win didn't get him in the Top 25, but it did bolster Tamada and Stark, who enter this week at No. 18 and No. 24, respectively. Both players were just barely on the outside of the rankings, so strong finishes quickly catapulted them in.


But two in means that two have to go out, as well, and those two this week are fan-favorites Luis Scott-Vargas and Pascal Maynard. Another strong finish from either would launch them back into the rankings, but, for now, they sit on the outside looking in.


Beyond that, there were few changes. Turtenwald is still No. 1 by a country mile, and the Top 10 remains unchanged.

What People Are Talking About
=============================


1. [[SOI Puzzle] Clue token flavor texts](https://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/4bm66i/soi_puzzle_clue_token_flavor_texts/)

The Internet has picked up on some strangeness about the flavor text in Clue tokens. What does it mean? WHAT DOES IT MEAN?!


No, seriously, what does it mean?


Deck of the Day
===============


1. [Red Edrazi](http://www.starcitygames.com/article/32628_Eldrazi-Red-Is-Coming.html)

Kent Ketter started hot at the StarCityGames.com Standard Open, going 9-0 on Day One before eventually finishing 13th. And he did so with a previously unheralded take on Eldrazi, one [that Chris VanMeter thinks might be a deck to watch after the rotation](http://www.starcitygames.com/article/32628_Eldrazi-Red-Is-Coming.html). After all, it basically loses nothing in the transition. The main deck really only loses [Tomb of the Spirit Dragon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tomb+of+the+Spirit+Dragon), while the sideboard loses seven mostly replaceable cards.


[Check out VanMeter's article for more analysis](http://www.starcitygames.com/article/32628_Eldrazi-Red-Is-Coming.html), but just know that this deck could be a force to be reckoned with in a few short weeks.
