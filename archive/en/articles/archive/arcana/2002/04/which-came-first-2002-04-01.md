Which came first, the Rukh or the Egg?

*Arabian Nights*' [Rukh Egg](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rukh+Egg) is one of the most sought-after commons of all time. Whenever this 0/3 "creature" goes to the graveyard, it is replaced by a 4/4 flying "Rukh" token.

But what is a Rukh exactly? According to *Webster's Unabridged Dictionary* it is a legendary bird of great size and strength believed to inhabit the Indian Ocean area. *Rukh* is the word's Arabic spelling; the "Westernized" version of it is *Roc*.

Where did the first Roc appear in **Magic**? [Roc of Kher Ridges](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Roc+of+Kher+Ridges) was in Alpha, which obviously predates *Arabian Nights*. So which came first? Nope, not the Egg.
