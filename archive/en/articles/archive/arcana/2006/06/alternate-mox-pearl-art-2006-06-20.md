So when the winner of the [2006 Vintage Championship](/en/articles/archive/event-coverage/2006-vintage-championship-fact-sheet-2006-04-07) walks up on stage to claim his or her specially-commissioned alternate art for [Mox Pearl](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mox+Pearl) this August, he or she will deserve every moxy inch. Here's a photo of this special prize, with a **Magic** card shown for scale.
