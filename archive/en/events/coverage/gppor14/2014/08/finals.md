Coming on the heels of Pro Tour *Magic 2015* last week, there was no doubt that there would some star-studded lineups at the Team Limited event that was Grand Prix Portland. And there was no bigger pairing than that of Owen Turtenwald, Reid Duke and William "Huey" Jensen, who entered the first weekend of the new Premier Play season ranked (respectively) 2-3-4 in the world.


In a field of teams with more than enough talent to make it into the Top 4, there was no team better equipped to go the distance than the trio of pros who have named their partnership the "Peach Garden Oath."


The field began with more than 600 teams, and now the three teammates were just one step away from standing atop them all. But to take the final step, Turtenwald, Jensen and Duke would need to defeat Eric Severson, Benjamin Weitz and Josiah Skallerup, three players who entered the tournament without any previous Top 8s but who had already advanced past several powerhouse teams, including Gaudenis Vidugiris, Matt Severa and No. 13 Ranked Player Sam Black in the Swiss rounds.



**Duke vs. Skallerup**



Skallerup sat down to the finals with an aggressive black-red deck that had the potential to outpace Duke's slower blue-black deck. That is, unless Duke found the perfect answer in [Jorubai Murk Lurker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jorubai+Murk+Lurker), which he did in Game 1. Skallerup kept it from blocking thanks to [Crippling Blight](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crippling+Blight), but between the lifelink it could provide and the [Indulgent Tormentor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Indulgent+Tormentor) that soon followed he quickly found himself down a game.
