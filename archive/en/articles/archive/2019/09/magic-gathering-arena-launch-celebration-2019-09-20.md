You know what else is happening on September 26? The official launch of *Magic: The Gathering Arena*. First and foremost, we wanted to extend a big thank you to all our Beta players who've helped us reach this point, and we look forward to playing more *Magic* with you in the years to come.


To celebrate this moment, we're going to roll out the ~~red~~ mythic orange carpet and hold a special *MTG Arena* Launch Celebration event, where you can build and ***play with* any *deck in Standard***.


Yep, that's right.


For this event, we'll be giving you access to playsets of every card in Standard whether they're in your collection or not. All you need to do is brew, build, and play! You'll be able to do this for up to twelve games, so be sure to take advantage of your ability to build as many decks as you like and swap them between matches, because the following weekend, you'll have the opportunity to earn ***a copy of every card in Standard***.


Oh yeah, you read that right too.


On October 6, we'll be holding a 36-hour follow-up event where you can *also* build and ***play with* any *deck in Standard***. If you manage to earn twelve wins before receiving two losses, you'll walk away with a prize that includes ***one copy of every Standard card*** for your collection (and yes, this includes *Throne of Eldraine)*. Be warned, you only have one shot (or one opportunity!) to participate in both events.
