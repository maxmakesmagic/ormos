Year after year, the *Magic* community has come together to fundraise for an incredible cause: Extra Life benefiting Seattle Children's Hospital. The funds we raise go to children and families in crisis, helping those who need it the most.


This year, we're striving to raise more money than ever before!


But to reach our goal, we need your help. Join our team, fundraise for the cause, and earn an *MTG Arena* premium card style for your community.


Here's how:


Creators or groups of up to six creators can create Extra Life teams and join the *Magic: The Gathering* Extra Life Super Team. From October 2, 2019 to 11:59 p.m. PT on November 2, 2019, each team will rally their community and compete against other teams to raise the most money. The eight teams that raise the most for Extra Life will earn an *MTG Arena* premium card style for the card [Inspiring Veteran](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inspiring+Veteran).
