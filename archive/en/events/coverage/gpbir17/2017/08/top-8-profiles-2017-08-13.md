Black-Green Rock, because people told me it's unplayable.


**What was the best card in your main deck, and why?**


[Tireless Tracker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tireless+Tracker) because people mostly refuse to play [Lightning Bolt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt)s.


**What was the best card out of your sideboard, and why?**


[Fulminator Mage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fulminator+Mage). Because people do not expect me to go land destruction in non "big mana" matchups.

**Previous Magic accomplishments:**


Two Grand Prix Top 8s, Gold two years in a row.


**What deck did you play this weekend, and why did you choose it?**


Red-Green Valakut, simple deck for a simple player. Also I think it's too powerful not to play.


**What was the best card in your main deck, and why?**


[Primeval Titan](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Primeval+Titan), duh!


**What was the best card out of your sideboard, and why?**


[Spitebellows](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spitebellows)! Okay, it might actually have been our [Witchbane Orb](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Witchbane+Orb) tech.

**Occupation:** Teacher


**Hometown:** Copenhagen, Denmark


**Previous Magic accomplishments:**


Grand Prix Gothenburg 2013 win, Grand Prix Manchester 2016 Top 4.


**What deck did you play this weekend, and why did you choose it?**


Abzan Company,. because it is my kind of deck—mana dorks, [Kitchen Finks](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kitchen+Finks), and multiple infinite combos. Also chose the deck because Chris Larsen was playing it and I wanted to prove that I am much better than him.


**What was the best card in your main deck, and why?**


[Devoted Druid](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Devoted+Druid)—does it all!


**What was the best card out of your sideboard, and why?**


[Chord of Calling](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chord+of+Calling) package is so important and makes it possible for you to control most matchups.

**What deck did you play this weekend, and why did you choose it?**


Lantern, because it defeats everything besides Mono-Blue Tron. Luckily, Shooktropa wasn't here.


**What was the best card in your main deck, and why?**


[Pyxis of Pandemonium](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyxis+of+Pandemonium) because you can pop it for troll value at the end of the game.


**What was the best card out of your sideboard, and why?**


[Leyline of Sanctity](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leyline+of+Sanctity), because it's good if you're lucky and I am an extremely lucky person.

### Loïc Le Briand

**Age:** 33


**Occupation:** Data analysis


**Hometown:** Metz, France


**Previous Magic accomplishments:**


Top 8 Grand Prix Lille in Legacy, Top 8 Grand Prix Paris in 2014.


**What deck did you play this weekend, and why did you choose it?**


Burn with [Shrine of Burning Rage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shrine+of+Burning+Rage). I like the deck, and I found something with which to make it past its bad matchups. [Eidolon of the Great Revel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eidolon+of+the+Great+Revel) is not great at the moment.


**What was the best card in your main deck, and why?**


[Shrine of Burning Rage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shrine+of+Burning+Rage). Completely unexpected, people really aren't prepared for it.


**What was the best card out of your sideboard, and why?**


[Grim Lavamancer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grim+Lavamancer) and [Destructive Revelry](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Destructive+Revelry) add something to your deck which it lacks at times.

### George Channing

**Age:** 30


**Occupation:** Trainee teacher


**Hometown:** Guildford, England


**Previous Magic accomplishments:**


Played one Pro Tour. Multiple Game Day champion.


**What deck did you play this weekend, and why did you choose it?**


Grixis Shadow as I have a lot of experience with it after my team captain Tom told me to take some time to learn a Modern deck—thanks Tom! Also it is the best deck, probably.


**What was the best card in your main deck, and why?**


[Thoughtseize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtseize). The card is absurd. It allows you to take their best card and then sculpt your game plan around what they have.


**What was the best card out of your sideboard, and why?**


[Engineered Explosives](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Engineered+Explosives) was excellent in the aggro matchups, but [Leyline of the Void](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leyline+of+the+Void) won me two rounds against [Living End](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Living+End) and [Dredge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dredge), so that has to be the winner.

Four copies of [Tectonic Edge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tectonic+Edge). Opponents don't expect them.

[Surgical Extraction](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Surgical+Extraction). It gave me the last round of the Swiss.
