Another announcement post? [Didn't we just have one last week for Historic Anthology IV](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/magic-digital/updates-and-events-coming-historic-anthology-iv-2021-03-10)? You're right—but that doesn't mean we shouldn't have more to share! There's a question to answer we're aiming for here: What's going on in *MTG Arena*?


With a bigger schedule, more ways to play each week, and other announcements players—like you!—will find interesting, we plan to follow up more often—roughly once each week—to help you know exactly what to expect.


We're saving deep dives and big announcements for the classic State of the Game articles you're familiar with, so you can rest assured these updates are an additional bonus.


Playing in Historic Times
=========================


We launched [Historic Anthology IV](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/magic-digital/get-ready-historic-anthology-iv-2021-03-05) on March 11, and immediately, new players began working on what these new cards brought to Historic formats. All 25 cards are available in the store for a limited amount of time as a bundle that comes with four copies of each (more on this in a moment).


**Bundle Cost**: 4,000 Gems or 25,000 Gold​


**Bundle Available**: March 11, 2021–June 10, 2021


* Players will still be able to craft these cards using Wildcards of the appropriate rarity after this date.

There is a clarification we want to highlight: the confirmation screen when purchasing the bundle states you received one copy of each card but that's a visual bug as *you receive all four copies of each card upon purchase*. (We'll fix that in a later update for clarity, but now you know for sure!)


Finally, with last week's deployment, some messaging flooded our server architecture and caused players to have negative in-game experiences, including difficulty downloading assets. We deployed fixes late Thursday and Friday that resolved these issues.


Our apologies for the inconvenience, and thanks for your patience as the team worked to address them.


You can view the full list of updates and bug fixes [on our official forum](https://forums.mtgarena.com/forums). If you encounter a bug, please submit it to our [*MTG Arena* feedback hub](https://feedback.wizards.com/forums/918667-mtg-arena-bugs).

**Historic Shakeup**
--------------------


With a changing banned card list, you'll have to stay on your toes and think fast to find the right deck each week. Week 1 of Historic Shakeup continues through March 19. Week 2 kicks off as soon as Week 1 ends and continues to March 26. (Week 3 will run March 26 to April 2.)
