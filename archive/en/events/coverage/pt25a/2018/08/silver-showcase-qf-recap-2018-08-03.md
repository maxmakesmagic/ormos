It's not every day you hear someone say "it's not every day" about something and for something as unusual as a *Beta*/*Arabian Nights*/*Antiquities*/*Legends* Rochester Draft, but it is *not* every day you get to watch some of *Magic*'s biggest star players play out a *Beta*/*Arabian Nights*/*Antiquities*/*Legends* Rochester Draft because it's pretty much never happened on camera before, and I suspect it's extremely unlikely to happen ever again.


Brian Kibler got off to a fantastic start in Game 1 with a [Giant Spider](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=449) and a [Lifeforce](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=202425), getting Paulo Vitor Damo da Rosa down to just 3 life before he could stabilize behind a [Frozen Shade](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=360). PV gradually whittled Kibler's life down with a [Prodigal Sorcerer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=416) and managed to finish him off with an [Unstable Mutation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=1228) on his [Will-o'-the-Wisp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=688) before Kibler could draw any of his burn spells to finish PV off.

Meanwhile on the back table, David Williams took Game 1 from Jason "Amaz" Chan with a Fireball, but Amaz took Game 2 in return with a turn 6 [Shivan Dragon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=1318).

*Amaz wins Game 2.*


PV got off to a much faster start in Game 2 holding Kibler in a [Deathgrip](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=56) and beating down with a pair of [Hasran Ogress](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=919)es. Kibler was a land short of clearing them out with a [Pyrotechnics](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=2300), so PV was able to take the first quarterfinals match.

Meanwhile, Williams was controlling the pace of their deciding game by attacking with a [Personal Incarnation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=860). Amaz managed to remove it with a [Berserk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=436) but took 12 damage in the process before drawing his second Mountain and slamming his [Shivan Dragon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=1318) onto the battlefield. Amaz followed up with a turn later with a [Lure](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=462) on his [Erg Raiders](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=916) to allow [Shivan Dragon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=1318) to roast Williams alive.

Jon Finkel took Game 1 against Raphaël Lévy with constant pressure leaving Lévy with little to fend off the 4/4 Bird token Finkel found inside a [Rukh Egg](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=965).


Stanislav Cifka won Game 1 against Shuhei Nakamura by squeaking out a win with a [Pestilence](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=371) activation to the face just as Nakamura looked like he was taking control of the game. Cifka got busy with an early [Vampire Bats](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=2134) in Game 2, and eventually managed to force a hefty [Fireball](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=492) past Nakamura's [Blue Elemental Blast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=97) with a [Red Elemental Blast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=217) of his own to take the match.

Lévy struggled to find enough land early in Game 2 as Finkel's creatures gradually hacked away at Lévy's life total. Lévy cunningly hatched one of Finkel's [Rukh Egg](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=965)s with his [Durkwood Boars](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=2208) so he could drown the Bird token in a [Flash Flood](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=1483), but he'd taken too much early damage, and Finkel closed out the match with some [Pyrotechnics](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=2300) and another helping of [Pestilence](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=371).
