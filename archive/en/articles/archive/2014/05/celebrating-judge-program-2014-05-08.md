In April of this year, we crossed an important milestone for **Magic**. This milestone is something that many players wouldn't realize, at least not directly, and yet it is vitally important. As of April 2014, we have more than 5,000 active judges helping make and keep the **Magic** community awesome!


With 5,000 judges around the world, there has never been a better time to join the judge program! Here are a few resources that can help you along the way:


* [Official Judge Resource](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/magazine/article.aspx?x=judge/welcome)—Start here and read about the judging program.
* [How to Become a Certified Judge](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/tcg/events.aspx?x=judge/becoming/how)—A great introduction about how to become a certified judge.
* [List of Regional Coordinators](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/tcg/events.aspx?x=judge/resources/coords)—Not sure who to contact? Reach out to your nearest regional coordinator and he or she will be able to help.
* [Become a Judge](http://wiki.magicjudges.org/en/w/Become_a_judge)—The judge community maintains its own wiki as a reference tool, and it has a number of useful articles. This is just one of them.

In recognition of this milestone, we sent promotional premium [Force of Will](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Force+of+Will) out to judges who had certified other judges after 2005. These premium [Force of Will](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Force+of+Will)s use the art created for the Legacy Championship by [Matt Stewart](http://gatherer.wizards.com/pages/search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&artist=[%22matt+stewart%22]).

As awesome as that promo is, I can't leave you all with just that to gawk at. Rather, here is also a look at a number of new judge promos!
