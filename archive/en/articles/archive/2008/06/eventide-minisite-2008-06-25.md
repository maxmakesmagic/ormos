*Eventide* previews start this Monday, June 30. But you can get a head start on learning about the new set now at the [*Eventide* minisite](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=magic/eventide/home).


We've got weekly puzzles and wallpapers, flavor descriptions and (and this might be the part you're looking for) a constantly updated Visual Spoiler with all the officially previewed cards so far. That includes cards that have been previewed in magazines, so there might be cards in there *right now* that you haven't seen. And it all exists in *nine different languages*! Exciting!


So what are you waiting for? The [*Eventide* minisite](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=magic/eventide/home) is waiting!
