Each of the [Honden](http://gatherer.wizards.com/default.asp?first=1&last=100&term=honden&Field_Name=on&Field_Rules=on&Field_Type=on&setfilter=ChampionsofKamigawa&colorfilter=All&output=summary&sort=name&x=36&y=27) from *Champions of Kamigawa* is a shrine dedicated to the worship of a powerful, godlike kami. The name of each Honden corresponds to the name of a legendary spirit -- [Myojin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/default.asp?first=1&last=100&term=myojin&Field_Name=on&Field_Rules=on&Field_Type=on&setfilter=ChampionsofKamigawa&colorfilter=All&output=summary&sort=name) -- in the set.


But there are correspondences in the art as well. Compare Kev Walker's art of the Myojin to the Honden below. Note how the shrines are mostly ruined; that's an indication of the abandonment the shrines faced during the Kami War, when the spirit and mortal worlds turned on one another.
