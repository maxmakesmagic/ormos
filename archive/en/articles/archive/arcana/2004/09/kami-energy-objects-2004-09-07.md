In **Magic** art director Jeremy Cranford's feature article [this week](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/feature/228), he mentions the term "energy objects" when describing the look of spirit creatures in the Kamigawa block.


> *"[Kamigawa's concept artists] came up with an idea that when a spirit manifested into our world they would be a bit unstable, creating strange **energy objects** orbiting around itself. ... It was a great visual cue and we ran with it."*

You can see these floating energy objects, these visual cues of kami-dom, in art of *Champions of Kamigawa* cards. They manifest in as many bizarre ways as the kami do. Check out some examples of energy objects floating around kami creatures in the following *Champions of Kamigawa* art samples:

 These objects remind the viewer that this is a kami creature, and help reinforce the kami's sense of majesty and otherworldliness.
