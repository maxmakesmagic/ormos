**Game 1**


Mohd Khairul opened on the offensive with [Arena Athlete](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arena+Athlete), [Triton Fortune Hunter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Triton+Fortune+Hunter) and [Spellheart Chimera](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spellheart+Chimera); while [Scholar of Athreos](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scholar+of+Athreos) prevented profitable attacks and gave Park the space he needed to sculpt his hand with [Read the Bones](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Read+the+Bones).


Park found [Sentry of the Underworld](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sentry+of+the+Underworld) and went for the kill with [Hopeful Eidolon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hopeful+Eidolon) and [Ordeal of Erebos](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ordeal+of+Erebos). But Mohd Khairul had an out in [Voyage's End](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Voyage%27s+End) and [Magma Jet](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Magma+Jet) on Scholar after damage opened the door for Khairul's offence.

Park took some damage, but once he redeployed and re-suited [Sentry of the Underworld](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sentry+of+the+Underworld) with [Observant Alseid](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Observant+Alseid), it was sufficient to take the game.


**Game 2**


Khairul once against started on the offence with [Ordeal of Thassa](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ordeal+of+Thassa) on [Satyr Rambler](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Satyr+Rambler) and [Breaching Hippocamp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Breaching+Hippocamp). However, Park had [Ray of Dissolution](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ray+of+Dissolution) at the perfect time and summoned [Wingsteed Rider](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wingsteed+Rider).


When Kairul attacked into the Rider, [Gods Willing](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gods+Willing) threatened to trade and forced Khairul to expand [Titan's Strength](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Titan%27s+Strength) to save his Satyr.

[Hopeful Eidolon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hopeful+Eidolon) and [Observant Alseid](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Observant+Alseid) on [Wingsteed Rider](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wingsteed+Rider) then threatened to steal the game from Khairul and while he found [Nimbus Naiad](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nimbus+Naiad) to force the trade with his own Satyr, Park's follow up plays of [Celestial Archon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Celestial+Archon) and [Hundred-Handed One](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hundred-Handed+One) was simply too high a hurdle to overcome.


**Park wins 2-0 and advances to the semi-finals.**
