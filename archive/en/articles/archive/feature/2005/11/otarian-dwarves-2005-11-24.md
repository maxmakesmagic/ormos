*This Arcana originally appeared on January 21, 2002. Happy Thanksgiving!*


If you've been paying attention, you should have noticed that dwarves have replaced goblins as the red race of choice in the *Odyssey* block, evident in cards like [Dwarven Strike Force](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dwarven+Strike+Force) and [Whipkeeper](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Whipkeeper).


Below are two images from the *Odyssey* styleguide that show how our artists conceptualized the Otarian dwarves. Click on each for a larger image.
