There's scuttlebutt among the players at Grand Prix about how *Oath of the Gatewatch* Team Sealed plays out. The idea is there are usually *two* failsafe, good decks: White-X Allies and some flavor of Devoid deck. However, the third can be all over the place.


*Oath of the Gatewatch* Team Sealed is the first format where the new colorless mechanic is a benefit, and not another complexity. With an “additional color,” with the right pool, you won't have to fight over the last color. If you can build a Mono-Blue-Colorless or a Mono-Black-Colorless, there is plenty cards for everyone!


But that doesn't always work. Sometimes the pull of the third deck can mess with the stability of the first two. I talked to some teams to find out what they ended up in for that often-elusive “third” deck.

**Andrew Baeckstrom, Gaby Spartz, Andrew Parnell** – “It's a Red ‘Good-stuff' deck. There are a couple good rares; it can get there. I think. I hope.”

**Steve Rubin, (6) Alexander Hayne, and (11) Mike Sigrist** – “*'Third* deck?' Well, one deck has two [Bone Saw](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bone+Saw)s ... It just beat a deck with two [Nissa, Voice of Zendikar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nissa%2C+Voice+of+Zendikar); two [Mina and Denn, Wildborn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mina+and+Denn%2C+Wildborn); one [Omnath, Locus of Rage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Omnath%2C+Locus+of+Rage). It's really the ‘first' deck.”
