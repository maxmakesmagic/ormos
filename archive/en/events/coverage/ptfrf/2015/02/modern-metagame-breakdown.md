What happens when a format gets reforged? While Grand Prix Omaha covered the Modern format a month ago, it was the swan song for [Birthing Pod](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Birthing+Pod)'s place in the format. The shuffle of cards and decks came as [Birthing Pod](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Birthing+Pod), [Dig Through Time](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dig+Through+Time), and [Treasure Cruise](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treasure+Cruise) sailed away.


What happened was [Siege Rhino](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Siege+Rhino) rushed in to fill the void. This is the complete breakdown of every archetype at Pro Tour *Fate Reforged*:




| **Archetype** | **Count** | **% Field** |

That's…a lot of [Siege Rhino](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Siege+Rhino)s.


Nearly thirty percent of all competitors arrived with Abzan decks, including several prominent teams. While it was one of “the obvious” decks coming into the weekend, there wasn't consensus on the best way to build it. Many opted into adding [Tasigur, the Golden Fang](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tasigur%2C+the+Golden+Fang) to provide both another cheap body—Tasigur could delve into play for perhaps just one black mana—and an engine to pull ahead on cards. If players expected mirror matches it would help find ways to break through the stalemates. Others maintained the traditional builds seen in Omaha, through with variable counts of [Lingering Souls](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lingering+Souls), [Voice of Resurgence](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Voice+of+Resurgence), and other tools in the main deck. A final splinter group eschewed Tasigur as well, though accelerated the power of the deck with cards like [Loxodon Smiter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Loxodon+Smiter) and [Wilt-Leaf Liege](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wilt-Leaf+Liege).


The surprise breakouts, at least from a metagame standpoint, are the rise of Burn and Infect towards the top. While Affinity was always a lurking aggressive menace, and Zoo varieties saw a resurgence (due in no small part to [Siege Rhino](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Siege+Rhino) flavors arriving) for a Top 8 in Omaha, the addition of [Become Immense](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Become+Immense) from *Khans of Tarkir* helped push Infect up the threat ladder. In Omaha, back-to-back World Champion and fourth-ranked Shahar Shenhar narrowly missed Top 8 on tiebreakers with a Burn deck in hand. The ability to simply pressure and outrace decks is what enticed players to all three archetypes, and there's no doubt these players were counting on slower, long-game-aiming Abzan decks appearing here in force.


What hasn't happened is the return of other powerful decks that have appeared in the format. Blue-Red Twin decks, once supplanted by Blue-Red [Delver of Secrets](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Delver+of+Secrets) options leveraging [Treasure Cruise](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treasure+Cruise) for all its might, didn't appear in force as they had before *Khans of Tarkir* was released. However, Grixis-flavored versions took a note from Abzan decks to adopt [Tasigur, the Golden Fang](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tasigur%2C+the+Golden+Fang) as well.

[Scapeshift](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scapeshift), a powerful deck with a multiple Grand Prix Top 8 pedigree, lost [Dig Through Time](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dig+Through+Time) but had *won* a Grand Prix well before the Instant had ever appeared. It, too, didn't rise in popularity. Red-Green Tron appeared flat against the previous event, though those that arrive almost universally adopted a copy or two of [Ugin, the Spirit Dragon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ugin%2C+the+Spirit+Dragon) to team up with the other colorless Planeswalker, [Karn Liberated](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Karn+Liberated). Similarly flat was Amulet Bloom, the [Amulet of Vigor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Amulet+of+Vigor)-meets-Summer Bloom deck that reached the finals of Grand Prix Omaha. If a Grand Prix *winning* deck couldn't increase in an unknown field it makes sense a runner-up deck wouldn't rise either.


Beyond these archetypes lie a slew of options that always hover in Modern: Storm (the [Pyromancer Ascension](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyromancer+Ascension) deck),  Jund (including [Life from the Loam](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Life+from+the+Loam) variants), Merfolk (*another* Omaha Top 8 deck), [Living End](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Living+End), White-Black Tokens, and Jeskai Control among many more.


For this weekend, several questions remain that players will have to answer:


* Is there a key way to break the Abzan mirror match?
* Which of the other decks can survive the gauntlet of Abzan players?
* Is there a breakthrough deck hidden in the weeds of singleton players?

This weekend, Modern was to be put through the crucible. Right now, it looks like it's holding its form just fine.
