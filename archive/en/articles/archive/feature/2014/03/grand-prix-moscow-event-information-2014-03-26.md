 The main tournament at Grand Prix Moscow is open to **Magic** players of all ages. 


 Players must have a signed waiver and consent form to compete at Grand Prix Moscow. Forms can be [downloaded here](http://www.wizards.com/dci/downloads/Consent_form_2013_Magic.pdf) and will be available onsite. Minors must have a parent or guardian’s signature on these forms. Minors will not be able to register or play unless we receive a waiver signed by a parent or guardian. No exceptions. 



**Tournament Format**
  


* [Standard Constructed](http://www.wizards.com/Magic/TCG/Resources.aspx?x=judge/resources/sfrstandard)
* Deck lists are required.
* Players must use the same deck on Day Two that they used on Day One.


**Tournament Structure** 


* Modified Swiss-style (50-minute rounds).
* Day One will consist of a maximum of 9 Swiss rounds. Day Two will consist of 6 Swiss rounds and the Top 8 single-elimination finals.
* If 799 or less players register for the event, all players with an X-2-0 record (or better) or the top 64 players – whichever is greater – advance to the second day of competition for prizes and invitations.
* If 800 or more players register for the event, all players with an X-2-0 record (or better) or the top 128 players – whichever is greater – advance to the second day of competition for prizes and invitations.
* The Top 8 players after the final Swiss round on Day Two will advance to the Top 8 single-elimination playoff.
* Top 8 playoff matches will be best 2 of 3.
* Top 8 playoff matches will have no time limit. (Players are still expected to play at a normal pace and complete playoff matches in a reasonable amount of time.)
* Standings after the Swiss rounds will be used to determine final order in the standings for losing players in the quarterfinal and semifinal playoff rounds.
* For the first game of each match in the Top 8, the player that finished higher in the Swiss rounds chooses either to play first or to play second. For subsequent games in each Top 8 match, the usual Play/Draw rule applies (loser of the previous game decides whether to play first in the next game).


**Judges**
  
 The head judge for Grand Prix Moscow is Chris Richter (Level 4, USA). Regional Coordinator is Eugene Bazhenov. Judges interesting in applying for this event may do so through the [Magic judge website](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=apps.magicjudges.org).

* Players are responsible for bringing their own method of tracking life totals, card sleeves, and appropriate counters or tokens.
* In the event that a player who wins an invitation to a Pro Tour stop at a Grand Prix has already qualified for an invitation, the invitation does not pass down under any circumstances.

Byes earned through Planeswalker Points are calculated using the Planeswalker Point totals from all reported events as of the Wednesday immediately before the Grand Prix. (For Grand Prix Moscow, the cutoff date will be June 11th.) Points earned in tournaments held at the Grand Prix event site do not count toward earned byes at that Grand Prix. Byes will be given to players in the Grand Prix based on the following criteria:

**NOTE:**
  
 Grand Prix Moscow is the first Grand Prix to take place in Season 3 of the 2014 Competitive Year. As a result, Competitive Point totals from events that took place in Season 1, 2014 (December 2, 2013 – March 9, 2014), will not count toward byes for the tournament. For details on point totals, seasons, and byes, please refer to the [Planeswalker Points site](http://www.wizards.com/magic/planeswalkerpoints). 



**Trial winners**
  
 Winners of a Trial tournament are awarded two byes in the Grand Prix that it feeds. Trial byes are not cumulative with other byes and do not pass down. Byes are not cumulative throughout the season or year. Byes do not pass down under any circumstances. Players who accumulate multiple byes to a particular Grand Prix tournament receive only the bye for the greatest number of rounds. For complete information about Grand Prix byes and their corresponding competitive season, please check the [Magic Premier Event Invitation Policy](http://www.wizards.com/wpn/Document.aspx?x=Magic_The_Gathering_Premier_Event_Invitation_Policy).
