The Sydney Top 8 is In!
=======================




(1) Seth Manfield, Ben Stark, Ben Seck, Scott Lipp, Zen Takahashi, Santiago De Paoli, Jan Ksandr, and Thierry Ramboa all made the cut!

Top 8 Coverage



A Tasmanian Devil whirlwind struck Sydney this weekend! The race for Grand Prix master is still on. Brian Braun-Duin lost in the last round to Zen Takahashi to miss the Top 8, which has given top-ranked Seth Manfield the last window to rip the title from his hands. If Manfield wins the Grand Prix (his third for the season), he will finish ahead of Braun-Duin and take home the prize.


And there are tons of stories in the Top 8 outside of just Manfield. Hometown hero Ben Seck has Top 8'ed again, which makes it 2-for-2 each time he's 9-0'ed the first day. Near-hometown hero Zen Takahashi from New Zealand—newly Mtg Mint Card—has also christened his recent World *Magic*Cup qualification with a Top 8. Team East West Bowl's Scott Lipp went undefeated to make it here ... granted, he was 12-0-3.


And oh yeah, big news: Pro Tour Hall of Fame member Ben Stark is good at Limited *Magic*.


The Top 8 is already streaming at [twitch.tv/magic](http://twitch.tv/magic)! Tune in right now to catch it all!

 
  
  



Day 2 Coverage



It was a crazy first day in Australia. The race for Grand Prix Master between Brian Braun-Duin and Tomoharu Saito has taken an interesting turn, as a wild, top-ranked Seth Manfield has appeared!



 As he's done the whole season, team East West Bowl's Manfield has remained untouchable, finishing 9-0 so far. And because the tiebreaker for the race is "Most Grand Prix wins this season," Manfield *still* has a leg up in the case of a tie. Though Braun-Duin is advantaged over Saito at the moment, the addition of this *deus ex machina* has surely added a kink in BBD's master plan.



And there's much more story to go around as well. Sitting at 9-0 with Manfield is Australian Ben Seck, Chapman Sim, and the Pantheon's Andrew Cuneo. It's a strong bunch at the top, and the last time Seck went 9-0 in Australia, he won the whole tournament. Yes, that was over a decade ago. But who cares? Seck sure doesn't.



 It's the first Limited drafts of *Eldritch Moon* today. This will provide a primer for the Pro Tour next weekend all while developing these and other stories to their completion.




 The stream starts at 10 am AEST (local Sydney time). Tune in to this site and <twitch.tv/magic> to follow the action all day!

Day 1 Coverage



We’ve been talking for weeks about the race for Grand Prix Master between Brian Braun-Duin and Tomoharu Saito. But is first-ranked, Mr. Spoil-Sport, Seth Manfield just going to sweep it out from under everyone?! Along with Ben Seck, Andrew Cuneo and Chapman Sim, the four are sitting atop the standings at the perfect 9-0.


Perhaps it might be right that all roads lead to Seth this year, but the fight’s not over yet. Braun-Duin is at 8-1. He’s still one point ahead of Saito (who’s at 6-2-1), but now his nemesis has become the top-ranked player in the world.


Eldritch Moon has landed with a giant boom (in fact, 9-0 Sim built his deck around the booming Emrakul, the Promised End), and it will only heat up as the drafts start tomorrow. This will lead into the Grand Prix Top 8, which will then lead into the Pro Tour next week.


There’s plenty of Magic left to go before the end of the season, and the drama only ratchets up the closer we get to the promised end.


We’ll see you all tomorrow! The stream will start bright and early tomorrow at twitch.tv/magic. See you then!
