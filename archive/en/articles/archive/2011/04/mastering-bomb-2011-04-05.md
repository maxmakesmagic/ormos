Let's talk for a second about [Metallic Mastery](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Metallic+Mastery), which represents the Phyrexians' ability to use the Mirrans' own technology against them.

The art showcases a Phyrexian furnace worker holding a familiar-looking artifact from *Scars of Mirrodin*.

Now that that's out of the way, let's look a little more closely at the rest of the card. The furnace worker, and even the furnace background, were taken from concepts in the *Mirrodin Besieged* style guide. Observe!
