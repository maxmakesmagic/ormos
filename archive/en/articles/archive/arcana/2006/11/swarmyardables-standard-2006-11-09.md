![swarmyard](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Swarmyard)The*Time Spiral* card [Swarmyard](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swarmyard) is a throwback to the venerable land [Elephant Graveyard](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elephant+Graveyard). [Swarmyard](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swarmyard) is a bit powered up - it's able to regenerate a much wider variety of creatures, and most of them are rather small creepy-crawlies that might *need* to regenerate more often than your typical Elephant.What cards currently in Standard can be regenerated by [Swarmyard](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swarmyard)?

P.S. If you're building a deck around [Swarmyard](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swarmyard), you should consider [Ratcatcher](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ratcatcher) as well -- he's not himself targetable by the land, but quite the friend to Ratkind! (Speaking of targetable, [Giant Solifuge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Giant+Solifuge) is an Insect, but can't be targetted by the land's ability.)

P.P.S. Note that the vermin in the art are chewing on a bloated, dead... you guessed it... Elephant.
