Christopher Moeller's original art for [Nut Collector](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nut+Collector) (a green rare from *Odyssey*) is a little over the top. Originally commissioned for [Druid's Call](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Druid%27s+Call) (an uncommon Enchant Creature), the painting was supposed to show "a bard playing music which lures out a small army of squirrels."


So what would lure out squirrels? A song about acorns, apparently. The art was just a little too *"Unglued"* for the team's taste, so they had the word balloon edited out, and eventually swapped art with the card now known as [Nut Collector](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nut+Collector).
