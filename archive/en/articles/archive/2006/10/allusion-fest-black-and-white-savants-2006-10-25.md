*Time Spiral’s* [Chronosavant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chronosavant) alludes to *Visions’* [Necrosavant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Necrosavant) in more than name. First off, their return-from-the-grave ability is an obvious strong tie.


But check out the art of the cards. The composition of Pete Venters’s [Chronosavant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chronosavant) has both broad and detailed similarities to the earlier 5/5.

Scan up and down between these two pieces. The sideways resting pose of each is a clear tie between them. But see how the structure of hourglasses behind him—symbolic of this titan’s ability to skip through time—are subtly reminiscent of the shelves of books behind [Necrosavant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Necrosavant)? See how [Necrosavant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Necrosavant)’s arms are crossed across its body—and the titan’s arms are crossed over a giant sword? There are even subtle patterns on [Chronosavant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chronosavant)’s hourglass structure that evoke the runes on the scroll in [Necrosavant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Necrosavant)’s chamber.
