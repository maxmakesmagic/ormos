When the blue color-hosing sorceries [Baleful Stare](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Baleful+Stare) and [Withering Gaze](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Withering+Gaze) needed new art for their *Ninth Edition* appearance, Randy Gallegos got the call. Since the two spells' effects were so symmetrical, so were their art descriptions -- a matched pair of card-art bookends.


As you can see, Randy created similar compositions for the cards. He maintained the same (but reversed) the sweep of color in each: the leafy vines in [Withering Gaze](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Withering+Gaze), rocky mountains in [Baleful Stare](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Baleful+Stare). And in the center he put the same blue wizard with her piercing eyes -- those eyes that peer right into a green or red mage's soul.

That blue wizard has some disdainful things to say about her enemy colors; check out the cards' new *Ninth Edition* flavor text.
