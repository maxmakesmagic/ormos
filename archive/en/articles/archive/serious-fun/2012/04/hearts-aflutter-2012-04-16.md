I'm a meat and potatoes kind of guy: a slab of perfectly cooked animal meat paired with an appropriate amount of vegetables is an idyllic sort of meal for me. And while I share [a similar appreciation for dining quality and epicurean refinement](http://twitter.com/#!/Top8Games/status/190618870682361859) as [Pro Tour Historian](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/magazine/events.aspx?x=mtgevent/webcast/home) and [The Week That Was](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Archive.aspx?tag=The%20Week%20That%20Wasamp;description=The%20Week%20That%20Was) writer Brian David-Marshall, there's still something primal and satisfying about just the basics roughly prepared. (Trust me, this metaphor is going somewhere.)

![](https://media.wizards.com/images/magic/daily/sf/sf191_hgablvdfzr.jpg)Cloudshift | Art by [Howard Lyon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoileramp;method=visualamp;action=advancedamp;artist=+[%22Howard+Lyon%22])

With more than a week of *Avacyn Restored* previews already unleashed, it's clear that the set has *refinement* written all over it. The soulbond mechanic featured on Nightshade Peddler and Tandem Lookout—is accompanied well by the abundance of "flicker" effects—as seen on Cloudshift and Restoration Angel. If you want something a little more traditional, undying is back—as seen on Howlgeist and Demonlord of Ashmouth—and works as well as soulbond with flickers. There are even a few exotic ingredients available—like [last week's Craterhoof Behemoth](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/sf/190)—for those with just such a discerning taste.

These core ingredients are just the start; the complex-yet-intriguing flavor of miracles was added. If you haven't heard about "[Time Walk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Time+Walk) returns" yet, [Mark Rosewater's preview last week](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/mm/190) will bring you up to speed on Temporal Mastery. The soft, gentle, broad base of Angels and Demons, infused with soulbond and undying, is refreshingly brightened by the spiciness of every first draw of a turn.

However, all the miracles so far have been very easy to digest. Thunderous Wrath is, for merely a moment, a spell far more powerful than [Lightning Bolt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt). Banishing Stroke, within just a flash of a trigger, can do things no other removal spell alone can. 

The preview I have to share today is a bit different from the miracles seen so far. It isn't simply a clever trick we're pleased to see when it pops up, but a powerful tool we need to plan to use.

And oh how we are entreated to use it! This is Entreat the Angels:

Are you ready to eat this yet?

Prep Time: 7+ Turns
Entreat the Angels isn't a complicated affair. It's a decadent slab of steak, a deep *tranche de tarte délicieuse*, or even a rich cup of *cà phê với sữa đặc*—Vietnamese coffee with condensed milk. It's awesome, ubiquitous, and deceptively complex. And proper preparation makes all the difference in the world.

![](https://media.wizards.com/images/magic/daily/sf/sf191_arm.jpg)[Armillary Sphere](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Armillary+Sphere) | Art by [Franz Vohwinkel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoileramp;method=visualamp;action=advancedamp;artist=+[%22Franz+Vohwinkel%22])

The most similar card that comes to mind is [Decree of Justice](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Decree+of+Justice), trading a ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20210707095534im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless0.gif) for a marginally different ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227125855im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/white.gif) in its casting cost. Just like [Decree of Justice](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Decree+of+Justice), Entreat the Angels really wants to see a lot of mana. You have to work hard and know the right steps to making it work. While there are obvious answers in green—[Cultivate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cultivate), [Rampant Growth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rampant+Growth), and everything similar—I think a pearly approach can be wonderful as well.
