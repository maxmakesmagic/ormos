| Piece #10 | Piece #10 | 300 |
| Piece #2 | Piece #2 | 269 |

So what's next? It's time to start figuring out what the card is. To do that we have two logical avenues. One, we could figure out its color. Or two, we could figure out its card type. As You Make the Card #1 & #2 both started by choosing color, I thought it would be more interesting to start with card type.


There are six choices, but I've condensed it down to three. First, I've combined instant and sorcery as both card types are identical from a creative standpoint. Plus, mechanically it's best to leave us the ability to modify spell speed as a tool to later fine tune the card. Second, I've eliminated artifacts, as the art does not support being an artifact. And third, I've eliminated land for the same reason. This leaves us with three options:


1. Creature
2. Enchantment
3. Instant or Sorcery

The deadline for this vote is midnight this Friday (Feb. 11). If you would like someone to bounce thoughts off of, please visit this article's thread on the bulletin board.


As always, have fun!
