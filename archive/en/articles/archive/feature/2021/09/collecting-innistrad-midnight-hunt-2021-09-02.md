Welcome to Collecting *Innistrad: Midnight Hunt* (MID)! In this article, we will take a deep dive into the boosters of *Innistrad: Midnight Hunt* and look at what cards you can find inside each booster. For more information about products, boosters, and card treatments, check out the [product overview article here](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/feature/boosters-and-products-innistrad-midnight-hunt-2021-09-02). With our return to Innistrad, we wanted to make sure that at every moment we were capturing the resonance and feel that a gothic horror setting for *Magic* could. To accomplish that, we filled *Innistrad: Midnight Hunt* boosters with lots of Innistrad goodness. I'm Mike Turian, product architect for *Innistrad: Midnight Hunt*, and I'm excited to share with you everything showcase, borderless, Innistrad, and Booster Fun.


Booster Fun
===========


Clayton Kroh's article goes over the creative approaches, planning, and work for each Booster Fun treatment in *Innistrad: Midnight Hunt*. You can [read that article here](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/feature/fear-and-booster-fun-innistrad-midnight-hunt-2021-09-02) and get a good feel of how each treatment was built and designed for Innistrad. In addition, Gavin Verhey has put together a [Good Morning *Magic*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vrt0W6rJFs) where you can hear him talk about and show off the Booster Fun treatments in the set.


Here's a quick recap of the treatments that you can find in *Innistrad:* *Midnight Hunt* Draft, Set, and Collector Boosters:


Showcase equinox cards use alternate art and the equinox frame to highlight the Werewolves and Warlocks in the set. In addition, Arlinn Kord, as Innistrad's planeswalking Werewolf, has a showcase equinox version as well. Since the Werewolves (and Arlinn) are on double-faced cards (DFCs), you get twice the amount of new artwork with these!

Showcase eternal night cards are inspired by the style of classic black-and-white horror films. Each legendary creature in the set that isn't a Werewolf or Warlock has a showcase eternal night legend card with new artwork. In addition, each basic land you will get in *Innistrad:* *Midnight Hunt* booster packs will be one of the ten showcase eternal night basics. Here are five of the ten you could open:

There are two kinds of borderless cards in *Innistrad:* *Midnight Hunt*, planeswalkers and rare dual lands. The three planeswalkers in the set and the five rare dual lands all feature new artwork paired with our classic borderless frame.

Draft Boosters
==============


![Draft Booster contents](https://media.wizards.com/2021/images/daily/en_d7Getwe63D.jpg)


In the *Innistrad:* *Midnight Hunt* Draft Booster, you can find all the Booster Fun treatments listed above in either non-foil or traditional foil. Of the 15 cards you get in a Draft Booster, there will be 1 rare or mythic rare, 3 uncommons, 10 commons, and a basic land. In a third of Draft Boosters, you will get a traditional foil basic, common, uncommon, rare, or mythic rare instead of the tenth common card.


The basic land will always be a non-foil of one of the ten showcase eternal night basic lands. You will always get one double-faced common card plus one double-faced uncommon, rare, or mythic rare. To help you play with the two non-foil DFCs in every pack, we've also included a DFC helper card in each pack as well.


![MID DFC Helper card](https://media.wizards.com/2021/images/daily/en_r9FC0RcBGI.png)


For the other showcase treatments in the Draft Booster, you will get a standard version of the card two-thirds of the time and the showcase or borderless version a third of the time. The exception here is Arlinn with her showcase and borderless versions, each showing up a sixth of the time, and the standard planeswalker card showing up two-thirds of the time.


Set Boosters
============


![Set Booster contents](https://media.wizards.com/2021/images/daily/en_7hYwehy23F.jpg)


Set Boosters have a guaranteed showcase eternal night basic land, which is in traditional foil 15% of the time. They feature an art card (95%) or a signature art card (5%), which are full art and highlight some of the many striking pieces that were done by our artists for *Innistrad:* *Midnight Hunt*.


*The List* continues to show up in 25% of Set Boosters. Of the 300 cards, we swapped 75 cards to bring in some extra Innistrad-feeling goodies and keep the excitement of opening cool reprints fresh.


The wildcard slot for Set Boosters can have practically any non-foil card in *Innistrad:* *Midnight Hunt*! With anything from commons to borderless planeswalkers (but not regular-frame rares and mythic rares), the wildcard slot also has the possibility of borderless dual lands, showcase eternal night legends, showcase equinox cards, and more!


One new feature of the Set Boosters is that we are introducing eight new cards (six rares and two mythic rares) that can be found in the wildcard slot. These cards are mechanically new and designed for Commander players. While you can find these in Collector Boosters in an extended-art version as well, these cards aren't found in the *Innistrad: Midnight Hunt* Commander decks. With only two Commander decks for *Innistrad: Midnight Hunt*, this allowed us to bring a couple of additional cards featuring Innistrad to the ever-growing Commander audience.


In addition to these eight new cards, Set Boosters also have the four foil cards from the Commander decks available in the wildcard slot in a non-foil version. As all twelve of these cards can't be found in Draft Boosters, we could design them without having to worry about disrupting a great draft experience.


Whenever you get any one of these eight new cards or four non-foil Commander cards in your Set Booster, you will have gotten at least two rares in that booster. The Set Booster always gives you one standard rare or mythic rare from the main set, so any rare or mythic rare in the wildcard slot is just extra goodness!


As we want to make sure the Set Booster continues to be an amazing opening experience, there is a guaranteed traditional foil slot where standard, showcase, and borderless cards can all appear. You won't get a traditional foil basic in this slot, and the eight new Commander cards and four Commander deck cards won't show up in this slot either.


Collector Boosters
==================


Let's take a look at the full breakout of the Collector Booster, and then I will dig into specifics.


![Collector Booster contents](https://media.wizards.com/2021/images/daily/ueow238faf.jpg)


Going into detail about some of the slots:


**Non-foil extended-art Commander rare or mythic rare** – This slot features each of the 30 new rares and 8 new mythic rares from either the Commander decks or the Set Boosters. Each rare shows up twice as often in this slot as each mythic rare. The card you find here is in an extended-art frame that shows off more of the standard card's artwork. For instance, you could get Wilhelt, the Rotcleaver in an extended-art version.


![Extended-art Wilhelt, the Rotcleaver](https://media.wizards.com/2021/mid/en_DOrGQ7zfb8.png)


**Non-foil extended-art rare or mythic rare from *Innistrad: Midnight Hunt*** – For any rare or mythic rare from *Innistrad:* *Midnight Hunt* that isn't getting a showcase or borderless treatment, we wanted to make sure that there was a special version available, and we accomplish that by giving those 40 rares and 14 mythic rares an extended-art version. Both these extended-art cards and the Commander slot above are treatments that can only be found in the Collector Booster.


**Non-foil showcase or borderless rare or mythic rare** – This slot is always one of the coolest slots in the Collector Booster. You always get a rare or mythic rare from one of the showcase equinox, showcase eternal night legends, borderless dual lands, or borderless planeswalker cards.


**Traditional foil showcase equinox, showcase eternal night legend, borderless dual land, borderless planeswalker, or extended-art rare or mythic rare from *Innistrad: Midnight Hunt*** – For the foil lovers of the world, this slot features a traditional foil card every time with a Booster Fun treatment. The moment you get to the end of the Collector Booster, you have found the place that you can get the scarcest and most exciting cards in *Innistrad:* *Midnight Hunt*! When you get your Collector Boosters and claw into them, savor the moment before you reveal the last *Magic* card in the booster. I hope you find the amazing cards you are looking to open.
