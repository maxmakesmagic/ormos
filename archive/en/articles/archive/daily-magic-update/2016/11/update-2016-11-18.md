The November 18, 2016 Update
============================

The Daily *Magic* Update is a roundup of everything *Magic* you should know on November 17, 2016. Today's Update is brought to you by the [World *Magic* Cup](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/premierplay/2016wmc), streaming all this weekend on [Twitch.tv/magic](https://www.twitch.tv/magic).


What To Watch This Weekend
==========================


1. [The World Magic Cup](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/premierplay/2016wmc) | [Twitch.tv/magic](https://www.twitch.tv/magic)

Sing it with me now—it's the most, wonderful tournament of the yeeeeeeaaaaarrrrr. The World *Magic* Cup is a truly global event with players representing more than 70 nations. By the time you read this, coverage will have already started since they're in Rotterdam, and time zones are a thing.


1. [StarCityGames.com Open: Knoxville](http://www.starcitygames.com/events/191116_knoxville_fact_sheet.html) | [Twitch.tv/scglive](https://www.twitch.tv/scglive)

The SCG Open goes back to Standard starting 10:30 a.m. ET on Saturday. With the Standard Showdown coming up next weekend (and the three weeks thereafter), this weekend seems like a good time to peek in and see what's going on with Standard.


Shaking Up Standard
===================


1. Multiple Brewers Start Brewing

It's like someone woke up the brewers this morning. We have multiple articles from people not talking about the metagame as it is, but how they want it to be. Especially with [Standard Showdown](http://magic.wizards.com/en/content/standard-showdown) coming up in about a week. Good for them! Here's just a few:


* [Control At #SCGKNOX](http://www.starcitygames.com/article/34068_Control-At-SCGKNOX.html) | StarCityGames.com | Shaheen Soorani
* [Shaking Standard's New Overlord](http://www.gatheringmagic.com/benfriedman-11182016-shaking-standards-new-overlord/) | Gathering Magic | Ben Friedman
* [Down the Rabbit Hole](http://www.gatheringmagic.com/aliaintrazi-11182016-down-the-rabbit-hole/) | Gathering Magic | Ali Aintrazi
* [Video: Temur Energy in Standard](http://www.starcitygames.com/article/34069_Video-Temur-Energy-In-Standard.html) | StarCityGames | Shaun McLaren
* [The Return of Aetherworks Marvel?](http://www.mtgmintcard.com/articles/writers/lee-shi-tian/the-return-of-aetherworks-marvel) | MTGMintCard | Lee Shi Tian

I probably missed a few, but these will get you started toward discovering plenty of interesting, new, and updated strategies for Standard. Plus, there's always [Panharmonicon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Panharmonicon)...


After That, Read, Watch, or Listen to These
===========================================


1. [Mtg: Your Questions Answered! The 40K Q&A](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kmNRFiaAkU) | Strictly Better MTG

What's up, his 40,000 wizards? Strictly Better MTG just hit 40,000 subscribers on his growing channel, and he celebrated with a Q&A. I would celebrate with fancy hats. But that's just me.


<https://www.youtube.com/embed/7kmNRFiaAkU>


1. [*Commander 2016* & Ben Hayes](http://www.commanderinmtg.com/2016/11/18/e072-commander-2016-ben-hayes.html) | Commanderin' | Phil DeLuca, Nate Burgess, and Sean Whatson

Ben Hayes is a stalwart member of R&D and very much involved in the creation of *Commander (2016 Edition)*—and now you can listen to the wise words that come out of his mouth as he chats with the Commanderin' crew.


1. [New Promos Added to Magic Online Treasure Chests](http://wizardsmtgo.tumblr.com/post/153319922559/in-the-latest-magic-online-release-we-added-a) | Magic Online Tumblr | Alli Medwin

The latest update brought some *Commander (2016 Edition)* and *Conspiracy: Take the Crown* cards to Treasure Chests, but it also brought some new promos that weren't previously available. Alli Medwin has the scoop.


1. [Karn Liberated and the Answer to a Blood Moon Victory](http://www.toplevelpodcast.com/karn-liberated/) | Top Level Podcast | Mike Flores and Patrick Chapin

The last few weeks have been a rollercoaster for Modern aficionados. One week [Blood Moon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Moon) wins it all, the next week, Tron wins a major tournament? Sure. Flores and Chapin investigate.


What People Are Talking About
=============================


1. [Wizards of the Coast to Stream Magic Events Exclusively on Twitch](https://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/5dizo4/wizards_of_the_coast_to_stream_magic_events/)

The best part of this announcement (the above links to the Reddit conversation, [this links](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/news/wizards-coast-stream-magic-events-exclusively-twitch-2016-11-17) to the actual announcement)? In my humble opinion, it's this line:


“Additionally, **the partnership will allow Wizards of the Coast to stream more of its international events** in English, collaborate on sponsorships, and ultimately make the *Magic* viewing experience among the best in the world.”


Much of the talk about this announcement so far has been about losing YouTube, but it didn't seem like most people picked up on the fact that more events will be streamed—this includes Grand Prix and other Pro Level events. Plus, with this partnership, we expect to see significant improvements in the streaming experience as we start working more closely with Twitch.

This is one of the coolest things about the World *Magic* Cup—teams showing up and showing off their national pride. Mexico, Guatemala, and England all showed enough spirit to win this year's Spirit Award. And, yes, that's a real award we give out every year.


Deck of the Day
===============


1. [Aetherworks Midrange?](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/mtgo-standings/competitive-standard-constructed-league-2016-11-17-1)

I'll have you know that a [Panharmonicon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Panharmonicon) deck went 5-0 in the same Competitive Standard League finishes I'm looking at today, and I resisted the urge to mark it as the deck of the day. On my birthday even. That's some restraint.


But I couldn't overlook the three copies of nearly identical [Aetherworks Marvel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aetherworks+Marvel) decks that seem to be reclaiming their spot in the metagame. The list below is from *Magic Online* player WitchKling, but DaielF80 and Yu-Ki went 5-0 with very similar lists.


The trick to these new versions is that they're less all-in on Eldrazi. They've dropped [Ulamog, the Ceaseless Hunger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ulamog%2C+the+Ceaseless+Hunger) in favor of more castable threats, should plan A fail. [Ishkanah, Grafwidow](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ishkanah%2C+Grafwidow) preys upon the White-Blue Flash lists that so overwhelmingly destroyed earlier versions of [Aetherworks Marvel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aetherworks+Marvel), and [Chandra, Torch of Defiance](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chandra%2C+Torch+of+Defiance) serves as a nice midrange punch that can take the game over in the right circumstance, should it be your only Marvel hit.


The swap to Ishkanah and Chandra seems to have breathed new life into an archetype that had fallen way out of favor since being the most played deck at the Pro Tour. If combo and spiders are your thing, definitely try this one out at a [Standard Showdown](http://magic.wizards.com/en/content/standard-showdown) event (they start next week!).
