It's a little early in the *Alara Reborn* previews to be looking at sketches, but, well, Thought Hemorrhage just looks so *cool*. And we've been looking at it since it appeared on the [*Alara Reborn* Visual Spoiler](/en/node/641856) last Wednesday. So why wait?


### Art Description



> Color: Black and red spell  
>  Location: Esper interior  
>  Action: A human from Esper, clad in mostly white, has fallen to her (or his) knees inside a pristine Esper building of some kind. She covers her face with her hands, and blood runs from between her fingers and drips on her clothing.  
>  Focus: the woman crying blood  
>  Mood: a psychic trauma made physical
> 
> 


### Sketch


Chippy's great, isn't he? He sent this sketch back, and it was exactly what the creative team was looking for.
