![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/worlds03/a758.jpg)Yesterday, Huey asked me what he should play in Extended. I don't know the Extended environment very well, so I gave him the only response I could- [Battle of Wits](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Battle+of+Wits). I'm sure my suggestion didn't actually influence his deck choice today, but perhaps he was looking for some sort of affirmation. He told me, "I always play Battle when I can, for the love of the game." This is not to say that [Battle of Wits](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Battle+of+Wits) is just a "fun" deck in this environment. It has enough tutors that it can search out whatever answer it needs to a particular deck, or of course it can just go get [Battle of Wits](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Battle+of+Wits) if it's not under any pressure. Plus, there's the added benefit of having a huge deck in some matchups. "The [Brain Freeze](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brain+Freeze) decks can't beat me. I want to sit down against someone who will puke all over the table because they can't win."

### Game 1

Gary opened with [Duress](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress), and saw a hand of lands, [Smother](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Smother) and [Battle of Wits](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Battle+of+Wits)- the enchantment obviously went to the graveyard. Although he had the [Duress](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress) to strip away Jensen's key card, Gary was lacking a second land. He cast [Entomb](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Entomb) on end step to get Akroma, played a second land, and had the [Reanimate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reanimate) to put her right into play. Jensen played [Charcoal Diamond](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Charcoal+Diamond) and ended his turn, then took another shot from Akroma to go down to eight. On the next attack, he used [Intuition](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Intuition) to get three copies of [Diabolic Edict](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Diabolic+Edict), which handled the massive threat.

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/worlds03/a759.jpg)A turn later, Gary cast [Vampiric Tutor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vampiric+Tutor) to get [Duress](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress), which he cast right away on his turn. Jensen responded with [Cunning Wish](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cunning+Wish), getting [Cremate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cremate), which he used to remove Akroma from the game. [Duress](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress) now resolved, and Gary took [Concentrate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Concentrate) out of Jensen's hand, leaving him with a land and two [Smother](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Smother). Jensen drew his own [Duress](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress) off the top, and saw a hand of [Petradon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Petradon), [Cabal Therapy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cabal+Therapy), [Exhume](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Exhume), [Visara](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Visara) and [City of Traitors](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=City+of+Traitors)- Therapy went to the graveyard. On the following turn, Huey drew and cast [Burning Wish](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Burning+Wish), letting out a smile. He searched up [Recall](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Recall), getting [Concentrate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Concentrate) and [Battle of Wits](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Battle+of+Wits) back from the graveyard. The Battle came down soon after, and Gary conceded.

Gary- "That was insane!"

Jensen- 1 Gary- 0

### Game 2

Gary mulliganed his opening hand. He [Entomb](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Entomb)ed [Verdant Force](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Verdant+Force), and [Exhume](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Exhume)d it into play. The attack that resulted brought Jensen down to twelve, and Gary added Nether Shadow to his side. Jensen played [Tainted Pact](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tainted+Pact) on end step, and kept going until he hit a plains on his ninth card, and decided to stop there. He untapped and cast [Merchant Scroll](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Merchant+Scroll), and looked through his deck before realizing he had no outs in this situation.

Jensen- 1 Gary- 1

### Game 3

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/worlds03/a761.jpg)Once more, Gary had a first turn [Entomb](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Entomb), which got [Symbiotic Wurm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Symbiotic+Wurm). He untapped and played [Cabal Therapy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cabal+Therapy), joking that the odds of hitting the card he named were pretty slim. He named [Cunning Wish](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cunning+Wish), and saw a hand of lands, [Concentrate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Concentrate), [Urza's Rage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Urza%27s+Rage), [Diabolic Edict](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Diabolic+Edict) and [Absorb](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Absorb). He then cast [Reanimate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reanimate), putting the Wurm into play. It was sacrificed to flash back [Cabal Therapy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cabal+Therapy), getting [Absorb](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Absorb) out of Jensen's hand.

The seven insects came out, and attacked on the next turn. When Gary tried to make things even worse by Exhuming the Wurm, Jensen had [Mana Leak](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak) waiting. He drew three more cards with [Concentrate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Concentrate) to try and find an answer, and Gary pitched his hands to [Last Rites](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Last+Rites), taking [Fact or Fiction](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fact+or+Fiction), [Absorb](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Absorb) and [Diabolic Edict](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Diabolic+Edict) out of Jensen's hand. He had outs left, but only one turn to find one, and it didn't come off the top.

**Final Result:** Jensen- 1 Gary- 2
