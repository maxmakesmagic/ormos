Announcement Day is here, and this month it's big. It's jumbo. It's so oversized it's at least *double* what one could expect. It's massive and *masterful* and *united* so much *Magic*. It's a return to the classics and a look ahead to what's next—and still more than that.


From first looks at *Double Masters* and *Dominaria United* to the return of Love Your Local Game Store promotions, new *MTG Arena* Premier Play plus *Alchemy Horizons: Baldur's Gate,* and the arrival of *Magic: The Gathering*'s Universes Beyond *Warhammer 40,000* collaboration to tabletops, the next few months are packed with amazing *Magic* wherever you play around the world.


*Magic: The Gathering*'s Universes Beyond *Warhammer 40,000* Collaboration
==========================================================================


On August 12, universes will collide with the *Magic: The Gathering*'s Universes Beyond *Warhammer 40,000* collaboration. This collaboration between two iconic tabletop titans, *Warhammer 40,000* and *Magic: The Gathering*, includes the release of four Commander decks and three *Secret Lair* drops. Both releases bring the grimdark lore, iconic art, and warring factions of the *Warhammer 40,000* universe into *Magic*'s multiverse. Get excited for powerful new commanders, the never-before-seen special surge foil, and beautiful art.


[Check out artwork, details, and of course new cards from the upcoming collaboration now](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/news/first-look-magic-gatherings-universes-beyond-warhammer-40000-collaboration) before previews begin July 26.


*Double Masters 2022*
=====================


*Double Masters 2022* arrives July 8, bringing with it a return of the exciting features of the original *Double Masters* release in 2020:


* Fan-favorite cards are available again in boosters—many featuring amazing new artwork.
* The return of powerful and legendary cards for your next Commander and Eternal format decks.
* Each *Double Masters 2022* Draft Booster is packed with *two* rare and/or mythic rare cards *plus* two foil cards.

And, like before, *Double Masters 2022* offers a unique, premium draft experience for *Magic* fans ready for a refreshing twist on play.

*Jumpstart* Jumps into Each Premier Set
---------------------------------------


Let's double down on the *Dominaria United* update: In addition to the Draft, Set, and Collector Boosters you already know, we're adding a fan favorite to the mix as well. Beginning with *Dominaria United,* each Standard set release also includes themed *Jumpstart* packs!


![Dominaria United Jumpstart Pack](https://media.wizards.com/2022/images/daily/en_TzNITdWD3V.png)


Replacing Theme Boosters, fan-favorite *Jumpstart* packs let players new and returning alike mix, match, and enjoy the mayhem of unique themes with each latest release. *Jumpstart* packs in *Dominaria United* and beyond follow the original *Jumpstart* release where each pack is a hidden theme to discover when you open, and shuffling any two packs together is all you need to be ready to play.


Each set will include several themes, each feeling right at home with what the set offers players—but don't let that stop you from mixing and matching for more mayhem as *Jumpstart* packs release from *Dominaria United* and beyond!


*Jumpstart* packs for *Dominaria United* feature cards from the set, including a rare or mythic rare, two foil basic lands, and a mechanically unique rare designed for the *Jumpstart* pack. Plus, these *Jumpstart* packs will be available as part of *Dominaria United* Prerelease events September 2–8!


Love Your Local Game Store Is Back
