**Age:** 28


**Occupation:** Team MTG Sheep Manager


**Previous *Magic* Accomplishments:**  

4 Grand Prix Top 8s, 2009 Worlds Team Champion, 2 China Nationals Top 8s


**Day 1 Summary:**  

8-1 (2 byes). I played a White-Black deck splashing Blue and [Jousting Lance](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jousting+Lance) was wonderful.


**Day 2 Summary:**  

I went 3-0 in Draft 1 and 2-0-1 in Draft 2. My best cards were [Song of Freyalise](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Song+of+Freyalise) and [The Mending of Dominaria](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=The+Mending+of+Dominaria) respectively. Those Sagas are great!


**Which is your favorite legendary from *Dominaria*, and WHY?**


[Karn, Scion of Urza](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Karn%2C+Scion+of+Urza). Planeswalkers are usually very strong in Limited. It's also colorless which means you can play it in any deck!


**What is the secret to winning at *Dominaria* Limited?**


Be sure to maximise the potential of your deck and ensure your deck is capable of having a high ceiling in terms of power level. That way, you'll be able to defeat the other decks. Also, try to have a wide range of sideboard cards because sideboarding is especially important in this format.
