*Do you have any fun stories from this weekend's Prerelease events?*

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/mtgcom/authorpics/authorpic_zachill.jpg)**Zac Hill:** Two stories:

A) One guy was asking whether infect was at all a Constructed mechanic. I said, "Well, I have a sweet infect deck—want to battle?" I did nothing for the first three turns, then on his turn-four end step (falling to 3 from an attack with NOTHING on the board) I [Carrion Call](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Carrion+Call)ed. He was dead on my next turn. Him: "Well, that was powerful."

| Carrion Call | Contagion Clasp |

B) In a game of *Elspeth vs. Tezzeret*, I was proliferating three times a turn with [Tezzeret the Seeker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tezzeret+the+Seeker) / [Contagion Clasp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Contagion+Clasp) / [Everflowing Chalice](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Everflowing+Chalice) / [Esperzoa](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Esperzoa). My opponent had zillions of guys, though, so I had to win by tutoring up a Pentavus.
