What an awesome week last week was. Five days of **Magic**  from Amsterdam, the Netherlands, culminating on Sunday with the crowning of Team France as the World **Magic** Cup Champion, and Shahar Shenhar as the new World Champion.

He's been working with us for several years now and I wanted to take today's Arcana as a chance to highlight some of his awesome photos.

Here are only a handful of the hundreds of photos he took over the course of the week. But be sure to look through the official event coverage and maybe take a little more notice of the awesome photos he took over the course of the event.

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/wc13/r3_utterleyton.jpg)*Other times he doesn't need any effects and captures the deep thought moments by players such as Josh "Wrapter" Utter-Leyton*

  
![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/wmc13/APE_011.jpg)*He scouts out good spots for photos that give unique perspectives, such as this top-down look at the World **Magic**  Cup competition.*

  
![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/wmc13/APE_018.jpg)*He also captures the moments between players, such as here where two members of the Australian team confer strategy during their match.*

  
And then also here's an awesome look at the staff that worked on these events and made these five days of **Magic** happen.
