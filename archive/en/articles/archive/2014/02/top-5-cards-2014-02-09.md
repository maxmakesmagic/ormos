![Rude Awakening](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Rude%20Awakening&options=)


 

### 5. [Rude Awakening](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rude+Awakening)


One of the standouts from *Fifth Dawn*, this gigantic spell was the centerpiece of No. 13 Makihito Mihara's deck. Well, really it had two copies of this centerpiece, if that analogy works. Mihara drafted an unconventional deck, which the Twitch chat and Twitter replete with criticism, but Mihara proved the haters wrong by smashing face with this green land-based monster again and again in the Top 8 *Modern Masters* draft—tapping, then untapping, then retapping his land again and going from a seemingly unwinnable position to utter opponent decimation.


  

 


![Ephara, God of the Polis](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Ephara,%20God%20of%20the%20Polis&options=)


 

### 4. [Ephara, God of the Polis](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ephara%2C+God+of+the+Polis)


Spotlighting finalist Mihara again, his off-the-wall Standard deck (we're calling "Ephara & Friends"), featured the *Born of the Gods* multi-colored God as a consistent card-drawer of the highest order. Vaulting Mihara into the Top 8, this indestructible enchantment did everything it needed to do. And teamed with the new hotness, [Brimaz, King of Oreskos](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brimaz%2C+King+of+Oreskos) (more on this later), you can even draw extra cards off your opponents' turns as well. Nice, nice, kids.


  

 


![Bile Blight](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Bile%20Blight&options=)


 

### 3. [Bile Blight](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bile+Blight)


If there was one card that shook up the format merely by existing it was [Bile Blight](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bile+Blight). Though unlikely representative of the format to come, a grand total of zero Mono-Blue Devotion decks showed up here today because of this instant-speed, [Echoing Decay](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Echoing+Decay)–looking menace. Why play a deck that folds to the combination of this a [Drown in Sorrow](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Drown+in+Sorrow).


In fact, this card has warped the format so much, player Andre Girard had metagamed the metagame by cutting back on copies he played because he expected that no Mono-Blue Devotion would show up. This card is really good for Black Devotion, Orzhov Midrange, and Top 8 finisher Klaas Grüber's Mono-Black Aggro deck alike.


  

 


![Brimaz, King of Oreskos](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Brimaz,%20King%20of%20Oreskos&options=)


 

### 2. [Brimaz, King of Oreskos](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brimaz%2C+King+of+Oreskos)


What is there to be said about this card that hasn't already been said?: [(Brimaz, King of White)](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/magazine/article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/eventcoverage/sss14/day2a#2)


There were 30 copies of this legend here today and there were in white decks of all stripes: Aggro, Midrange and full-on Control. As many, many people reiterated, this card gives people a "reason to play white again."


Expect a lot more white in you LGS's future—and expect it at Pro Tour *Born of the Gods* coming real soon.


  

 
 


![Death Cloud](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Death%20Cloud&options=)


 

### 1. [Death Cloud](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Death+Cloud)


It makes me so happy to have my favorite card from *Darksteel* as the number one card of this tournament. And there's no favoritism here—this card is rightfully number one. No. 12 Owen Turtenwald drafted an incredible blue and black tempo deck in the *Modern Masters* Top 8 draft portion of the tournament with this and a [Take Possession](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Take+Possession) as the marquee bombs.


[Death Cloud](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Death+Cloud) crushed his semi-final opponent, Andrew Robdrup and finalist Makihito Mihara by casting the card for just enough to strip the entire hand away and grinding out the win over the next couple turns.


The most memorable moment from this first Super Sunday Series Championship will be the rubber game from the finals where Owen stripped the second [Rude Awakening](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rude+Awakening) from Mihara's hand the turn before it was going to take his life away.


Much like [Pox](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pox) and [Balance](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Balance) before it, [Death Cloud](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Death+Cloud) affects so many resources, it's almost guaranteed that it will do exactly what you need it to, and the other stuff it does is all bonus. Oh how I miss [Death Cloud](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Death+Cloud), my dear, dear friend.
