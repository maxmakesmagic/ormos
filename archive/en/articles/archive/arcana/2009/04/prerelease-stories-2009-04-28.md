The *Alara Reborn* Prerelease was fun, right? [Kelly Digges](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/sf/36) seems to have enjoyed it. And judging by this smattering of responses to @[dailymtg](/en/articles/archive/2012-07-10), some of you did as well!


Here's how it started:



> (Kelly) Had a great time at the Prerelease. Any of you have good stories from the weekend?

And here are some of our favorite 140-character stories:



> 
> **thetwixt** @dailymtg One of my favorite prereleases. Very fun set, esp Cascade. got 3 exalted w/ one spell in my first game.
> 
> 
> **fotolorea** @dailymtg Prerelease story: Kept playing Broodbraid Elf and cascading into either Intimidation Bolt or Flurry of Wings. Not cool. LOL :)

> **cursedmortivore** @dailymtg I had Spellbound Dragon swinging one turn and discarding Valley Rannet then the next turn discarding Thraximundar for the win.
> 
> 
> **podunk42** @dailymtg Gloryscale Viashino + 2 Reborn Hope = WIN.
> 
> 
> **kaokun** @dailymtg I also managed to get a Mage Slayer onto a Blitz Hellion :) Nothing like 14 to your opponent's face to put a smile on yours
> 
> 
> **burgessm** @dailymtg Allstar play of the day: Enlisted Wurm, cascading into Demonic Dread to kill a crystallized thoctar, cascading into Terminate

> **brendensparks** @dailymtg I had to run it so didn't get chance to play. But incredible brainstorming, theorycrafting, and deck-naming after the fact.
> 
> 
> **izezay** @dailymtg turn 5 kill with twin claw and 2 pump spells, opp was tapped out

> 
> **Dave\_Rey** @dailymtg Good stories? It wasn't good for me, but in one of my games, my opponent played Deny Reality and hit Meddling Mage off the Cascade
> 
> 
> **blisterguy** @dailymtg i offered my opponent my deck to cut, so he cut to reveal a card at random to see who goes first. i wasn't expecting that
