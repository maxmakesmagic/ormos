CHAOS DRAFT! February 5–19
--------------------------


Flex your deck-building skills during February's CHAOS DRAFT!, a format that requires players to contemplate meta-archetypes over the curated archetypes typically found in a cube. CHAOS DRAFT! runs through February 19—plenty of time to smash face amidst the [Pandemonium](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pandemonium).


Sets that can be opened in this CHAOS DRAFT! include:


*Visions*, *Weatherlight*, *Stronghold*, *Exodus*, *Urza's Legacy*, *Urza's Destiny*, *Planeshift*, *Apocalypse*, *Torment*, *Judgment*, *Legions*, *Scourge*, *Darksteel*, *Fifth Dawn*, *Betrayers of Kamigawa*, *Saviors of Kamigawa*, *Guildpact*, *Dissension*, *Coldsnap*, *Planar Chaos*, *Future Sight*, *Morningtide*, *Eventide*, *Conflux*, *Alara Reborn*, *Worldwake*, *Mirrodin Besieged*, *New Phyrexia*, *Dark Ascension*, *Dragon's Maze*, *Born of the Gods*, *Journey Into Nyx*, *Fate Reforged*, *Oath of the Gatewatch*, *Eldritch* *Moon*, *Aether Revolt*, *Hour of Devastation*, and *Rivals of Ixalan*

Build Notes
