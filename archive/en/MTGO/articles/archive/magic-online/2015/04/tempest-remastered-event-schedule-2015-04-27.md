*Tempest Remastered* goes on sale for three weeks, beginning Wednesday, May 6, only on *Magic Online*!


![](https://web.archive.org/web/20150227202313im_/http://www.wizards.com/mtg/images/digital/magiconline/TPR_logo.png)


*Tempest*, *Stronghold*, and *Exodus* were some of the first sets designed with Limited play in mind. It's been nearly two decades since *Tempest* block's release, and R&D has leveraged their accumulated experience to refine and balance those Limited forebears to play as well as a modern-day set. Now that *Tempest Remastered*'s release day is almost here, what's the best way to celebrate these three weeks in which the set is first available on *Magic Online*? With a smorgasbord of Limited Events, of course!


Players will be able to pick and choose between Draft and Sealed Queues through the Wednesday, May 27, downtime. Snag every [Sliver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?action=advanced&set=+[%22Tempest%20Remastered%22]&name=+[sliver]) that happens across your path in the [8-4](#TPR84) and [6-2-2-2](#TPR6222) Draft Events! Shove every creature with [Shadow](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?action=advanced&set=+[%22Tempest%20Remastered%22]&text=+[Shadow]+[(this]+[creature]) into one unblockable monstrosity in the [*Tempest Remastered* Sealed Event](#TPRSealed)! Don't forgot to set your egg timer for every four hours either—there are scheduled *Tempest Remastered* Events to attend.

The *Tempest Remastered* [64-Player Single Elimination Draft, with Top 8](#64playerdraft) is the premier event throughout the set's first on-sale period. The stakes are high, with the first place finisher walking away with 24 packs of *Tempest Remastered*. What does one do with such riches? Crack those packs to build your Legacy and Vintage collection, or use them as part of an entry option into more *Tempest Remastered* Events! Participation in any *Tempest Remastered* Event will earn you one of two alternate-art Avatars—Bottle Gnomes or Rathi Dragon, depending on the event.


Don't think we've forgotten you either, Constructed fans. While *Tempest Remastered* is available on *Magic Online*, May 6 through May 27, prizes will rotate in the Vintage and Legacy 2-Player Queues and Dailies to award booster packs of *Tempest Remastered*! Refer to the tables [below](#prizes) to get the run-down on what prizes will be awarded for which events.


Can't wait for *Tempest Remastered*? Take a look at the full [card image gallery](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/card-image-gallery/tempest-remastered-card-image-gallery-2015-03-30) as well as an [interview](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/feature/adam-prosak-and-ian-duke-tempest-remastered-interview-2015-03-30) with the lead designers while you count down the days until release.
