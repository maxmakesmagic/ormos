There's been so many awesome things going on here this weekend, spread across so many cards and so many archetypes. Narrowing it down to just five seems a fool's errand, but I must persevere!

### 
 5. [Sidisi, Brood Tyrant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sidisi%2C+Brood+Tyrant)



 After waiting in the wings for too long, Sidisi's time is now! Making a decent showing at Pro Tour *Khans of Tarkir*, the Sidisi Whip deck—featuring the Brood Tyrant alongside [Whip of Erebos](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Whip+of+Erebos) and big hitters like [Hornet Queen](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hornet+Queen)—has only been gaining steam in the meta. And it's been for a very specific reason: Mardu has become a thing.
 


It's not surprising that the rise of Mardu and the rise of Sidisi Whip are so closely correlated—Sidisi destroys Mardu. Both Albert Ake, who piloted the deck in the Top 8, and eventual winner Ryan Scullin on Mardu, said that Mardu was Sidisi's best match-up, and Sidisi was Mardu's worst.



 Mardu was the third-highest represented deck in Day 2, behind only Abzan and Jeskai. Sidisi Whip already had good game against Abzan, so if Mardu keeps rising, no doubt will Sidisi too. This card could have been [Whip of Erebos](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Whip+of+Erebos), that has shown up in decks Sidisi does not, but No way Legendary Enchantment Artifact! Sidisi is the prom queen tonight; you're just serving punch.
