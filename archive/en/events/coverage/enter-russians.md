Enter the Russians
==================











![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gpsto07/kiss.jpg)Nicolay Potovin wins Grand Prix-Stockholm!


It was only a few years ago that **Magic** was first printed in Russian, with a fanfare launch tournament in Moscow featuring a selection of top pros. Now the country has its second Grand Prix champion in Potovin. When Pro Tour-Philadelphia Top 8 member Andre Müller beat Kenji Tsumura in the semifinals, he proudly declared "For me the tournament is over" -- but he had not reckoned with the might of Nicolay Potovin and his powerhouse red/blue deck, which romped to victory in two games straight.


The Russian contingent was out in force at Grand Prix-Stockholm, and while there were many Germans, a local hero and a tiny hero from the far east all vying for the title, none could stop Potovin from lifting the trophy with his countrymen at the end of the day.



Congratulations to Nicolay Potovin, Grand Prix-Stockholm champion!

Sunday, May 6: 9:01 p.m. - Quarterfinals: Klaus Jöns vs. Kenji Tsumura
----------------------------------------------------------------------


*by Tim Willoughby*

Kenji's Top 8 began with a mulligan, but quickly improved with a [Knight of Sursi](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Knight+of+Sursi) suspended on turn one. He followed up with a morph on turn three, while Jöns was looking to take the shadow path, with both a Looter *il-*Kor and an [Infiltrator il-Kor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Infiltrator+il-Kor). The race was on, and Klaus got to draw extra cards into the bargain.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gpsto07/kenjiqf.jpg)*Wake up Kenji!*
[Aven Augur](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aven+Augur) gave Klaus his first non-shadow monster, but with the way that each player was attacking all the time, it might as well have. The life totals were quickly 12 to 10 in Jöns' favour, and when a big [Fomori Nomad](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fomori+Nomad) came down for the German, suddenly Kenji was on the defensive. He carefully read [Aven Augur](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aven+Augur), and got to experience its ability first hand in the very next upkeep. As there were two targets for the ability, his morphed [Willbender](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Willbender) could do nothing about it, and without blockers, he was quickly taken down to 2.


A [Whip-Spine Drake](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Whip-Spine+Drake) joined the German team, and Kenji briskly scooped up his cards.


Klaus Jöns 1 - 0 Kenji Tsumura


Kenji's [Knight of Sursi](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Knight+of+Sursi) suspend came on turn two for game 2, while Klaus had a [Looter il-Kor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Looter+il-Kor). Kenji played [D'Avenant Healer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=D%27Avenant+Healer), an answer he'd brought in to deal with shadows, and passed, forced to take a single hit from the Looter before his guy came online. An [Aquamorph Entity](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aquamorph+Entity) got hit by Spell Snare when Kenji tried to play it as a morph, but Kenji still had his small victory of holding back the Looter, which didn't want to attack into certain death. Klaus played [Coal Stoker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Coal+Stoker) and a morph before passing.


Kenji had a [Cloudchaser Kestrel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloudchaser+Kestrel), who blocked the following turn when Klaus' two new creatures swung in, but when he used his Healer, it got hit by [Leaden Fists](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leaden+Fists). Klaus' morph that was blocked didn't even die, as it turned out to be a [Fathom Seer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fathom+Seer), who unmorphed.. Kenji used [Piracy Charm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Piracy+Charm) to kill the Looter, and when [Gossamer Phantasm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gossamer+Phantasm) came out, he used his Kestrel's ability to finish it off.


Kenji jumped ahead on tempo in the game with a [Jedit's Dragoons](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jedit%27s+Dragoons), and then by bouncing an [Aven Augur](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aven+Augur) with [Venser's Diffusion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Venser%27s+Diffusion). He attacked Klaus down to 6, and even in the face of an [Infiltrator il-Kor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Infiltrator+il-Kor), was ahead enough on life that he looked good for a race.


Attacks forced [Aven Augur](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aven+Augur) into a trade with [Cloudchaser Kestrel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloudchaser+Kestrel), but still took Klaus to four. Each player had a morph, but it seemed that Kenji had the only flyer. In upkeep, Klaus showed his morph to be [Shaper Parasite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shaper+Parasite), but was trumped by a [Willbender](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Willbender), allowing Kenji to kill of one of the German team, and swing for the win.


Klaus Jöns 1 - 1 Kenji Tsumura


Kenji led off with a suspended [Ivory Giant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ivory+Giant) for Game 3, and followed up with a suspended [Knight of Sursi](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Knight+of+Sursi). Jöns had a suspended [Infiltrator il-Kor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Infiltrator+il-Kor) and a morph. Kenji had a [Cloudchaser Kestrel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloudchaser+Kestrel), but it died to [Shaper Parasite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shaper+Parasite), leaving Jöns clear to attack. Kenji killed off the shadow creature with [Piracy Charm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Piracy+Charm), but took two on the other swings. Jöns played a morph and passed.


Kenji played a 1/5 face up [Aquamorph Entity](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aquamorph+Entity) to stem the bleeding, and used it to block Jöns' [Shaper Parasite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shaper+Parasite) the following turn when the German attacked. Then down came [Jodah's Avenger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jodah%27s+Avenger). Kenji had taken a [Dust Elemental](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dust+Elemental) over one of these in the draft, and though it seemed unlikely to be the same one, it was definitely scary for the little master. His [Ivory Giant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ivory+Giant) came off suspension, and he swung in with is team into a fully tapped-out German board. A [Walk the Aeons](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Walk+the+Aeons) allowed for another attack - to take Klaus to 8. [Aven Augur](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aven+Augur) then joined the Japanese team.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gpsto07/klausqf.jpg)*Klaus feels the hurt.*
Jöns attacked with his [Jodah's Avenger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jodah%27s+Avenger). Kenji let his 1/5 block, to which the Avenger gained double strike. Kenji used [Pongify](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pongify) to turn his wall into a 3/3 Ape that looked curiously like Richard Hoaen. The game was now very tight on life. Kenji went to the tank, looking for the right play for his turn, as Jöns had the turn before. In his upkeep, he sacrificed [Aven Augur](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aven+Augur), bouncing [Jodah's Avenger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jodah%27s+Avenger), and Jöns' own [Aven Augur](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aven+Augur), before drawing and swinging with his team. All Jöns had was a morph and a [Shaper Parasite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shaper+Parasite) to block with, and both went in front of [Ivory Giant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ivory+Giant) - with the morph (a [Slipstream Serpent](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Slipstream+Serpent)) falling to the 3/4.


[Aven Augur](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aven+Augur) came back for Klaus, but it was not enough to keep him out of the deep water he was in. The following turn, one extra threat on the board from Kenji was enough to seal it. Jöns scooped up his cards. There was some confusion as to life totals, but the extra [Knight of Sursi](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Knight+of+Sursi) that was lurking on top of Kenji's deck suggested that even if Jöns hadn't scooped when he did, the result would not have changed.


Kenji Tsumura wins 2-1
