Here are five cards that sum up some of the biggest stories of the weekend.

### 
 5. [Riddle of Lightning](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Riddle+of+Lightning)



 The new delve spells from *Khans of Tarkir* have already left their mark on almost every single format, but there are always new avenues to be explored. Here in Stockholm, Mikael Magnusson combined [Dig Through Time](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dig+Through+Time) and [Treasure Cruise](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treasure+Cruise) with [Riddle of Lightning](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Riddle+of+Lightning), and piloted his blue-red counter-burn deck to a 41st place.
 


Dealing 8 damage in one strike is certainly one of the flashiest ways to end a game. In one noteworthy match, Magnusson managed to chain Riddle into Riddle over the course of two fiery turns, and took his opponent down from 22 life to 0. There are few burn spells that can do that.
