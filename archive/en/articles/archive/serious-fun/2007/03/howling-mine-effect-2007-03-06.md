The Howling Mine Effect
=======================

By The Ferrett











Two weeks ago, I chose the [Most Powerful Multiplayer Card in *Planar Chaos*](/en/articles/archive/serious-fun/multiplayer-power-planar-chaos-2007-02-20), to much [controversy](http://boards1.wizards.com/showthread.php?t=794525) And that's fine. Whereas *Time Spiral* had a handful of out*rage*ously powerful cards like Teferi and [Stuffy Doll](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stuffy+Doll), *Planar Chaos* didn't have any obvious standouts. I knew going in that there was nothing I could choose to satisfy everyone... And so I'm fine with it. 

But I'll still stand by [Wild Pair](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Pair), baby. Is it expensive? Sure. But you'll get your money's worth. 

But the time for *power* is past. Now it is time to discuss *fun*. And, um.... 

I'm pretty sure you'll have problems with this call, too. 

Why? Because I'm going to start off why telling you why the most popular choice for "The Most Fun Card In *Planar Chaos*" is not actually that fun. That's right – it's time to trash....

![Braids, Conjurer Adept](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Braids%2C+Conjurer+Adept)**[Braids, Conjurer Adept](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Braids%2C+Conjurer+Adept) (10 Votes)**I suspect a large part of the reason this got chosen is because I touted the juicy goodness of [Hypergenesis](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hypergenesis) as [The Most Fun Card In *Time Spiral*](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/daily/tf9). And I'll stand by that; [Hypergenesis](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hypergenesis) is fun because it encourages everyone to slam their entire hand onto the table at once, creating one big whopping puppy pile of fun. It's *fireworks* aseverythingexplodes onto the table. 

[Hypergenesis](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hypergenesis) is a Fourth of July show, rocking the air with thunderous bursts. 

Braids? The new Braids is one of those little snake-things that putters out in a pathetic ooze of smoke and ash. 

You see, [Hypergenesis](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hypergenesis) is uncontrollable. Oh, you can counter it, or you can strip people's hands, but once it starts to resolve everything just goes *nuts*. Everyone gets a chance to do whatever they feel like, in a sort of Summer of Love-style thriller exposition.

Braids, on the other hand? Braids doesn't even have the thrill of letting *you* start first. You have to let your opponents get their goodies first. 

And there's no guarantee that their goodies won't kill your chance. Try this!

"Braids!"  
 "[Firemaw Kavu](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Firemaw+Kavu)!" 

"Braids!"   
 "[Avatar of Woe](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Avatar+of+Woe)!" 

"Braids!"   
 "[Riftwing Cloudskate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Riftwing+Cloudskate)!" 

"Braids!"   
 "[Humility](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Humility)!" 

"Aw, come on, Ferrett," you say. "She's a party. *Everyone* loves a party. Braids is like [Howling Mine](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Howling+Mine)!" 

And here is where, perhaps, the people you've played with and the people that I've played with differ. Because let's talk about *The [Howling Mine](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Howling+Mine) Effect*. 

![howling_mine](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/cardart/9ED/howling_mine.jpg)[Howling Mine](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Howling+Mine) is the card that beginning players *love*, and it's usually their first (and most disastrous) flirtation with the politics of multiplayer. And if you're playing with a table full of relative novices, they will *adore* the [Howling Mine](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Howling+Mine). 

But [Howling Mine](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Howling+Mine) goes in two styles of decks, and neither is particularly good against opponents with a decent level of experience: 

*1) A deck that doesn't really get any particular benefit from [Howling Mine](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Howling+Mine).*

You just put it in there because you have a weak deck that likes to draw extra cards. But then again, what deck *doesn't* like to draw a few cards now and then? Heck, that's the whole reason other players *like* 
[Howling Mine](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Howling+Mine) – free cards, baby! 

But in the end, your deck does not particularly capitalize on these extra cards. It lets you draw more lands and creatures and enchantments and artifacts, but those excess cards don't interact with the [Howling Mine](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Howling+Mine) in any way that really matters.

The problem with the "[Howling Mine](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Howling+Mine) as a patch for an incomplete deck" is that other players most likely have better decks that will benefit *more* from drawing more cards. Why? Well, for one thing, they have at least four more slots in their deck that are devoted to cards that will actually *kill* other players... As opposed to the four slots you've used up to help everyone else draw more cards. 

*You* will draw more [Howling Mine](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Howling+Mine)s. *They* will draw more business cards. And the reason they're letting you live is not because they're having a great time, but because – and I hate to tell you this – 

It's because you're not a big enough threat to bother to take out. 

If you were a real threat, they'd be sending all of their guys your way. But they know, and nine times out of ten they're correct, that a deck that utilizes [Howling Mine](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Howling+Mine) and then doesn't try to follow it up with some evil combo isn't going to be much of a challenge when the time comes. So they let you live *not* because they're having such a good time, but because they figure they can hammer you down at their leisure.

They're usually right, too. 

Usually, [Howling Mine](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Howling+Mine) helps everyone as much as it hurts them, so it's not something that really affects the table. Everyone's drawing cards at the same rate, which means that [Howling Mine](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Howling+Mine) is actually boosting the most powerful deck at the table at a disproportionate rate. 

And didn't I just explain that this *isn't* you? 

The big guy will either outdraw everyone and just pound them into dirt on the back of these fresh hot cards he's getting, or he'll pop the [Howling Mine](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Howling+Mine) whenever he figures it's not giving him an advantage any more. Thus, your Mine isn't a real advantage to *you*.

It's a card that maybe – *maybe* – lets you come in second. But who wants that? 

Sure, there's some political consideration to be had if some meanie decides to pop the [Howling Mine](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Howling+Mine) with a [Naturalize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Naturalize). Players will be mildly upset that they're not getting to draw the extra cards. But on the other hand, it's not like they were really robbed – the [Howling Mine](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Howling+Mine) was a nice bonus while it was around, but it's not like *they* spent the two mana to put it into play. Nobody's popped their card. So usually, at experienced tables, the [Howling Mine](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Howling+Mine) destruction gets met with a round of "Aw, man"s and *no effect whatsoever*. 

Occasionally, someone will be furious that the [Howling Mine](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Howling+Mine) went away. He is furious because he needed those cards. And if he needed those cards *that* badly, usually he's mana-screwed or mana-flooded and isn't really anything to worry about. 

Sure, it's nice to play [Howling Mine](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Howling+Mine). Or Braids. Or any other spell that gives the benefit to your opponents first, giving them the opportunity to kill your happy little share-around before you get it. But it's usually not good enough to throw into a deck and win.

Which leaves us with the other option: 

![Megrim](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Megrim)*2) A deck designed around [Howling Mine](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Howling+Mine)*Oh, there are tons of them. How about [Underworld Dreams](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Underworld+Dreams) and [Howling Mine](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Howling+Mine)? Or [Megrim](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Megrim) and [Howling Mine](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Howling+Mine) and [Barbed Shocker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Barbed+Shocker)? Or some sort of crazy [Dreamborn Muse](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dreamborn+Muse)/[Howling Mine](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Howling+Mine) deck 'em combo? 

How 'bout we assume your opponents are going to be suspicious? 

Come on, this isn't the local Salvation Army. There are no real handouts in Magic. And at least until they can scope the contents of your deck a little more (see Deck Style #1 above), they're going to assume that this friendly gift is, in fact, a nice wooden horse with a bunch of Trojan soldiers rattling around inside of it. 

They're going to sniff that combo. The minute you put anything else on the table that seems to work with it in the slightest, they're going to *react*. (Assuming, of course, they're bright enough to see it coming – some players aren't.) 

Their reaction will take the edge off of your handy-dandy [Howling Mine](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Howling+Mine). Suddenly, it's not the fun times of "Hey, it's a gift!" It's the "This will benefit you briefly, and then kill you!" responses, and that will involve them sending large men over to investigate the nooks and crannies of your face, or killing the combo pieces as they appear. 

And invariably, they have the guns to *do* it, too. Why? *Because you're handing them free cards, you silly*. 

"But I'm good times!" you cry. "I'm not the threat!" And that's the problem with [Howling Mine](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Howling+Mine). It doesn't survive because people love you; it survives because people get a benefit out of it. And by nature, the benefit *they* get is superior to yours. 

[Hypergenesis](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hypergenesis) worked because everyone got to play at once. The slow drip drip drip of Braids, however... Well, that's no fun at all. 

So sorry. Braids, you're off the island. 


> *Braids has that one key trait of a great fun multiplayer card – she fundamentally alters the world as soon as she hits the board. Then there's one other mote of greatness that I'll mention at the end.* 
> 
> 
> *Braids pokes the world with a big stick, like a [Hunted Wumpus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hunted+Wumpus) on crack. Suddenly, everyone else's plan has to change around to "Is there anything good for me to drop?" and "What's everyone else going to drop?" Should they change their strategy just because the game suddenly changed from Magic to [Spit](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spit_(card_game))? It forces new decisions on everyone.*
> 
> 
> *It's also a great time for you if you're the one who brought Braids to the party, because you're all set to apply some asymmetric strategy to her global power. Bring permanents you can't actually play, or at least can't play quickly. Exult in getting five ridiculously large artifacts into play in as many turns.*

As an added bonus, the first [Grozoth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grozoth) to hit the board lets you pull the remaining [Grozoth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grozoth)s and Nullstones into your hand, and the Nullstone is yet another global alteration card, shutting down all those pesky non-creature spells and letting your big guys wander the field with a little less hassle. After all, you'll always have a counter waiting after they've cast a creature or burned a spell just for the chance to try and kill one of your precious Gargoyles.*

She's a sweet, unassuming girl who'd be a great study partner and who tries to give everyone a hand getting their cards into play. Even if she does have an evil twin in an alternate dimension, she's a fundamentally good person and everyone's favorite on the show. Or in the game. You know what I mean.*

Say the guy beside you drops [Darksteel Colossus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Darksteel+Colossus), [Pristine Angel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pristine+Angel), [Simic Sky Swallower](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Simic+Sky+Swallower), Teferi, Rimescale Dragon, Niv-Mizzet or some other big scary card that has the potential to wreck you. Sure, Braids the little 2/2 is the one who did it, but is it worth hitting her with [Chainer's Edict](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chainer%27s+Edict) or something like that when the scary Thing is out to wreak havoc? No indeed. The opposition will concentrate on defending themselves from each other...or turn on you.*

> 
> *But since you naturally have a backup plan, that's not an issue. In short, to borrow an Alongi term, Braids "burns other people's fuel."*
> 
> 
> *5) The skill level. [Braids, Conjurer Adept](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Braids%2C+Conjurer+Adept) takes skill to play. This for me is the best part of her. Anyone can kill with Akroma, but it takes planning and skill to win with Braids.*
>

![Dichotomancy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Dichotomancy)**[Dichotomancy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dichotomancy) (9 votes)**I discussed potential [Dichotomancy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dichotomancy) builds in the last column, and I do feel that most of the people who were discussing it were mixing "fun" with "power." That's a problem that we'll have to address in the next contest, however... And I'm avoiding it, because it means explicitly defining "power" and "fun." 

Or maybe we revamp the whole challenge from the get-go. If you have any suggestions as to how I should divide the "fun" cards from the "powerful" cards when many folks seem to think that fun and power are the same thing – and I can't say they're not – sound off. 

![Chronozoa](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Chronozoa)**[Chronozoa](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chronozoa) (6 votes)**This one was more of a solid split between "Fun" and "Powerful," which again points to some fuzzy definitions here. That said, I think [Chronozoa](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chronozoa) is a lot more "fun" than it is "powerful," since we have a big splitting amoeba. How can that not be fun?

There's one other card that got six votes... But we'll deal with that in a moment. Because it's the one that *won*. 

But let's discuss the fun that other people had.

> *It works very well, with the manipulator as the win condition. I slap +1/+1s onto anything that comes along to befriend them. The behemoth helps, because players know that I give +1/+1s away freely. They refuse to attack me, knowing I give them anything they want. [Regeneration](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Regeneration), flying, or even untargetability. The fact that when it comes in, I still have +1/+1s on my creatures helps a bit.*

> *The most FUN card in Planar Chaos multiplayer has to be [Magus of the Arena](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Magus+of+the+Arena). [Magus of the Arena](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Magus+of+the+Arena) not only has the toughness to stay on the board in most multiplayer games, he has one of the most flavorful and most fun abilities I have yet to see. Nothing screams fun like sitting around the table waiting for the guy on your right to finish and you can say "O yeah, at the end of my turn...*you *and* you *fight to the death!" Its so much fun sometimes I forget my creature is going to lose the gladiatorial battle, and there goes my creature. Not only is it fun to make your opponents creatures go mono on mono with your own, its even better in a deck with counters and pump. Just like Rocky in well... All the Rockys, your creature can be the champ of the board as long as its A) strong, or B) you have a nice little card called [Brute Force](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brute+Force) to back you creature up. In conclusion that is why [Magus of the Arena](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Magus+of+the+Arena) is the king of fun(ness) in multiplayer Planar Chaos.*

> *Nobody in Planar Chaos fits the multiplayer criteria better than [Timbermare](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Timbermare). Most bombs only hit the board on turn 4 through reanimation, while he can deal five damage to the head to anybody that turn. His haste gives him the ability to make an unblockable impact before getting hit with [Wrath of God](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wrath+of+God). But it's not just a [Groundbreaker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Groundbreaker). Later in the game, there is more you can do than sending a four-mana [Lava Axe](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lava+Axe). Assuming you don't like paying echo cost, how about killing it right now and dealing ten damage with [Fatal Frenzy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fatal+Frenzy)? If you want it alive, use an Adarkar Valkyrie tapping all their guys and dealing nine damage per turn? Sounds fun! And one last way to annoy your enemies: [Momentary Blink](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Momentary+Blink).*

> *There is one card which clearly, in the fun category kicks a lot of ass: [Dust Elemental](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dust+Elemental). Its good for a few reasons; one, it's a 6/6 for four with flying, fear, and flash. Two, if your deck is built to handle its "return three creatures ability," it is a massive boon. Yeah, you heard me.*

[Damnation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Damnation) into [Avatar of Woe](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Avatar+of+Woe) can be devastating, unless of course your Akroma gets bumped right back.*

The only splurge in the first deck are the glares and hierarchs. The reason there are not four [Dust Elemental](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dust+Elemental)s is that the most horrible play ever is [Dust Elemental](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dust+Elemental) returning [Dust Elemental](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dust+Elemental) (unless you have to).*

The deck doesn't seem threatening at all, until it drops glare and [Dust Elemental](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dust+Elemental)s into the beat-down win. [Harmonize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Harmonize) would also be good here.

But there is one card that I have a weakness for. Those who paid attention to the [Most Fun Card In *Time Spiral*](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/daily/tf9) will note my rating system... And they would see the reason why I chose this.

Or, maybe Player B has a really great 1/1 with a neat mechanic that you want to get rid of, but still maybe want to get rid of Player A's attacking 2/2 creature instead. You get rid of the powerful 1/1, and Player B blocks, killing Player A's creature. Neat.*

Well, not me. I have 4/4s, 6/6s, etc. Ok, and maybe you Bob since I can't target that one or that one. Wanna make a deal? By the way, I'm now planning on making a bunch of 1/1 Saprolings one at a time and turning them each into 3/3 creatures. Let's see who can make the most 3/3 creatures.*

Player A attacks Player B with a 4/4 creature. Player B only has a 1/1 creature. You turn it into a 3/3 and do a point of damage (with the sharpshooter) to one of the players. When the creature goes away, the sharpshooter untaps allowing you the possibility to do an extra point of damage to Player A's attacking 4/4 creature if Player B decides to block with his now 3/3 creature. Thus, killing both creatures.*

Alas, Spencer, this isn't the best entry. It was close. But *this* is the best [Pongify](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pongify) entry:

> ![Dralnu, Lich Lord](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Dralnu%2C+Lich+Lord)*I mean, it turns any creature into a 3/3 monkey! What's that, Teferi? You want a banana? I'm sorry, Dralnu, I didn't understand that last "Oook." It's a great answer to specific trouble creatures, even if it's not a great answer to, say, a Saproling. And, really, it's just entertaining. The flavor and effect of the card line up perfectly for hilarity.*
> *At the same time, [Pongify](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pongify) doesn't take anyone out of the game directly. Unlike most spot kill (or, for that matter, [Counterspell](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterspell)s), [Pongify](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pongify) leaves the player with a monkey – and a fairly beefy monkey, at that. So the poor guy who got his 7-part Rube-Goldberg combo-deck ready to go isn't left high and dry, unable to participate in the game. The guy who sacrificed all his lands to unsuspend a [Greater Gargadon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Greater+Gargadon) quickly doesn't have to sit around uselessly for five turns hoping to draw another mountain. [Pongify](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pongify) leaves players with something to do, even if that thing isn't as good as what they had planned. Insofar as doing things in a game is fun, [Pongify](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pongify) gives opportunities for fun like few kill spells do.*
> 
> 
> *Finally, [Pongify](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pongify) is surprisingly versatile, and it's great for actually helping other players. I've often chosen to Pong my own creatures when they'd otherwise die, to get the token. It's like a bounce spell, but you get your monkey right now. If you're playing a team game, and your ally is getting his head handed to him because his hand that seemed so good can't draw a second elf? Pong! A better creature for you. Or in a free-for-all, when one person is dying for lack of blockers? Pong! That'll stall the ground for a while, so you can finish your combo, and earn you some goodwill, too! [Pongify](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pongify) is creature kill, but it's also a creature rescue, and an ad hoc [Giant Growth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Giant+Growth), and all those effects are useful when used on yourself or other players. It's a great political card, a quirky flavor card, and a useful mechanical card, all at once.*

No, you have a nice, day, Phillip. You had me at Dralnu saying "ook." Because God knows I loves me some Terry Pratchett. 

So there you have it: [Pongify](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pongify). The Funnest Most Fun *Planar Chaos* Card in Multiplayer. And Phillip will soon receive a full set of bananaed goodness for his excellent dissection of why it's more fun than a monkey's uncle!

You may now go nuts in the forums.
