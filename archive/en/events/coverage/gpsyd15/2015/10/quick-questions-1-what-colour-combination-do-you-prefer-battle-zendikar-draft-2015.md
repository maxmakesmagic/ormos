 What colour combination do you prefer in *Battle for Zendikar* draft?
=======================================================================


Some colours are stronger than others in any given limited format, either by design or by accidental, but what it often comes down to, when deciding what to draft, is personal preference. I asked some of our better players which colour combination they'd be happiest drafting.

**Zen Takahashi:** Blue-Red or Blue-Black because Blue is basically the deepest colour.

**Jason Chung:** Black-Green sacrifice, or Blue-Red devoid.

**Sam Loy:** White-Blue, because Roil Spout amazing.

**Paul Jackson:** Black-Red devoid. I've had good success with it, and the cards that are good in it are cards that are seldom good in other archetypes. [Vile Aggregate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vile+Aggregate) is the best card in that deck.

**Maitland Cameron:** Red-White, but I haven't actually played that combination yet.
