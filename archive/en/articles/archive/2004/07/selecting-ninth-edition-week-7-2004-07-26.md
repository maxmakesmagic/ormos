### Card Vote #7


This week it’s the battle of the bounce. [Time Elemental](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Time+Elemental) was a very popular card back in the *Legends* days, and it made it into the core set for *Fourth Edition* as well as *Fifth Edition*. [Temporal Adept](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Temporal+Adept) of *Urza’s Destiny* is the incumbent though, looking to extend its run in *Seventh Edition*  and *Eighth Edition*  into a threepeat. The adept is the stronger card in terms of versatility and costs one less to activate, but comes with a steeper blue requirement that many decks find prohibitive not to mention that often annoying single point of toughness. Which card makes it? The choice is yours!

### Sketch Vote #3


This week’s sketch vote features another *Legends*  card, a white spell so well known that it’s often considered synonymous with the ability of gaining life for damage dealt. Having made every core set it’s been eligible for, it’s time for [Spirit Link](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spirit+Link) to get a new look. Pick whichever you like best and the winning sketch will be fleshed out into the final art for this card’s *Ninth Edition* appearance!


This week’s sketch vote is between Kevin Walker and Ron Spencer.
