The February 23, 2017 Update
============================



 Posted in **Daily Magic Update**
 on February 23, 2017

Blake is the content manager for DailyMTG.com, making him the one you should email if you have thoughts on the website, good or less good (or not good). He's a longtime coverage reporter and hasn't turned down a game of Magic in any format ever. 






The Daily *Magic* Update is a roundup of everything *Magic* you should know on February 23, 2017. Today's Update is brought to you by winning. In whatever form that takes.


Today's Must
============


1. [What Does Winning in Commander Look Like?](http://www.starcitygames.com/article/34613_What-Does-Winning-In-Commander-Look-Like.html) | StarCityGames.com | Sheldon Menery

For me, it looks like my opponents mutually agreeing the game is over while I take a 10-minute turn, but I suppose that's why people throw fruit at me. For others, there are a lot of things that look and feel like winning in Commander—from finally pulling off that nine-card combo to everyone having fun to decks doing the thing they were designed to do, even if that thing is losing in style.


It's a good reminder that there are a lot of ways to enjoy *Magic*.


After That, Read, Watch, or Listen to These
===========================================


1. [Heartfelt Thoughts from Pro Tour *Aether Revolt*](http://www.mtgmintcard.com/articles/writers/eduardo-sajgalik/heartfelt-thoughts-from-pro-tour-aether-revolt) | MTG Mint Card | Eduardo Sajgalik

Pro Tour *Aether Revolt* Top 4 competitor Eduardo Sajgalik recounts how he ended up on Team MTG Mint Card, how he found his deck, and just how he ended up on a *Magic* card (sort of).


1. [The Gatewatch Era, So Far](http://www.starcitygames.com/article/34615_The-Gatewatch-Era-So-Far.html) | StarCityGames.com | John Dale Beety

Beety recounts the Gatewatch Era, as he calls it—the storytelling epoch *Magic* is currently in, following the Gatewatch as they traipse around the multiverse (yes, traipse), righting wrongs and making up nicknames for one another.


1. [Five Hidden Gems of *Aether Revolt*](http://www.hipstersofthecoast.com/2017/02/five-hidden-gems-aether-revolt/) | Hipsters of the Coast | Brendan McNamara

Still can't crack *Aether Revolt* Draft? Yeah, me neither. Maybe it's time to look at things a bit differently. Brendan McNamara tilts his head to the side and squints to find five cards in *Aether Revolt* that we all might be undervaluing.


1. [Against the Odds: Warped Statuary (Modern)](https://www.mtggoldfish.com/articles/against-the-odds-warped-statuary-modern?src=wizards) | MTGGoldfish | SaffronOlive

Saffron's been all over [Inspiring Statuary](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inspiring+Statuary) since it was printed—so why not Modern? In one of his craziest brews ever, he tries to go off with [Warp World](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Warp+World) and [Inspiring Statuary](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inspiring+Statuary) to, well, let's just call them mixed results.


1. [A Guide to Sigarda, Host of Herons Commander / EDH for *Magic: The Gathering*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8HuTVldPD8) | Tolarian Community College | The Professor

[Sigarda, Host of Herons](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sigarda%2C+Host+of+Herons) is a bit of a weird bird. Or Angel. The Professor explores what you can do with her for Commander, complete with creepy-sounding opening montage that might haunt your dreams if you listen to it before bed.

Community Spotlight
===================


1. [Cardhoarder Podcast](https://www.cardhoarder.com/content/cardhoarder-podcast-episode-44-death-s-shadow-magic-digital-next-283) | Cardhoarder | Conor, Nathaniel, and Dave

Cardhoarder—a store you might have heard of before—hosts a weekly, topical podcast on their website. This week they cover Modern [Death's Shadow](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Death%27s+Shadow), the 1996 World Championship card, and, the portion with the most utility, Twitch streams you should be watching.


What People Are Talking About
=============================


1. [*Khans of Tarkir* Flashback Draft](http://wizardsmtgo.tumblr.com/post/157592281774/khans-of-tarkir-flashback-draft)

Although I was fortunate enough to get into a queue and do a bunch of winning with ProsBloom, there were some issues that forced the Throwback Standard Draft to be rescheduled. In its place, we put up *Khans of Tarkir* Flashback drafts. It's much harder to combo kill someone on turn three, but it is much easier to draft the five-color banners deck, so I'll call it a wash.


1. [Instead of posting this five times in every thread I figured I'd announce it. The legs make sense.](https://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/5vkvra/instead_of_posting_this_five_times_in_every/)

Remember that art we showed off the other day of [Liliana and the fruit Zombies](https://twitter.com/wizards_magic/status/833842911578058752)? After it came out, there was some talk about what was going on with her foot, and some wondered if this was a mistake. It wasn't. This thread ([mainly this image](https://i.imgur.com/6lZMIAB.jpg)) clears the whole thing up.


Deck of the Day
===============


1. [TGNYN's Blue-Black Eldrazi](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/mtgo-standings/competitive-standard-constructed-league-2017-02-21)

And now for something completely different. *Magic Online* player TGNYN went 5-0 with this Blue-Black (and colorless) Eldrazi deck in a Standard Competitive League, pairing removal, disruption, and Eldrazi to form one monster of a deck.


What's most interesting is the blue, which, besides some sideboard cards, is here almost exclusively for [Baral's Expertise](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Baral%27s+Expertise), a powerful card that only pops up now and then. But when it does, it always signals something gross. In this case, casting [Baral's Expertise](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Baral%27s+Expertise) can let you immediately drop a [Thought-Knot Seer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thought-Knot+Seer), allowing you to snag one of the cards you just bounced. Between that and [Transgress the Mind](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Transgress+the+Mind), it can be difficult for your opponent to put together a coherent game plan, what with the Eldrazi always reaching into your brain, and all.
