 Working in R&D since '95, Mark became Magic head designer in '03. His hobbies: spending time with family, writing about Magic in all mediums, and creating short bios. 






Welcome to my second *Double Masters* preview week. Last week, I talked about the design of the set. This week I decided to share some stories about how cards in the set were originally designed. (I did a similar article for *Core Set 2021* that got a very positive response, so I thought I'd do it again.) Also, before my article is done, I'll share two new preview cards for *Double Masters*. That said, on with the stories.


**This story coming July 30.**


Editor's note: Something should be here, but it's not ready for you yet. Check back on July 30 for more *Double Masters* content.


**Karn Liberated**


![Karn Liberated](https://media.wizards.com/2020/2xm/en_1R5JSIBejz.png)


This story starts back in 1996. Michael Ryan and I were putting together a story to pitch to the *Magic* brand team to convince them to start a *Magic* story that would get woven into the sets. (This would become the Weatherlight Saga.) To do that, we had to make a cast of characters. It was important to us to make characters that covered the entire color pie. One of the things that meant was we needed an artifact creature. I was partial to a Golem, so I convinced Michael to make him one. Michael and I liked the idea that he would fit the "gentle giant" archetype, someone that looked like they could be threatening but were in fact very sweet on the inside.


During *Tempest*, to help create a singular voice and feel for each character in flavor text, we divvied up characters by writer. I ended up with Karn (and Ertai), meaning that for the first year, I wrote all of Karn's flavor text. While I liked all the characters Michael and I made, I always had a soft spot for Karn.


Flash forward a number of years. We're working on the *Scars of Mirrodin* block. In the story, Karn gets captured by the Phyrexians (he was responsible for accidentally bringing them to Mirrodin) and things are looking pretty bad for him. I think we had started design on *New Phyrexia*, and I walked over to talk with Brady Dommermuth, then the creative director. We were going to have a Karn card in the set, and I was trying to get a sense of what it would look like.


Brady said to me that they were trying to figure out how the story ends. Either Karn gets totally corrupted by the Phyrexians and becomes the Father of Machines, a legendary creature, or he breaks free and gets printed as a planeswalker card. My response: "We were really hoping he could be a planeswalker card." I'm not sure how much my input swayed the story, but I had to look out for my not-so-little Golem.


I believe the design of the card itself started with the ultimate. We wanted an ultimate that really captured the flavor of Karn liberating himself from the Phyrexians. I don't remember who pitched the idea of the game restarting, but we realized when we heard it that that was the way we had to go. The other two abilities were designed to set up the ultimate. The exile of a permanent was the stronger ability and had a bigger impact on the board, so we made that the minus loyalty ability. I think we talked about the first effect being a milling effect but decided the exiling from hand was better.


**Magus of the Will**


![Magus of the Will](https://media.wizards.com/2020/2xm/en_15MDLP1Zt6.png)


This story begins in *Time Spiral* design. We were very focused on nostalgic designs, so we were looking for cool ways to make new cards that harkened back to old cards. One of the ideas we came up with was to take old, popular powerful artifacts and print their abilities on creatures. The reason this was cool was threefold. One, creatures are more vulnerable than artifacts, so it would allow us to print the creatures at the same converted mana cost as the artifact (shifting one or more of the generic mana to colored). We then chose a power and toughness that worked with that mana cost. Two, this would allow us to reprint artifact effects of artifacts we couldn't reprint, such as cards on the Reserved List. Three, when you change card types, you get to create new interactions with the effects. There would be things you could do with the Maguses that you could never do with the original artifacts.


There was much time spent finding the right five artifacts to match to a cycle of creatures. As the artifacts we were referencing were all colorless, we had to match them up properly with each of the five colors. As with many cycles, the early choices were easy and then it got more difficult. I think we spent numerous hours trying to find the best choice for the black Magus. We named them so each card would give a nod to the artifact the creature was redoing.


Here are the five cards we made:


* [![126273](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&multiverseid=126273)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=126273)
* [![126279](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&multiverseid=126279)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=126279)
* [![126298](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&multiverseid=126298)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=126298)
* [![126278](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&multiverseid=126278)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=126278)
* [![126287](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&multiverseid=126287)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=126287)

[Magus of the Disk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Magus+of+the+Disk) was a redo of [Nevinyrral's Disk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=37) from *Alpha*. [Magus of the Jar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Magus+of+the+Jar) was a redo of [Memory Jar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=8841) from *Urza's Legacy*. [Magus of the Mirror](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Magus+of+the+Mirror) was a redo of [Mirror Universe](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=1414) from *Legends*. [Magus of the Scroll](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Magus+of+the+Scroll) was a redo of [Cursed Scroll](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=4601) from *Tempest*. [Magus of the Candelabra](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Magus+of+the+Candelabra) was a redo of [Candelabra of Tawnos](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=999) from *Antiquities*.


We had so much fun making the *Time Spiral* cycle, we decided to do it again in the very next set, *Planar Chaos*, but instead of doing artifacts, this time we did lands. As they didn't have a mana cost, it allowed us to make each creature whatever cost and size served the effect best. Like the artifacts, we had to match up lands to each of the five colors. This time, at least, black was easy. I think green was the troublesome one this time.


Here they are:


* [![134741](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&multiverseid=134741)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=134741)

* [![130719](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&multiverseid=130719)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=130719)
* [![124507](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&multiverseid=124507)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=124507)
* [![131008](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&multiverseid=131008)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=131008)

[Magus of the Tabernacle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Magus+of+the+Tabernacle) was a redo of [The Tabernacle at Pendrell Vale](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=1690) from *Legends*. [Magus of the Bazaar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Magus+of+the+Bazaar) was a redo of [Bazaar of Baghdad](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=984) from *Arabian Nights*. [Magus of the Coffers](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Magus+of+the+Coffers) is a redo of [Cabal Coffers](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=29896) from *Torment*. [Magus of the Arena](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Magus+of+the+Arena) is a redo of [Arena](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=97042), a book promo card from way back in the day. (The first *Magic* novels came with a coupon in the book you could send in for a promo card.) [Magus of the Library](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Magus+of+the+Library) was a redo of [Library of Alexandria](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=990) from *Arabian Nights*. (I'll admit that this was an odd fit.)


Two points make a line, so it was obvious *Future Sight* had to finish this block cycle. We had done artifacts and lands, so that meant there was only one permanent type remaining, enchantments. (Planeswalkers would come into existence the very next set but weren't a thing yet.) Enchantments were easier in some ways and more difficult in others. For instance, they were already colored, so it was clear what color each enchantment effect belonged to, but because they already had a colored mana cost, we felt obliged to keep them exact, which added a component that we couldn't change and had to design around.


Here's what we made:


* [![136159](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&multiverseid=136159)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=136159)
* [![136152](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&multiverseid=136152)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=136152)
* [![136148](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&multiverseid=136148)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=136148)
* [![136033](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&multiverseid=136033)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=136033)
* [![136051](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&multiverseid=136051)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=136051)

[Magus of the Moat](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Magus+of+the+Moat) was a redo of [Moat](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=1626) from *Legends*. [Magus of the Future](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Magus+of+the+Future) was a redo of [Future Sight](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=39628) from *Onslaught*. (And yes, we enjoyed the fact that we were doing a redo of [Future Sight](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=39628) in *Future Sight*.) [Magus of the Abyss](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Magus+of+the+Abyss) was a redo of [The Abyss](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=1460) from *Legends*. [Magus of the Moon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Magus+of+the+Moon) was a redo of [Blood Moon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=1784) from *The Dark*. [Magus of the Vineyard](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Magus+of+the+Vineyard) was a redo of [Eladamri's Vineyard](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eladamri%27s+Vineyard) from *Tempest*.


And with that, we thought we were done. Three cycles of the three permanent types stretched across the three sets of the block. Take a bow.


Our story picks up again in the design of *Commander 2015*. Someone on the team (I wasn't on the team, so I don't know who) said, "Wait a minute, we did Maguses for all the permanent types, save planeswalker. What about the non-permanent card types?"


So, they designed this card:


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&multiverseid=405293)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=405293)
[Magus of the Wheel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Magus+of+the+Wheel) is a redo of [Wheel of Fortune](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=231) from *Alpha*. It was the redo of a sorcery. When the card was released, the players asked about the rest of the cycle. Maguses always come in cycles. Where are the white, blue, black, and green Maguses of sorceries? Each year, the Commander set would bring one more.


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Magus+of+the+Will)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Magus+of+the+Will)[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Magus+of+the+Mind)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Magus+of+the+Mind)[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Magus+of+the+Balance)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Magus+of+the+Balance)
[Magus of the Will](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Magus+of+the+Will) is a redo of [Yawgmoth's Will](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=5629) from *Urza's Saga*. [Magus of the Mind](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Magus+of+the+Mind) is a redo of [Mind's Desire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=46424) from *Scourge*. [Magus of the Balance](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Magus+of+the+Balance) is a redo of [Balance](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=234) from *Alpha*. They appeared in *Commander 2016*, *Commander 2017*, and *Commander 2018*, respectively. *Commander 2019* was supposed to have the final card in the cycle, the green Magus, but that card got pushed off to another product, which will be explained when it finally comes out.


When the green Magus gets released, I can finally start to field the questions about when we're doing the instant Magus cycle.


**This story coming July 29.**


Editor's note: Something should be here, but it's not ready for you yet. Check back on July 29 for more *Double Masters* content.


**Treasure Mage**


![Treasure Mage](https://media.wizards.com/2020/2xm/en_vD25FSg0l0.png)


This story starts back in the design of *Fifth Dawn*. One of the themes we'd put into the set was something we called cogs. Cogs were artifacts that had a converted mana cost of 1 or less and had small effects. We then made a number of cards in the set which interacted with the cogs to help you build a deck around them. One such card was designed by Aaron Forsythe:


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&multiverseid=50163)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=50163)
Aaron enjoys tutoring and "enters the battlefield" effects on creatures, so he combined them to make a cog-friendly Wizard. [Trinket Mage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Trinket+Mage) got printed and has seen play in numerous formats. (Having a lot of powerful artifacts with a converted mana cost of 1 or less in older formats didn't hurt.)


Flash forward a number of years to *Mirrodin Besieged*. We're back on Mirrodin, so we decided to make a mirror of [Trinket Mage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Trinket+Mage) called [Treasure Mage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treasure+Mage). Instead of searching for a small artifact (one with a converted mana cost of 1 or less), it looks for a large artifact (one that has a converted mana cost of 6 or more). It was also a 2/2 for 2U, and we called it [Treasure Mage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treasure+Mage) to have a similar feel.


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&multiverseid=423715)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=423715)[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Tribute+Mage)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tribute+Mage)
While technically the story is done on [Treasure Mage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treasure+Mage)'s design, there's still a little more story to tell. The *Aether Revolt* design team made [Trophy Mage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Trophy+Mage), which tutors for an artifact with a converted mana cost of exactly 3. It's also a 2/2 for 2U with a T word in its name. *Modern Horizons* then made [Tribute Mage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tribute+Mage), which tutors for an artifact with a converted mana cost of exactly 2.


All of this leaves artifacts of converted mana costs 4 or 5 unaccounted for, but I have faith that one day, provided we don't run out of T words, we'll see this—I'm not sure what to call it as "cycle" seems a little off—completed.
