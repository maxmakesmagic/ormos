Nagoya's convenient location in the heart of the country affords easy access to travel destinations throughout Japan. The Shinkansen express train links Nagoya with Tokyo, Osaka, Kyoto and other major cities. The Nagoya International Airport offers direct flights to many of the world's major cities; its numerous domestic flight destinations are a gateway to Japan. With a population of about 2.15 million living within the city's 326 square kilometers, comfortable living conditions prevail. Reliable and safe public transportation, including subways and extensive bus lines, put many of the city's attractions within easy reach. The city is known for its broad avenues; tree-lined boulevards make strolling around one of the simple pleasures of this city. Popular attractions include Nagoya Castle, originally built in 1612 and housing a museum with many interactive exhibits, and Atsuta-jinja Shrine, which is home to the sword Kusunagi-no-tsurugi, one of the Three Imperial Regalia of Japan. 

 Nagoya has a long **Magic** history, having hosted multiple Grand Prix and Pro Tour events. Perhaps most well-known as the city where Shu Komuro won the last-ever Rochester Draft at Pro Tour Nagoya 2005, Nagoya is called home by some of Japan's most noted **Magic** luminaries, including Jin "The Last Emperor" Okamoto, Worlds 2006 Finalist Ryō Ogura, and one-time National Champion Kotaro Ōtsuka. Come join us in Nagoya once more for all the fun and excitement Grand Prix are famous for.

**Tournament Structure** 


* Modified Swiss-style (50-minute rounds).
* Day One will consist of a maximum of 9 Swiss rounds. Day Two will consist of 6 Swiss rounds and the Top 8 single-elimination finals.
* If 799 or less players register for the event, all players with an X-2-0 record (or better) or the top 64 players – whichever is greater – advance to the second day of competition for prizes and invitations.
* If 800 or more players register for the event, all players with an X-2-0 record (or better) or the top 128 players – whichever is greater – advance to the second day of competition for prizes and invitations.
* The Top 8 players after the final Swiss round on Day Two will advance to the Top 8 single-elimination playoff.
* Top 8 playoff matches will be best 2 of 3.
* Top 8 playoff matches will have no time limit. (Players are still expected to play at a normal pace and complete playoff matches in a reasonable amount of time.)
* The Top 8 players will be seated randomly at the draft table immediately prior to drafting. The Top 8 bracket will be determined using this random seating.
* Standings after the Swiss rounds will be used to determine final order in the standings for losing players in the quarterfinal and semifinal playoff rounds.
* For the first game of each match in the Top 8, the player that finished higher in the Swiss rounds chooses either to play first or to play second. For subsequent games in each Top 8 match, the usual Play/Draw rule applies (loser of the previous game decides whether to play first in the next game).
