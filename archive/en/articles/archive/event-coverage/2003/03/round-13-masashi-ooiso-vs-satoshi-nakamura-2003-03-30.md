### Game 1

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gpkyo03/a921.jpg)Nakamura escaped mana difficulties early with [Wirewood Elf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wirewood+Elf) helping him cycle a [Krosan Tusker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Krosan+Tusker). That all meant he had a [Barkhide Mauler](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Barkhide+Mauler) on the table by turn four. Ooiso had just a [Glory Seeker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glory+Seeker), with nothing to add on his third turn. He came back with [Dive Bomber](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dive+Bomber) and took four from the Mauler. Nakamura set up his draw step with [Sage Aven](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sage+Aven).

Ooiso dropped [Aven Soulgazer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aven+Soulgazer), setting up a huge [Aven Brigadier](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aven+Brigadier) on the following turn. Nakamura threw a wrench in the works with [Crookclaw Elder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crookclaw+Elder). Ooiso dispatched it with [Solar Blast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Solar+Blast), and when Nakamura tapped it and the Sage to draw a card, Ooiso hit for five in the air. Nakamura untapped and served for four on the ground. Ooiso cycled [Sunfire Balm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sunfire+Balm) to spare himself a point. Nakamura further delayed the Brigadier with a [Keeneye Aven](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Keeneye+Aven) and a morph besides.

Ooiso baited him, swinging in with the Soulgazer. Nakamura took it, double blocking and losing both when Ooiso showed him [Pinpoint Avalanche](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pinpoint+Avalanche). Nakamura came back strong. [Essence Fracture](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Essence+Fracture) left Ooiso with just his [Glory Seeker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glory+Seeker). After swinging in for four with the Mauler, Nakamura made a morph and handed it back. Ooiso thought, then tapped out for Soulgazer and [Battlefield Medic](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Battlefield+Medic).

Nakamura swung in with morph and Mauler. Ooiso put his [Glory Seeker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glory+Seeker) in the way of the morph. It was [Primal Whisperer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Primal+Whisperer), a 4/4 thanks to Nakamura's other morph. Ooiso fell to five. But he wasn't out yet. He added [Dive Bomber](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dive+Bomber) and [Liege of the Axe](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Liege+of+the+Axe) to his team. Nakamura swung in again. Soulgazer and Medic blocked the Mauler, Bomber and Liege blocked the Whisperer. Nakamura split the Mauler's damage three-one, and aimed to kill the [Dive Bomber](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dive+Bomber) with the Whisperer. Ooiso tried to rescue the Soulgazer with the Medic, but Nakamura unmorphed [Venomspout Brackus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Venomspout+Brackus) and shot it down. Then he played his masterstroke: [Chain of Vapor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chain+of+Vapor). He rescued both is Mauler and Whisperer.

That gave Ooiso a little time, at least. He used it well. [Aven Brigadier](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aven+Brigadier) showed up, and then another [Liege of the Axe](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Liege+of+the+Axe) and a Morph. Still, Nakamura found [Glintwing Invoker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glintwing+Invoker), and forced the Brigadier to chump block. It was then that Ooiso topdecked [Akroma, Angel of Wrath](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Akroma%2C+Angel+of+Wrath). Nakamura helped matters by forgetting that Akroma has first strike, costing him his [Glintwing Invoker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glintwing+Invoker). When he didn't draw [Choking Tethers](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Choking+Tethers), the game was Ooiso's.

Ooiso 1 – Nakamura 0

### Game 2

Nakamura's start for Game 2 was gangbusters. First [Wirewood Elf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wirewood+Elf), then [Keeneye Aven](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Keeneye+Aven) and [Barkhide Mauler](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Barkhide+Mauler). Ooiso's was a sluggish [Wingbeat Warrior](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wingbeat+Warrior) and [Dive Bomber](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dive+Bomber). He found himself at twelve quickly. He played [Aven Soulgazer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aven+Soulgazer) and held the fort.

Nakamura showed him [Essence Fracture](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Essence+Fracture). After trading with a morph he was at five and facing four creatures with an empty board. They moved to Game 3.

Ooiso 1 – Nakamura 1

### Game 3

In Game 3, it was Ooiso's turn to give a master class in tempo, after Nakamura mulled to six, pitching a hand of all land. He started with [Wingbeat Warrior](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wingbeat+Warrior) and [Dive Bomber](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dive+Bomber) while Nakamura merely cycled [Krosan Tusker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Krosan+Tusker). He added a morph and was quickly at fourteen. Ooiso played a morph of his own, and declined to block Nakamura's attack. Nakamura hoped that [Barkhide Mauler](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Barkhide+Mauler) would buy him time to get some flying defense.

Ooiso cracked down with [Pinpoint Avalanche](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pinpoint+Avalanche), leaving Nakamura at eight. Nakamura hoped [Crookclaw Elder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crookclaw+Elder) would do the job. Ooiso dropped [Daru Encampment](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Daru+Encampment) and served. Nakamura lined up the morphs and put his Elder on the [Dive Bomber](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dive+Bomber). Ooiso unmorphed [Liege of the Axe](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Liege+of+the+Axe) and dealt three with the Warrior. Nakamura drew, and laid his hand on the table: All lands.

**Final Result:** Masashi Ooiso defeats Satoshi Nakamura 2-1
