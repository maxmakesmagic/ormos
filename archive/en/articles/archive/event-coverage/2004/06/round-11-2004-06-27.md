Jelger Wiegersma vs. Yann Hamon
-------------------------------


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gpzur04/fm9_1.jpg)Two big names in the European Circuit. Yann sneaked into the second day in 63rd place. Even if they are a bit out of the running (at 21 points) we can't resist a peek at their decks.


### Game 1


Jelger showed his colors with a turn one Aether Vial, while Hamon played [Forest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest) and [Mountain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mountain). The next turn saw another Vial, [Chromatic Sphere](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chromatic+Sphere) and double [Frogmite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Frogmite).


Hamon shook his head and took a hit. At four mana he unleashed [Granulate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Granulate). Wiegersma slumped in his chair. He played a Vial-powered [Disciple of the Vault](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Disciple+of+the+Vault) and buried all his nonland-artifact permanents.


Still, Hamon fell to nine and the Dutch played [Arcbound Ravager](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arcbound+Ravager). Things weren't looking up for the French. At five mana he dumped [Arc-Slogger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arc-Slogger) but that gave Wiegersma one final opening. He played [Cranial Plating](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cranial+Plating).


Jelger: "I think that's enough."  

Yann: "Yes."


Jelger 1-0 Yann.


Jelger: "I think if I played it right I could have killed you three turns earlier."  

Yann: "Really?"  

Jelger: "Yes, the turn before you played [Granulate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Granulate)."


### Game 2


Again Jelger had a turn one Vial but this time it didn't help him at all. An [Oxidize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oxidize) and [Tel-Jilad Justice](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tel-Jilad+Justice) later he had no permanents. A couple of [Blinkmoth Nexus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blinkmoth+Nexus) allowed him to breath again, powering out [Frogmite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Frogmite).


But the French was not about to give up control of the table. He played [Molder Slug](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Molder+Slug). The Dutch thought for a while and decided on [Arcbound Ravager](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arcbound+Ravager). [Viridian Shaman](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Viridian+Shaman) took care of that.


On his upkeep he was back to two lands, and could do little more than shake his head. Silently Yann Hamon set about finishing the game. A [Terror](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Terror) took out the [Molder Slug](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Molder+Slug) but a turn later Jelger Wiegersma shrugged and again reached for his sideboard.


Jelger 1-1 Yann.


### Game 3


This time Jelger tried a turn one [Arcbound Worker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arcbound+Worker). [Oxidize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oxidize) took it away. Then another [Oxidize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oxidize) took his [Great Furnace](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Great+Furnace) away. Thankfully for the Dutch he had Aether Vial and [Chromatic Sphere](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chromatic+Sphere) out, because otherwise he would again have nothing but lands in play.


A THIRD [Oxidize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oxidize) took the Vial away before it could dump anything bigger than [Disciple of the Vault](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Disciple+of+the+Vault) into play. While Yann had no shortage of removal (next using a [Fireball](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fireball) to kill the Disciple) he couldn't find his third land.


Slowly Jelger extended his game. Worker, [Frogmite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Frogmite). Another [Fireball](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fireball) took out the Worker. The Dutch played [Thoughtcast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtcast) before the French finally found his third land. The FOURTH [Oxidize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oxidize) ate up Jelger's [Vault of Whispers](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vault+of+Whispers).


On and on the [Frogmite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Frogmite) attacked alone. Yann was at eleven. Jelger risked [Arcbound Ravager](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arcbound+Ravager) and Yann Hamon hit his fourth land.


Four mana = [Granulate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Granulate).


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gpzur04/fm9_2.jpg)When the dust cleared Jelger had one 4/4 Nexus as his only weapon. Not too shabby. Hamon fell to seven. He untapped and drew his card. Jelger tried the Nexus attack again... Yann had no answer.


He fell to three. His next card didn't save him.


Final result:  

Jelger 2-1 Yann.
