Team Philippines surprised the world by placing in the Top 8 of the first ever World *Magic* Cup. This meant that Asia Pacific had two shots to become the World *Magic* Cup Champions. Even though it was Team Chinese Taipei who got there in the end, this proved to the world that the Filipinos were not be underestimated.

*Team Philippines - World* Magic *Cup 2012 Top 8: (from left to right) Zax Ozaki, Jeremy Bryan Domocmat, Andrew Cantillana, and Gerald Camangon (Captain).* 



The captain this year was Jason Ascalon, leading his teammates to Nice. They did not achieve as good a result as they hoped but all of them had a great time in Nice. "We visited the French Riveria, and also the Christmas Carnival next to the Ferris Wheel. The weather was great compared to what we experienced in Paris and it was a great trip regardless of our placing."

The community in the Philippines is huge and to even win a World *Magic* Cup Qualifier was a feat in itself. I was told that even the Pro Tour Qualifiers that are a 4-hour drive from Manila would hit 150 â€“ 200 attendees and Grand Prix Trials in Manila could balloon to 300 to 400 players. It was no surprise that when you throw in a Promo [Geist of Saint Traft](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Geist+of+Saint+Traft), the World *Magic* Cup Qualifiers become the biggest in the world.

"There are a lot of good players in the Philippines, we just can't travel as much. Now that the World *Magic* Cup has just concluded, we're glad that we have Grand Prix Manila to look forward to!"


As we speak, the locals are putting up a good fight against foreign resistance. Makihito Mihara, Ivan Floch, Christian Calcano, Raymond and a bunch of local players are at the perfect 7-0, already locked up for Day 2. We'll bring you more updates as the day draws to a close!
