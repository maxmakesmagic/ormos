Several early **Magic** sets had multiple alternate art pieces for the same card. One such set was *Alliances*, in which the card [Phyrexian Boon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phyrexian+Boon) was slated to get two collectible pieces of art. 

Mark Tedin elected to illustrate the two [Phyrexian Boon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phyrexian+Boon) pieces as one continuous mural. Check it out:

*Art by Mark Tedin*You can see how it was split up on the two cards:

The card [Serra's Boon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Serra%27s+Boon) from *Planar Chaos*, as Matt Cavotta [reported earlier](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/daily/mc78), contains a particularly close art homage to the left half of Tedin's [Phyrexian Boon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phyrexian+Boon) art.
