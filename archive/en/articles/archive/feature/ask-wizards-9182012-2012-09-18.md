**Q:** Can I get Vraska in the Golgari Guild Prerelease Pack at the *Return to Ravnica* Prerelease?


—Fred


**A:** From **Trick Jarrett**, Editor-in-Chief DailyMTG.com


Choosing Golgari at your prerelease will not enhance your chances of getting Vraska. You can still get a mythic rare in your guild prerelease pack but it is the leader for that guild. Otherwise it will be a rare in the guild's colors (though possibly not guild affiliated.)


Come back on Monday when we have Tim Willoughby with the Prerelease Primer for *Return to Ravnica* to find out more about this set’s prerelease!
