 I haven't seen a [Restore Balance](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Restore+Balance) cast since the last time I was in Amsterdam, at the [Pro Tour in 2010](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/magazine/article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/eventcoverage/ptams10/welcome). It's not the most common spell to cascade into (it is rare, after all), but the effect it has is undeniably powerful. 

[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Restore+Balance)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Restore+Balance) What this deck is trying to do is use [Demonic Dread](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Demonic+Dread) or [Violent Outburst](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Violent+Outburst) to cast the aforementioned [Restore Balance](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Restore+Balance), and respond to it by sacrificing some or all of its lands to [Greater Gargadon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Greater+Gargadon). That wipes the board of all creatures and lands, with some amount of hand disruption depending on the game. After the dust settles, Gargadon or [Nihilith](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nihilith) come off suspend to finish the job, aided by a Keyrune from time to time. 

 The deck is operating under some interesting restrictions, because in order to hit [Restore Balance](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Restore+Balance) it cannot play any card that costs less than three. [Search for Tomorrow](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Search+for+Tomorrow) cheats that by being a one-drop that costs three, and all of the cycling creatures do the same. All this deck does is Balance the scales, and every card in the deck is aimed toward achieving that goal. 

 That casting cost restriction applies to the sideboard as well, where [Ingot Chewer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ingot+Chewer)s and Leylines have a similar [Cheatyface](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cheatyface) feel. [Slaughter Games](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Slaughter+Games) is the only sideboard card that costs what it costs, and helps fight against other combo decks like [Scapeshift](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scapeshift). 

 If you want a deck that feels (and plays) dramatically different from everything else that's going on, this can certainly restore your interest in Modern. All it's trying to do is [Armageddon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Armageddon), [Wrath of God](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wrath+of+God), and [Mind Twist](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mind+Twist) both players, and who doesn't want to cast that trio of powerhouses?
