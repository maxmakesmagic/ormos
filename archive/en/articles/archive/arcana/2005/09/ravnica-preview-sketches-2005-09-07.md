You've only seen four *Ravnica: City of Guilds* preview cards this week, and already we're clamoring to show you their cool full-size art and the sketches that went into their creation.

On Monday you saw **[Agrus Kos, Wojek Veteran](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/feature/283)**, a heroic investigator from the red-white Boros Legion. Here's the art behind it, by Donato Giancola.

Also on Monday you saw **[Selesnya Guildmage](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/daily/mr192)**, a preview of the new "hybrid" mana costs from the green-white Selesnya Conclave guild. Here's the art behind it, by Mark Zug.

Last but not least, today's preview is of **[Sunhome, Fortress of the Legion](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/daily/zm9)**, a mighty nonbasic land that blesses your Boros or any other troops with double strike. Here's its art by Martina Pilcerova.

Expect more *Ravnica* card and art previews over the next two and a half weeks. Of course, you'll love the art of the special *Ravnica: City of Guilds* 
**[prerelease card](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=events/magic/prereleases)** -- but you'll have to be a bit patient for that.
