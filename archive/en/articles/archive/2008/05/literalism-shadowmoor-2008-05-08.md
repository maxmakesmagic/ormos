Most cards in **Magic** have names that describe what's happening on the card. [Noggin Whack](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Noggin+Whack) shows a kithkin getting whacked in the noggin. Simple. Direct. To the point. And in this case, hilarious.


Some cards, though, take an extra detour on the way. Take [Illuminated Folio](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Illuminated+Folio) for example:



![Illuminated Folio](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Illuminated+Folio)

The traditional meaning of an "illuminated folio" would be a book with intricate illustrations throughout the margins and elaborating the capital letters. *This* folio, however, is "illuminated" in the sense of being "lit-up by a bright light".

Or consider the case of [Ghastly Discovery](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ghastly+Discovery).



![Ghastly Discovery](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Ghastly+Discovery)

Normally, this would mean a discovery that was terrifying. And that might be, but in this case, it's also a discovery made by some kind of ghostly creatures. In other words, it's a discovery made by ghasts. A ghast-ly discovery.

Finally, let's take a look at [Disturbing Plot](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Disturbing+Plot):



![Disturbing Plot](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Disturbing+Plot)

Does this card portray a worrying scheme? No, it does not. In fact, it shows two people digging up a grave. "Disturbing, " in other words, a burial "plot."

We'd love to be able to tell you that the other three monocolored common conspire cards follow this pattern. And we're about 60% convinced that [Mine Excavation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mine+Excavation) shows two creatures shouting "Mine!" about their recent excavation. And [Burn Trail](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Burn+Trail) is normally a noun (a trail that has been burned), but it's being used here as a verb (burning a trail), but those are almost the same meaning. And sadly, no matter how we parse it, [Gleeful Sabotage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gleeful+Sabotage) just portrays some sabotage being done gleefully. So it's not a whole cycle. It's still neat, though.
