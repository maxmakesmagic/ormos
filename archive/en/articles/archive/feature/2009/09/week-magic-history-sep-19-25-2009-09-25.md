### September 19-25: Prerelease Week!


We're not saying this just to encourage you to go to the *Zendikar* prerelease (although it *is* [this weekend](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/magazine/article.aspx?x=mtgcom/events/prereleases), you know). But just look at how many prereleases have taken place over this weekend in September!


### September 21, 1996: *Mirage* Prerelease


### September 25, 1999: *Mercadian Masques* Prerelease


### September 23, 2000: *Invasion* Prerelease


### September 22, 2001: *Odyssey* Prerelease


### September 20, 2003: *Mirrodin* Prerelease


### September 19, 2004: *Champions of Kamigawa* Prerelease


### September 24, 2005: *Ravnica: City of Guilds* Prerelease


### September 23, 2006: *Time Spiral* Prerelease


So this is essentially the week where a huge chunk of **Magic** was seen for the first time. Surely you can forgive us for mentioning the [*Zendikar* Prerelease](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/magazine/article.aspx?x=mtgcom/events/prereleases) this weekend just one more time?
