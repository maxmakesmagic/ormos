Kaya and Tibalt are back and more formidable than ever. But we're also meeting two new Planeswalkers in [Tyvar Kell](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/feature/creating-tyvar-kell-2020-12-14) and [Niko Aris](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/feature/creating-niko-aris-2020-12-14). You can meet both characters today by clicking on their names.
