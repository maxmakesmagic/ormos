When Gavin Verhey was eleven, he wanted a job making Magic cards. Ten years later, his dream was realized as his combined success as a professional player, deck builder, and writer brought him into Wizards R&D during 2011. He's been writing Magic articles since 2005 and has no plans to stop.

Welcome to Jeskai Week!


This is the second stop on our worldwide tour around the clans of Tarkir. Buckle up, keep your hands inside the vehicle at all times, and please, don't pet the djinns or efreets. Stick to the path, Red Riding Hood.



 Now, if you'll notice, we already took [one look at Jeskai](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/rc/way-jeskai-2014-09-16) when *Khans of Tarkir* first came out, and in the meantime, a couple of Jeskai decks have risen to be top Standard competitors. So, what's left to do with Jeskai?

Well, there are still plenty of interesting ways to take a Jeskai deck. Today, we're going to take a look at yet another way you can build Jeskai: tokens-centric! Let's take a look at our initial list, courtesy of Lex Taylor:

The Battle Plan
===============


Normally with Jeskai, you'd expect to see some [Mantis Rider](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mantis+Rider)s zooming in, or a flurry of burn spells to end the game—but not quite as much with this kind of deck.


It's still aggressive, but in this strategy, you "go wide"—that is, build up a board presence—with tokens, then enhance all of those tokens to make them far more effective than they would be otherwise.


For example, let's look at [Hordeling Outburst](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hordeling+Outburst). Three mana for 3 power isn't all that exciting in Constructed. But if suddenly there's a [Dictate of Heliod](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dictate+of+Heliod) on the table, you just generated 9 power for three mana. Suddenly you have a three-headed, six-legged, scary conglomerate of creatures! The tokens do a lot more for you in this regard than casting a single individual creature could, since they create a number of creatures that all get pumped by your enchantments.


This is an aggressive deck that can generate a ton of power out of nowhere, with even as much as a single end-step [Raise the Alarm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Raise+the+Alarm) letting you crack in for a ton of damage. This decklist is already a pretty good interpretation of a tokens deck, so it's just going to be a matter of tightening up around the edges and focusing on what fits best.


Let's get started, shall we?


Deck Breakdown
==============


It's time to go through the deck card by card and see which cards fit, and which ones don't quite ascend into the deck.



**Raise the Alarm**




[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Raise the Alarm)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Raise the Alarm)

[Raise the Alarm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Raise+the+Alarm) is a staple for a deck like this one. It's a two-drop, so it can come down early, and it even has the benefit of being an instant, so you can ambush attackers or play around an [End Hostilities](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=End+Hostilities). Having cheap, early token makers are important where you can find them, and this is one I definitely want to keep all four of.






**Nyx-Fleece Ram**




[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Nyx-Fleece Ram)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nyx-Fleece Ram)

The Ram is a great tool against more aggressive decks. However, here, I'm not sure it's such a great main-deck fit. What is it accomplishing for us? It's neat that it can attack once given benefits from our global pumping effects, but in a deck that aims to be aggressive like this one, I'd rather have something that helps kill our opponents quickly.


To that end, I do think it's important what we add is also a two-drop—this deck is a little lacking for two-drops (which is the gap [Nyx-Fleece Ram](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nyx-Fleece+Ram) was trying to fill) and curving out early is important for a deck that wants to be aggressive. I want about five or six more two-drops, and this is a good opportunity to fill up on them.


The first one I'd like to add is [Akroan Hoplite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Akroan+Hoplite). This card fits marvelously into a tokens strategy. On its own, it attacks as a 2/2—nothing too special there. But with some tokens, it quickly grows to smash in for a lot more damage. If you curve this into a [Hordeling Outburst](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hordeling+Outburst) or [Goblin Rabblemaster](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Rabblemaster), it is attacking for 5 damage on turn four! (Plus, if it's a Rabblemaster, you get in for 3 damage with it on turn three.) I'll take four copies of the Hoplite.


With the last spot remaining, a good fit for this deck is [Seeker of the Way](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seeker+of+the+Way). This new Jeskai creature is going to usually be attacking as 3/3 for two with lifelink in this deck—and it can get even larger without too much effort. There's not quite enough room for more than two in this deck, but I'm happy having two.
