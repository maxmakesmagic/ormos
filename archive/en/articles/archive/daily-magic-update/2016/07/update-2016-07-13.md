The Daily *Magic* Update is a roundup of everything *Magic* you should know on July 13, 2016. Today's Update is brought to you by brewers everywhere. You're the real heroes of preview season.


Today's Must
============


1. [Tons of *Eldritch Moon* Modern Deck Updates](http://www.starcitygames.com/article/33272_Tons-Of-Eldritch-Moon-Modern-Deck-Updates.html) | StarCityGames.com | Michael Majors

The title says it all—Michael Majors, currently [among the leaders for Draft Master for the World Championship](#7)—checks out the impact *Eldritch Moon*, and specifically emerge, can make in Modern. And the article delivers as well; Majors has eight distinct decks updated with powerful emerge cards. [Mulldrifter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mulldrifter) even makes a cameo!


After That, Read, Watch, or Listen to These
===========================================


1. [Two Takes on White-Blue in the New Standard](http://www.channelfireball.com/articles/two-takes-on-whiteblue-in-the-new-standard/) | ChannelFireball | Frank Karsten

Karsten goes deep on two builds of white-blue decks for *Eldritch Moon* Standard, and this time that's not a pun on [Elder Deep-Fiend](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elder+Deep-Fiend) (though there will be plenty of those). Instead, he brews with [Lone Rider](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lone+Rider) on one hand and a bunch of flash creatures on the other. But both, secretly, are [Spell Queller](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spell+Queller) decks. Shh. Don't tell anyone I told you that.


1. [*Eldritch Moon* Set Review](https://www.rocketjump.com/listen/eldritch-moon-set-review-113) | The Command Zone | Jimmy Wong and Josh Lee Kwai

Set reviews, am I right?


I guess I should say more than that. This one's twist is the focus on Commander. Is [Thalia, Heretic Cathar](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thalia%2C+Heretic+Cathar) meant for Commander greatness? What about [Gisa and Geralf](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gisa+and+Geralf)? How likely are you to meld, well, anything in Commander? Josh and Jimmy have the answers.


1. [Expanding the Oath](http://magic.tcgplayer.com/db/article.asp?ID=13386&writer=Conley+Woods&articledate=7-13-2016) | TCGPlayer | Conley Woods

Someone had to try it.


[Call the Gatewatch](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Call+the+Gatewatch) is both super flavorful and incredibly powerful—if you can get it to work. Conley Woods takes a run at doing just that, first pairing them with Dragons, and then brewing a deck that has 18 planeswalkers and 11 Oaths, plus [Languish](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Languish) and [Deploy the Gatewatch](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deploy+the+Gatewatch). And that's it. That's the deck. 18 freakin' planeswalkers. If you ever pull this off at an FNM, I guarantee people will be crowding around your table to see it happen.


1. [Vintage Super League, Week 7](https://www.youtube.com/watch?list=PL3rP64NRtmbhGb6I6vTslqQKoLpfnrKry&v=dZ1D6PRQeE4)

I had my days all mixed up this week and simply forgot that yesterday was a Tuesday, which meant Vintage Super League! So if you missed it and you blame me, first, I hope we can still be friends. Second, you can still catch it on YouTube! Are we friends again?

What People Are Talking About

> A review of player standings revealed that you are one of the frontrunners to compete in the 2016 World Championship! [#Hype](https://twitter.com/hashtag/Hype?src=hash) [#Onetimedealer](https://twitter.com/hashtag/Onetimedealer?src=hash)

It's that time of year. The races for the World Championship are coming down to the wire, and pros who have a shot at something are being notified. You can see the races in play on our [Premier Event Statistics](http://magic.wizards.com/node/252491) page. Several of the races are very close. Grand Prix Master looks like it might come down to the final Grand Prix of the year, as Brian Braun-Duin and Tomoharu Saito are within a single point of each other, with two other players close enough. Constructed Master—the player who performs best in the Constructed portion of Pro Tours over the whole season—has Sam Black in the lead by a single point over Michael Majors and Rookie frontrunner Oliver Tiu. And Draft Master—same concept, but for Drafting—currently belongs to Jon Finkel, who has a 2-point lead over Marcio Carvalho and Christian Calcano. These, plus the At-Large spots, are all likely going to come down to the wire at [Pro Tour *Eldritch Moon*](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/premierplay/protour/ptemn).

If you don't know, Luis Scott-Vargas and his wife had a kid not too long ago and named her Naya. It didn't take long for LSV to involve a burrito. What does this have to do with *Magic*? Very little. But admit it—this is your favorite item in this entire Update.


Community Spotlight
===================


1. [Kitchentablemtg.com](http://www.kitchentablemtg.com/)

For everyone who loves to take *Magic* a little less seriously, there's a relatively new forum you can check out. Intended for casual players—the most active posts are about gaming life and formats like Pauper or Commander—it looks to be a decent place to visit if you just want to have some fun.


Deck of the Day
===============


1. Blue-Red Eldrazi with *Eldrich Moon* from [In League with Morgan](http://www.gatheringmagic.com/morganwentworth-07132016in-league-with-morgan-ur-eldrazi-redux/) | Gathering Magic

In League with Morgan is a recurring series on Gathering Magic where Morgan Wentworth runs through a *Magic Online* League and looks at the results. In today's episode, she starts out with the Blue-Red Eldrazi deck that's been making the rounds. It's a cool deck, and certainly a powerful one. But what we're interested in today is the update she offers for *Eldritch Moon*, found at the bottom of the article.


Working in several powerful spells—[Imprisoned in the Moon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Imprisoned+in+the+Moon), [Nahiri's Wrath](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nahiri%27s+Wrath), and [Scour the Laboratory](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scour+the+Laboratory)—as well as some crazy powerful Eldrazi—[Emrakul, the Promised End](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Emrakul%2C+the+Promised+End) and [Elder Deep-Fiend](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elder+Deep-Fiend), of course—Morgan has spawned what looks like it will be a force to be reckoned with in the new Standard.
