Shahar Shenhar is the reigning world champion. Currently ranked 16th in the world, Shenhar already has two Grand Prix victories and another Top 8 to his name. Shenhar enters this Top 8 as the highest ranked seed. 



 His opponent, Lucas Siow, has a pair of Grand Prix Top 8s and also once beat me in the finals of a PTQ. Siow entered this tournament without much knowledge of the *Khans of Tarkir* Limited format, but he's proven his *Magic* instincts and card evaluation skills are worthy of greatness with a Top 8 in this event.



Siow and Shenhar debated Siow's picks in an earlier draft while they waited for the match to start. 



 Shenhar got off to a quick start with [Disowned Ancestor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Disowned+Ancestor) into [Mardu Skullhunter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mardu+Skullhunter), but Siow had [Highland Game](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Highland+Game) to stave off the early pressure.
