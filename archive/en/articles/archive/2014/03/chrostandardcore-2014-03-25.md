Sometimes you take an already reasonable two-color deck and add a five-color card. Cards that require the full five colors of mana are typically powerful, and [Chromanticore](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chromanticore) is no exception. As it turns out, splashing [Chromanticore](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chromanticore) isn't actually all that difficult!



![Chromanticore](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Chromanticore&options=)

For help, we turn to [Chromatic Lantern](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chromatic+Lantern) and [Axebane Guardian](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Axebane+Guardian), both of which can get you to [Chromanticore](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chromanticore) Land. When you're swinging with a giant keyworded monster, you'll probably be pretty happy that you're playing them. Additionally, they facilitate some wacky sideboard options, such as [Ruric Thar, the Unbowed](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ruric+Thar%2C+the+Unbowed) and [Golgari Charm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Golgari+Charm). If that's not enough, they give you more mana to accelerate out [Archetype of Endurance](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Archetype+of+Endurance)!


If you can't make it happen, the backup plan is reminiscent of Makihito Mihara's [Pro Tour *Theros*](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pro+Tour+Theros) deck, where he used [Nykthos, Shrine to Nyx](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nykthos%2C+Shrine+to+Nyx) and [Voyaging Satyr](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Voyaging+Satyr) to power out [Garruk, Caller of Beasts](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Garruk%2C+Caller+of+Beasts). Newer versions of the deck generally play [Sylvan Primordial](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sylvan+Primordial) as another mana sink.


While splashing [Chromanticore](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chromanticore) might be "correct," it certainly is awesome. Even if you've got the [Chromatic Lantern](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chromatic+Lantern) or [Axebane Guardian](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Axebane+Guardian) in play, your opponent might never see it coming...
