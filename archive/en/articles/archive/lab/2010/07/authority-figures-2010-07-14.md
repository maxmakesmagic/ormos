Hello and welcome back to the Lab of all things Johnnyness! Now that ***Magic** 2011* has completely settled in your consciousness, let's go ahead and build some sweet decks! I've got the craving for some good old-fashioned synergy, and today it comes in two steaming dishes. If I were a restaurant, I'd be called Red Labster.

Recovered yet? I know, that was an especially numbing pun, but I'm ordering you to forget about it. I'm getting all authoritarian because the three ***Magic** 2011* cards I'm speaking of today are all authority figures of some sort. [Garruk's Packleader](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Garruk%27s+Packleader) is just that, the leader of the Wildspeaker's beastly pack. Two of the flagship Titans, [Inferno Titan](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inferno+Titan) and [Sun Titan](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sun+Titan), make a giant appearance later on.

Leader of the Pack of the Speaker of the Wild
That's technically [Garruk's Packleader](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Garruk%27s+Packleader)'s full title, since authority figures commonly have fancy titles to flaunt at moment's notice. So when your opponent notices you drawing a ton of cards and beating you down at the same time, be sure to name-check the guy that made it happen. Draw out each syllable. I'd love to see [Oona's Gatewarden](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oona%27s+Gatewarden) or [Jhoira's Timebug](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jhoira%27s+Timebug) be introduced in this way. "All hail the Warden of the Gate of [Oona, Queen of the Fae](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oona%2C+Queen+of+the+Fae)! Get ye withered!"
