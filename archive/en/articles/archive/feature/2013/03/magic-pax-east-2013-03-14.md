### Chandra's Quest


Here's the official description of Chandra's Quest:



> 
> Chandra Nalaar needs you! She has traversed the multiverse to find and burn the one who manipulated her. Help her on her quest by visiting with three of these four allies in the convention center:
> 
> 
> * **Loading Ready Run** – Bandland
> * **Astro Gaming** – 668
> * **Skull Candy** – 718
> * **Magic: The Gathering Tournament HQ** – MTG Tournament Hall
> 
> Find these allies, solve the riddles, and get your Planeswalker stamp. Collect three (3) Planeswalker stamps and return to the **Magic: The Gathering** Booth #562. Show your completed card to the Chandra’s Quest Representative to receive your own pair of Chandra’s Goggles and a flame kissed photo with Chandra perfect for sharing with your friends!
> 
> 
> Use the hashtag [#ChandrasQuest](https://twitter.com/search/realtime?q=%23chandrasquest) on Twitter to discuss the quest!
> 
> 
> 


That's right! Your *own pair* of Chandra's goggles! A photo *with Chandra*!


### The Panel


There will also be a **Magic: The Gathering** panel. If you're not at the Corgi Theater at Saturday at 1:30 p.m., you will miss out on the latest news. And such news there is! We can't even include it in this Arcana; that's how fresh it is!


### Magic Online


The **Magic Online** Championship Series reaches its crescendo at PAX East! Head over to Hall C and you can watch the sixteen finalists battle it out for their share of $100,000 and the chapionship title!


Or you can just check out the new client and play in a free Sealed match, with no **Magic Online** account required. This takes place on Saturday from 10:00 a.m. to 1:00 p.m. and on Sunday from 10:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m..


### Celebrity Guests


The tournament area will feature a spellslinging area, where players will get to compete against members of **Magic** R&amp;D, as well as select PAX East performers, like Jonathon Coulton, Paul and Storm, Matt Stanford of Those Who Fight, and Brandon "BL4k Lotus" Patton of MC Frontalot's band. And **Magic** artist Winona Nelson will be there signing cards. This is the perfect time to get your [Bruna, Light of Alabaster](javascript:void()) signed! Or [any of her other cards](http://gatherer.wizards.com/pages/search/default.aspx?output=spoiler&amp;method=visual&amp;action=advanced&amp;artist=+%5B%22winona+nelson%22%5D), really.

### Exclusive Magic Merchandise


There are shirts that are exclusive to PAX East! On Saturday, there's a Chandra thermal, and on Sunday there's a Penny Arcade Chandra T-shirt. There will also be shirts with mana symbols, and keychains with the [Tablet of the Guilds](javascript:void()), but those aren't exclusive. They'e new, though!

*Mouse over each image to see the five mana-symbol shirts*


### Playing Magic


There are also huge swaths of tournaments going the whole time. Prizes include things like "*Avacyn Restored* Foil Set" and "*Gatecrash* Uncut Foil Card Sheet." And those are both for the same tournament, a four-booster Sealed deck on Sunday. There's a complete schedule in PDF form [here](http://tjcollect.com/uploads/events/204_Pax%20East.pdf).


And if you just want to hang out and play **Magic**, there's an Intro Pack league to make sure that there are other people with the same idea as you!


PAX East is March 22-24, 2013, in Boston, MA. Frankly, it sounds like a lot of fun!
