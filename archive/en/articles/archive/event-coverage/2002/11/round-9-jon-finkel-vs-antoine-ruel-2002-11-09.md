A lot of matches like this have seen the light of day yesterday and today at the Pro Tour. Reanimator vs. Reanimator. Both these gentlemen are running the Blue-Black version of the deck with some differences, but still, they tend to do the same thing.

### Game 1

![Reanimate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Reanimate)Antoine won the flip but got a hand that was best described as mediocre. Double [Vampiric Tutor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vampiric+Tutor), [Duress](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress), two [Underground River](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Underground+River)s and a [Visara the Dreadful](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Visara+the+Dreadful). He just played the River and said go. Jon took Antoine's [Duress](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress) when he [Duress](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress)ed Antoine himself. Antoine then fetched a [Careful Study](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Careful+Study) with his [Vampiric Tutor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vampiric+Tutor), played it on his own turn to put [Visara](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Visara) in the graveyard and [Reanimate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reanimate)d it. This put him at 9 life already though. Jon played a [City of Brass](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=City+of+Brass) and Careful Studied himself, ditching an [Exhume](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Exhume) and [Hapless Researcher](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hapless+Researcher). Antoine attacked with his [Visara](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Visara) and played [Brainstorm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brainstorm) and [Polluted Delta](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Polluted+Delta).Jon then fetched his own Pitfighter Champion - [Rorix Bladewing](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rorix+Bladewing) - with [Entomb](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Entomb). He [Exhume](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Exhume)d it and served for 6, bringing Antoine to two precious life. Antoine had to fetch a land with his Delta though to get land that wasn't even more painful. Afterwards he fetched a [Mana Leak](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak) with [Mystical Tutor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mystical+Tutor) and kept his [Visara](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Visara) at home this turn. Jon entombed a [Visara](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Visara) of his own at the end of Antoine's turn. He attacked his [Rorix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rorix) into [Visara](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Visara), mimicking a real pit fight right there. [Visara](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Visara) wins though - she tends to win pit fights by cheating and killing the other off without combat. Jon tried to [Recoil](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Recoil) the [Visara](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Visara) during Antoine's attack step but that was [Mana Leak](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak)ed. He then fetched a [Life](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Life)/[Death](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Death) with [Vampiric Tutor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vampiric+Tutor), cast the [Life](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Life) part with help from a [City of Brass](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=City+of+Brass) and served with 2 lands to take the game.

### Game 2

![Visara the Dreadful](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Visara+the+Dreadful)A double mulligan on Antoine's side made this look bad from the start. Even though he got a [Visara](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Visara) on turn two with help from a [Vampiric Tutor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vampiric+Tutor), [Entomb](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Entomb) and [Reanimate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reanimate), Jon just [Entomb](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Entomb)ed a [Gilded Drake](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gilded+Drake) and took the [Visara](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Visara) from Antoine by casting [Death](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Death) on the Drake. Antoine who only had one card left in his hand even saw that one stripped by Jon's [Mesmeric Fiend](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mesmeric+Fiend) - it was a [Reanimate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reanimate) that could take the Drake should Jon kill it with the [Visara](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Visara). Another [Mesmeric Fiend](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mesmeric+Fiend) takes a [Mystical Tutor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mystical+Tutor) on turn later and Antoine scoops it up.**Final Result:** Jon Finkel 2 - Antoine Ruel 0
