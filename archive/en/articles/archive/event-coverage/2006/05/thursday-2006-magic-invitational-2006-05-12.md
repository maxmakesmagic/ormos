Thursday, 9:54 a.m.: Know The Rule
----------------------------------


A long time ago I wrote about a concept I called "The Rule." In the early days of **Magic** draft, there would be blocks where one color or one color combination was better or worse than the others. The original version was in *Urza's Saga* draft, where black was insane. What I had realized was that there was no way that drafting black could be wrong within a draft. Sure, it could lead to a worse deck this time around, but you had no way of knowing that until after you had already gone into black and at that point it was so much stronger that it was worth sticking it out. So here was The Rule for that block: Draft black unless everyone else knows The Rule.


*Urza's Saga* was where I gave it a name, but *Mirage* Block was where the idea was born. In *Mirage* block it became clear to good drafters that white and blue were the strongest colors, and when *Weatherlight* came out it became blatant. The rewards for being in those colors were so good that you couldn't possibly be sent a signal strong enough to make it worth abandoning the colors – you would still get a good pack two and then get to try and open [Empyrial Armor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Empyrial+Armor) or [Heavy Ballista](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Heavy+Ballista) in pack three. The Rule was to draft blue-white unless everyone else knew The Rule, and with *Weatherlight* in the mix you could almost draft it anyway. You would happily splash for Kaervek's Torch, but that was about it.


When today's drafters returned to *Mirage* block, they learned their lesson well ... too well. It seems that everyone did in fact know The Rule. You walked down the line of computers to find drafter after drafter with his first six or seven picks in blue and white, sighing as the packs went by later on. The few who went into other colors, mostly for strong cards that they opened early, were rewarded with great selection while many blue-white drafters would have to abandon at least one of their colors. By the end of pack two, things had diverged once again, as they have to. There are only so many cards of each color!


My guess is that those who sidestepped those overdrafted colors from the start will have a decisive advantage in today's draft. Those colors are better, but how much better can they be? It also continues the dynamic of rewarding those players willing to go into beatdown strategies. Better players tend to like control and combo more than they should, and in worlds where they are drafting and bidding against each other for those strategies those willing to take the other approach will often have a lot of value. Viva la beatdown!




Thursday, 11:01 a.m.: Rules are Made to be Broken
-------------------------------------------------


*by Mike Turian*

Jeff Cunningham was one of two undefeated players going into Day Two of the Magic Invitational. The other, Pierre Canali, joined Jeff in Pod A of the draft.


Jeff started off the draft strong with a first-pick [Savage Twister](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Savage+Twister). Unfortunately for Jeff, the draft had to be restarted as it was discovered that an Invitationalist wannabe had snuck into the draft with the pros.


During the short pause, Jeff revealed that he was going to force red-green. He felt that overall the colors were both the strongest and the deepest. Unlike conventional wisdom that blue was the best because of how strong it was in *Visions*, Jeff felt that *Mirage* blue just wasn't up to snuff.


 



![Volcanic Dragon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Volcanic+Dragon)

He was a man of his word, as his new first pick was a [Rampant Growth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rampant+Growth), followed by a [Quirion Druid](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Quirion+Druid). A third-pick [Mtenda Lion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mtenda+Lion) proved how committed he was to red-green. Jeff said he really liked the aggression of the Lion and wouldn't even take it out against blue decks. By the end of the first pack, every card he had taken was either red or green with the sole exception of a [Basalt Golem](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Basalt+Golem).


The draft gods smiled on Jeff in pack two. As an apology for being denied a [Savage Twister](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Savage+Twister), Jeff opened up the powerful [Volcanic Dragon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Volcanic+Dragon). He continued to be shipped goodies in the form of [Jungle Wurm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jungle+Wurm), [Talruum Minotaur](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Talruum+Minotaur), and [Searing Spear Askari](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Searing+Spear+Askari). Only the [Jungle Wurm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jungle+Wurm) gave Jeff pause. In that pack, he had the option to take a [Preferred Selection](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Preferred+Selection) – Jeff spoke very highly of the card, saying that the format was slow enough for the card selection to really matter and hoped it would wheel.


*Visions* saw Jeff with a first-pick [Suq'Ata Lancer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Suq%27Ata+Lancer). He then picked up a [Dwarven Vigilantes](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dwarven+Vigilantes) to take advantage of the two [Lightning Reflexes](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Reflexes) and two [Agilities](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Agilities) he had drafted earlier. His third pick was a dream come true, [Viashivan Dragon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Viashivan+Dragon). A [River Boa](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=River+Boa) and [Lichenthrope](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lichenthrope) rounded out Jeff's draft. The only unfortunate occurrence for Jeff was when he timed out deciding between [Rock Slide](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rock+Slide) and [Panther Warrior](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Panther+Warrior). He tried for the [Panther Warrior](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Panther+Warrior) at the last second but ended up goof-grabbing [Prosperity](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Prosperity).




Thursday, 12:39 p.m.: Handicapping the Field
--------------------------------------------


*by Mike Turian*

We're at the halfway mark, so it seemed like a good time to get all the players' ideas of who might win this whole thing:


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/mi06/blog_momir.jpg)*Momir Vig has his eye on ffeJ too.***The Players**  

Frank Karsten – Jeff Cunningham  

Antoine Ruel – Olivier  

Jose Barbero – Antoine  

Mike Flores – Cunningham  

Geoffrey Siron – Not me, Antoine  

Pierre Canali – Antoine, but I'm in the finals with him.  

Jeff Cunningham – No Comment. (Randy Buehler was standing next to him and noting that Jeff was currently 7–1 chuckled, "No wonder he said no comment.")  

Dave Williams – Me  

Gabriel Nassif – Antoine or Cunningham  

Terry Soh – Kenji  

Julien Nuijten – Kenji  

Osyp Lebedowicz – Cunningham  

Antonino De Rosa – Osyp  

Tsuyoshi Fujita – Kenji  

Olivier Ruel – Antoine, oh no no, Siron  

Kenji Tsumura – Antoine


**The Staff**  

Zvi Mowshowitz – Antoine  

Randy Buehler – Antoine  

Scott Larabee – Osyp (When Zvi was told this he commented, "Osyp will never win an Invitational.")  

Mike Turian – Cunningham  

Mark Rosewater – Not me, but an All–Star will win for sure!




Thursday, 12:56 p.m.: Simple and Elegant Days of Yore
-----------------------------------------------------


*by Zvi Mowshowitz*

*Mirage* was the first set made with an eye on Limited, and it's holding up better than anyone thought. I've heard the sentiment that *Mirage* makes us realize how far we've come and how good our modern formats are, but there is still something to be said for the simplicity and elegance of the olden days.


Dave Williams put it this way: "I like it. It's kind of easy, I mean it's just bodies, my deck has 18 creatures."


 



![Crypt Rats](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Crypt+Rats)

Some of them are [Crypt Rats](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crypt+Rats), but a lot of them are vanilla. At the same time, in a real way that's what **Magic** was meant to be about, the clash of men and removal and tricks. *Mirage* captures what makes **Magic** fun and what makes **Magic** **Magic**. If it's not the most taxing on your brain, that can be a good change of pace sometimes. There's clearly plenty going on. Here are some moments I found memorable while watching the rounds play out:


 


* Frank Karsten called out "What is this? The master!" as [Dark Ritual](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dark+Ritual) foiled his [Power Sink](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Power+Sink), only to untap and find everyone's favorite [Kaervek's Torch](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kaervek%27s+Torch) had come to save the day.

A round later, Karsten would be seen keeping a notepad window open with a list of the cards his opponent had played so far in the match. It's one of those things you know you should be doing, but you just can't motivate yourself to do it. Come on, admit it. You need to tighten up!


 


* Mike Flores reached out to touch the screen as he counted up the damage coming at him. If your opponent can't see you, he figures, why not add in some extra insurance?

 


* Even having seen it a few times, it's still strange to have two players playing a ***Magic** Online* match, then shake hands afterwards... without either leaving their seat.

 


* The six-mana [Savage Twister](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Savage+Twister) hand was looking good against Terry Soh until Kookus showed up, then picked up a [Sun Clasp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sun+Clasp) and then a [Ritual of Steel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ritual+of+Steel). "Build your own dragon," Antonio called it.

Gerrard and who knows how many members of his fan club stood by ready to employ the latest in online distraction and tilt technology, even if the better angels of Antonino de Rosa's nature stopped him from pulling the trigger. He's once again on the line with the team during lunch, trying to shore up holes in his block deck.


E3 has plenty of huge screens and amazing graphics, but it's the little things that count. It is good to remember that.




Thursday, 1:31 p.m.: Terry's Final Fortune
------------------------------------------


*by Zvi Mowshowitz*

Julien Nuijten was tapped out. All his Mountains were tapped. All his creatures were tapped. Ready to move in for the kill, Terry Soh cast Final Fortune with enough power in creatures to finish off his opponent.


The plan looked good, but there was just one problem. *Visions* has some free spells. Out of nowhere, a [Fireblast](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fireblast) from Julien cut down one of the attackers and suddenly Terry didn't have enough power to finish the job in two turns. He symbolically hit the top of his deck but it was no avail.


His final fortune had come.




Thursday, 2:10 p.m.: Block Awareness
------------------------------------


*by Zvi Mowshowitz*

With so many blocks to choose from, history is the guide that players must use to find their weapon in Block Party as they furiously browse the coverage history of Block Constructed tournaments for deck ideas. One unique aspect of this scramble is that many of the designers and players of those decks are on hand here to answer questions, and a few more are just an instant message away.


I've had multiple inquiries to my Pro Tour-winning (but here utterly useless) Solution deck. In the words of Pierre Canali, "How do these [Crimson Acolytes](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crimson+Acolytes) help?" Back then, in a lot of ways. Right now, not so much. Look elsewhere, my friend.


Randy Buehler has had to field the same questions about Sandsapoise, his signature historical block deck. In the end, a variety of blocks and decks look to emerge with *Invasion* Block leading the way as the precieved most powerful block and looking to square off against the top two weapons of *Odyssey*  and *Onslaught*  and the surviving decks of *Mirrodin*  as well. Not every block will make it, but the format is almost certainly packed with outstanding variety.


When all was said and done and the decklists submitted, here is how the blocks broke down:


 


* *Invasion*: 7
* *Odyssey*: 5
* *Mirrodin*: 2 (both mono red)
* *Onslaught*: 2



Thursday, 3:24 p.m.: Through a Potato's Eyes

Thursday, 4:40 p.m.: An Inside Look at V3
-----------------------------------------


*by Mike Turian*

The guy in the Wizards booth constantly meeting with newspapers, websites, and television stations showing off the latest features of V3? That's Justin Ziran, the Brand Manager for ***Magic** Online*. In addition to the media interest, he says new and longtime **Magic** players have been coming up to him commenting on how revitalized V3 looks.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/mi06/blog_ziran1.jpg)*Ziran's been a popular guy this week.* Right now V3 is in internal testing. Through this process, V3 will be preparing for external playtesting, scheduled to begin in a couple of months. Of course, being a computer program, there will be continuous quality improvements being made during this time period.


Justin was excited to show off the higher video quality ***Magic** Online* V3 will have. Using the latest DirectX technology, V3 has greatly improved the look and feel of ***Magic** Online*. Justin showed off some of the different zooming options available in V3. You will never have to squint to see a **Magic** card again.


Another big improvement that V3 will have is improved tournament systems. Right now Scott Larabee handles the tournaments that are run online, but he'll have many more options in V3. The important thing is that V3 will be more likely to offer the right tournament for you. We will have to wait and see what new formats Mark Rosewater makes to challenge next year's Invitationalists.


Justin loves seeing the project come together and wanted to share that experience with everyone online. Currently a free beta is scheduled for the week before the official V3 release. While that date isn't set in stone, no doubt **Magic** players will be excited for a whole week of free play.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/mi06/v3screen.jpg)*This is what you have to look forward to.*


  


Thursday, 5:44 p.m.: Soh Where are My Shoes?
--------------------------------------------


*by Zvi Mowshowitz*

Terry Soh likes to take off his shoes during matches. This round, he was in for a rude surprise: His shoes were missing.


The only hint was a sign: Last year's winner's shoes, $2. Contact Olivier Ruel.


In the end, Terry bargained him down to a dollar with the help of alternate source Jose Barbero and the footwear was returned to its rightful owner.
