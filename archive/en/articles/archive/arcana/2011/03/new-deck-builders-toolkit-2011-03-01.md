The *Deck Builder's Toolkit* is back, and it's being refreshed!

In broad strokes, it's still the same basic [Deck Builder's Toolkit](/en/articles/archive/deck-builders-toolkit-2010-05-17-0):

* 125 semi-randomized cards suitable for building several different **Magic** decks
* Four 15-card booster packs from a variety of recent **Magic: The Gathering** sets
* 100 basic land cards to help you cast your spells
* Deck builderâ€™s guide with tips about building the best **Magic** decks
* **Magic** "learn to play" guide
* Full-art reusable card storage box

The "refresh" part is that the assortment of cards and boosters is being kept current. With the latest *Deck Builder's Toolkit*, you'll be working with the latest cards, all the way up to *Mirrodin Besieged*!

There's another change we should mention. The *Deck Builder's Toolkit* was originally available in English only, but this one will also be in French, German, and Spanish!

**Languages Available:** English, French, German, and Spanish   
**Release Date:** March 11, 2011   
**MSRP:** $19.99

And here's a peek at the inside cardsleeve!
