Maybe[last week's draft primer](/en/articles/archive/limited-information/guide-reactive-drafting-2007-06-12) would've been better served as one of my initial articles; laying down the solid strategy before meddling in the world of drafting. It would be nothing short of wrong to not follow it up with a draft walkthrough, especially now that *Time Spiral* / *Planar Chaos* / *Future Sight* drafts are available on **Magic Online**. Hopefully the draft should hammer home the lessons of last week.


### Pack 1, Pick 1


![Pack 1](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/mtgcom/fcpics/limited/qm15_Pack1_Small.jpg)[Tendrils of Corruption](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tendrils+of+Corruption), [Penumbra Spider](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Penumbra+Spider), [Errant Doomsayers](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Errant+Doomsayers), [Rift Bolt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rift+Bolt), [Aether Web](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aether+Web), [Basal Sliver](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Basal+Sliver), [Sage of Epityr](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sage+of+Epityr), [Ghitu Firebreathing](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ghitu+Firebreathing), [Momentary Blink](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Momentary+Blink), [Sporesower Thallid](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sporesower+Thallid), [Telekinetic Sliver](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Telekinetic+Sliver), [Durkwood Tracker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Durkwood+Tracker), [Spike Tiller](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spike+Tiller), [Funeral Charm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Funeral+Charm), [Plains](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plains)


This pack presents several good options for consideration. [Momentary Blink](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Momentary+Blink) and [Tendrils of Corruption](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tendrils+of+Corruption) are inferior in power to the rest of the pack so they, along with their colours, can be dismissed. [Telekinetic Sliver](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Telekinetic+Sliver) is one of the strongest cards to break out into the Sliver archetype, especially now that [Homing Sliver](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Homing+Sliver) has provided a consistent way of finding him. However, there are still cards with higher raw power than the potential this Sliver has to offer. [Rift Bolt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rift+Bolt) is obviously great, but it is the depth of Green that intrigues me here: [Spike Tiller](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spike+Tiller), [Penumbra Spider](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Penumbra+Spider) and [Sporesower Thallid](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sporesower+Thallid).


I actually think that [Spike Tiller](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spike+Tiller) is the most inferior of the three options, despite being a very powerful card that can easily swing games. It is the most expensive of the three, but it is because I feel the other two 'do' more for green than the Tiller that it is ranked the worst. [Penumbra Spider](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Penumbra+Spider) is one of my favourite cards, providing green with both card advantage and an answer to evasion. Being able to deal with flyers is more important with the release of *Future Sight* than before. It brought [Lucent Liminid](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lucent+Liminid), [Whip-Spine Drake](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Whip-Spine+Drake), and [Knight of Sursi](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Knight+of+Sursi)â€”all of whose effective three power the Spider trumps. It fills the hole in the colour that the introduction of [Thornweald Archer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thornweald+Archer) fails to fill. However, [Sporesower Thallid](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sporesower+Thallid) is just too good. A 4/4 for four is massive. Given that Saprolings are now better thanks to the introduction of [Sporoloth Ancient](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sporoloth+Ancient) and [Sprout Swarm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sprout+Swarm), the Thallid gets even better.


The decision between [Thallid](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thallid) and Bolt was close before Saprolings improved. Whichever we pick, the decision is in no way influenced by the fact that there are plenty of green cards and only one red card. We could take the Bolt because we want to let others get involved in the green quagmire; but if we take a green card, then the player on our left will take the [Rift Bolt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rift+Bolt) and the green traffic jam we feared will never occur. This pick is so close that, if in doubt, the nod would easily go to [Rift Bolt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rift+Bolt) because it has a higher likelihood of making your final deck as it is less of a colour commitment and a card you would happily splash for. Colour preference also has little to do with this pick as both colours are very strong throughout the three sets. I came close to timing out on this pick and eventually went with the safer Bolt. In hindsight, my pick is completely wrong. The [Thallid](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thallid) is just too powerful a card to justify taking the Bolt over it. Bolt is good, whereas the [Thallid](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thallid) is great. Not off to the best start...


Pick: [Rift Bolt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rift+Bolt)


**Pack 1, Pick 2**


[Fortify](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fortify), [Spiketail Drakeling](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spiketail+Drakeling), [Flamecore Elemental](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flamecore+Elemental), [Mana Skimmer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Skimmer), [Nantuko Shaman](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nantuko+Shaman), [Shadow Sliver](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shadow+Sliver), [Watcher Sliver](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Watcher+Sliver), [Thrill of the Hunt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thrill+of+the+Hunt), [Plunder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plunder), [Ignite Memories](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ignite+Memories), [Saltcrusted Steppe](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Saltcrusted+Steppe), [Outrider *en*-Kor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Outrider+en-Kor), [Sindbad](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sindbad), [Sprout](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sprout)


This pack once more provides some similarly powered options. There are no red cards worth considering, but with the rare missing this means nothing to us. Neither of the two combat tricks are powerful enough at this point (as we are neither of the colours, times a little bit more for the Thrill) so we can focus on the three creatures. [Nantuko Shaman](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nantuko+Shaman) is a great card, underrated in my opinion, but is inferior to the other two, especially given that we just passed three great green cards (again, not the reason for passing it). This brings us to a decision between [Spiketail Drakeling](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spiketail+Drakeling) and [Outrider *en*-Kor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Outrider+en-Kor). If these cards were very close in power then I would opt for the Drakeling, because I prefer blue and I think that blue-red is a great colour combination. So I picked the Drakeling.


Here I made another grievous mistake, even worse than normal given last week's words of wisdom and my last pick. The Drakeling and *en*-Kor are not so close in power as to advocate a pick based on colour preference, as I did at the time. The Rebel is the better card by quite a long way. At the end of the draft, I will reflect on the impact this pick had on the draft. But for now, a mistake has been made, but it shouldn't be enough to shake you. Put it behind you, analyse the impact on the signals you are sending to the left, and focus on what is flowing from the right.


Pick: [Spiketail Drakeling](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spiketail+Drakeling)


**Pack 1, Pick 3**


[Bonesplitter Sliver](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bonesplitter+Sliver), [Dark Withering](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dark+Withering), [Viscerid Deepwalker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Viscerid+Deepwalker), [Ashcoat Bear](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ashcoat+Bear), [Search for Tomorrow](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Search+for+Tomorrow), [Thallid Shell-Dweller](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thallid+Shell-Dweller), [Jhoira's Timebug](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jhoira%27s+Timebug), [Jedit's Dragoons](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jedit%27s+Dragoons), [Savage Thallid](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Savage+Thallid), [Calciform Pools](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Calciform+Pools), [Return to Dust](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Return+to+Dust), [Mangara of Corondor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mangara+of+Corondor), [Empty the Warrens](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Empty+the+Warrens)


A strong pack with many options. Red continues to be weak, presenting cards that are not worth considering given the power of the alternatives. We have our first black card of qualityâ€”[Dark Withering](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dark+Withering), going up against [Mangara of Corondor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mangara+of+Corondor), [Viscerid Deepwalker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Viscerid+Deepwalker) and [Search for Tomorrow](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Search+for+Tomorrow). [Search for Tomorrow](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Search+for+Tomorrow) has decreased slightly in value with the introduction of [Edge of Autumn](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Edge+of+Autumn), but here it is still an indicator that green might be open. The Deepwalker would be a nice addition to follow up the Drakeling but the draft is still young and, like the Search, the Homarid is just not powerful enough to be picked over wither of the two 'removal' spells. The decision between [Dark Withering](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dark+Withering) and [Mangara of Corondor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mangara+of+Corondor) is, again, tight. I'm not particularly partial to either colourâ€”I prefer white with blue and black with red. Both represent quite large colour commitments, Mangara slightly more so. The Withering opens the door to the madness deck/trap (you end up with too many madness spells and not enough outlets, or vice versa, or you get there. Either way, trying to keep the madness engine going will often cause you to make incorrect picks along the way.), whereas Mangara is combo-licious with [Momentary Blink](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Momentary+Blink) and cards like [Stonecloaker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stonecloaker).


I am more willing to abandon my [Rift Bolt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rift+Bolt) at this point than my Drakeling, as neither pack from the right has contained a red card of worth (although it is still too early to know), and there is a higher chance that I can splash the Bolt than the Drakeling. I also feel that I should have picked the *en*-Kor the pick before, which would have made Mangara an easy pick here, and it is likely that the guy on our right will assume we are in white and will consequently veer away from it (even though he shouldn't care too much about what we, as the guy on his left, do).


Pick: [Mangara of Corondor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mangara+of+Corondor)


**Pack 1, Pick 4**


[Chromatic Star](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chromatic+Star), [Tolarian Sentinel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tolarian+Sentinel), [Flowstone Channeler](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flowstone+Channeler), [Trespasser *il*-Vec](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Trespasser+il-Vec), [Viscid Lemures](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Viscid+Lemures), [Mwonvuli Acid-Moss](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mwonvuli+Acid-Moss), [Two-Headed Sliver](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Two-Headed+Sliver), [Blazing Blade Askari](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blazing+Blade+Askari), [Dementia Sliver](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dementia+Sliver), [Chronatog Totem](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chronatog+Totem), [Thunder Totem](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thunder+Totem), [Pandemonium](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pandemonium)


This pack was so dry I almost considered picking the [Chromatic Star](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chromatic+Star) just to ensure the likelihood that I would play [Rift Bolt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rift+Bolt) by the end of the draft. However, this would have been just wrong, as there are still some good cards left in the pack. Either [Tolarian Sentinel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tolarian+Sentinel) or [Flowstone Channeler](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flowstone+Channeler) (a card I prefer to [Blazing Blade Askari](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blazing+Blade+Askari), unless my deck is already looking very aggressive) link back into colours I have already picked and the Sentinel is a great combo with Mangara. Yet I think that [Trespasser *il*-Vec](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Trespasser+il-Vec) is strong enough to pick above both of these cards. Black might well be open given that it has the strongest card in this pack and was one of the best in the last pack.


Pick: [Trespasser *il*-Vec](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Trespasser+il-Vec)


Four packs in and I'm staring at four differently coloured cards. Two of them are heavy colour commitments, and it is likely that one or both will not make my final deck. And yet, with the exception of the *en*-Kor pick, I am not at all disgruntled. Many of my drafts start this way. Green seems to be drying up a little, as we saw none of its best commons since the first pack, and red too seems light. It might look like a pile so far, but I have the flexibility to go in almost any direction and no matter which way I go, it is unlikely I will sacrifice many of my early picks in doing so.


**Pack 1, Pick 5**


[Empty the Warrens](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Empty+the+Warrens), [Icatian Crier](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Icatian+Crier), [Bonesplitter Sliver](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bonesplitter+Sliver), [Ancient Grudge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ancient+Grudge), [Flickering Spirit](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flickering+Spirit), [Call to the Netherworld](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Call+to+the+Netherworld), [Drifter *il*-Dal](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Drifter+il-Dal), [Havenwood Wurm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Havenwood+Wurm), [Stormcloud Djinn](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stormcloud+Djinn), [Dodecapod](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dodecapod), [Swamp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swamp)


This pack is very weak. If it suggests anything, it is that red *might* be open, with [Empty the Warrens](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Empty+the+Warrens), [Bonesplitter Sliver](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bonesplitter+Sliver) and [Stormcloud Djinn](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stormcloud+Djinn) still here, but this is far from a strong signal. This is so weak that I almost picked the [Dodecapod](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dodecapod), and there is a good argument to suggest that I should have done. However, I think that this block in general has several [Hill Giant](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hill+Giant)s (more on these and my love for them later on), and for now I am still all about taking the most powerful cards if in doubt.


Pick: [Empty the Warrens](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Empty+the+Warrens)


**Pack 1, Pick 6**


[Scarwood Treefolk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scarwood+Treefolk), [Slipstream Serpent](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Slipstream+Serpent), [Bogardan Rager](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bogardan+Rager), [Sangrophage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sangrophage), [D'Avenant Healer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=D%27Avenant+Healer), [Wormwood Dryad](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wormwood+Dryad), [Locket of Yesterdays](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Locket+of+Yesterdays), [Tectonic Fiend](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tectonic+Fiend), [Magus of the Mirror](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Magus+of+the+Mirror), [Withered Wretch](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Withered+Wretch)


A typical mid pack full of mediocre cards. The black cards are too much of a colour commitment for their effects (the Magus is awful), the [Wormwood Dryad](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wormwood+Dryad) and [Scarwood Treefolk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scarwood+Treefolk) are too weak to consider going green, and the [D'Avenant Healer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=D%27Avenant+Healer) is also too feeble a card to take over the real options. It took me a long time to chose between the [Slipstream Serpent](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Slipstream+Serpent) and the [Bogardan Rager](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bogardan+Rager) as I think they are very close in power. I eventually sided with the Rager. Looking back, this pick is easily the Rager as I have picked no other blue cards since the Drakeling, whilst I have picked up a few cards that suggest I'm headed red.


Pick: [Bogardan Rager](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bogardan+Rager)


**Pack 1, Pick 7**


[Thallid Germinator](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thallid+Germinator), [Pentarch Ward](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pentarch+Ward), [Aetherflame Wall](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aetherflame+Wall), [Pit Keeper](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pit+Keeper), [Sage of Epityr](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sage+of+Epityr), [Divine Congregation](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Divine+Congregation), [Mindlash Sliver](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mindlash+Sliver), [Firewake Sliver](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Firewake+Sliver), [Safe Haven](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Safe+Haven)


Here is what I would normally refer too as a good signal. The [Thallid Germinator](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thallid+Germinator) is too good to be here this late. It must have been a strong booster to have made it this far, but it is a sign that green is underdrafted. It might well have been correct for me to take it. However, this draft has reached a point where it is unlikely to really benefit me by dipping into green given that the only strong signal that I have passed to the guy on my left is that green is open. Peculiar to this draft, the guy on my left probably picked exclusively green cards for his first three or four picks (as I would have done had I picked the [Sporesower Thallid](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sporesower+Thallid)). It is therefore unlikely that I will receive any strong green in *Planar Chaos*. It is also unlikely that I will receive much green of consequence from what is left of *Time Spiral*, meaning that I would be relying solely on the third pack. This is one of the few examples where I haven't cut a colourâ€”in fact I have done the exact opposite, to my own detriment, and it is therefore too late for me to switch into green. Any other colour would be fine.


Pick: [Aetherflame Wall](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aetherflame+Wall)


**Pack 1, Pick 8**


[Flamecore Elemental](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flamecore+Elemental), [Mystical Teachings](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mystical+Teachings), [Two-Headed Sliver](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Two-Headed+Sliver), [Clockspinning](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Clockspinning), [Sidewinder Sliver](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sidewinder+Sliver), [Evil Eye of Urborg](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Evil+Eye+of+Urborg), [Fungal Reaches](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fungal+Reaches), [Jolrael, Empress of Beasts](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jolrael%2C+Empress+of+Beasts)


Were I green I *might* have picked the [Fungal Reaches](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fungal+Reaches) over Jolrael, because I think she is a very overrated card. However, I also love 3/3s, so might still have picked her, although the introduction of [Fomori Nomad](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fomori+Nomad) and [Sporoloth Ancient](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sporoloth+Ancient) (were I red-green) means that the five drops in that archetype are plentiful. However, relevant to my current situation, my choice is between [Flamecore Elemental](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flamecore+Elemental) and the land. This is pretty close. Normally, a storage land is better than the Elemental, because it is either a mana fixer or gives you the potential to splash another colour. In this case, that splashed colour would be green, and for obvious reasons, this is not a strong thing.


Pick: [Flamecore Elemental](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flamecore+Elemental)


**Pack 1, Pick 9**


[Aether Web](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aether+Web), [Basal Sliver](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Basal+Sliver), [Sage of Epityr](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sage+of+Epityr), [Ghitu Firebreathing](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ghitu+Firebreathing), [Durkwood Tracker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Durkwood+Tracker), [Funeral Charm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Funeral+Charm), [Plains](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plains)


I hated the rarer [Funeral Charm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Funeral+Charm) here over the [Aether Web](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aether+Web), as it is a harder card to play around.


Pick: [Funeral Charm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Funeral+Charm)


**Pack 1, Pick 10**


[Shadow Sliver](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shadow+Sliver), [Plunder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plunder), [Ignite Memories](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ignite+Memories), [Saltcrusted Steppe](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Saltcrusted+Steppe), [Sindbad](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sindbad), [Sprout](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sprout)


Pick: [Saltcrusted Steppe](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Saltcrusted+Steppe)


**Pack 1, Pick 11**


[Jhoira's Timebug](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jhoira%27s+Timebug), [Savage Thallid](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Savage+Thallid), [Calciform Pools](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Calciform+Pools), [Return to Dust](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Return+to+Dust), [Empty the Warrens](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Empty+the+Warrens)


My computer froze up at this point, and by the time I'd rebooted, I found the land nestled in my picked pile. [Empty the Warrens](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Empty+the+Warrens) would have been a great addition and is also a great signal that red is open as, with the exception of green, the pack wasn't too deep the first time around.


Pick: [Calciform Pools](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Calciform+Pools)


**Pack 1, Pick 12**


[Viscid Lemures](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Viscid+Lemures), [Blazing Blade Askari](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blazing+Blade+Askari), [Dementia Sliver](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dementia+Sliver), [Chronatog Totem](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chronatog+Totem)


Pick: [Blazing Blade Askari](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blazing+Blade+Askari)


**Pack 1, Pick 13**


[Call to the Netherworld](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Call+to+the+Netherworld), [Drifter *il*-Dal](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Drifter+il-Dal), [Swamp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swamp)


Pick: Drifer *il*-Dal


**Pack 1, Pick 14**


[Scarwood Treefolk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scarwood+Treefolk), [Sangrophage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sangrophage)


Pick: [Scarwood Treefolk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scarwood+Treefolk)


**Pack 1 Pick 15**


Pick: [Mindlash Sliver](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mindlash+Sliver)


So far we are weakly invested in red. It almost certainly open from the right and we did a decent job of cutting it, so it should flow well in the next pack. Had we picked the [Sporesower Thallid](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sporesower+Thallid) we would be sitting on a very solid red-green deck. Had we picked the [Outrider *en*-Kor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Outrider+en-Kor), nothing would have changed so far as white dried up fairly fast. Black never materialised and I have no intention on dipping into it now, as it is weak in the later packs. There was a steady flow of slightly better than mediocre blue cards during the first few packs, so I hope for that to be open, mainly because all the other colours are more lacking than blue.


### Pack 2, Pick 1


![Pack 2](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/mtgcom/fcpics/limited/qm15_Pack2_Small.jpg)[Reflex Sliver](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reflex+Sliver), [Whitemane Lion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Whitemane+Lion), [Midnight Charm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Midnight+Charm), [Saltfield Recluse](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Saltfield+Recluse), [Aquamorph Entity](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aquamorph+Entity), [Evolution Charm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Evolution+Charm), [Pallid Mycoderm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pallid+Mycoderm), [Brain Gorgers](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brain+Gorgers), [Merfolk Thaumaturgist](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Merfolk+Thaumaturgist), [Sinew Sliver](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sinew+Sliver), [Vampiric Link](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vampiric+Link), [Timebender](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Timebender), [Muck Drubb](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Muck+Drubb), [Ovinize](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ovinize), [Heroes Remembered](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Heroes+Remembered)


Not a red card in sight, so I'm forced to make an awkward decision straight off the bat. This choice boils down to blue versus white in the form of [Ovinize](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ovinize) or [Saltfield Recluse](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Saltfield+Recluse). The Mangara I have is more powerful than the Drakeling, but the cards you have are of less of a consideration than the hook-up you think you are or will be getting. I feel that blue is more likely to be open, I also prefer blue so it helps match the colour preference as well. As far as power is concerned, the two are, once more, very close in level. The Recluse might be more powerful, but [Ovinize](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ovinize) has the ability to deal with almost any creature. I chose the latter because I felt that blue would be more forthcoming.


Pick: [Ovinize](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ovinize)


**Pack 2, Pick 2**


[Erratic Mutation](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Erratic+Mutation), [Cradle to Grave](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cradle+to+Grave), [Reflex Sliver](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reflex+Sliver), [Dreamscape Artist](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dreamscape+Artist), [Reality Acid](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reality+Acid), [Citanul Woodreaders](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Citanul+Woodreaders), [Pallid Mycoderm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pallid+Mycoderm), [Keldon Marauders](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Keldon+Marauders), [Piracy Charm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Piracy+Charm), [Fa'adiyah Seer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fa%27adiyah+Seer), [Sinew Sliver](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sinew+Sliver), [Waning Wurm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Waning+Wurm), [Shivan Meteor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shivan+Meteor), [Malach of the Dawn](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Malach+of+the+Dawn)


[Shivan Meteor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shivan+Meteor) is the easy pick here. [Erratic Mutation](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Erratic+Mutation) might also be a good removal spell, but the Meteor has the capacity to deal with practically everything.


Pick: [Shivan Meteor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shivan+Meteor)


**Pack 2, Pick 3**


[Dawn Charm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dawn+Charm), [Spitting Sliver](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spitting+Sliver), [Mire Boa](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mire+Boa), [Battering Sliver](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Battering+Sliver), [Aven Riftwatcher](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aven+Riftwatcher), [Ghost Tactician](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ghost+Tactician), [Wistful Thinking](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wistful+Thinking), [Dash Hopes](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dash+Hopes), [Simian Spirit Guide](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Simian+Spirit+Guide), [Mantle of Leadership](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mantle+of+Leadership), [Jodah's Avenger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jodah%27s+Avenger), [Shrouded Lore](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shrouded+Lore), [Fatal Frenzy](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fatal+Frenzy)


This is a nice reward. In an almost completely empty pack, there is nestled a bomb in the colour of our uncertainty. Thanks.


Pick: [Jodah's Avenger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jodah%27s+Avenger)


**Pack 2, Pick 4**


[Synchronous Sliver](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Synchronous+Sliver), [Needlepeak Spider](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Needlepeak+Spider), [Dreamscape Artist](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dreamscape+Artist), [Aven Riftwatcher](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aven+Riftwatcher), [Dust Corona](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dust+Corona), [Vitaspore Thallid](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vitaspore+Thallid), [Dash Hopes](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dash+Hopes), [Brute Force](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brute+Force), [Fa'adiyah Seer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fa%27adiyah+Seer), [Lavacore Elemental](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lavacore+Elemental), [Kavu Predator](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kavu+Predator), [Kor Dirge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kor+Dirge)


[Needlepeak Spider](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Needlepeak+Spider) is a filler card at best. [Dreamscape Artist](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dreamscape+Artist) is a great card, but it's not in the same league as the reprinted [Giant Growth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Giant+Growth).


Pick: [Brute Force](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brute+Force)


**Pack 2, Pick 5**


[Giant Dustwasp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Giant+Dustwasp), [Stingscourger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stingscourger), [Deadly Grub](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deadly+Grub), [Citanul Woodreaders](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Citanul+Woodreaders), [Brain Gorgers](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brain+Gorgers), [Keldon Marauders](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Keldon+Marauders), [Prodigal Pyromancer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Prodigal+Pyromancer), [Piracy Charm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Piracy+Charm), [Healing Leaves](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Healing+Leaves), [Blood Knight](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Knight), [Fungal Behemoth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fungal+Behemoth)


Along with the [Jodah's Avenger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jodah%27s+Avenger) pack, this is the kind of thing you want to see when drafting. It's where you breath a sigh of relief at having reaped the rewards from either cutting or staying fast to the correct colours and having them come in spades. Ironically, out of the three red cards the [Blood Knight](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Knight) is the worstâ€”it's simply a great card. [Stingscourger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stingscourger) is phenomenal as well as being underrated. Its echo isn't as expensive as it looks, and even if you don't intend to pay it, a sorcery bounce spell in red is a brilliant addition to any deck. Added to that is the fact that your opponent will often not be able to find a good attack the next turn as it lies there with the echo unpaid, and if you do pay it then you have netted your self a tempo-based two for one. It is, however, still not the strongest card in the pack. This right is reserved for Tom.


Pick: [Prodigal Pyromancer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Prodigal+Pyromancer)


**Pack 2, Pick 6**


[Dreamscape Artist](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dreamscape+Artist), [Ridged Kusite](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ridged+Kusite), [Dawn Charm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dawn+Charm), [Cradle to Grave](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cradle+to+Grave), [Fury Charm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fury+Charm), [Reality Acid](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reality+Acid), [Essence Warden](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Essence+Warden), [Mana Tithe](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Tithe), [Bog Serpent](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bog+Serpent), [Psychotrope Thallid](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psychotrope+Thallid)


In an unexciting pack with no option for us, the Artist provides us with a much-needed two drop.


Pick: [Dreamscape Artist](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dreamscape+Artist)


**Pack 2, Pick 7**


[Needlepeak Spider](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Needlepeak+Spider), [Aquamorph Entity](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aquamorph+Entity), [Firefright Mage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Firefright+Mage), [Ghost Tactician](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ghost+Tactician), [Healing Leaves](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Healing+Leaves), [Primal Plasma](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Primal+Plasma), [Muck Drubb](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Muck+Drubb), [Tidewalker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tidewalker), [Benalish Commander](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Benalish+Commander)


Ignore the Spider; it's not in the same league as the two blue cards. I've picked both cards before when faced with this option, as it will often come down to the makeup of your deck and its mana curve. All things excluded, the [Primal Plasma](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Primal+Plasma) is the better card in a vacuum and, for us, the better card for our deck, which is currently lacking any serious late-game power other than the Avenger.


Aside: I love [Hill Giant](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hill+Giant)s. They may be the standard for four mana, but they're slightly better than that. Gray Ogres have been outclassed again and againâ€”three mana should buy you something more nowadaysâ€”whereas a [Hill Giant](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hill+Giant) is still a great deal. Amen.


Pick: [Primal Plasma](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Primal+Plasma)


**Pack 2, Pick 8**


[Poultice Sliver](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Poultice+Sliver), [Dust Corona](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dust+Corona), [Bog Serpent](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bog+Serpent), [Skirk Shaman](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skirk+Shaman), [Essence Warden](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Essence+Warden), [Kavu Predator](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kavu+Predator), [Serra's Boon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Serra%27s+Boon), [Imp's Mischief](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Imp%27s+Mischief)


Pick: [Skirk Shaman](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skirk+Shaman)


**Pack 2, Pick 9**


[Reflex Sliver](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reflex+Sliver), [Midnight Charm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Midnight+Charm), [Aquamorph Entity](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aquamorph+Entity), [Brain Gorgers](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brain+Gorgers), [Vampiric Link](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vampiric+Link), [Timebender](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Timebender), [Muck Drubb](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Muck+Drubb)


Pick: [Aquamorph Entity](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aquamorph+Entity)


**Pack 2, Pick 10**


[Reflex Sliver](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reflex+Sliver), [Reality Acid](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reality+Acid), [Keldon Marauders](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Keldon+Marauders), [Piracy Charm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Piracy+Charm), [Fa'adiyah Seer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fa%27adiyah+Seer), [Waning Wurm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Waning+Wurm)


Pick: [Piracy Charm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Piracy+Charm)


**Pack 2, Pick 11**


[Spitting Sliver](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spitting+Sliver), [Wistful Thinking](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wistful+Thinking), [Dash Hopes](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dash+Hopes), [Simian Spirit Guide](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Simian+Spirit+Guide), [Shrouded Lore](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shrouded+Lore)


Pick: [Shrouded Lore](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shrouded+Lore)


**Pack 2, Pick 12**


[Dust Corona](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dust+Corona), [Dash Hopes](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dash+Hopes), [Fa'adiyah Seer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fa%27adiyah+Seer), [Lavacore Elemental](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lavacore+Elemental)


Pick: [Lavacore Elemental](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lavacore+Elemental)


**Pack 2, Pick 13**


[Deadly Grub](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deadly+Grub), [Brain Gorgers](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brain+Gorgers), [Keldon Marauders](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Keldon+Marauders)


Pick: [Keldon Marauders](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Keldon+Marauders)


**Pack 2, Pick 14**


[Dawn Charm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dawn+Charm), [Fury Charm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fury+Charm)


Pick: [Fury Charm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fury+Charm)


**Pack 2, Pick 15**


Pick: [Firefright Mage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Firefright+Mage)


After a partially interesting first pick, the rest of *Planar Chaos* passed fairly unexcitingly. We're obviously in the correct seat for red and, starting with the Avenger and followed by the late Plasma and Entity, it would appear that blue is working out. However, this was coming from the left, which means nothing. Hopefully blue will be open from the right anyway, and our taking almost every good blue card from this pack will have helped exclude our neighbours on the right from dipping into it. One of the things that I'm concerned about is that apart from the Avenger, the deck is very light on large/evasion creatures who can win the game if left unmolested, so I'm on the look out for those in *Future Sight*.


### Pack 3, Pick 1


![Pack 3](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/mtgcom/fcpics/limited/qm15_Pack3_Small.jpg)[Rift Elemental](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rift+Elemental), [Augur *il*-Vec](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Augur+il-Vec), [Llanowar Empath](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Llanowar+Empath), [Marshaling Cry](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Marshaling+Cry), [Kavu Primarch](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kavu+Primarch), [Lymph Sliver](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lymph+Sliver), [Homing Sliver](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Homing+Sliver), [Sporoloth Ancient](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sporoloth+Ancient), [Grave Scrabbler](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grave+Scrabbler), [Lumithread Field](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lumithread+Field), [Street Wraith](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Street+Wraith), [Bloodshot Trainee](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodshot+Trainee), [Spellwild Ouphe](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spellwild+Ouphe), [Nihilith](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nihilith), [Dakmor Salvage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dakmor+Salvage)


It's pretty hard to find a more disappointing pack. Our lucky options are between the off-colour flashback of [Marshaling Cry](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Marshaling+Cry) or the off-colour morph [Lumithread Field](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lumithread+Field). Both might be splashed off the [Calciform Pools](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Calciform+Pools) but will almost certainly not make the deck. I opted for the Cry, just in case the deck ended up appalling and the only real way of winning was to dig to any bombs we might have.


Pick: Mashalling Cry


**Pack 3, Pick 2**


[Wrap in Vigor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wrap+in+Vigor), [Knight of Sursi](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Knight+of+Sursi), [Leaden Fists](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leaden+Fists), [Gift of Granite](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gift+of+Granite), [Augur of Skulls](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Augur+of+Skulls), [Thornweald Archer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thornweald+Archer), [Frenzy Sliver](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Frenzy+Sliver), [Mesmeric Sliver](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mesmeric+Sliver), [Patrician's Scorn](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Patrician%27s+Scorn), [Sarcomite Myr](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sarcomite+Myr), [Boldwyr Intimidator](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Boldwyr+Intimidator), [Phosphorescent Feast](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phosphorescent+Feast), [Pyromancer's Swath](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyromancer%27s+Swath), [Sarcomite Myr](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sarcomite+Myr) (foil)


This pick was quite difficult. The deck is in need of both removal and fatties and this pack offers [Leaden Fists](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leaden+Fists) versus [Boldwyr Intimidator](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Boldwyr+Intimidator). [Leaden Fists](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leaden+Fists) is basically a superior Assasinate that can backfire on occasion, whereas the Intimidator is a monster. Seven mana might be a bit daunting, but it will win the game in short fashion. *Future Sight* has four red common removal spells and right now I'm looking for fatties.


Pick: [Boldwyr Intimidator](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Boldwyr+Intimidator)


**Pack 3, Pick 3**


[Grave Peril](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grave+Peril), [Wrap in Vigor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wrap+in+Vigor), [Samite Censer-Bearer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Samite+Censer-Bearer), [Infiltrator *il*-Kor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Infiltrator+il-Kor), [Putrid Cyclops](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Putrid+Cyclops), [Blind Phantasm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blind+Phantasm), [Virulent Sliver](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Virulent+Sliver), [Mass of Ghouls](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mass+of+Ghouls), [Vedalken Aethermage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vedalken+Aethermage), [Blade of the Sixth Pride](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blade+of+the+Sixth+Pride), [Storm Entity](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Storm+Entity), [Spellwild Ouphe](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spellwild+Ouphe), [Aven Mindcensor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aven+Mindcensor)


A clear sign that blue is indeed open.


Pick: [Infiltrator *il*-Kor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Infiltrator+il-Kor)


**Pack 3, Pick 4**


[Quiet Disrepair](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Quiet+Disrepair), [Saltskitter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Saltskitter), [Unblinking Bleb](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Unblinking+Bleb), [Llanowar Augur](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Llanowar+Augur), [Grinning Ignus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grinning+Ignus), [Fomori Nomad](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fomori+Nomad), [Logic Knot](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Logic+Knot), [Lucent Liminid](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lucent+Liminid), [Centaur Omenreader](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Centaur+Omenreader), [Mistmeadow Skulk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mistmeadow+Skulk), [Dryad Arbor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dryad+Arbor), [Coalition Relic](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Coalition+Relic)


[Coalition Relic](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Coalition+Relic) is a card I enjoy having in control deck or decks with a very expensive or decks with colour issues. This deck is none of these, meaning that we can happily pick the [Fomori Nomad](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fomori+Nomad) and fulfill the fatties quota the deck was needing.


Pick: [Fomori Nomad](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fomori+Nomad)


**Pack 3, Pick 5**


[Cutthroat *il*-Dal](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cutthroat+il-Dal), [Gift of Granite](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gift+of+Granite), [Quiet Disrepair](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Quiet+Disrepair), [Foresee](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Foresee), [Patrician's Scorn](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Patrician%27s+Scorn), [Logic Knot](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Logic+Knot), [Nessian Courser](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nessian+Courser), [Grave Scrabbler](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grave+Scrabbler), [Henchfiend of Ukor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Henchfiend+of+Ukor), [Ramosian Revivalist](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ramosian+Revivalist), [Arcanum Wings](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arcanum+Wings)


Pick: [Foresee](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Foresee)


**Pack 3, Pick 6**


[Lost Hours](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lost+Hours), [Petrified Plating](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Petrified+Plating), [Leaden Fists](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leaden+Fists), [Henchfiend of Ukor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Henchfiend+of+Ukor), [Death Rattle](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Death+Rattle), [Blind Phantasm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blind+Phantasm), [Lumithread Field](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lumithread+Field), [Narcomoeba](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Narcomoeba), [Skizzik Surger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skizzik+Surger), [Force of Savagery](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Force+of+Savagery)


The late [Death Rattle](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Death+Rattle) is surprising but of no concern to us. [Skizzik Surger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skizzik+Surger) is a card that I always see going really late. This guy is massive. Half the time you won't ever need to pay echo for the guy, because either he will have been killed or your opponent will have been. The echo isn't even that big considering that the [Skizzik](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skizzik) will be the last thing you play in your hand and you will have little to do with your mana then anyway. However, we have picked up enough expensive guys, and the [Leaden Fists](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leaden+Fists) is one step closer for us to complete the removal quota.


Pick: [Leaden Fists](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leaden+Fists)


**Pack 3, Pick 7**


[Venser's Diffusion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Venser%27s+Diffusion), [Oblivion Crown](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oblivion+Crown), [Emberwilde Augur](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Emberwilde+Augur), [Vedalken Aethermage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vedalken+Aethermage), [Virulent Sliver](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Virulent+Sliver), [Frenzy Sliver](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Frenzy+Sliver), [Fomori Nomad](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fomori+Nomad), [Storm Entity](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Storm+Entity), [Magus of the Moat](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Magus+of+the+Moat)


I find the late Nomad surprising, but unfortunately it's not what I'm looking for anymore. [Venser's Diffusion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Venser%27s+Diffusion) might have made the final cutâ€”it might not be the best bounce spell out there but it gets the job done. We're lacking two drops, though, which leaves us deciding between [Emberwilde Augur](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Emberwilde+Augur) and [Storm Entity](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Storm+Entity). I experimented with a card that I haven't played very much and picked the Entity. It didn't make the final cut, whereas the Augur would have, so in that respect I should have picked the other card, but I believe in experimenting when it comes to crazy cards like this. In some decks, the Entity is crazy, but I didn't have quite enough suspend or cheap cards in the end to make him worth itâ€”my four drop was already quite full and what I needed was a two drop.


Pick: [Storm Entity](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Storm+Entity)


**Pack 3, Pick 8**


[Rift Elemental](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rift+Elemental), [Unblinking Bleb](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Unblinking+Bleb), [Lost Hours](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lost+Hours), [Grinning Ignus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grinning+Ignus), [Mass of Ghouls](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mass+of+Ghouls), [Zoetic Cavern](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Zoetic+Cavern), [Spin into Myth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spin+into+Myth), [Witch's Mist](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Witch%27s+Mist)


The first thing I saw when this pick popped up was the [Zoetic Cavern](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Zoetic+Cavern)s, which I was overjoyed to see, and it's a great card, as it let's you cheat on your land count. Then I noticed that [Spin into Myth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spin+into+Myth) was somehow still in the pack. This had to have been a pick anomalyâ€”the card is brilliant. It is a blue [Dark Banishing](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dark+Banishing) with a lil' extra on the side. It often 'kills' the guy and leaves them with a useless land for their next draw. It is certainly a first pick card and one that even now, writing this, I am amazed came this late. Another sign that blue was indeed open.


Pick: [Spin into Myth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spin+into+Myth)


**Pack 3, Pick 9**


[Rift Elemental](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rift+Elemental), [Augur *il*-Vec](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Augur+il-Vec), [Lymph Sliver](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lymph+Sliver), [Lumithread Field](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lumithread+Field), [Street Wraith](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Street+Wraith), [Spellwild Ouphe](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spellwild+Ouphe), [Dakmor Salvage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dakmor+Salvage)


The incredibly disappointing pack has made its way back and I get to pick my other "choice." Yay.


Pick: [Lumithread Field](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lumithread+Field)


**Pack 3, Pick 10**

![](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Island)


















There wasn't much to think about during deck construction. [Fury Charm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fury+Charm) and [Flamecore Elemental](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flamecore+Elemental) made their usual way to the bench, and after some deliberation, [Dreamscape Artist](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dreamscape+Artist) joined them, as I had no need for his fixing ability and didn't have very far to accelerate.


The deck wound up being nothing specialâ€”a typical blue-red deck full of little men and kinky tricks. After two unexciting matches, I split the final as I had a party to get to.


Till next week,
