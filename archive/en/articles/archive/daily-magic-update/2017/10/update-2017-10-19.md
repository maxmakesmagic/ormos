The October 19, 2017 Update
===========================

The Daily *Magic* Update is a roundup of everything *Magic* you should know on October 19, 2017. Today's Update is brought to you by [Tasos Lazarides](#4).


A Bit of News
=============


1. Store Championship Dates Expanded

After a bunch of feedback from players and stores, we have expanded the window for the *Ixalan* Store Championship. *Ixalan* Store Championships can now be held any day between Monday, December 25 and Sunday, December 31. Check with [your local store](http://locator.wizards.com/) for more information.


Today's Must
============


1. [Meet *Magic: The Gathering* World Champion William "Huey" Jensen](https://www.forbes.com/sites/laurenorsini/2017/10/19/meet-magic-the-gathering-world-champion-william-huey-jensen/#57701e1b4512) | Forbes | Lauren Orsini

In which our hero is interviewed by Lauren Orsini with *Forbes* and gives quotes like:


"I think I only played six Grand Prix over the past year. But in the last four I played, I finished first or second each time. That was enough to get me into the World Championship."


William Jensen, everyone: a deserving Champion and way better at *Magic* than you are.


Community Spotlight
===================


1. [Artifact Token Themed Commander Deck Tech](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPRLN-VG19Q) | Jumbo Commander

I really enjoy the format of these deck techs from Jumbo Commander. They're clear, easy to understand, and thorough. This particular deck tech is also pretty cool, as Jumbo (May I call you Jumbo? Or do you prefer Mr. Commander?) is inspired by [Revel in Riches](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Revel+in+Riches) to build an artifact token–based Commander deck. The result is pretty cool. Not as cool as Tasos Lazarides (I'm not sure anything is), but pretty cool, nonetheless.


<https://www.youtube.com/embed/kPRLN-VG19Q>


After Those, Read, Watch, or Listen to These
============================================


1. [*Magic: The Gathering Arena* Trump Stream Shows a Promising Game](http://toucharcade.com/2017/10/18/magic-the-gathering-arena-trump-stream-shows-a-promising-game/) | Touch Arcade | Tasos Lazarides

First, let me say that Tasos Lazarides is an awesome name. I'm jealous. I might name my firstborn Tasos Lazarides.


Second, Lazarides (so cool) wrote about yesterday's play stream, which you can watch [on our Twitch video archive page](https://go.twitch.tv/magic/videos/all) and decide for yourself. Though, if Tasos Lazarides is into it, then all the cool kids clearly love it.


1. [*Ixalan* Archetype Deeper Dive](http://lrcast.com/limited-resources-411-ixalan-archetype-deeper-dive/) | Limited Resources | Marshall Sutcliffe and Luis Scott-Vargas

You've listened to the deep dive, but now it's time to go *deeper*. For some reason, this reminds me of any movie or television scene where someone at a computer screen says "enhance" 20 times while zooming in on a blurry picture. It's kind of like that, but for *Ixalan* Limited.


1. [5 Interesting Decks from Nationals Weekend](https://www.channelfireball.com/articles/5-interesting-decks-from-nationals-weekend/) | ChannelFireball | Frank Karsten

They certainly are interesting and a bit off the beaten path, but, I am going to do a bit of self-promotion here: I totally have done three out of five of these as Deck of the Day. Our new slogan is going to be "Come for the latest *Magic* content, stay for the *world-beating*, *forward-thinking tech*."


That may be a bit wordy. I bet Tasos Lazarides could come up with something better.


1. [Riley Knight – Breaking Mirrors in Standard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlEwLkQ3taw) | TCGplayer | Riley Knight

Knight discusses ways to get a leg up in Standard mirror matches, but, really, you're watching this video for the clever clips paired with Riley's voice-over. It's basically a video that speaks in gifs—the language of the internet—so I know we're all fluent.


<https://www.youtube.com/embed/mlEwLkQ3taw>


1. [Oppressive Wills, Part II](https://www.hipstersofthecoast.com/2017/10/oppressive-wills-part-ii-mtg-edh-commander-history/) | Hipsters of the Coast | Ryan Sainio

If you missed [Part I](https://www.hipstersofthecoast.com/2017/10/oppressive-wills-part-i-mtg-edh-commander-history/), it's not too late! Because it's the internet, and nothing ever disappears. Also, because it's a fun jaunt through Commander history that will leave you thinking "Why don't we do that anymore?"

SaffronOlive often comes up with decks that take the internet by storm, but this might be the most discussion I've ever seen about a deck first thing in the morning. It could be the critical mass of cool *Ixalan* cards it has in it—[Sunbird's Invocation](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sunbird%27s+Invocation); [Tishana, Voice of Thunder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tishana%2C+Voice+of+Thunder); and [Growing Rites of Itlimoc](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Growing+Rites+of+Itlimoc) to start. It could be that [Panharmonicon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Panharmonicon) is involved. It could be that when the deck works, it goes off like an intricate puzzle. Whatever the reason, [people seem to love it](https://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/77bsbq/against_the_odds_sunbirds_invocation_standard/).


Deck of the Day
===============


1. [Standard Oketra's Monument Returns](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/mtgo-standings/competitive-standard-constructed-league-2017-10-18)

A flavor of the month not too long ago, [Oketra's Monument](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oketra%27s+Monument) is starting to make a comeback in a format that seems open to Tokens taking over.


While [Anointed Procession](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Anointed+Procession) is all the rage these days, *Magic Online* players like Ringo\_ have quietly been putting up results with a certain token-producing, cost-reducing artifact. The deck even got two new toys from *Ixalan*.


[![](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Kinjalli%27s+Sunwing)](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kinjalli%27s+Sunwing) [![](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Legion%27s+Landing)](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Legion%27s+Landing)[![](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Adanto%2C+the+First+Fort)](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Adanto%2C+the+First+Fort)Transform
Sunwing lets you stay ahead of your opponents even more while they struggle to keep up with your token producers, and [Legion's Landing](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Legion%27s+Landing), the darling of Standard at the moment, is just really, really good.


The lower number of [Abrade](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Abrade)s in the format and the weakness of blue-black to artifacts have given this deck another day in the sun. Whether that lasts, only Oketra knows.


Or, rather, knew. Too soon?
