Both Eric Blanchet and Bill Tsang have found themselves in their first Grand Prix Top 8 this weekend. Top 8ing any Grand Prix is no easy task, but the achievement is even more impressive when one takes into account the massive size of this tournament.



Bill Tsang has been crushing drafts all day by playing the most aggressive strategies available, his penchant for Red cards has served him well today. He’s looking to light up the Top 8 with a hyper-aggressive Blue Red deck.



His opponent, Eric Blanchet, is also playing an aggressive strategy, but he’s certainly the control player in this matchup with his White Blue deck. He’ll need to hold on long enough for his more powerful cards to matter if he wants to stand a chance against Tsang.



In the first game, Blanchet seemed to have the perfect two mana creature, Jeskai Student, to stave off Tsang’s army of 2/1s, but he quickly fell behind as Tsang mounted more and more pressure.

Tsang’s [Humble Defector](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Humble+Defector), Valley Dasher, and [Bloodfire Expert](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodfire+Expert) continued getting in for damage as Tsang chained tricks turn after turn.



It looked like Blanchet might have stabilized on a key turn, but [Mardu Scout](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mardu+Scout) dashed into the red zone and the first game was over in the blink of an eye.



**Tsang 1 - 0 Blanchet**



In the second game, Tsang got off to an early start again with Leaping Master. Blanchet picked up his pen for a moment and put it down.



Tsang laughed, “ready for that Valley Dasher?”



“I was.”

Tsang’s board quickly grew out of control as Leaping Master, [Humble Defector](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Humble+Defector), and [Mardu Scout](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mardu+Scout) mounted an offense.



Blanchet had a blocker, but [Crippling Chill](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crippling+Chill) from Tsang meant that there would be no respite.



Blanchet tried to stabilize with a pair of blockers on the following turn, but [Icy Blast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Icy+Blast) from Tsang presented a lethal attack. Blanchet had [Pressure Point](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pressure+Point) to stay alive, but the cool power of Tsang’s rare instant was enough to end the game with just one more attack.



**Tsang 2 - 0 Blanchet**



Bill Tsang defeats Eric Blanchet in two quick games to advance to the semifinals.
