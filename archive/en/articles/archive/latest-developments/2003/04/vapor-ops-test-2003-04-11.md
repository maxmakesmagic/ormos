A few cards worth looking at
----------------------------


A couple of weeks ago I wrote an [article](/en/articles/archive/latest-developments/taking-vapor-ops-2003-03-14) about the process people have to go through in order to get a job in Wizards of the Coast R&D. The most interesting part of the process is the Vapor Ops test – seventy or so potential **Magic** cards for the prospective employees to think about. Around 83% of you said you were interested in hearing more about Vapor Ops so here’s what we’re going to do. This week I’m going to give you guys a portion of the test and I want you to email me your answers. I’ll read through your answers and then I’ll publish the most interesting submissions in a future column.


Here we go…


![](https://media.wizards.com/legacy/global/images/mtgcom_daily_rb66_pic1_en.jpg)### Instructions


(These are the exact instructions I received in August ’99, by the way.)


Attached please find “Vapor Ops.” Vapor Ops is a collection of new cards and some repeats. We want to know your opinion on each card. Should it be published? Is it too weak or too strong? Is it good for the game? Don’t limit yourself to these questions. There are very few right and wrong answers. Your reason for your decision is as or more important than the decision itself. (Please don’t be concerned with card names.)


(The instructions I got also included “Please do not include your name on this document. You have been assigned a number to keep the test objective” but that isn’t really relevant to you guys.)
