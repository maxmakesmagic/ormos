Rahman apologised nervously as she sat down at the feature match table. "I'm still a little slow", she explained, having only started playing a few months ago. This was her first GP, and she had battled her way to the 3-0 table only to be summoned to a feature match against the dreaded Saito. "I know who you are!", she laughed as the players introduced themselves.


Rahman summoned a [Tormented Hero](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tormented+Hero) and ran it into Saito's [Leafcrown Dryad](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leafcrown+Dryad), regenerating it with a [Boon of Erebos](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Boon+of+Erebos). Saito summoned a [Nessian Courser](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nessian+Courser) and passed, Rahman happy to trade her Hero against it with the aid of a [Pharika's Cure](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pharika%27s+Cure).


Saito summoned a [Heliod's Emissary](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Heliod%27s+Emissary), then bestowing it with another [Leafcrown Dryad](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leafcrown+Dryad). Rahman played what defence she could, but Saito didn't give her any opportunity to recover. He flashed in a [Boon Satyr](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Boon+Satyr) to take the first game in brutal fashion.


In between rounds, Saito and Rahman chuckled about the incongruously flamenco-style guitar music being piped over the speakers at the venue. "The music is good, but not good for thinking", Saito laughed. "I cannot do combat math to music."

*Tomoharu Saito, with a song in his heart and combat math on his mind.*

**Tomoharu Saito 1 - Diyana Abdul Rahman 0**


The second game started off less aggressively, with Saito summoning a [Nessian Courser](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nessian+Courser), Rahman with a [Returned Centaur](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Returned+Centaur) to keep things under control. Saito tried an attack with his Courier, and Rahman blocked. A pause stretched into eternity - we all held our breath - and Saito smiled and moved his Courier back to his side of the battlefield. Rahman pumped a little first in victory - correctly calling a Pro's bluff is one of the better feelings in competitive *Magic* - and looked to her board to see how she could take the game.


Rahman summoned a [Baleful Eidolon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Baleful+Eidolon), while Saito had a [Fabled Hero](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fabled+Hero) and a [Chosen by Heliod](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chosen+by+Heliod) to swing the game in his favour. When he attacked, Rahman had a [Boon of Erebos](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Boon+of+Erebos) to block and kill the Courier, while the [Fabled Hero](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fabled+Hero) punched on in for a healthy chunk of her life total. A [Sip of Hemlock](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sip+of+Hemlock) finished off the Hero, allowing Rahman to attack unopposed for the first time in the match.

*Rahman ruminates her next assault.*

Saito had a [Vulpine Goliath](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vulpine+Goliath), while Rahman summoned a Grey Merchant of Asphodel to even out the life totals somewhat. Saito played a [Phalanx Leader](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phalanx+Leader) and then flash-bestowed a [Boon Satyr](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Boon+Satyr) onto it, spreading a Heroic trigger around and generally getting all up in Rahman's grill. An attack step later, and it was all over.


**Tomoharu Saito 2 - Diyana Abdul Rahman 0**


Post-match, Saito and Rahman chatted briefly about their mutual love of excellent Japanese food, before Saito offered to workshop Rahman's deck with her. Rahman's deck was originally mono-black in construction, but with a bevy of powerful cards in her sideboard.


A few pointers from the master, and Rahman moved on to the rest of the day's rounds with bolstered confidence (and a mean-looking deck!), having survived her first feature match against one of *Magic*'s true gentlemen.

*Post-game analysis forms a big part of improving at Magic, and there are few better teachers than Saito.*
