Day 2 Coverage



With 354 teams battling in three formats at once, the weekend featured a wealth of spicy brews and provided a deeper insight into the current state of Standard, Modern, and Legacy. Also, we got to witness a number of close and exciting matches, nailbiters and rollercoasters all around. It was carnage, really, and after the first day's eight rounds, only 45 teams had qualified for Day 2.


In the end, four teams gathered in the feature match area for the playoffs, including multiple World *Magic* Cup and Grand Prix champions. In fact, the only team for whom this marked the first big break was the British trio of Christoph Green, Ben Jones, and Charles Eliatamby—but they made it count. They first dispatched five-time GP Top 8er Elias Watsfeldt, Pro Tour champion Joel Larsson, and Per Nyström in the semifinals in two matches, leaving the third unfinished. Then they repeated this feat in the finals against Andreas Petersen, Michael Bonde, and Thomas Enevoldsen, the latter two of whom had just won the Team Grand Prix Lyon in November.


It certainly wasn't an easy path to victory, adding all the more meaning to this triumph. So congratulations to Christoph Green, Ben Jones, and Charles Eliatamby, champions of Grand Prix Madrid 2018!

 Simple math suggested that there'd be one 8-0 team at Grand Prix Madrid this year, but things didn't turn out simple. Instead, after a series of unintentional draws, we got no 8-0 team but...](/en/events/coverage/gpmad18/day-1s-undefeated-decks-2018-03-11)





Day 1 Coverage



In the morning, a total of 354 teams started playing the first Team Trios Constructed Grand Prix this side of the Atlantic/Pacific, with high hopes for fame and fortune. But after eight rounds of Standard/Modern/Legacy, only 45 of those teams reached the requisite record of 6-2 or better to qualify for the second day.


Leading the charge into Day 2 were three teams at 7-0-1: Elias Klocker/Florian Koch/Carsten Linden, Michael Bonde/Thomas Enevoldsen/Andreas Petersen, and Iñigo Vallejo Pascual/Miguel Castro/Pedro Lechado Artigues.


Check back tomorrow for all the action live from the battlefield, for decklists, and for the epic conclusion of Grand Prix Madrid 2018!

One of the things I did not expect from Grand Prix Madrid was torrential rain. As a Brit we're used to being drowned by the weather at home, not in "sunny” Spain. It must be a Magic in Spain...
