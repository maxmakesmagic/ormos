This week's "Sketches" focuses on a new green token generator, [Kamahl's Summons](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kamahl%27s+Summons) by Anthony S. Waters.


### 1. Art Description


These are the instructions given to the artist:

"At Kamahl's command, forest matter (soil, roots, bark, etc) magically coalesces and takes the shape of two large bears."


### 2. Sketch


This is the preliminary sketch submitted by Anthony.


### 3. Final Art


Here is a large version of the final piece. There was some concern in R&D that the bears looked like they were being formed out of water, but when put in a green card frame, the art conveyed the creation of bears from the forest well enough.


### 4. Card


Finally, here is the card as it appears in the set.
