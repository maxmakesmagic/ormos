Walking the Planes went to Pro Tour *Fate Reforged* and came back with a slew of jokes about everyone's favorite topic: math! If you just thought "huh?" we're not surprised. It's no secret that *Magic* is one of the most enjoyable ways to learn basic skills in mathematics, but the fun doesn't stop there. Watch Nathan troll the pros, learn about game design from Ian Duke, and behold as our Pro Tour champion takes his deck to infinity and beyond!
