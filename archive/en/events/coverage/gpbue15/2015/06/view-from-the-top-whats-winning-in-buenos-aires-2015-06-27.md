We’re establishing a much clearer picture of the metagame as we enter the final round of Day 1 here in Buenos Aires. At the beginning of the day, the format seemed more diverse than ever. It was rare to see even two copies of the same deck at a single table. One would expect the dust to settle and for a few key archetypes to rise to the top, but the diversity of the top tables remains a testament to the format’s depth from a deck building perspective.



Let’s talk about the archetypes that are currently playing for an undefeated record on Day 1 of Grand Prix Buenos Aires!



Abzan strategies have nudged their way to the front of the line again. In recent weeks, we’ve seen stranger versions of the deck do very well: Abzan Megamorph, Abzan Midrange like the deck Lucas Siow won Grand Prix Toronto with. This weekend, a pair of Abzan Aggro decks are facing off for an undefeated record in the final round of Day 1. The format has become very diverse and strong disruption backed up by a fast clock seems to be one of the best strategies for this weekend.



There’s a Green Devotion player also currently sitting at 8-0. The player is currently facing off against Sidisi Whip for an undefeated Day 1 record.



Speaking of Sidisi Whip, there’s another copy of the deck also playing for an undefeated record against a Mardu opponent. Sidisi Whip strategies were all but forgotten less than ten days ago and now they represent a third of the decks in contention for an undefeated record here on Day 1.

The lone undefeated Mardu player is packing multiple copies of Kolaghan’s Command and at least some number of Hidden Dragonslayer, proving that there’s still a ton of room for innovation and improvement in this Standard environment.



One of the more exciting decks that’s doing well this weekend is Naya Mastery. The deck had success in trial events on Friday and many players at the top tables are sporting this relatively rogue archetype, including [20] Craig Wescoe, who enters round nine with only a single loss.



As we descend into the X-1 bracket, the format becomes wide open again. It seems likely that no single archetype will account for more than 20% of the field as we enter the second day of competition.



Will Sidisi Whip and Abzan Aggro continue to dominate Grand Prix Buenos Aires? Stay tuned for undefeated decklists from Day 1 and more exciting action from Day 2 of Grand Prix Buenos Aires!
