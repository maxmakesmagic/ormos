[![Magic Hall of Fame](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/tournamentcenter/halloffame.jpg)](/en/node/574031)LLegendary Dutch **Magic**  player Bram Snepvangers will join Gabriel Nassif, Brian Kibler, and Tomoharu Saito in the [**Magic**  Pro Tour Hall of Fame](/en/node/574031) Class of 2010.

An inconsistency between Wizards of the Coast's published rules and the mathematical formula used to count votes was discovered after announcing the 2010 inductees last weekend at Pro Tour–Amsterdam. After the voting totals were recalculated using the correct .67 multiplier instead of .667 for Selection Committee votes, Snepvangers's weighted total of 40.03% exceeded the 40% threshold necessary for induction.

Snepvangers has played in 63 Pro Tours in his career and has four Pro Tour Top 8 appearances, eight Grand Prix Top 8 appearances, and 317 lifetime Pro Points. His influence has stretched throughout the Dutch **Magic** community as a player, tournament organizer, and judge since he started playing in 1996. 

The four elected players will be inducted into the Pro Tour Hall of Fame in a ceremony at the 2010 World Championships in Chiba, Japan on December 9-12.
