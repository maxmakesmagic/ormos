![Hurloon Minotaur](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Hurloon+Minotaur)**[Hurloon Minotaur](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hurloon+Minotaur)** – *Limited Edition Alpha* common. There was a time when [Hurloon Minotaur](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hurloon+Minotaur) was the official face of **Magic: The Gathering**, appearing on shirts, jackets, and even welcoming people to game stores as a giant statue. Unfortunately, a vanilla 2/3 for ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20211201201921im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless1.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227130159im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/red.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227130159im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/red.gif) wasn't good enough to live up to the image.
 ![Vedalken Heretic](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Vedalken+Heretic)**[Vedalken Heretic](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vedalken+Heretic)** – *Alara Reborn* rare. The art for [Vedalken Heretic](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vedalken+Heretic) shows a [Lorescale Coatl](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lorescale+Coatl), which (not so coincidentally) works very well with the heretic in play.
 ![River of Tears](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=River+of+Tears)**[River of Tears](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=River+of+Tears)** – *Future Sight* rare. [River of Tears](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=River+of+Tears), like the other *Future Sight* dual lands, comes from its own strange alternate reality. All we know about that plane is what we can deduce from the art, namely that it's pretty.
 ![Avarice Totem](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Avarice+Totem)**[Avarice Totem](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Avarice+Totem)** – *Fifth Dawn* uncommon. Like the Jinxed artifacts ([Jinxed Choker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jinxed+Choker), [Jinxed Idol](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jinxed+Idol), and [Jinxed Ring](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jinxed+Ring)), [Avarice Totem](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Avarice+Totem) tends to change sides a lot in the course of a game. But *unlike* them, it brings joy and goodness instead of pain and misery.
 ![Gluttonous Slime](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Gluttonous+Slime)**[Gluttonous Slime](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gluttonous+Slime)** – *Conflux* uncommon. Have you ever noticed the two creatures trapped inside the [Gluttonous Slime](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gluttonous+Slime)? They're in there!
 ![Wanderlust](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Wanderlust)**[Wanderlust](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wanderlust)** – *Limited Edition Alpha* uncommon. [Wanderlust](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wanderlust) is one of the few cards to have exactly the same name in English and German. This makes perfect sense, of course, when you consider that the word "Wanderlust" was originally German. (It means "a strong desire or impulse to wander").
 ![Devoted Druid](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Devoted+Druid)**[Devoted Druid](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Devoted+Druid)** – *Shadowmoor* common. The flavor behind [Devoted Druid](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Devoted+Druid) is "coaxing mana from a meager source". The druid in the art is concentrating on a desolate patch of land, but still creating growth. This effort has a physical effect on her, as shown by the -1/-1 counters.
 ![Subterranean Shambler](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Subterranean+Shambler)**[Subterranean Shambler](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Subterranean+Shambler)** – *Time Spiral* common. The [Subterranean Shambler](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Subterranean+Shambler) is, like many other *Time Spiral* cards, a callback to an earlier card. But while [Subterranean Spirit](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Subterranean+Spirit) damages nonflying creatures by tapping, the Shambler does it only when it first appears (toppling the poor creatures unlucky enough to be standing in the wrong spot) or vanishes (presumably creating a sinkhole).
 ![Groundling Pouncer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Groundling+Pouncer)**[Groundling Pouncer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Groundling+Pouncer)** – *Eventide* uncommon. [Groundling Pouncer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Groundling+Pouncer)'s flavor is based on the army of Endry (of the three faeries of the [Vendilion Clique](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vendilion+Clique)). In the *Eventide* novel, Endry's army is composed of non-flying faeries called "groundlings."
 ![Canopy Crawler](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Canopy+Crawler)**[Canopy Crawler](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Canopy+Crawler)** – *Legions* uncommon. In the days of *Onslaught-Legions* limited, [Canopy Crawler](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Canopy+Crawler) was a very popular pick in the "Beasts deck". Combined with [Contested Cliffs](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Contested+Cliffs), things could go very well for the wise [Canopy Crawler](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Canopy+Crawler) drafter.
 ![Krosan Cloudscraper](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Krosan+Cloudscraper)**[Krosan Cloudscraper](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Krosan+Cloudscraper)** – *Legions* rare. In the art for [Krosan Cloudscraper](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Krosan+Cloudscraper), it's ripping up chunks of the Krosan forest that surrounds it. That's represented in its mechanics by the ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20220123123600im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/green.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20220123123600im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/green.gif) upkeep cost!
 ![Celestial Ancient](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Celestial+Ancient)**[Celestial Ancient](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Celestial+Ancient)** – *Dissension* rare. When Mark Tedin got the assignment for [Celestial Ancient](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Celestial+Ancient), he drew in some facial similarities to an earlier elemental with a similar effect: [Forgotten Ancient](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forgotten+Ancient). The creative team liked it so much, they gave it a name that called back to the same thing!
 ![Two-Headed Giant of Foriys](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Two-Headed+Giant+of+Foriys)**[Two-Headed Giant](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Two-Headed+Giant)** – *Limited Edition Beta* rare. The "Foriys" in "[Two-Headed Giant of Foriys](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Two-Headed+Giant+of+Foriys)" is pronounced "four-eyes". Because he's got four eyes, see?
 ![Sealed Fate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Sealed+Fate)**[Sealed Fate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sealed+Fate)** – *Mirage* uncommon. [Sealed Fate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sealed+Fate) lent its name to a *Future Sight* mechanic that appeared on only [Mesmeric Sliver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Mesmeric%2BSliver) [Spin into Myth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Spin%2Binto%2BMyth): *fateseal*.
 ![Updraft](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Updraft)**[Updraft](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Updraft)** – *Ice Age* uncommon. The flavor text on the *Ice Age* version of [Updraft](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Updraft) features a Sky Mage named Arnjlot Olasson, who appears on three other flying-based cards in *Ice Age*, including [Arnjlot's Ascent](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arnjlot%27s+Ascent).
 ![Doubling Cube](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Doubling+Cube)**[Doubling Cube](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Doubling+Cube)** – *Tenth Edition* rare. In **Magic**, a doubling cube is an artifact that doubles the amount of mana in your pool. But in backgammon, a doubling cube is a six-sided die marked with 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, and 64, to show how big the current stakes are!
 ![Limited Resources](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Limited+Resources)**[Limited Resources](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Limited+Resources)** – *Exodus* rare. You think [Armageddon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Armageddon) is an unfriendly form of land destruction? Check out *Exodus*'s [Limited Resources](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Limited+Resources), which (with a few [Stone Rain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stone+Rain)s or [Frenzied Tilling](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Frenzied+Tilling)s) can actually prevent further lands from being played at all!
 ![Flame Wave](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Flame+Wave)**[Flame Wave](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flame+Wave)** – *Stronghold* uncommon. There's something cool in the art for [Flame Wave](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flame+Wave), but you have to look really, really closely. For a better look at it, check out [this Arcana](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/arcana/115)!
 ![Giant Shark](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Giant+Shark)**[Giant Shark](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Giant+Shark)** – *The Dark* common. [Giant Shark](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Giant+Shark) once was on a list of "Sea Serpent" variants for use in **Magic Online** *Masters Edition* sets. Despite its awesome name and flavor (it gets a bonus against wounded creatures!), [Giant Shark](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Giant+Shark) still waits on the sidelines while [Red Cliffs Armada](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Red+Cliffs+Armada) and [Vodalian Knights](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vodalian+Knights) have been printed online.
 ![Coalhauler Swine](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Coalhauler+Swine)**[Coalhauler Swine](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Coalhauler+Swine)** – *Ravnica: City of Guilds* common. When the Grand Creature Type Update came around, the [Coalhauler Swine](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Coalhauler+Swine) got a more specific creature type. No longer a mere "Beast", it became a much more classy "Boar Beast".
 ![Jinxed Idol](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Jinxed+Idol)**[Jinxed Idol](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jinxed+Idol)** – *Tempest* rare. [Jinxed Idol](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jinxed+Idol) was one of the last of the "four-letter flavor text" cards, a cycle that began with *Mirage*'s [Ray of Command](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ray+of+Command): "Heel."
 ![Lavalanche](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Lavalanche)**[Lavalanche](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lavalanche)** – *Alara Reborn* rare. The scale of [Lavalanche](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lavalanche) is a little hard to pick up at first, but if you look closely, you'll discover that the wave of lava is engulfing entire buildings!
