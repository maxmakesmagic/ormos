The Daily *Magic* Update is a roundup of everything *Magic* you should know on November 13, 2017. Today's Update is brought to you by Dogsnail Engine. It's an engine. Run by a dogsnail. Dogsnail Engine.


What You Might Have Missed This Weekend
=======================================


1. [[UST] Dogsnail Engine (full card)](https://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/7c5iyv/ust_dogsnail_engine_full_card/)

This one was fun. On Friday, nine different community members received mysterious packages from, well, me. Inside each package was a piece of a larger card, all of which were "assembled" virtually by the internet, eventually resulting in *Unstable*'s first preview card—the Contraption Dogsnail Engine!


1. Three Grand Prix

Grand Prix Shanghai, Warsaw, and Atlanta all took place over the weekend, all featuring Standard, and all featuring some bit of innovation and interesting gameplay. Warsaw and (parts of) Atlanta were broadcast on Twitch, so you can check those out on our [Twitch video archive page](https://go.twitch.tv/magic/videos/all). But if you're looking for a faster, more text-based archive, we've got you covered there too:

1. *Duel Decks: Merfolk vs. Goblins* gameplay videos

While everyone is getting excited about *Unstable* and the release of *Iconic Masters*, *Duel Decks: Merfolk vs. Goblins* slipped into stores this past weekend, and a number of people reviewed or played with it over the weekend. Here are some of the videos from those fine internet folks.


* [Merfolk vs. Goblins](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZjuM8Cdeyc&t=808s) | YoungMage
* [*Duel Decks: Merfolk vs. Goblins* Gameplay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCxUvZRi8eQ) | ChannelFireball
* [GamePlay *Duel Decks: Merfolk vs. Goblins*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsJWFqld_bY) | Magic4Ever (this is in Spanish, but, honestly, there's not much you need to hear. It's just them playing. And what sounds like a small child in the background.)

There were also about 87 different unboxing videos, but you can find those easily on YouTube just by searching for "Merfolk vs. Goblins." Turns out that string of words is very specific to this product. Who knew?


Today's Previews
================


Every day I'll highlight the day's previews found elsewhere on the interwebs (read: not on DailyMTG). Day one is light as we focus on mechanics and introducing you to the set. You might start seeing some others later this evening (because time zones), but just these two extra for today.


1. [Earl of Squirrel](https://magic.wizards.com/en/products/unstable) | *Unstable* Product Page.

We all knew our Squirrel overlord would come one day.


1. Yet to come: [@Wizards\_Magic](https://twitter.com/wizards_magic) social challenge

Watch our Twitter early this afternoon (Pacific time).


Also, Read, Watch, or Listen to These
=====================================


1. [Social Currency](http://www.starcitygames.com/article/36159_Social-Currency.html) | StarCityGames.com | Gerry Thompson

This ran on SCG Premium a few weeks back, but has been moved over to the free side in large part because it's a fantastic article. In it, Gerry reflects on a time he wasn't a boon to the *Magic* community, how he became a better person, what it took to get there, and why it was worth the transformation.


1. [FINALE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1AXZcU_B50) │ Magic: Shandalar #37 │ ProJared Plays!

We've checked in on ProJared now and then as he played through *Shandalar*. It felt like it would always be there. But no! This is it—the finale. Godspeed, ProJared. Shandalar is safer thanks to you.

Community Spotlight
===================


1. [Scryed Away Sunday](http://www.masterofmagics.co.uk/community/scryed-away-sunday-12-nov-17/) | Master of Magics | Abbie

Master of Magics is a UK-based site that has started a weekly roundup of *Magic* news on Sundays. What a brilliant idea!


What People Are Talking About
=============================


1. > 
> Wow [@CoreyBaumeister](https://twitter.com/CoreyBaumeister?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) with his 4th Standard top 8 in a row. Let's go Genesis!

This is definitely something to keep watching. Everyone calls Corey Baumeister "Brad Nelson's brother," but this is an accomplishment even Brad hasn't notched. Something to watch for at the next constructed Grand Prix.

100% fake news. But, like, actually fake news. Really, he made this up. As he will be throughout the lead-up to *Unstable*.


Deck of the Day
===============


1. [Standard Desert Red](https://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/gpatl17/top-8-decklists-2017-11-12)

Desert Red? Isn't that just Ramunap Red? Excellent question.


Ben Stark, apparently, found Desert Red as an answer to this format and your question.


By dropping some of the deck's aggression (no [Earthshaker Khenra](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Earthshaker+Khenra)) and adding in some slower, more midrangey cards ([Treasure Map](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treasure+Map), [Glorybringer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glorybringer)), Ben Stark made his way to the finals of Grand Prix Atlanta with an updated take on Ramunap Red that actively *wanted* to play against Temur.


The key card was [Sand Strangler](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sand+Strangler), which was basically just [Flametongue Kavu](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flametongue+Kavu) all weekend. By playing twelve Deserts, Stark ensured the Strangler was always on.


Speaking of Deserts, Stark played twelve of them, including three—yes three—[Dunes of the Dead](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dunes+of+the+Dead) which could be sacrificed to feed any other desert *and* create a 2/2.


The end result was a wildly new take on the archetype that looks like it could just be the next big thing.
