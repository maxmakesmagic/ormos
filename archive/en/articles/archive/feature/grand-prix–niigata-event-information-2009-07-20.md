![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/gp_chromemox.jpg)*Get your free promo card by playing in the Grand Prix (while supplies last).* Long used as a port city, Niigata is sometimes called the "City of Water" because of the two rivers that flow through it, its position next to the Japan Sea, its many wetlands, and the canals that used to run through the city. It is also sometimes referred to as the "City of Willows" because of the willow trees that lined the old canals. In recent years, the city has been promoting itself as a "Designated City of Food and Flowers" highlighting its agricultural areas outside of the city center. Niigata is renowned for its rich variety of seafood and saké. Fans of popular Japanese culture will also recognize it as the home city of manga artists Takahashi Rumiko and Obata Takeshi.


This is the second Grand Prix to be held in Niigata. The first was held in 2005, and won by Katsuhiro Mori, who went on to win the World Championships that year, also held in Japan. Niigata is home to a number of Japanese **Magic** luminaries, including Masayasu Tanahashi (Pro Tour¬–Kyoto Top 8, Grand Prix–Kobe 2008 Top 8) and Yuta Takahashi (2007 Japan Nationals Top 8, 2007 Pro Tour Rookie of the Year, Grand Prix–Shizuoka 2008 Champion, 2008 Japan Nationals Top 8, Grand Prix–Kobe 2008 Champion, Grand Prix–Singapore 2009 Top 8). 


*The **Magic: The Gathering**  Grand Prix tournament series is a great reason to get out of the house, catch up with old friends, meet some new ones, and play **Magic**. Grand Prix tournaments are world-wide open events that allow all **Magic**  players to participate and experience the thrill of a large-scale competition. In addition to $30,000 in cash prizes, Pro Tour invitations for the top 16 finishers, and exclusive foil promo cards for participants, Grand Prix feature a host of other activities, including public events and artist signings.

A bye is normally given out to a player when there are an odd number of players in a round, but byes may also be rewarded to players for previous performance at a tournament or as a prize at a Trial tournament. Byes will be given to players in the Grand Prix based on the following criteria *(Byes are not cumulative throughout the season or year. Byes do not pass down under any circumstances.
