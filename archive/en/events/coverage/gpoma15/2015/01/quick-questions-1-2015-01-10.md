Modern is a format filled with options. With seemingly every color combination seeing action, and archetypes ranging across the entire aggro-combo-control spectrum, “wide open” is a description you’ll hear open. But that doesn’t mean the larger metagame of deck choices aren’t apply.


We canvassed a few of the big names at Grand Prix Omaha to see how they answered a simple question: What do you expect at Grand Prix Omaha?

Ari Lax had prepared for the weekend by heading in a different direction than the crowd.


“I expect a lot of Pod and Delver on Day 2,” said Pro Tour *Khans of Tarkir* champion and tenth-ranked Ari Lax. “On Day 1 it can be literally anything.”

Pro Tour Magic 2015 Top 8 contender Patrick Cox had a broader answer.


“A lot of Blue-Red or Temur Delver. Probably various [Siege Rhino](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Siege+Rhino) decks, like Pod and Rock,” Cox said. “Modern is pretty diverse. There’s probably against Affinity and random combos, but that’s what I think will be a plurality of the field.”

Back-to-back World Champion Shahar Shenhar had a simpler answer.


“Blue-Red Delver or [Siege Rhino](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Siege+Rhino),” was eighth-ranked Shahar Shenhar’s answer, content to believe in the trends leading up to the event.

Pro Tour Hall of Famer William Jensen kept it to just cards.


Sixth-ranked William Jensen had the briefest answer of all: “[Treasure Cruise](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treasure+Cruise) or [Birthing Pod](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Birthing+Pod). That’s it.”


Was Modern really all about two cards? Was it as nuanced and complex and we imagine? Grand Prix Omaha was just one of many data points to help you decide the right answer.
