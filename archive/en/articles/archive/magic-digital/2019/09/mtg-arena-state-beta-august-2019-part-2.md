Oh, hey—looks like we forgot to mention something last week . . .

Courtside Action
================


Here's what you need to know:


* September 4
* That's Today
* Play 1v1 Brawl on *MTG Arena*
* Use *Throne of Eldraine* Brawl Decks
* Earn up to six playsets of uncommon cards from *Throne of Eldraine*
* No entry fee

If you're still reading, we're going to assume it's because you have questions like "What is Brawl?" or "How does Brawl work on *MTG Arena*?" or "Wait, like . . . play with *Throne of Eldraine* cards right now?"


And to answer that last one—yes! Starting ~~today~~ right now, we're giving you the best seats in the Realm where you can preview, play, and earn *Throne of Eldraine* cards on *MTG Arena*. Players will have until September 9 to participate in a special *Eldraine* Courtside Brawl event, which allows you to play with four preconstructed Brawl decks based on the tabletop product that will be hitting shelves in October.


There is no entry fee, you can swap your deck anytime between matches, and each win up to six will reward you with a playset (that's four copies) of an uncommon card from *Throne of Eldraine*. And if you want to learn more, or need some light reading material while you finish updating the game, [here's a guide we put together](https://forums.mtgarena.com/forums/threads/59651) that covers everything you need to know about Brawl and how to play in *MTG Arena*.


Also, remember those Standard 2020 events we talked about last week?

When we said "Play with decks only using cards from *Guilds of Ravnica* forward," that *technically* includes *Throne of Eldraine*. So yes, you will be able to use your *Throne of Eldraine* reward cards in Standard 2020 events, and you can only earn those cards by playing in the Courtside Brawl event. You won't be able to craft them or find them in booster packs until the set officially releases on September 26.


That's when you're launching, right?
====================================


Yes, but we figured most people would've stopped reading to go play Brawl by this point. So, uh, yeah! *MTG Arena* is officially removing the Open Beta tag on September 26! Play now to earn your Open Beta participation reward Fblthp player avatar and card sleeve while you can.

But this is a State of the Beta. If you want to know more about *MTG Arena*'s launch roadmap, you're looking for the State of the *Game*, which will arrive around September 19.


Until then, we'll see you courtside!
