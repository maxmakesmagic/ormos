SUNDAY COVERAGE
---------------



 Throughout his illustrious **Magic** career, one accomplishment had eluded Patrick Chapin—until now. The Hall of Famer defeated Nam Sung Wook in the finals of Pro Tour *Journey into Nyx* to earn his first Pro Tour title in a career that stretches all the way back to the debut of the game. Behind the power of Elspeth, Sun's Champion, Fleecemane Lion, Chapin's Junk Midrange deck overpowered Nam's Constellation deck to win the finals in four games.




 Chapin's path to his first title was a journey fitting of a hero. In the quarterfinals he defeated fellow long-time player Jamie Parke and then had to take down reigning Player of the Year Josh Utter-Leyton in the semifinals. With a throng of friends gathered around him as he hoisted his trophy, Chapin's long quest to earn a Pro Tour title had been completed. Next on Chapin's career path is a shot at the **Magic** World Championship, an invitation to which he earned with his victory here in Atlanta.
