*Got any awesome **Magic** stories from the holiday break?*


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/mtgcom/authorpics/authorpic_kennagle.jpg)**Kenneth Nagle:** 


This holiday break, I was playing **Duels of the Planeswalkers** and unlocking cards by playing the same deck over and over. I found it somewhat tedious if I didn't enjoy the deck—but unlocking cards was definitely something I wanted to do. I was reminded of an achievement I suggested be put in the game. Basically, the achievement would be "defeat every opponent with every deck." It was never implemented, but I thought to myself, "I'm gonna do it anyway!"


In the current **Duels of the Planeswalkers** content (base game, Expansion 1, Expansion 2, and Expansion 3), I count 17 decks and 37 opponents in the single-player campaign. That's 629 game wins to get "Nagle's Achievement."


What's more, I'm recording my games and uploading them to YouTube once per day this year until I achieve this or my willpower breaks. The playlist is [here](http://www.youtube.com/user/NorrYtt#grid/user/FDA90D4C3AC69FCE).
