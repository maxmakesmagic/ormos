![](https://media.wizards.com/legacy//mtg/images/daily/mm/mm52_exiled.jpg)Welcome to Exiled Week. This is one of those loose themes where the columnists are allowed to hit the theme in whatever way they wish. I could talk about the exile zone (the zone formerly known as "the removed-from-the-game zone") and my quest to get it renamed; I could talk about designing cards that exile things; I could talk about the creation of *From the Vault: Exiled*, which Tom LaPille, Mark Purvis, and I put together. When I sat down to write this, I had no idea which way I'd go. I decided to be inspired in the moment.

I've talked about my dislike of the term "removed from the game," as it never meant what it says, but I've covered this topic in my column multiple times. The story is basically: "I disliked it. I complained. Others disliked it. They complained. When M10 rolled around we saw a chance to change it and we did." It's just not a topic that is going to fill several thousand words.

I thought about what I could say about using the exiled zone as a design tool. It boiled down to – "It's nice to have somewhere to put things other than in play, hand, graveyard and library. I make use of it when I need it." Also not worthy of a full column.

I explored what I could say about *From the Vault: Exiled* and then realized that Tom [had already written a column on it](/Magic/magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/ld/50). That also got scratched off.

So what do I write about? With nowhere else to turn, I've decided to try something we used to do back in my improv days. I am going to free associate on the word and see where I end up. That will be what I write about today.

*Exiled*

*Removed from the game*

*Removed from **Magic***

*Things **Magic** once had*

Got it! Okay, let me set this up correctly. When I was a kid, my parents used to tell me stories about when they were kids and how they didn't have half the things we had as kids. As I got older, I used to always make fun of them for this. *(using old man voice)* "In my day..."

And then, I had kids. Before I knew it, I was telling them stories about my youth. How we didn't have half the things they have. My eldest daughter Rachel, 9, for example, has been bugging me for a cell phone. I told her to go ask her mother how old she was when she got her first cell phone. I realized that I was taking the first steps towards becoming a crotchety old man.

[![Show All Footnotes](https://media.wizards.com/legacy//mtg/images/daily/mm/mm52_showallfootnotes.jpg)](javascript:void(0);)For today's column I'm going to channel my inner crotchety old man to explain how **Magic** has changed in the last sixteen years, to show what has been exiled from the game. Non-crotchety me will return next week when I do this year's State of Design column (including some interesting tidbits about the upcoming *Zendikar* block). As some of you might not get all the references crotchety old me might make, I am going to footnote all the relevant points so that I can explain then in non-crotchety language. All you need to see the footnote is click on the number which will open it up. You might want to read through everything before you come back and read all the footnotes as I'm a little on the wordy side while explaining the footnotes (me, wordy—who could've guessed?).

Until then, enjoy crotchety old man Mark. (Please read this hearing my crotchety old man voice.)

![](http://wizards.com//mtg/images/daily/mm/mm52_blackLotus.jpg)  
These kids today and their **Magic**! In my day, we didn't have no sixty-card decks. We had forty-card decks and we liked it. [(1)](javascript:void(0);) And when you lost, you had a thirty-nine-card deck. [(2)](javascript:void(0);) That's just the way it was. We didn't have no banned or restricted lists. There was no one telling you how many cards you could play. [(3)](javascript:void(0);) If you wanted to play twenty [Black Lotus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Black+Lotus)es then that's what you played. [(4)](javascript:void(0);)

 (1) When **Magic** first began, the rules dictated a 40-card deck. Constructed and Limited had the same deck size, although remember that the only Limited format was Sealed and it wasn't at all pushed. It quickly became apparent that 40 was too small for Constructed as it both made the game too repetitive and made it too easy to pull of key combos.[(Close this footnote)](javascript:void(0);)  
  
(2) **Magic** was originally played for ante. What that meant was that you flipped up the top card of your library at the start of each game and put it aside. You then drew your seven cards and played. The winner of the game permanently won the ante card from their opponent. Richard had originally imagined that the game much like marbles, where there was fluidity between ownership of the cards. What Richard had not counted on was the scope of the game and how valuable individual cards would become. While some people did play for ante, it quickly fell from favor and the majority of players played without it. It became an optional rule rather than a mandatory one and was eventually removed from the game entirely. [(Close this footnote)](javascript:void(0);)  
  
(3) The four-of limit was not originally part of the game. In fact, that rule didn't roll around until Wizards started pushing organized play more than half a year later. Player reaction to the introduction was mixed. Many players hated the idea. Why? One of the most popular decks at the time was a [Plague Rats](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plague+Rats) deck with [Swamp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swamp)s, [Dark Ritual](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dark+Ritual)s and lots and lots of [Plague Rats](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plague+Rats).

(4) Many of the early degenerate decks won before the opponent could take a turn. The one I'll always remember was a 41-card deck filled with [Black Lotus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Black+Lotus)es and [Wheel of Fortune](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wheel+of+Fortune)s. [(Close this footnote)](javascript:void(0);)  
  
Not that anyone had twenty [Black Lotus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Black+Lotus)es. It's not like today where you can just walk in a store and buy booster packs. In my day, you had to camp out in front of the store, sometimes for hours. [(5)](javascript:void(0);) We had to wait on line just to be able to buy a few measly packs. [(6)](javascript:void(0);) And you weren't even promised a rare. You felt lucky if you didn't get an [Island](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island). [(7)](javascript:void(0);)

(5) In the early days very few stores carried **Magic**. If you wanted to get some you had to find a store that carried it (and forget anything like mass market—Wal-Mart, Target, etc.), find out what day the shipment arrived, and then camp out so that you were one of the lucky few who were able to buy it that day before it sold out. [(Close this footnote)](javascript:void(0);)  
  
(6) Not only was demand high, but supply was low. Stores would order **Magic** only receiving ten or twenty percent of what they ordered. This was because Wizards had not anticipated how rapidly the following of the game would grow and simply hadn't printed enough cards to meet demand. As a result of this, many stores limited how many booster packs people could buy. It was very common at the time for **Magi**c players to make journeys from store to store picking up a few boosters at a time. [(Close this footnote)](javascript:void(0);)  
  
(7) As part of their plan to hide the rarities, Ramp;D came up with the idea of putting an [Island](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island) on the rare sheet to confuse the players as to what the rare was in their pack. As players finally figured out what was going on they referred to it as the "rare [Island](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island)." You might say it was the very first [One with Nothing](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=One+with+Nothing). [(Close this footnote)](javascript:void(0);)  
  
Not that we knew what the rare card was. We didn't have any of these newfangled expansion symbols. [(8)](javascript:void(0);) You know how we knew which card was the rare? We didn't! We just had to guess. Because back then Wizards of the Coast wasn't talking. [(9)](javascript:void(0);) They wouldn't even tell you which cards were in the set. Sortable card viewer—pfaw! You had to squeeze Wizards just to get the number of cards in the set, and sometimes they gave you more than one number. [(10)](javascript:void(0);) We didn't have a collector number written on every card to hold our hand. [(11)](javascript:void(0);) You wanted to know what cards existed, you just had to go out and play a lot of **Magic**.

 (8) Color-coded expansion symbols didn't show up until *Exodus*, over three years into the game. Up until that point, you had to learn rarity from card lists. One of the most important things about trading in the early days was being aware of what rarity each card was. ![](https://media.wizards.com/legacy//mtg/images/daily/mm/mm52_exodus.jpg)  
[(Close this footnote)](javascript:void(0);)  
  
 (9) When **Magic** first came out, Wizards took a policy of saying absolutely nothing about the contents of the game. Not only did they refuse to reveal things like rarity, they didn't even admit what the cards were called. The idea at the time was that a big part of the game was discovery and if they told the players what the cards were they were lessening that experience. For similar reasons, Wizards also refused to share deck lists during those first few years. [My coverage of the first World Championship Finals](/magic/magazine/article.aspx?x=mtgcom/feature/226gencon) (between Zak Dolan and Bertrand Lestree) only hinted at what was in each deck. We never gave a definitive list. (Okay, we did provide lists [years later](/Magic/magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/daily/mr204%20) when Wizards changed their policy.) [(Close this footnote)](javascript:void(0);)  
  
(10) *Arabian Nights* had a printing problem and certain cards were reprinted but they looked slightly different, so *Arabian Nights* had two different full set numbers depending on how you viewed the misprints. [(Close this footnote)](javascript:void(0);)  
  
(11) Collector number also didn't appear until *Exodus*. Collector numbers and rarity symbols were pushed through by the then **Magic** Brand Manager Joel Mick. [(Close this footnote)](javascript:void(0);)  
  
Not to mention that sometimes you just had whole boxes missing cards. [(12)](javascript:void(0);) When you opened a pack you didn't have to mail in for a rebate, you were happy. [(13)](javascript:void(0);) Then when you opened the booster packs, you found misprints, typos, cards with the wrong mana cost—and that's if they even bothered to write a mana cost. [(14)](javascript:void(0);) If you understood what a card was supposed to do, that was good enough.

(12) *Legends* had a problem where boxes only had one of two subsets of uncommons; if you bought only one *Legends* box, you were missing half of the uncommons. [(Close this footnote)](javascript:void(0);)  
  
(13) Wizards has always prided itself on its customer service. For each of the first three sets, you were able to send your bad packs in for new packs. [(Close this footnote)](javascript:void(0);)  
  
(14) The early days were also rife with printing errors. Alpha, for example, had two cards with the wrong mana cost, another card missing its mana cost, a creature with a swapped power and toughness, a card with the wrong card type printed on it, and a slew of typos, including numerous cards where the mana symbols were replaced by the appropriate letter.

And remember, cards didn't have all the things you take for granted today. Haste, vigilance, shroud, lifelink, deathtouch, flash, reach, fear, double strike, defender, indestructible—none of those words existed. [(15)](javascript:void(0);) We didn't have equipment or planeswalkers or cantrips or legendary permanents or multicolored cards. Heck, we didn't even have a tap symbol. [(16)](javascript:void(0);) Artifacts came in four varieties [(17)](javascript:void(0);) and creatures didn't say "creature" on them. [(18)](javascript:void(0);) If you wanted to know how something worked, you had to keep trying until you figured it out.

(15) A number of the concepts existed but the majority of keywords that we use today were introduced after Alpha. [(Close this footnote)](javascript:void(0);)  
  
(16) As I explained in my column [25 Random Things About **Magic**](/magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/mm/26), the tap symbol went through several iterations. [![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Prodigal_Sorcerer)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Prodigal_Sorcerer)  
[(Close this footnote)](javascript:void(0);)  
  
(17) The four types of artifact: 1) Artifact creatures – the same as they are now; 2) Mono artifacts – artifacts that now would have an activation with a tap symbol on them; 3) Poly artifacts – artifacts with activations that you could use as much as you wanted; 4) Continuous artifacts – artifacts with global effects like [Howling Mine](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Howling+Mine) or [Winter Orb](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Winter+Orb). To know how these cards worked, you had to know what each type of artifact did.

(18) Creature cards originally said "Summon \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_" on their card type line. That was changed during the *Sixth Edition* rules change, as it was odd that creature was the only card type that didn't have its name on the card type line. I still get letters asking me to bring "summon" back. [(Close this footnote)](javascript:void(0);)  
  
![](https://media.wizards.com/legacy//mtg/images/daily/mm/mm52_coin.jpg)Back then we didn't have none of these fancy rules you got now. There were no trained judges or comprehensive rulebooks. [(19)](javascript:void(0);) Our rulebook came with a story about two wizards fighting written by Richard Garfield himself, and we liked it. [(20)](javascript:void(0);) The rulebook even told you to flip a coin if you couldn't figure out a ruling. [(21)](javascript:void(0);) Like when you tried to [Wrath of God](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wrath+of+God) a [Black Knight](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Black+Knight). On any given day, who knew how it worked? [(22)](javascript:void(0);)

(19) The earliest judges were people who took it upon themselves to judge (such as myself). There was no serious judge program until the Pro Tour began, and even then it has made giant strides since it began. I'm not sure when the comprehensive rulebook began, but I do know in the early days the key tool was a compilation of rules put together independently by a player named Steven D'Angelo. [(Close this footnote)](javascript:void(0);)  
  
(20) The first two pages of the *Alpha* rulebook had a story written by Richard. I swear. You can even [read it if you want](/magic/magazine/article.aspx?x=mtgcom/daily/jc20). Let's just say Richard's game design skills were slightly better than his prose. [(Close this footnote)](javascript:void(0);)  
  
(21) You can't make stuff like this up. [(Close this footnote)](javascript:void(0);)  
  
(22) The rules for protection were really rough in the early days. The ruling on whether a [Wrath of God](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wrath+of+God) could kill a [Black Knight](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Black+Knight) got reversed multiple times.

Damage on the stack? We didn't even have a stack. We had batches and spells nested inside of other spells. [(23)](javascript:void(0);) Different card types worked at different speeds. [(24)](javascript:void(0);) We had concepts like "semi-targeted" [(25)](javascript:void(0);) and somehow [Giant Growth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Giant+Growth) always trumped [Lightning Bolt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt). [(26)](javascript:void(0);) And if you played your spell before you paid your mana, you got thrown out of Pro Tours. [(27)](javascript:void(0);) It was chaos. The Rules Manager at the time explained how things worked by drawing it up as a rat maze, [(28)](javascript:void(0);) and we thought it was the best thing since sliced bread. Yes, we had sliced bread back then.

(23) I'm not going to begin to try and explain how pre-*Sixth Edition* rules worked but suffice it to say they were a hodgepodge of all sorts of craziness. [(Close this footnote)](javascript:void(0);)  
  
(24) I don't know if the card types technically worked at different speeds, but for all practical purposes interrupts (a card type killed in the *Sixth Edition* rules) were faster than instants. For a taste of what they felt like, check out split second in *Time Spiral* block. [(Close this footnote)](javascript:void(0);)  
  
(25) There was a point in time where [Balance](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Balance) counted [Black Knight](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Black+Knight) to determine how many creatures were in play but was unable to kill it. [Balance](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Balance) could "sense" it enough to count it but not enough to kill it.[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Balance)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Balance)  
[(Close this footnote)](javascript:void(0);)  
  
(26) Pre-*Sixth Edition* rules, damage waited until all spells in the "batch" resolved, meaning that if you cast [Giant Growth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Giant+Growth) on your creature, your opponent wasn't able to Lighting Bolt it out from under you. [(Close this footnote)](javascript:void(0);)  
  
(27) Once upon a time, you had to tap your lands for mana before you cast your spell. Now you are able to do so either before or after you announce that you're casting the spell. In a famous Pro Tour incident, a player named David Mills was ejected in a Pro Tour Top 8 (up two games to one out of a best-of-five Final match) for doing it too often—he kept getting warned by the table judges until it finally escalated into a disqualification (with prizes). [(Close this footnote)](javascript:void(0);)  
  
(28) It was printed in *The Duelist* #9, and you can see it in [this Arcana](/magic/magazine/article.aspx?x=mtgcom/arcana/130). (*The Duelist* was a magazine about **Magic** that Wizards used to put out—I was editor-in-chief of the magazine for many years.) [(Close this footnote)](javascript:void(0);)  
  
And don't get me started on Limited. Back in the day, when you opened packs to play Sealed Deck, you prayed to get enough creatures to even build a deck. Sixteen to eighteen creatures for Limited? Hah! I played a *Legends* Sealed game once where my pool only had four creatures capable of dealing damage. [(29)](javascript:void(0);) And I was thankful to get such a good deck.

(29) True story, I swear. If you don't believe me, check out [the red common creatures from that set](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoileramp;method=visualamp;action=advancedamp;rarity=%7C%5BC%5Damp;set=%7C%5B%22legends%22%5Damp;color=+%5BR%5Damp;type=+%5B%22Creature%22%5D). [(Close this footnote)](javascript:void(0);)  
  
We didn't have the number of bomb rares you kids have today. When we opened a pack, we kissed the ground if the rare wasn't a Lace. [(30)](javascript:void(0);) When you cracked a giant monster you played it and just hoped it killed your opponent before it killed you, because that's just how giant monsters worked back then. [(31)](javascript:void(0);) Our five-mana white angel had just two abilities, and she was good. [(32)](javascript:void(0);) Our vampire had a sucky ability, but we didn't care because it was 4-power flier and that just won you games, because that was good enough. [(33)](javascript:void(0);)

(30) Alpha had a cycle of rare cards that each permanently turned a spell or permanent into a certain color. The names all ended in "lace," so they were called "Laces." They were much maligned because, well, they sucked. Being the Johnny I am, I used a number of Laces in decks I built.

(31) If you look at Alpha, most of the big creatures had some upkeep that if you didn't pay, they attacked you. We've since moved towards having our giant monsters be mostly upside.

Limited was easy, though, compared to Constructed. We didn't have no Internet building our decks for us. Back in the day, we had to build our own decks. [(34)](javascript:void(0);) And there weren't no cushy formats to help make things easier. You know what format we played? It was called **Magic**. [(35)](javascript:void(0);) And when we wanted to play, we didn't have no namby-pamby "Organized Play" throwing tournaments every other day. [(36)](javascript:void(0);) No, when we wanted to play, you had to hunt down an opponent. You had to hunt someone down and force them to play.

(34) While the Internet did technically exist, it hadn't yet found its way into the hands of the masses quite yet. Early **Magic** tended to build around local metagames. I remember making a trip up to San Francisco and bringing my [Moat](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Moat)s, because up in San Francisco they were going for three times what they cost in Los Angeles. (It was due to a little thing known as "[The Deck](/magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/daily/mf61)," made by a player named Brian Weissman.) [![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Moat)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Moat)  
[(Close this footnote)](javascript:void(0);)  
  
(35) **Magic** didn't start with the idea of formats. In the beginning, you just played the game. A few years later, Ramp;D introduced the idea of formats as a way to allow newer players to get into the game without the need to acquire every old powerful card. Also, adding in Standard (called Type II at the time) allowed us to slowly phase out mistakes of the past. The **Magic** public at the time didn't take the news too well. [(Close this footnote)](javascript:void(0);)  
  
(36) While Organized Play is a major part of **Magic** now, it was nonexistent for the first six months or so and even then took many years to get built up. [(Close this footnote)](javascript:void(0);)  
  
Of course, back then they knew how to make spells. Not like the kind they make today. What's it cost now to take an extra turn? Five mana? [(37)](javascript:void(0);) In my day, you could take an extra turn for that much and still have enough left over to draw three cards, get three mana of any color, and make the opponent discard, sacrifice creatures, and sacrifices lands. [(38)](javascript:void(0);) And that was all on turn one.

(37) [Time Warp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Time+Warp) from ***Magic** 2010*. [![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Time+Warp)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Time+Warp)

Kids these days have no idea how cushy they have it. Playing their net decks in sleeved cards at Friday Night **Magic** with a well analyzed metagame. [(39)](javascript:void(0);) That ain't the **Magic** we played. No siree. You kids don't know how lucky you have it. [(40)](javascript:void(0);)

(39) Everything I listed didn't exist until later in **Magic**'s life. Yes, there was a point in **Magic** history when you didn't play with card sleeves because they didn't exist, or at least weren't easy to find. Luckily, in those days, the most expensive card only cost ten bucks or so.
