PAX South is coming up January 23–25 in San Antonio, Texas, and *Magic: The Gathering* will be there!



Wizards of the Coast will have tournament space in the Tabletop Area of Exhibit Hall D with events all weekend, including:



* On-demand events, drafts, Commander, and free learn-to-play sessions
* Events for new players, including the Hunt for Garruk and Intro Pack Leagues
* Scheduled events, including Sealed, Two-Headed Giant, Chaos Draft, Foiled Again!, Mini-Masters, Modern, and Standard, among others
* Spellslinging with two members of R&D, Kimberly Kreines and Allison Medwin

For a full schedule, details on Wizards of the Coast events at PAX South, and more information, visit [magic.wizards.com/PAXSouth](http://magic.wizards.com/PAXSouth).



Additionally, PAX South features the return of the Prize Wall—a literal wall of *Magic* prizes there for the winning—and the opportunity to earn a limited edition PAX South Pinny Arcade Ugin Pin that looks a little something like this:

The tabletop area is open 10 a.m.–midnight on Friday and Saturday, and 10 a.m.–6 p.m. on Sunday, so there is plenty of time to get your game on. There are very few badges left (as of this writing), so visit <http://www.showclix.com/event/3854062> for tickets or check out the [PAX South website](http://south.paxsite.com/) for more information on how to attend. And for a full schedule, details on Wizards of the Coast events at PAX South, and more information, you can always check out [magic.wizards.com/PAXSouth](http://magic.wizards.com/PAXSouth).
