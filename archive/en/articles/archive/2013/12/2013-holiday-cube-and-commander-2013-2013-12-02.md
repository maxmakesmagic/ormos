2013 Holiday Cube and Commander 2013
====================================



 Posted in [NEWS](/en/articles)
 on December 2, 2013 










The end of the year is rapidly approaching, and 'tis the season for the **Magic Online** Holiday Cube! The fun starts on Wednesday, December 18, 2013, and runs through Wednesday, January 8, 2014.


The "Cube" refers to the stack of cards selected for the format—in face-to-face **Magic**the stack resembles a cube composed of as many as 540 cards with no duplicates. The **Magic Online**Cube is made up of digital cards, and these are randomly divided into fifteen-card Cube booster packs used for drafting. Cube Draft encompasses many of the most enjoyable aspects of **Magic: The Gathering**, combining elements of both Constructed and Limited play, trading, and playing the game with friends.


Paired with this year's Holiday Cube will be the Flashback Draft [*Mercadian Masques*](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/tcg/productarticle.aspx?x=mtg/tcg/mercadianmasques/productinfo)until December 23. Then, the Flashback Draft will change to a new format, which will be revealed in the **Magic Online**client announcements on December 23, and then again on January 3. So check in throughout the holidays to see what's new.


Also coming this week is [***Magic: The Gathering—****Commander*(2013 Edition)](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/tcg/productarticle.aspx?x=mtg/tcg/commander13/productinfo), which goes on sale in **Magic Online**December 20, 2013. These five Commander decks offer great Commander-format gameplay, bringing together some amazing cards in each.


There's a virtual sleigh-full of play coming in December to **Magic Online**!
