What could bring Nate and Shawn from Walking the Planes, Graham and James from LoadingReadyRun, Marshall Sutcliffe, Rashad Miller, and Brian David-Marshall together?

The inevitable defeat of the Community team at this year's Community Cup, of course!

Tune in to [Twitch.tv/magic](/en/events/coverage/pro-tour%E2%80%93amsterdam-standard-qualifier-season-top-8-decklists) on Friday at 11 a.m. Pacific, 2 p.m. Eastern, to watch the Community get destro—umm, I mean—*play* against the Wizards team. In the broadcasting booth are: Brian David-Marshall, Marshall Sutcliffe, Rashad Miller, Graham Stark, and James Turner.

The wacky-draft format is pretty fun from what I hear but I can't tell you all yet because, well, I don't know. It's locked away in the secret vault alongside our stockpile of cards and signed photos of Richard Garfield.

I was initially sad I wasn't competing in the Community Cup; I loved playing in a few games last year. But this year the competition is going to be fierce, as both sides bring titans to the table and I would not fancy facing off against any of them. I mean, the Community team has a few players with Pro Tour Top 8s, and the Wizards team brings two Hall of Famers, a World Team Champion, and a combined thirteen Pro Tour Top 8s. So... I'm okay sitting this one out and watch the stream when I'm not on the floor at PAX Prime.

Should the Community team somehow manage to vanquish the totally dominant and unquestionably powerful Wizards team, **Magic Online** players who logged in between Friday, August 30, at 10 a.m. Pacific and Saturday, August 31, at 7 p.m. Pacific, during the Community Cup, will be granted a premium foil [Sliver Queen](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sliver+Queen) promo and [Rakdos Cackler](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rakdos+Cackler) FNM promo on September 4.

When the Wizards team lands their second Community Cup victory, the **Magic Online** players who logged in during the event will receive a different premium foil promo card, one befitting that of the losing team: [Totally Lost](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Totally+Lost).
