Choose Your Side! 

You've probably heard that mantra many times recently, especially leading up to the *Mirrodin Besieged* release. If you haven't, where have you been? You missed an awesome week on the [Daily MTG](http://www.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Default.aspx) that [featured](/en/articles/archive/make-your-choice-2011-02-21) several [interesting](/en/articles/archive/pick-side-any-side-2011-02-21) themed [articles](/en/articles/archive/lab/rootin-home-team-2011-02-24) focused on the [war](/en/articles/archive/latest-developments/mirran-meddling-2011-02-25) tearing the [plane of Mirrodin](http://www.wizards.com/magic/mirrodin/#world) apart.

For **Magic Online**, factionalizing started with the February [Thursday Night **Magic Online** events](/en/articles/archive/thursday-night-magic-online-2010-07-29), where players had to choose between Mirran or Phyrexian events and were rewarded with a faction-specific promo card, either [Peace Strider](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Peace+Strider) or [Pierce Strider](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pierce+Strider), and a faction-specific avatar: Young Auriok for the valiant Mirran resistance or Young Moriok for the vile Phyrexian invaders (more on these in a minute).

Next, the [*Mirrodin Besieged* Prerelease Sealed Swiss Flights](/en/articles/archive/news/magic-online-mirrodin-besieged-prerelease-news-2011-02-08) required players to choose their side again, using the untradeable War Marks to show their allegiance. The War Mark players used to enter the prerelease event determined which faction-specific booster packs they would build their decks with, creating crazy card pools and ensuring players could play the faction they wanted to.

While they will not help determine the overall outcome of the war, War Marks more than a fancy way to enter the *Mirrodin Besieged* prerelease events. For instance, we are tracking which faction has the most support, measured by how many of that side's War Marks are consumed in events over the course of the war. In the prerelease events, for example, 54.5% of all War Marks used were Phyrexian. So, while it was a close battle, the Phyrexians came out on top. Can't you just feel the corruption of Mirrodin? 

Beyond simply tracking War Mark consumption, we will also have special events for players who are invested in the war and supporting their faction. For instance, check out this tournament we're planning for March 27: 

### *SCARS OF MIRRODIN* BLOCK CONSTRUCTED FACTION TOURNAMENTS

**START TIMES:** A Mirran and a Phyrexian event at 5:00 AM PDT (12:00 UTC), 10:00 AM PST (17:00 UTC), 4:00 PM PDT (23:00 UTC), and 8:00 PM PDT (Monday 3:00 UTC) on Sunday, March 27. A Mirran and a Phyrexian event will start at each start time.  
**LOCATION:**  Premier Events room.   
**ENTRY REQUIREMENT:**  5 Mirran War Marks or 5 Phyrexian War Marks, depending on the event joined.  
**PRODUCT:**  A *Scars of Mirrodin* Block Constructed format legal deck.   
**SIZE:**  8 players minimum, 512 players maximum.  
**DURATION:** 3 rounds, Swiss pairings. Play in all three rounds, win or lose.   
**PRIZES:** Prizes are based on the total match points at the end of the tournament. Each match win awards 3 points and each match loss awards 0 points. 



|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Match Points** | **Prizes** | **QPs** |
| 9 | 1 *Scars of Mirrodin* booster pack and 1 *Mirrodin Besieged* booster pack | 1 |
| 6 | 1 *Mirrodin Besieged* booster pack | 0 |

  
**ADDITIONAL PRIZES:** All players who participate in a *Scars of Mirrodin* Block Constructed Faction Tournament will receive 1 Avatar and 1 War Mark that matches the faction of the tournament they played in. Players with at least 6 match points at the end of the tournament will also receive an additional War Mark that matches the faction of the tournament they played in. 

This means if you played in a few *Mirrodin Besieged* prerelease events you can play in this event too, no Event Tickets required. And for folks who were unable to participate in the prerelease, we will be setting up two faction-specific *Scars of Mirrodin* Block Constructed 8-Player Queues to give you the opportunity to earn more War Marks. In addition, there will even more events like this in the coming weeks. Keep checking the [What's Happening page](/en/articles/archive/2009-06-29) and the [**Magic Online** Group page](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=%20http://community.wizards.com/magiconline) for the latest information about **Magic Online**. 

Another way **Magic Online** will be involved in the war, the aforementioned Auriok and Moriok avatars will change as the war progresses. These avatars will be available as part of events, so make sure you display your allegiance proudly. As a reward for Phyrexians being chosen more in the prerelease events, here is a sneak peek at the next evolution of the Moriok Avatar: the Scavenger Nim.

We are also hatching other nefarious schemes to get players involved in the war, but we are not ready to unleash our full battle plans quite yet. In the meantime, however, gather your weapons of war, choose your side, and support that choice by using your War Marks! The war on Mirrodin has arrived; will Mirrodin remain pure or will a new Phyrexia rise to glory?
