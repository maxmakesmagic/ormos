It might be hard to believe that (4) Yuuya Watanabe has a nemesis. As it turns out, Tzu Ching Kuo has a great record against him.


Kuo has once denied Watanabe of yet another Top 8 at Grand Prix Kitakyushu, beating him in the win-and-in match. Not that he needs anymore, but one can never have enough Grand Prix Top 8s. At Grand Prix Kobe 2014, Kuo also defeated Watanabe in Round 4.


"I can't believe I am saying this, but I actually like to play against Yuuya Watanabe," Kuo smiled.


Kuo's deck looked pretty insane, featuring triple [Reave Soul](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reave+Soul) and a pair of [Possessed Skaab](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Possessed+Skaab) to recur [Cruel Revival](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cruel+Revival) and [Fleshbag Marauder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fleshbag+Marauder).

*A battle between the Gold uncommons of* Magic Origins*.*


Watanabe's White Blue deck was laden with fliers, including [Stalwart Aven](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stalwart+Aven), [Thunderclap Wyvern](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thunderclap+Wyvern) and triple [Patron of the Valiant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Patron+of+the+Valiant). Oh yea, Watanabe also had [Sentinel of the Eternal Watch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sentinel+of+the+Eternal+Watch), one of the best uncommons in *Magic Origins*!


Today, will Watanabe exact revenge or will Kuo go 3-0 against Watanabe in three consecutive seasons?


Game 1
======


Kuo was the aggressor, leading with [Screeching Skaab](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Screeching+Skaab) and [Deadbridge Shaman](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deadbridge+Shaman). Watanabe put up [Stalwart Aven](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stalwart+Aven) and [Thunderclap Wyvern](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thunderclap+Wyvern) to defend but a pair of [Reave Soul](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reave+Soul)s put them to rest.


Watanabe rebuilt with a pair of [Patron of the Valiant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Patron+of+the+Valiant), keeping all of Kuo's creatures at bay. [Fleshbag Marauder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fleshbag+Marauder) got rid of one of them, but Kuo couldn't find the 5th land to cast [Cruel Revival](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cruel+Revival). When he did, it was countered by [Clash of Wills](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Clash+of+Wills).


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Cruel+Revival)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cruel+Revival)[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Fleshbag+Marauder)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fleshbag+Marauder)
That paved the way for [Possessed Skaab](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Possessed+Skaab) to resolve, and Kuo was able to pick up [Cruel Revival](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cruel+Revival) to in turn recur [Fleshbag Marauder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fleshbag+Marauder). With that immense advantage, Kuo was up one game.

*Tzu Ching Kuo locks up the first game with a chain of unfair recursions.*


**Tzu Ching Kuo 1 – Yuuya Watanabe 0**


Game 2
======


Kuo opened with [Thornbow Archer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thornbow+Archer) and [Bonded Construct](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bonded+Construct), but that blistering start was stopped by a pair of [Cleric of the Forward Order](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cleric+of+the+Forward+Order).


The life cushion bought Watanabe enough time to summon double [Patron of the Valiant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Patron+of+the+Valiant) and [Sentinel of the Eternal Watch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sentinel+of+the+Eternal+Watch).

*Yuuya Watanabe faces his nemesis and looks visibly worried.*


[Cruel Revival](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cruel+Revival) took care of the 4/6 but Kuo had no elegant solution to the pair of 4/4 Angels. [Priest of the Blood Rite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Priest+of+the+Blood+Rite)'s 5/5 Peanut token kept them at bay, and Kuo used the momentary breathing room to regrow [Cruel Revival](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cruel+Revival) with [Possessed Skaab](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Possessed+Skaab).


![](https://media.wizards.com/2015/events/gphk15/gpHK_D2_FM12_Yuuya_Watanabe_Token.jpg)  
*Yuuya Watanabe offers his "Peanut" token for Tzu Ching Kuo to use as a 5/5 Demon.*


[Ampryn Tactician](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ampryn+Tactician) boosted the pair of Angels into 5/5s, allowing Watanabe to go on the offensive. With both players at 10 life, Kuo was forced to take the trade, taking 7 damage from the other Angel and a 2/4 [Stalwart Aven](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stalwart+Aven).


[Cruel Revival](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cruel+Revival) took care of the second Angel and a second [Possessed Skaab](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Possessed+Skaab) allowed Kuo to resurrect [Priest of the Blood Rite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Priest+of+the+Blood+Rite).


[Nantuko Husk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nantuko+Husk) started to peck away at Watanabe's life total, to a point where he was forced to begin blocking. A third copy of [Patron of the Valiant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Patron+of+the+Valiant) was shoved in the way of a lethal demon token as sacrificial fodder.


It is never a good sign when you're chump-blocking with 4/4 fliers and the final outcome was clear as day. Watanabe had fallen to Kuo once again.


**Tzu Ching Kuo 2 – Yuuya Watanabe 0**


Tzu Ching Kuo defeats Yuuya Watanabe and eliminates him from Top 8 contention. Kuo is 9-2-1 and needs to win out!
