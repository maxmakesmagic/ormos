Grand Prix Seville was the latest event in the Pro calendar, and although the top half of the *Magic* Top 25 Pro Rankings remained static, there was movement further down the table. For the third weekend running it's Martin Juza of the Czech Republic who continues his fine run of form. Three weeks ago, it was his 21st Grand Prix Top 8 in [Mexico City](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/gpmex15) that brought him back into the rankings at No. 25. A solid finish at [Pro Tour *Fate Reforged*](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/ptfrf) brought him up six spots to No. 19, and now his 22nd Grand Prix Top 8 in [Seville](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/gpsev15) bumps him up three more to No. 16. Juza is almost unstoppable at the penultimate level of the game, dominating the GP circuit over much of the last decade. By comparison, his two Pro Tour Top 8s seem shy of his potential, but there are still two more Pro Tours this season, and Juza is in some of the best form of his career.



The only other Top 25 player in action in Seville was Jérémy Dezani, but he wasn't playing for long, mustering a solitary match win before exiting the tournament on Day One. He remains at No.14, but another points opportunity has slipped by with Dezani a long way from retaining his Platinum status for next season.



The remainder of the changes were largely brought about by the rise of Juza—Yuuki Ichikawa, Stanislav Cifka, and Seth Manfield all dropped as Juza charged past—and also the decay of points from last season. That was enough to see the return to the Top 25 of Gaudenis Vidugiris at No. 25, and the removal of Josh Utter-Leyton, who had been on the rankings from week one.



Next up, a double-header weekend, and, unusually, they are both in North America. Vancouver plays host to Modern, while Memphis takes a look at the latest goings on in Standard. There should be plenty of Top 25 players in action, so join us for all the news next week.
