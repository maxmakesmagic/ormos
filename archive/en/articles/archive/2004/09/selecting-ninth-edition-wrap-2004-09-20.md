### Sketch Vote Winners


For Selecting *Ninth Edition* the readers had a whole new way to participate in putting together the core set, this time by voting on two sketches for each card, deciding which would be fleshed out into the final piece for each card in question. Listed below are the winning sketches in order, as well as two finished pieces we now have here at Wizards.

### Flavor Text Votes


For Selecting *Ninth Edition* readers sent in nearly 10,000 flavor text submissions for [Shock](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shock), [Naturalize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Naturalize), and [Fear](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fear). For [Fear](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fear), the winning choice came from Joseph Vidal:


***"Don't fear the darkness. Fear what it hides." -Remin venerable monk***


For [Naturalize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Naturalize), the most popular submission came from Alex Zacharias:


***"Well, it also makes a very nice flower pot . . . ." -Arcum Dagsson Soldevi machinist***


And lastly, here are the final results for the [Shock](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shock) flavor text vote:





|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| *"Once I saw a goblin shouting at a thunderstorm. He lost the argument pretty quickly." -Wandering mage* | **1704** | **28.1%** |
| *This is why there are no furry goblins.* | 833 | 13.7% |
| *"They say lightning's the mother of fire. Guess what? You're about to become the father." - Jaya Ballard, task mage* | 612 | 10.1% |
| "*You know what I like best about lightning? It's like fire but even faster." -Jaya Ballard task mage* | 602 | 9.9% |
| *"More fun than a barrel of rocks! More effective too." -Toggo goblin weaponsmith* | 518 | 8.5% |
| *"Lightning is like a troll: you don't know what hit you till you smell it." -Flegren, goblin seer* | 465 | 7.7% |
| *"That's the problem with the high ground," mused Grognak. "It's too close to the sky!"* | 432 | 7.1% |
| *Once in a while static electricity ceases to be static.* | 395 | 6.5% |
| *"Sparks fly when you're having fun!" -Snogg, goblin pyromancer* | 292 | 4.8% |
| *"At first my hair stood on end. Then I smelled it burning."* | 215 | 3.5% |
| Total | 6068 | 100.0% |


The vote for [Shock](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shock) was actually run twice, as the first time we ran it a real-world quote by Mark Twain slipped through to the finalists list, in violation of the promotion’s rules. The vote was run a second time, with the real-world quote removed and the next runner-up inserted. Despite the changes, the same submission won both votes, so extra congratulations go to David Griffiths for getting his quote onto this popular card.


### Looking Forward


And so it comes to a close, for now. Thank you to everyone who took the time to participate in this popular event! In the coming weeks make sure to keep watching the **Magic** Arcana slot for more final art pieces composed from the winning sketches chosen by the readers. We’ll also soon be announcing You Make the Card 3, with a whole new angle that is sure to surprise you. In the meantime, thanks again for taking part in shaping your next core set, and stay tuned to **magicthegathering.com** for even more ways to influence the game!
