People enjoyed [their look at Steve Argyle's process](/en/articles/archive/argyle-process-2009-05-27) so much that there was a positive outcry to have [Naya Battlemage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Naya+Battlemage) as this week's desktop wallpaper. And who are we to argue?


Incidentally, Mr. Argyle himself dropped into the forums and provided [an enormous version of this art](http://forums.gleemax.com/showpost.php?p=18670866&postcount=236). Thanks, Steve! This also gives us an opportunity to mention [SteveArgyle.com](http://www.steveargyle.com/), where there are more time-lapses, as well as various sketches and cool stuff. Check out the sketches for [Slave of Bolas](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Slave+of+Bolas) while you're there!


Enjoy.
