**What was your Sealed pool like and how did the rounds play out?**


I was Black-Green, a very unusual color combination! [Colossal Dreadmaw](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Colossal+Dreadmaw) killed my opponents.


**How did your Drafts go? How did the rounds play out?**


White-Black Stuff and Green-Blue Merfolk.


I didn't think the White-Black deck was that good, but it performed really well, there is a lot you can do with that color pair.


**Did any particular card surprise you this weekend? Why?**


[Grim Captain's Call](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grim+Captain%27s+Call), it returned three of my creatures!

Blue-Black Pirates – won all but one game on Day 1!!!


**How did your Drafts go? How did the rounds play out?**


First deck my teammate hooked and cut me. [(6) Martin Juza]


Second deck was near perfect.


**Did any particular card surprise you this weekend? Why?**


[Legion Conquistador](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Legion+Conquistador). I didn't realize it could get all copies. Neither did Matt Costa.


**What does this Top 8 mean to you?**


Another day, another dollar.

**Hometown:** Floral Park, NY


**Age:** 30


**Occupation:** Filmmaker


**Previous *Magic* Accomplishments:**


Day 2 at Grand Prix Portland


**What was your Sealed pool like and how did the rounds play out?**


No rares made it into my final deck. Luckily though, I had a good amount of vampires. If I've learned anything about *Ixalan* it's to always go vampires no matter what. Maybe merfolk if you must, but vamps rules in *Ixalan*. Also speed is key.


**How did your Drafts go? How did the rounds play out?**


The first draft was the best Limited deck I've ever put together. Six bomb removal spells plus a nice spread of different vamps. Only got mana flooded in one match.


The second draft was the most intense *Magic* experience I've ever had and I'll admit, I definitely got lucky.


**Did any particular card surprise you this weekend? Why?**


Argul's Blood Fast – Someone used it against me this weekend and it was so effective I used it in my final draft deck.


**What does this Top 8 mean to you?**


Now I can tell Aunt Monique if she still thinks it's a waste of time. Also now my friends will quit calling me a scrub.


**What was your favorite moment of 2017 (*Magic* or non-*Magic*)?** 


This is definitely in the running!

Yes. The 1R Enchantment that deals 1 if you sacrifice a creatures or artifact. [[Makeshift Munitions](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Makeshift+Munitions)]


Not that bad.


**What does this Top 8 mean to you?**


That even though Huey, Owen, Reid runs the streets, me and Josh Taylor run the cul-de-sacs.
