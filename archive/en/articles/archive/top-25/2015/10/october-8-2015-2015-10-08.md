Welcome to our weekly look at the *Magic* Top 25 Pro rankings. The waiting is almost over, as there's plenty to keep our eyes on over the next few weeks. While the rankings may have stood mostly steady through the Prerelease and Release period for *Battle for Zendikar*, that's absolutely about to change. We have two Grand Prix ready to whet our appetite this weekend before the Pro Tour comes to Milwaukee next week.


In Sydney, there's a dress rehearsal of sorts for a city that's hosting a Pro Tour next year—but this time it's at the Grand Prix level, so anyone can compete. It will be interesting to see whether the home players who are qualified for Milwaukee will take the opportunity to acclimatize closer to the main event, or stay home for what is always a true festival of Australian *Magic*.


Their alternative? Grand Prix Madison, sitting a figurative "down the road" from the Pro Tour host city. You can expect to see a wide range of global talent on display in Madison. Many of the top North American players will be on hand, of course, but this is the ideal stopping-off point for European travelers en route to the Pro Tour the following week. By the time we reach the Top 8 on Sunday, we could be looking at a *very* talented lineup indeed.


Whichever Grand Prix our pros attend, *Battle for Zendikar* Limited will be the format—meaning we will get a great chance to see early draft plans coming to fruition before the best of the best tackle six rounds of Draft during the Pro Tour itself. With a ton of Standard testing happening in the margins of the Grand Prix (mostly behind locked doors), this is a great weekend for a Pro Tour tune-up. And with plenty of Pro Points on offer, we can expect some movement in the rankings before the Pro Tour shakes everything upside down.


To find out who goes into the Pro Tour as the No. 1-ranked player in the world, join us right here next week at the home of the *Magic* Top 25 Pro Rankings.
