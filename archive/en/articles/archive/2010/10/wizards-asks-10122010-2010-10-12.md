*What's the most ridiculous Limited game you've ever seen?*


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/mtgcom/authorpics/authorpic_kellydigges.jpg)**Kelly Digges:** Why, funny you should ask—the most ridiculous Limited game I've ever seen was just a few nights ago, drafting *Scars of Mirrodin* with some old **Magic** buddies from my hometown. It looked like this:


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/activity/da557_wa2.jpg)Let me walk you through what's going on here. Nikki imprinted [Tumble Magnet](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tumble+Magnet) onto [Prototype Portal](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Prototype+Portal) (groan), then Adrian stole the Portal with [Volition Reins](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Volition+Reins) (double groan). The Quentin Martin pro player cards—which Adrian collects—are all [Tumble Magnet](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tumble+Magnet)s.

Not pictured is Nikki's [Contagion Engine](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Contagion+Engine) (groan, then groan again), which is why her Quentin Martins all have double-digit counters on them and Adrian has no creatures—not that her creatures could get through against his wall of [Tumble Magnet](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tumble+Magnet)s anyway.

Adrian's plan was to draw the second [Volition Reins](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Volition+Reins) he claimed was in his deck, steal the [Contagion Clasp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Contagion+Clasp), and finally get through. By the end of the game, Adrian had an enormous stack of inactive [Tumble Magnet](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tumble+Magnet)s off to one side, and Nikki's [Tumble Magnet](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tumble+Magnet)s all had so many counters on them that I think they stopped keeping track.


So how did the game actually end? Adrian ran out of cards, either having been bluffing on the second [Volition Reins](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Volition+Reins) or having drawn it too late.
