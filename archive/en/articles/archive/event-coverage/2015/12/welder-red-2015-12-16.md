At the 5-0 table were a number of predictible decks. Stompy, Replenish, Control Black... despite the prevalence of established archetypes, there was apparently still plenty of room for innovation. Played by Kenny Crawford from Indiana, Welder Red was designed by Adrian Sullivan and was one of the most original decks at this point in the tournament. It bears a resemblance to traditional Wildfire decks, but instead of Temporal Aperture for card advantage, it uses an interesting combination of Gamble and Goblin Welder, as well as Urza's Blueprints and Citanul Flute. Goblin Welder is not only crucial against artifact destruction, but it generally improves the quality of cards in play and it fights against discard, which is quite popular with the Control Black deck that Jon Finkel piloted to a first place finish in the US National Championships.



Besides Goblin Welder, the other key card in the deck is Karn, Silver Golem, which can turn a collection of Fire Diamonds and Thran Dynamos into a horde of artifact beatdown. With these two cards in combination, the Welder can provide a replacement from the graveyard for any artifact that happens to be assigned lethal damage during combat.



The deck still appears somewhat inconsistent with few reliable ways to find one of the deck's most powerful spells, Wildfire; still no one who has seen the deck in action can doubt the utility of Goblin Welder in its interactions with Gamble, Karn, and the other artifacts of the deck like Tanglewire. And at least one player, Kenny Crawford, feels that the deck is top 8 quality.
