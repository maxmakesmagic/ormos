The "tragedy of the commons" is a well-known game theory phenomenon. It all starts with sheep, and multiple shepherds, and a field that nobody owns. Because nobody owns the field, nobody cares how much grass their sheep eat. Before you know it, presto, no more grass and lots of starving sheep.

This is the problem with commons: they're only good for sheepfood, and have no staying power. So it is in **Magic**.

Or is it?

Here during Commons Week at MagicTheGathering.com, we're just thrilled to present to you all the latest tech in commons-only goodness. For Serious Fun, that goodness is defined by what you can do in group play.

For the fairly new (read: one year or less) **Magic** player who has a regular group to play with, it is often intimidating to look at all of the hard-to-find rares that the veterans plop down with a yawn. Is there any way to work around a [Nevinyrral's Disk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nevinyrral%27s+Disk)? What do you do when faced with a deck sporting both [Mystic Snake](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mystic+Snake)s and [Spiritmonger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spiritmonger)s? Is there an answer to [Desolation Angel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Desolation+Angel)? Do any of the answers to these questions cost less than $10, or even $5?

There are many uncommons that can help you in the above situations: [Swords to Plowshares](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swords+to+Plowshares) alone is practically an answer for all three, and shouldn't run you more than a buck or two. But if you're really gunning for a penny-solution, you want commons.

[Terminate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Terminate). [Counterspell](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterspell). [Disenchant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Disenchant). [Shock](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shock) (or, if you're lucky, [Lightning Bolt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt)). These are the answers to many questions, and they should cost you virtually no money at all. (Bolts will take some finding; but don't let anyone dupe you into trading a rare for one unless it's an Alpha/Beta/Unlimited.) If you have 8-12 of each of these cards, and a bunch of cheap and efficient creatures, then you can begin to build a set of multiplayer decks that should be capable of challenging even the most stunning combos or sweeping board-clearers.

*Beyond* the staples, what would I recommend for the fresh-faced group player? A solid dose of recent cards with black expansion symbols, and a mix of little-known tricks from older expansions. Only one of these should go for more than 25 cents, even at retail stores; most should be in the 10-cent bin, or easy by-products of busting packs in the given expansion.

This list isn't even close to comprehensive. I only really have room for five cards in each color (and five more for gold). I expect emails from readers who wonder if I have gone insane for "forgetting" this card or that. Write me an email if you like -- or better yet, hook into another web site's editor and give your own list for consideration. The more cheap cards and ideas we put out there in front of newer players, the better.

### RED

In the common slot, red resorts most often to its primary strategy: flexible burn. With that in mind, three of the five cards I'm going to suggest here are burn spells.

![Seal of Fire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Seal+of+Fire) **Seal of Fire** is, in group play, nearly always superior to [Shock](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shock) -- and in fact, is often superior to [Lightning Bolt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt). Why? Because if you're not crass enough to show everyone your hand whenever you have a good card, putting the burn "on the table" is the only way to let your opponents know what you can do. You can prevent a troubling attack, divert a spell that may have been considering you, or even enslave a nearly-dead opponent to your will, all for the low, low price of ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227130159im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/red.gif). [Seal of Fire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seal+of+Fire) has, in other words, "rattlesnake" value, and dominates the early game like almost no other card can.![Suq'Ata Lancer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Suq%27Ata+Lancer)**Suq'Ata Lancer** is one of the better red creatures to see print. (Sure, we'd all rather cast [Ball Lightning](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ball+Lightning) on turn three; but this isn't "prohibitively expensive rares" week, is it?) This beauty from *Visions* can attack immediately and trade with a defending 3/3. People often forget how useful haste is in multiplayer -- it neutralizes a good deal of bounce, and throws off defenders' math.

![Rolling Thunder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Rolling+Thunder) **Rolling Thunder** is the poor man's [Earthquake](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Earthquake) that often does a better job altogether. While designed as a tournament-inferior [Fireball](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fireball) (since it requires ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227130159im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/red.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227130159im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/red.gif) up front), this card loves the deliberate pace of multiplayer. You don't have to pay extra for each additional target, and like its cousin [Arc Lightning](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arc+Lightning) (and many uncommon and rare variants), it will always, always be useful. On an interesting side note, this is well known as the card that taught the limited format community that red X spells are just wrong in the common slot.![Flowstone Wall](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Flowstone+Wall) **Flowstone Wall** is for the less aggressive red mage who needs to handle everything from [Dandan](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dandan)s to [Blastoderm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blastoderm)s (and by the way, that was my way of sneaking on two more strong commons on to their respective lists). The ability to put a little torque on the block and deal damage is a nice touch.![Lava Storm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Lava+Storm) For the last slot, I'll pull out a trick that most players have completely forgotten: **Lava Storm**. This masterful cardboard pun ("they say lava conquers all") is most useful when the combat has nothing to do with you at all. Entire legions of squirrels -- and even a nascent sliver horde -- will go down swiftly to this well-placed volcano. If the combatants have toughness greater than 2, don't forget to wait for creatures' combat damage to be put on the stack before you play this.### BLACK

There's a little bit below for every black mage -- removal, recursion, life drain, and early creatures.

![Syphon Soul](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Syphon+Soul) We'll start with **Syphon Soul**, one of the most beloved old-school black commons for group play. I've had several conversations with readers about cards like this -- hurting all opponents at once, and giving yourself a big life boost to boot, makes a big statement in the early game. You're saying, in essence, that you think you can take on everyone at the table simultaneously and don't care if they gang up on you or not. Plan accordingly.![Pestilence](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Pestilence) **Pestilence** is on the verge of being a staple, since it dates back to Alpha; but it's been out of circulation long enough that many readers may be only dimly aware of it. Of course, there have been many variants on the card -- from [Crypt Rats](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crypt+Rats) to [Thrashing Wumpus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thrashing+Wumpus) to [Last Laugh](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Last+Laugh) -- but the original still stands the test of time. Most often played with [Circle of Protection: Black](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Circle%2Bof%2BProtection%253A%2BBlack) and pro-black creatures, [Pestilence](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pestilence) also works fine in decks without the cheesy combo. Note that this card was most recently reprinted in *Sixth Edition*, as an uncommon.![Exhume](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Exhume)**Exhume** has always had my favorite artwork. It also does really fun things. I'll leave it to you to explore the possibilities.

![Abyssal Gatekeeper](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Abyssal+Gatekeeper) **Abyssal Gatekeeper** is a *Weatherlight* common with excellent early-game possibilities. Like [Diabolic Edict](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Diabolic+Edict) (sneaking another common on the list), it has the potential to hit pro-black and untargetable creatures. In conjunction with universal damage or removal, where many creatures die simultaneously with the Gatekeeper, you can leave your opponents with very few options so that a much larger creature goes down with the ship. (Best example I have ever seen with this? A [Tremor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tremor) taking out all of a [Verdant Force](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Verdant+Force)'s saprolings, and the Gatekeeper, to force the death of the big fattie.)![Bone Harvest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Bone+Harvest) The last black common we'll explore today is a real dark horse: **Bone Harvest**. Put into a controlling deck with lots of comes-into-play creatures like [Bone Shredder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bone+Shredder), [Flametongue Kavu](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flametongue+Kavu), or [Wall of Blossoms](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wall+of+Blossoms) (and see blue for another possibility), this can be one of the most back-breaking cards in existence. You bring back your favorite creatures, set up as many draws as you like, draw an extra card, and even put off milling decks, as an added bonus. *And it's an instant.* When a friend introduced it to me, I was sure it had to be a rare, or at least an uncommon. (They didn't color the expansion symbols until *Exodus*.) I learned it was a common and just went ape getting my hands on four for 40 cents. [Bone Harvest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bone+Harvest) doesn't go into every black deck -- but wow, it goes into more than you'd think.### WHITE

White's cards are predictably defensive; but there are a couple in here that can get spun as fun and dirty tricks.

![Congregate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Congregate) **Congregate**: you're all waiting to see it, so there. Happy? Thus begins and ends the gutless-card portion of our program.![heavy ballista](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Heavy+Ballista) **Heavy Ballista**, like [Lava Storm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lava+Storm) for red, is a card that enjoys combat between two opponents just as much as combat you're in. The variants on this card are usually uncommon (like [Aven Archer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aven+Archer)); but not rare; so a theme deck is both possible and quite intriguing.![Wall of Glare](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Wall+of+Glare)![Embolden](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Embolden) **Embolden** is probably my favorite damage prevention card, which shouldn't be saying a lot; but that fact takes nothing away from this card. You can surprise somebody the first time into a bad combat move, and then attack more aggressively with your own creatures afterward. Cheap enough both times to cast twice in an emergency -- I've seen players fend off [Overrun](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Overrun), [Death Grasp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Death+Grasp), [Shivan Dragon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shivan+Dragon), and even a closing [Psychatog](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psychatog) move with this card.**Wall of Glare** is a fine early to mid-game move. The Wall complicates combat math and is easy enough to protect with damage prevention or pump that it ought to survive even fatal-looking assignments. All white wants to do in the early game is send people somewhere else. Just add an [Angelic Wall](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Angelic+Wall) in the air, and presto, mission completed.

![Kor Chant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Kor+Chant) The *en-*Kor creatures of the *Stronghold* expansion were my first introduction to white in **Magic**. When **Kor Chant** came out in *Exodus*, I was truly impressed. I thought every white dynamic would be that cool. (I was horribly, desperately wrong.) Redirection of damage gives you a nice blend of red burn and blue deflection -- this will almost never be a dead card in your hand. When it is, it will be because you have superior numbers, anyway… why haven't you won the game already?![Soltari Visionary](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Soltari+Visionary) To make up for [Congregate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Congregate), which isn't really a card by any reasonable definition, I'll offer up a sixth suggestion: **Soltari Visionary**, the amazing, unblockable, recurring enchantment destruction.### GREEN

I took pains to limit the creatures here to two, so that green mages can explore other dynamics the color has to offer. Both creatures are very recent (and don't forget I already covered [Blastoderm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blastoderm)!).

![Emerald Charm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Emerald+Charm) **Emerald Charm** is probably the most useful of the *Mirage*-block modal spells. The Charm gave green spot removal for global enchantments and two possible paths to creature removal -- knocking down a flyer and untapping any permanent. That kind of versatility is a real asset in group games, and you'll often surprise yourself with the mode you use in any given game.

![Nantuko Disciple](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Nantuko+Disciple) **Nantuko Disciple** is my pick for recent creature. [Wild Mongrel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Mongrel) is a bit obvious (presto!...I sneaked in another one); but *Odyssey* has too many good green common creatures to ignore. The Disciple is an immediate target for your enemies; but if it lasts one round, it will likely last a good deal longer. Take out the black mage first; the red mage will almost certainly be less of a problem for you once this goes active. The Disciple is not a rush card; it is meant for conservative play, with one or two creatures attacking and one or two (including the Disciple) hanging back to block. Any ability that requires "tap" in the ability loses a bit in group play; but this gains a lot back with what it does.![Repopulate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Repopulate) **Repopulate** is very, very good in this age of enhanced graveyard strategy, especially since it's an instant. Help yourself, confound an opponent, or just cycle it for a card you need more.![Yavimaya Elder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Yavimaya+Elder) **Yavimaya Elder**, in some cases, is better at acting like a [Seal of Fire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seal+of+Fire) than a [Seal of Fire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seal+of+Fire) is! Once you can sac it for a card, what two-toughness creature is going to attack you on the ground? *You don't care.* You get to kill a creature, get two more lands, thin your deck, and draw an extra card. (The card-draw goes on the stack first, then the graveyard ability. So you get your lands first, and you're a bit less likely to draw a third land.) The Elders are great for starting off chain reactions in more expensive cards like [Grave Pact](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grave+Pact), [Pattern of Rebirth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pattern+of+Rebirth), and [Reincarnation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reincarnation). Or you can use the more modest tricks of [Fecundity](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fecundity) or [Soul Net](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soul+Net). It's all gravy -- the Elder is good enough on its own.![Avoid Fate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Avoid+Fate) I've fallen into a pattern of somewhat obscure commons in the earlier colors, so I'll continue that trend here. Being a *Legends* card, **Avoid Fate** may be harder to track down (and more expensive once you find it) than the other commons on the list; but given errata (the word "interrupt" now means "instant", allowing it to affect a great deal more spells), it can be a solid card in a deck that must protect its creatures. One of the few counterspells that green has at its disposal, it will be a complete surprise the first time you play it.### BLUE

It's hard to cover all the things blue does well in five commons; but the cards below do represent most of blue's strengths.

![Capsize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Capsize) **Capsize**, even after many years, remains the ultimate in blue bounce. This may be the best common ever printed. If you play blue at all and don't have at least four, you shouldn't even read the rest of this article -- go get them, now. Still a ten-cent deal, despite its power, because *Tempest* is readily available and not that aged.![Confound](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Confound) **Confound** is my common counterspell of choice. Many multiplayer decks that run [Counterspell](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterspell) should be running this instead. You won't be able to stop a [Wrath of God](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wrath+of+God) or dragon legend, but you will stop the removal that's bent on your creatures, which is what most creature decks need anyway. (It's funny to think of this as an overcosted [Avoid Fate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Avoid+Fate) -- green finally did better than blue! -- but you do get to draw a card, so blue wins out, after all.)![Man-o'-War](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Man-o%27-War)**Man-o'-War**, *Visions* edition, has beautiful artwork that looks even better when you're stalling one or more opponents with its tempo-ey goodness. Fabulous with gating creatures, but perfectly fine as a simple 3-drop in a deck that likes to mess around with players' heads.![Ray of Command](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Ray+of+Command) **Ray of Command** is the sort of one-turn stealing that blue won't see so much of anymore. (Wizards has [plainly stated](http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=mtgcom/daily/rb17) that they're passing the ability on to red via cards like [Temporary Insanity](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Temporary+Insanity).) It's a fabulous trick that often wastes two opponents' creatures, since you carefully screen your target to both kill and be killed by an attacking creature. Rares like [Reins of Power](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reins+of+Power) and [Spinal Embrace](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spinal+Embrace) can help you build a theme deck; but the much cheaper uncommon [Legacy's Allure](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Legacy%27s+Allure) can work just as well alongside this common.![Rhystic Study](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Rhystic+Study) The "unexpected" slot for blue is not all that surprising, for anyone who remembers the powerhouse that was the *Prophecy* expansion. (Yes, that's irony.) **Rhystic Study** is a nice, subtle card that got the rhystic dynamic right. Many -- perhaps *too* many -- opponents will just let you draw a card, since they tapped out or want to save their mana for other, more immediate threats. Playing Study in a deck with multiple cheap spells is a nice way to overwhelm those players who try to prevent the draw every time.### GOLD

The best commons in gold will all be from *Invasion* block -- after all, there were only three gold commons before *Invasion*!

![Vodalian Zombie](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Vodalian+Zombie) **Vodalian Zombie** is probably the best bet for multiplayer, when it comes to the fantastic 2/2 pro-color "*Invasion* bears". Early creatures are often green, and the Zombie is immune to most black removal. That said, there's nothing wrong with the other four; any of these are solid filler in your two-color deck.![Consume Strength](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Consume+Strength) **Consume Strength** is a terrific two-for-one card, saving one of your creatures while you kill someone else's. A green deck does not need too much black to give itself one of the most efficient removal cards in group play.![Gaea's Skyfolk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Gaea%27s+Skyfolk)**Gaea's Skyfolk** competes with a very select group of 2cc creatures -- the Invasion bears, [Wild Mongrel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Mongrel), [Meddling Mage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Meddling+Mage), and maybe one or two others -- for the title of "Best Bear Ever". A flying 2/2 on turn two with no drawbacks just won't happen again, anytime soon. If you're still buying *Apocalypse* product, hang on to these as you find them until you have a dozen or more; a veteran with 12 decks built at once could easily have three that use blue and green, and these should be in all of them. As a bonus, the artwork is stunning.

![Hull Breach](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Hull+Breach) **Hull Breach** is "the answer" for those red-green decks that don't want to lose momentum in a field full of expensive control cards like [Stasis](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stasis), [Ensnaring Bridge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ensnaring+Bridge), [Solitary Confinement](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Solitary+Confinement), and [Winter Orb](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Winter+Orb). A mere two mana can destroy up to two permanents that often present problems to both colors. Like [Consume Strength](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Consume+Strength), it's worth splashing.![Goblin Legionnaire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Goblin+Legionnaire) **Goblin Legionnaire** is a fairly predictable pick, but the darn thing simply does too much to ignore. Some day, red-white decks will be good again, in *some* format. (I have no idea which. Multiplayer seems like the best bet.) It swings, it defends, it kills, it saves… and you can't ask for much more from a single card.Like the Skyfolk, [Wild Mongrel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Mongrel), and *Invasion* bears, the Legionnaire seeks the title of "Best Bear Ever". I think it's heartening that seven commons are competing for the title, and only one rare. (Eight commons, if you count [River Boa](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=River+Boa) before Wizards shifted it to uncommon.) That bodes well for the future of bears… and of commons, more generally. As long as there are efficient commons, there will be viable all-common decks. I've proposed a tempo deck below suitable for a small number of opponents (no more than three); but the possibilities truly are infinite. There used to be columnists on the Internet who specialized in this topic; I hope to see some again one day. Good luck.
