Say hello to The Moonlit Lands! Available soon at WPN Premium stores, in English only and while supplies last, these promotional black-and-white basic lands are [similar to the eternal night basic lands](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/feature/sink-your-teeth-booster-fun-innistrad-crimson-vow-2021-10-28) found in [*Innistrad: Midnight Hunt*](https://magic.wizards.com/en/products/midnight-hunt) and [*Innistrad: Crimson Vow*](https://magic.wizards.com/en/products/innistrad-crimson-vow) boosters but are stripped of any color and feature a silver foil-etched treatment with a touch of gloss. It's a slick style for a truly black-and-white basic land you'll want to see in person to appreciate.


Local WPN Premium game stores will receive copies of all five promos to use in a variety of waysâ€”check with [your local WPN Premium store](https://locator.wizards.com/) to see how you can acquire these incredible promos soon.
