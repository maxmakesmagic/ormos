New Draft, new Standard, and three days of action.


**Pro Tour *Ixalan*!**


Coverage of Pro Tour *Ixalan* on [twitch.tv/magic](https://go.twitch.tv/magic) begins November 3 and 4 at 9 a.m. local time (MDT)/8 a.m. PT/11 a.m. ET/3 p.m. UTC. Then, due to North American daylight saving time, coverage of the Top 8 will begin November 5 at 9 a.m. local time (MST)/8 a.m. PT/11 a.m. ET/*4 p.m. UTC*.


Follow all of the action as it happens live from Albuquerque, New Mexico!


That's typically what I say in the days leading up to a Pro Tour. Thing is, "new Draft" and "new Standard" were a little more accurate about four weeks ago in the lead-up to the World Championship. So with that said . . .


While players have gotten a glimpse of the Draft and Standard formats in the last few weeks, the Pro Tour has the potential to highlight new angles for attack. After all, some of the world's very best will be competing for their share of $250,000, so tune in for three days of Pro Tour *Ixalan* to see what might emerge!

PRO TOUR IXALAN BASICS
======================


Here's the basics that you need to know about Pro Tour *Ixalan*:


* The Pro Tour is a three-day, invitation-only event featuring some of the greatest *Magic* pros as well as top-finishing Grand Prix competitors, Hall of Famers, and players who found success in August's Regional Pro Tour Qualifiers. Those players will be competing for a share of the $250,000 prize pool, with $50,000 going to the winner along with an invitation to the 2018 *Magic: The Gathering* World Championship.
* Pro Tour *Ixalan* is the first Pro Tour of the 2017–18 professional season, and the debut of the [2017–18 Pro Tour Team Series rosters](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/organized-play/2017-18-pro-tour-team-series-rosters-2017-10-30), featuring 37 teams—many new, some returning—as they strive for Pro Tour greatness.
* The formats for Friday and Saturday are three rounds of Booster Draft—using three *Ixalan* packs—and five rounds of Standard Constructed. All matches on Friday and Saturday are best-two-out-of-three games.
* The following sets are legal in Standard Constructed for this tournament: *Kaladesh*, *Aether Revolt*, *Amonkhet*, *Hour of Devastation*, and *Ixalan*.
* The following cards are currently banned in Standard Constructed, and cannot be used by players: [Smuggler's Copter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Smuggler%27s+Copter), [Felidar Guardian](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Felidar+Guardian), and [Aetherworks Marvel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aetherworks+Marvel).
* All players with 12 or more match points (a 4-4 record or better) at the end of Day One will advance to Day Two of the competition.
* The Top 8 players at the end of Day Two will advance to Sunday's playoff, featuring a traditional single-elimination bracket.
* All matches played on Sunday are best-three-out-of-five, with the first two games featuring pre-sideboard action.
* The winner gets $50,000, Platinum status in the Pro Tour Players Club through December 9, 2018, and an invitation to compete in the 2018 *Magic: The Gathering* World Championship.
* The $250,000 prize pool pays down to 64th place, awarding a minimum of $1,000. In addition, all players with 33 or more match points at the end of the Pro Tour's Swiss rounds will receive an invitation to compete in the next Pro Tour.

That's the quick hits about the first Pro Tour of 2017–18, but if you want a deeper dive, Rich Hagon—as always—[has you covered](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/organized-play/pro-tour-ixalan-preview-2017-10-30).


WHEN DOES COVERAGE START?
=========================


You can watch every round of Pro Tour *Ixalan* on [twitch.tv/magic](https://go.twitch.tv/magic) Friday, Saturday, and Sunday beginning at 9 a.m. local time.


Local time, in this instance, is Mountain Time. That means 8 a.m. PT, 11 a.m. ET, and 2 p.m./14:00 UTC each day.


However, if you're living outside of North America, things get a bit more complicated. Daylight saving time for North America rolls back the clocks this Sunday in the early morning. That means running back 1 a.m. local time for an extra hour, and another 60 minutes of sleep before Sunday's Top 8 begins. Which is great . . . except that it alters the start time for a lot of regions for that one day.


So for Europe, South America, and Japan, follow the chart:




|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Time Zone | Day 1 | Day 2 | Day 3 |
| Brazil (GMT-2) | November 3 at 1 p.m. | November 4 at 1 p.m. | November 5 at 2 p.m. |
| Central European Time (CET) | November 3 at 4 p.m. | November 4 at 4 p.m. | November 5 at 5 p.m. |
| Japan | November 4 at 12 a.m. | November 5 at 12 a.m. | November 6 at 1 a.m. |

If you can't watch the broadcast live, no worries! We'll be replaying the broadcast once each day concludes, so just in case you can't watch it all in your time zone, you'll have a chance when the hours are a little more convenient.


In addition to that, VODs (videos on demand) of each round and segment will be available on our Twitch page, so if you can't catch it all live, catch it all on demand later during the weekend!
