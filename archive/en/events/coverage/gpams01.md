![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gp_lg.gif)Chris Benafel has won 2001 Grand Prix Amsterdam, coming out on top of a 641-person field. The Top 8 included such Pro Tour luminaries as Rookie of the Year Brian Davis, 1998 Pro Tour-Los Angeles winner David Price, Daniel O'Mahoney-Schwartz (who finished fourth; the same finish his brother Steve got last week in New Orleans), and Antoine Ruel. The host country was represented by Menno Dolstra and Alexander Witt fighting for the Netherlands. Benafel defeated Spaniard Xavier Curto Vives in the finals.
