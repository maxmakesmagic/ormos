**Comments:**  

In response to judge comments, I eliminated CounterCast.


The process of developing the new logline helped me see the theme already running through my set, that of sacrifice. I have pushed this theme as the primary theme of the set, focusing on sacrificing creatures in Red but branching out in other colors and rarities. This theme risks being unfun, especially for new players, so I was careful to always make it an upside (except for Rage), with triggers that provide additional bonuses.


The +1/+1 counter theme remains, with the same concept (power-emitting mana crystals), but reduced to secondary status. The stealing theme is all but erased.


Another subtheme in Red (and White) is that of pain. Some prisoners have ritualized it as a cult of pain. This is shown on Shackled Masochist and the Paincast spells. Those spells are Prisoner aligned, just as the sacrifice triggering spells are in the Native faction (primarily Black and Green, only splashed here), but the enablers are intentionally spread across both factions to allow cross-pollination of decks.


As requested, I have parametrized Rage, but this first set only has Rage 3 (leaving room to grow). I experimented with adding the requested activation cost, but it made the cards read less elegantly, and made activating it on haste creatures feel like kicker (my core Rage concept is a card that can either be Ball lightning or solid but weak French Vanilla creature).


The looter celebrates MaRo's tweet that the ability is now red.
