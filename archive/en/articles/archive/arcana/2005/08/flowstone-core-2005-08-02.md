*Ninth Edition* is an opportunity not only for new players to learn **Magic**, but also for old-schoolers to enjoy its history. You'll find elements from many planes and timelines in this Core Set, from the antiquated [Llanowar Elves](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Llanowar%2BElves) to the wise [Counsel of the Soratami](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Counsel%2Bof%2Bthe%2BSoratami) of the moonfolk of Kamigawa, from the solemn [Adarkar Wastes](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Adarkar%2BWastes) to Otarian [Form of the Dragon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Form%2Bof%2Bthe%2BDragon).


One such flavor journey is a series of red cards related to flowstone. Flowstone in geology is the accumulation of calcite deposited by centuries of dripping water. [Flowstone in **Magic**](http://gatherer.wizards.com/?first=1&last=100&term=flowstone&Field_Name=on&Field_Rules=on&Field_Type=on&Field_Flavor=on&setfilter=Allsets&colorfilter=All&typefilter=All&output=summary&sort=name&x=41&y=29) is a *much* more active substance -- magically animated stone that has attacked, afflicted and allied with mages across three planes.


*Ninth Edition* features three of these flowstone cards, one at each rarity:
