The people have spoken, but a third of you couldn’t agree. It’s time for a run-off. Here are the top three vote getters (in no particular order):

**Concept A** - A humanoid elemental of moss supports itself with a hand against a dead tree. From where the elemental touches, it spreads wild regrowth.

**Concept B** - A shambling plant-creature which can quickly grow large thorny spikes to protect itself. Afterwards it can shed these thorns, which make excellent weapons.

**Concept C** - A Venus flytrap with an oversized mouth inhales a spell. Tubules emit the spell from behind; small buds are seen.

The deadline for the run-off will be midnight, Sunday, July 7th. After the run-off we will post the identities of the ten card concept creators.
