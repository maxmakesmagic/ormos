 Brian David-Marshall is a New York–based game designer who has been involved with Magic since 1994, when he started organizing tournaments and ran a Manhattan game store. Since then, he has been a judge, a player, and one of the longest-tenured columnists on DailyMTG.com, as he enters his second decade writing for the site. He is also the Pro Tour Historian and one of the commentators for the Pro Tour. 






I got to the feature match area too late for game one, which would seem to favor the player with Necropotence over the player with Vintara Snapper but by the time I settled in the players were shuffling up for game two. Sceadeau—pronounced ‘shadow’—found himself down a game to the mighty Snapper.

“You know what card I haven’t drawn at all this tournament?” griped Sceadeau, “Anything that begins with ‘Necro’!”

### Game two

If cards beginiing in Necro weren’t coming to Sceadeau, them he would make them come to him—and he did. At the end of Don’s first turn, he Vampiric Tutored for the brokenest enchantment and played it courtesy of Cabal Ritual on turn two. Vintara Snapper seemed like a meager turn two for Don in comparison and it was promptly Edicted away. Sceadeau followed up with a blind Cabal Therapy naming Masticore and saw the he would have his work cut out for him with a Krosine Vorine, Call of the Herd, Genesis, and Phantom Centaur queuing up to hit play. Call of the Herd was the first through the door and he went down to another Edict. Blackmail found a Wild Dog and Phantom Centaur came crashing through a window only to be Mutilated on the next turn—Sceadea was at 6 from the FOURTEEN cards he had ripped with Necro so far. Genesis threatened to make things a little more challenging and he plopped himself into the middle of the table unafraid.

With Don tapped out, Sceadeua used Rhystic Syphon to go up to 11 and draw two more cards but he quickly fell back to five from the Genesis. Vorine hit play as well but Sceadeau had Yawgmoth’s Will and was able to recycle hit Mutilate. He drew only two more cards and went to three, fearing—believe it or not—“Unyaro Bee Sting would be the end of me!” That’s one of the great aspects of these wacky format Ivitationals; you are forced to consider cards and situations you would never normally find yourself in during traditional tournament play.

Don regrew a Phantom Centaur with Genesis but did not have the mana to cast it. Sceadeau used the turn’s reprieve to play a Skittering Skirge and Sould Feast his opponent. He was at seven and could draw three more cards. Don played out a Masticore but did not have the four extra mana to shoot down the Skirge. Sceadeau attacked him down to 8 and flashed back an Edict to deal with the artifact creature. Don picked up a Wild Dog and played it and a Phantom Centaur but Sceadeau had the Sould Burn to finish him off after another attack by the Skirge

Sceadeau - 1 Don - 1

### Game three

Both games I covered in this match would be decided by Tutors. Game two was all about tutoring for Necropotence but game three was all about the Worldly Tutor for Silvos and casting it on turn three thanks to a Llanowar Elf and a Rofellos. With a Spike Drone on the table as well it would be at least a few turns before Mutilate could do its job. With three other creatures in play, Sceadeau tried to see a way out, “How many Edicts do I need?”

Sceadeau - 1 Don - 2
