Kazuyuki Takimura ended Day 1 on 9-0 alongside Steven Setya and Chye Yian Hsiang, and when Setya was paired down in Round 10, that left us with Hsiang and Takimura battling on table 1 for the title of King of the Hill.



 Takimura drafted a double [Hot Soup](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hot+Soup) White-Blue deck, featuring [Avacyn, Guardian Angel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Avacyn%2C+Guardian+Angel), which he used to take down Hsiang's Black-Red deck 2-1, to advance to 10-0 and become the first King of the Hill of Grand Prix Taipei.
