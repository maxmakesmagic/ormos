*Portal* and its offshoots are often maligned by serious long-time players for containing oversimplified versions of good cards, or cards that are just plain bad. What gets lost is the fact that a good number of tournament staples were actually designed for *Portal*.

Below are three instances of cards created for *Portal* that were later worked into expert-level expansions where they were well received: [Gravedigger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gravedigger) and [Wood Elves](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wood+Elves) from *Portal* went into *Tempest* and *Exodus* respectively, and [Wildfire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wildfire) from *Portal Second Age* was a force when it showed up in *Urza's Saga*. If you look over the card lists for the *Portal* sets, I'm sure you'll discover more of your favorites.
