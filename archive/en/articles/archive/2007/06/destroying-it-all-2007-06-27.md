Despite being the enemy of red-color of chaos and destruction-and of black-color of power and death-*white* is the true master of destroying permanents. The concept of a "reset button," a spell that destroys entire categories of permanents at a go, belongs in many ways to white, whose destructive capabilities are at their strongest when wiping clean an entire battlefield at once.


Take a look at some of white's most destructive board-sweepers through the ages to see what happens when you wrong a color with a strong sense of justice.




![wrath of god](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=wrath+of+god)

![Armageddon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Armageddon)

Alpha's first board sweepers were [Armageddon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Armageddon), [Wrath of God](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wrath+of+God), and Balance, establishing white's unique mastery over the type line. [Armageddon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Armageddon) and [Balance](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Balance) dropped out of the Core Set long ago, but [Wrath of God](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wrath+of+God) has stuck around.




![Balance](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Balance)

![Restore Balance](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Restore+Balance)

The power of [Balance](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Balance)-a spell that, when cast, is very rarely balanced at all in its destructive effect-has seen variations through the years, including [Balancing Act](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Balancing+Act) and [Restore Balance](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Restore+Balance).




![Cataclysm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Cataclysm)

[Cataclysm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cataclysm) represents a different twist on the board sweeper. Instead of being rewarded for having zero or very few of the type of permanent being destroyed, it rewarded the mage for having exactly one of each type of permanent is listed.






![Catastrophe](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Catastrophe)

[Catastrophe](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Catastrophe), continuing in the theme of cards named after synonyms for giant disasters, built on [Wrath of God](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Wrath%2Bof%2BGod) and [Armageddon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Armageddon), letting the white mage choose between the two destinies in one card. (Hint: use the Wrath half if you're losing, and the [Armageddon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Armageddon) half if you're winning!)






![Purify](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Purify)

[Purify](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Purify), in the set right after [Catastrophe](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Catastrophe), plugged the "holes" that [Catastrophe](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Catastrophe) missed. [Purify](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Purify) proves a board sweeper for artifacts and enchantments, all the permanent types (at the time) that [Catastrophe](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Catastrophe) couldn't hit.






![Akroma's Vengeance](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Akroma%27s+Vengeance)

Not to be outdone by an artifact, white's [Akroma's Vengeance](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Akroma%27s+Vengeance) replicated the power of [Nevinyrral's Disk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nevinyrral%27s+Disk) by destroying every type (at the time) of permanent besides lands. If that wasn't enough, it even had cycling in case the white mage wasn't in the mood to judge the entire board unworthy of existence. This pattern of "blow up everything except [some category]" formula has produced many other cards-see [Soulscour](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soulscour), [Winds of Rath](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Winds+of+Rath), and *Ravnica*'s [Hour of Reckoning](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hour+of+Reckoning).
