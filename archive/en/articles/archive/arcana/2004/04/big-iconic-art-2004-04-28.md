When a new set of **Magic: The Gathering** comes out, art from the new set must be selected to showcase the iconic characters and to represent the theme and mechanics of the set. These pieces are often illustrated in proportions larger than the usual **Magic** art box, much like the [Tall Angels](/en/articles/archive/tall-angels-2004-02-26) and other [big art](/en/articles/archive/more-darksteel-big-art-2004-04-14) we've seen before on Magic Arcana, and they commonly appear on packaging of boosters and theme decks.

Today we look at a few famous characters and creatures from past sets, in their original dimensions rather than the way they appear on cards. Warning: this art is big -- prepare to scroll.
