Did we mention the [prerelease events](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/events/prereleases-fut) occur April 21-22? Well, did you mark it on your PDA? Oh, you carved it into the flesh of your arm instead? Good enough. Get a bandage to protect that date while the scar forms. We don't want you to bleed on the prerelease card.
