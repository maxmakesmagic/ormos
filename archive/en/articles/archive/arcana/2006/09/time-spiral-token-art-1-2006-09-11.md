*Time Spiral* cards generate token creatures.

A *lot* of them.

By which we mean, a lot of *Time Spiral* cards generate token creatures, and many of them generate a lot of tokens.

And since these cards will be doing their token-cranking best in ***Magic** Online* starting October 30th, new art was commissioned for all those tokens. Today we start showing off some of these token art pieces.

We begin with one of the most common types of creature token in *Magic*.

*Saproling token art by Warren Mahy*

*Ravnica* brought saproling token-generation to the fore recently, but in fact saprolings are steeped in history. This is a *Time Spiral* saproling: as you may have read in the [*Time Spiral* minisite](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=magic/timespiral/home), Dominaria is undergoing hard times. After a series of plane-wide disasters, vegetation is scarce. Saprolings here are sturdy and compact little fungi, not the [verdant crystal-growers of Ravnica](/en/articles/archive/ravnica-style-guide-saprolings-2005-09-28).


Ready for more?

*Goblin token art by Thomas M. Baxa*

*Of course* there are goblin tokens. In fact, no less than three *Time Spiral* cards generate goblin tokens. As you can see, goblins are a bit worse for wear in the time-rift-afflicted world as well. But if nothing else, goblins are survivorsâ€”they adapt, and they multiply.


Last one for today.

*Token art by Heather Hudson*

Here's a slightly odder token. We're not giving away what creature type this thing is just yet, but maybe you can figure it out. Here's a hint: It's *Time Spiral*, where Dominaria's past gets mingled with its present. Think old-school, and post your guesses to the boards.


Watch Magic Arcana for more *Time Spiral* token art, and keep in mind that [prereleases](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/events/prereleases) start September 23!
