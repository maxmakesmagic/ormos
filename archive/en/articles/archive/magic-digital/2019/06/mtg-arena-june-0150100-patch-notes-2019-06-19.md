Events
======


War of the Spark Chronicles
---------------------------


* The reward structure and amount of wins required to win has been updated for Part IV and Part V. The distribution of prizes will be as follows:
	+ 3 Wins: 1st Glass Style
	+ 5 Wins: 200 Gold
	+ 7 Wins: 2nd Glass Style
	+ 10 Wins: 3rd Glass Style

*Developer Notes:* We've received a lot of feedback regarding the new event structure, and one of the things we wanted to change was players feeling "burnt out" by the amount of time it took to receive all of the prizes. We want players to feel challenged by these events and rewarded for completing them, but not at the cost of fun. **The total rewards remain the same**; we've combined the two Gold rewards into one (previously, you'd receive 100 Gold at 6 wins and 12 wins respectively), and lowered the total number of wins required to receive all glass styles (previously, you'd receive a glass style reward at 3, 9 and 15 wins respectively).


We will also be making all of the glass styles you would have been able to earn from these events available for purchase for Gold after the release of *Core Set 2020*. If you found yourself unable to finish one of the previous events, you'll still have the option to add all of the glass styles to your collection. Thank you for all of your feedback, and we hope you enjoy these changes!

Bug Fixes
=========


* Selecting a split card with [God-Eternal Kefnet](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=460980)'s triggered ability and then declining to cast the card should no longer cause the game to temporarily stall.
* Players should no longer receive an "Asset Error Detected" message when playing on a Turkish version of Windows.
* When using [Dauntless Bodyguard](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=442902)'s activated ability, it should now properly give Indestructible to a Planeswalker if the Planeswalker was a creature when Dauntless Bodyguard entered the battlefield.
* Fixed an audio bug that caused some players to hear a looping static sound.
