L[ast Friday](/en/articles/archive/latest-developments/core-samples-2010-06-04), Tom LaPille asked three questions at the end of Latest Developments. Well, he technically asked four, but the last three are the ones we're talking about today:


* Precisely eight cards have appeared in every core set from *Alpha* through *Magic 2010*. How many of these eight do you think will be in *Magic 2011*?
* Which of the eight cards are you most confident will be IN *Magic 2011*?
* Which of the eight cards are you most confident will be OUT of *Magic 2011*?

Before we get into the answers (by which I mean both the answers you gave and the real answers, let's talk about the history of these eight cards, much of which is borrowed from [this Mark Rosewater article](/en/articles/archive/making-magic/outwit-outplay-outlast-2005-07-25) from 2005.


There were 283 cards in *Alpha*. Only 250 of those cards made it into *Revised*. We're down to eight cards that have been in every core set. Before we list them, here's the round-by-round breakdown.



> 
> ***Alpha***: 283  
> ***Revised***: 250  
> ***Fourth Edition***: 211  
> ***Fifth Edition***: 151  
> ***Sixth Edition***: 79  
> ***Seventh Edition***: 60  
> ***Eighth Edition***: 40  
> ***Ninth Edition***: 24  
> ***Tenth Edition***: 16  
> ***Magic 2010***: 8
>

And here are the eight cards:

> [Rod of Ruin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rod+of+Ruin)
>

So! Let's get some results!

### Which Cards Made It?


In order to get a prediction from the crowd (that's you), we asked the same question in two different ways: which card do you think is in, and which card do you think is out? And here are the results!

If there's a consensus to be drawn from these two polls, it's that the community is pretty confident that [Giant Growth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Giant+Growth) is in ***Magic** 2010*. And the community is ...


... correct!


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/arcana/468_hh1tyj0ris.jpg)So [Giant Growth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Giant+Growth) is one of two cards that has made it through twelve core sets. And which is the other?

[Giant Spider](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Giant+Spider)! It didn't do all that well on the "what card do you think is in" poll, but it was second-to-last on "what card do you think is out?"
