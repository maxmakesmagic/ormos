Drive to Work: Episode 177
==========================


 







[**Episode 177**](http://media.wizards.com/2014/podcasts/magic/drivetowork177_10thingsgoal.mp3): 10 Things Every Game Needs: Goal (16.0 MB)


This is the first podcast in a now ongoing 10-part series called "10 Things Every Game Needs," based on my [article](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/making-magic/ten-things-every-game-needs-part-1-%1A-part-2-2011-12-16) and [podcast](http://www.wizards.com/drivetoworkpodcast.xml) of the same name. Each podcast, I go in depth on one aspect. For the first one, I talk all about the needs of a game having a goal or goals.
