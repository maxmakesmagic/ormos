It's a new year! Is that still safe to say? We're about two and a half weeks in, so it's still relatively new, right? It's certainly new enough to check in on the progress of the different guilds!




|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Guild | Points | Members | Points per member |
| Izzet | 1,996,277 | 11,362 | 175.70 |
| Azorius | 1,889,327 | 9,891 | 191.01 |
| Dimir | 1,292,222 | 8,368 | 154.42 |
| Simic | 1,190,628 | 6,696 | 177.81 |
| Golgari | 952,365 | 7,331 | 129.91 |
| Selesnya | 770,044 | 6,505 | 118.38 |
| Boros | 733,627 | 5,731 | 128.01 |
| Orzhov | 726,870 | 7,459 | 97.45 |
| Rakdos | 672,796 | 5,340 | 125.99 |
| Gruul | 410,587 | 2,510 | 163.58 |

  
Note that Izzet and Azorius are both above 1,500,000 points. That means both guilds have received the Guild Eminence achievement!


And in more competitive news, Izzet is still winning! And they've still got the most members! Azorius and Simic have better points-per-member stats, for what that's worth. Since our [last update](/en/articles/archive/guild-update-2012-12-14), Azorius has amassed a few more points than Izzet, but they're the only ones.
