Trials for individual-format Grand Prix tournaments award a three-round bye to a Grand Prix tournament for one or more of the top-finishing competitors. The number of three-round byes awarded will be determined by the number of players in the Trial as shown in the table below. Grand Prix Trial byes no longer pass down. If a player already possesses a three-round bye, finishes high enough to win another bye from a Grand Prix Trial, that bye will not be passed down to the next eligible player. `


**Intro Pack Open Dueling**


Players are provided a *Conflux* Intro Pack upon joining. Players are then matched up against others for game play. After 5 games, players receive a *Conflux* Booster. Cost: ¥ $1300.
