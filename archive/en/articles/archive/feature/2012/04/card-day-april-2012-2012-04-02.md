![Griselbrand](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/tcg/products/avr/kxnlgrvj2f_en.jpg)

![Nath's Buffoon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Nath%27s+Buffoon)**[Nath's Buffoon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nath%27s+Buffoon)** – *Lorwyn* common. The creature depicted in [Nath's Buffoon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nath%27s+Buffoon) is a boggart goblin that's been enslaved by [Nath of the Gilt-Leaf](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nath+of+the+Gilt-Leaf) to be a court fool. You can see Nath's shadow in the background of the buffoon's art!
 ![Liar's Pendulum](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Liar%27s+Pendulum)**[Liar's Pendulum](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Liar%27s+Pendulum)** – *Mirrodin* rare. [Liar's Pendulum](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Liar%27s+Pendulum) started life as as a riff on [Cursed Scroll](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cursed+Scroll), but the design team changed its effect to card-drawing for flavor reasons.
 ![Jester's Sombrero](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Jester%27s+Sombrero)**[Jester's Sombrero](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jester%27s+Sombrero)** – *Unglued* rare. Each card in Unglued has a bonus word on its rules text line, which can be combined to form a bonus joke. But did you know that the words sometimes tie in to the card on which they appear? Consider Jester's Sombrero, which has flavor text spoken by a small Mexican dog. And the bonus word? "Chihuahuas". Fascinating!
 ![Trickery Charm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Trickery+Charm)**[Trickery Charm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Trickery+Charm)** – *Onslaught* common. Things have changed since the days of *Onslaught*. For example, the entire direction David Martin was given for [Trickery Charm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Trickery+Charm) was "Blue mist in a glass charm shaped like a shell." The original sketch was a little more clown-centric than the creative team liked. You can [see it here](/en/articles/archive/sketches-trickery-charm-2003-07-24).
 ![2410](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&multiverseid=2410)**[Jester's Cap](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=2410)** – *Ice Age* rare. Some people say that the face on the *Ice Age* version of [Jester's Cap](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=2410) was modeled on Richard Garfield. Maybe it was and maybe it wasn't. The [statue of the jester](http://www.wizards.com/magic/images/mtgcom/fcpics/making/mr240_30.jpg) doesn't look much like Richard, though. (The statue can be seen in context in [this Mark Rosewater article](/en/articles/archive/making-magic/80000-words-2006-08-07).)
