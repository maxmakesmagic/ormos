There's only one thing happening this weekend in the **Magic** Community, and it's the [***Magic** 2011* Prerelease](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/events/prereleases)!

But for the sake of argument, let's say you want to know what's going on in the world of **Magic Online**. Well, have you been to [www.mtgonline.com](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Digital/MagicOnline.aspx?x=mtg/digital/magiconline/whatshappening)? It's got lots of fascinating information, like upcoming tournaments (there's a *Ravnica* Block Sealed tournament on July 17 that gives out a complete foil *Ravnica* set!) and full event coverage of online tournaments.

Why, with just one click, you can see the results of any event of the last week. Congratulations, for example, to **Tutz**, who won [this Legacy event](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Digital/MagicOnlineTourn.aspx?x=mtg/digital/magiconline/tourn/1395676) with a deck featuring nine Eldrazi cards. Neat!
