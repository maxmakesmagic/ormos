Both German players were unbeaten going into round 7. Rene Kraft made top 8 at GP London last year. Jensen is another local Hamburg player who benefited from a trial with 3 byes.

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gpham02/946.jpg)Jensen went first and busted out a Mongrel and then used [Quiet Speculation](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Quiet+Speculation) to put two Roars and an [Acorn Harvest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Acorn+Harvest) into the graveyard. Kraft summoned a turn two [Millikin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Millikin), which accelerated him to a Fiend (taking second Mongrel) and [Nantuko Shade](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nantuko+Shade). A [Faceless Butcher](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Faceless+Butcher) took care of the first Wurm token and the second Wurm met the same fate.

Jensen was running out of creatures, his sole Mongrel against Kraft’s double Butcher, [Nantuko Shade](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nantuko+Shade) and [Mesmeric Fiend](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mesmeric+Fiend). A Second Mongrel leant some support and the [Acorn Harvest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Acorn+Harvest) was flashed back to shore up the defences.

Kraft’s [Millikin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Millikin) had been doing sterling work though, turning over an [Ichorid](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ichorid), a black creature to feed and an [Aether Burst](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aether+Burst) to make the one in his hand all the more effective as both dogs went yelping back into Jensens hand. The squirrels chumped and Jensen was down to a precarious 4 life.

[Upheaval](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Upheaval) was on hand to reset the game and Jensen relaid an island and then Careful Studied into a Rootwalla. He only had 3 life so Kraft’s [Ichorid](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ichorid) was potentially a big problem. That problem was doubled as a second [Ichorid](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ichorid) was discarded with enough food for both. A third [Aether Burst](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aether+Burst) to clear the road and it was time for game 2.

Kraft 1-0 Jensen

Jensen opened again with a turn two Mongrel. Kraft [Aether Burst](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aether+Burst)ed it and then tried to snipe out Jensen’s forest with a [Rancid Earth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rancid+Earth). Jensen had plenty of forests (he’d already thrown one to [Careful Study](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Careful+Study)), but then [Braids](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Braids) appeared to give him a choice of keeping the Mongrel or getting up to four mana to flashback the Roar in his graveyard. Jensen chose to keep the Mongrel only for it to vanish beneath a [Faceless Butcher](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Faceless+Butcher). He had a backup Mongrel, but Kraft had a backup Butcher and when Jensen failed to lay a land the following turn that was all she wrote.

Rene Kraft beat Marten Jensen 2-0
