While both of these players had made it to Grand Prix elimination rounds before, one could hardly characterize this pairing as evenly matched. Austria's Bernhard Lehner had but one Top 8 to his name, while Czech superstar Martin Jůza could boast a whopping 21 Grand Prix Top 8s including four wins.


So Lehner was clearly the underdog here and his deck may have been too. He had brought an innovative red-green beatdown deck, while Jůza was running a more established archetype in Jeskai, albeit with a few spicy additions from Fate Reforged.


Game 1
======


Lehner won the die-roll and was suitably happy: "Achievement unlocked!" He led with a [Heir of the Wilds](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Heir+of+the+Wilds), and Jůza matched it with his own [Soulfire Grand Master](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soulfire+Grand+Master). "That guy is … annoying," Lehner complained and killed it via [Crater's Claws](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crater%27s+Claws).


Over the next two turns, Jůza summoned a pair of [Mantis Rider](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mantis+Rider)s but Lehner was easily able to keep up with him: First, he cast an impressive three-drop of his own in [Fanatic of Xenagos](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fanatic+of+Xenagos), then his [Lightning Strike](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Strike) took down one of Jůza's fliers, and then came [Stormbreath Dragon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stormbreath+Dragon).

While Jůza did have [Stoke the Flames](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stoke+the+Flames) for the Dragon and was able to get Lehner all the way to 2 life, it was Lehner who sealed the deal, with [Chandra, Pyromaster](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chandra%2C+Pyromaster) coughing up the final point of damage.


**Berhard Lehner 1 – 0 Martin Jůza**


"It was really important for you to win this die-roll," Jůza agreed while the players were shuffling. "If I had had the first creature or been able to kill yours first, this whole thing would have played out very differently."


Game 2
======


This time it was Jůza's turn to deploy the first creature—Seeker of the Way—but this game was defined by a lot of trades rather than a classic damage race. [Fanatic of Xenagos](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fanatic+of+Xenagos) traded with [Lightning Strike](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Strike), [Heir of the Wilds](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Heir+of+the+Wilds) traded with [Goblin Rabblemaster](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Rabblemaster), another [Heir of the Wilds](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Heir+of+the+Wilds) traded with [Seeker of the Way](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seeker+of+the+Way).

Jůza was already far ahead in life when he summoned [Stormbreath Dragon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stormbreath+Dragon) and put Lehner in grave danger. Lehner did have a Dragon of his own, and these two traded too, but then Jůza had more—Brimaz, King of Oreskos—while Lehner didn't.


**Berhard Lehner 1 – 1 Martin Jůza**


Game 3
======


"Sooo … I'm going to go first again," Lehner announced with a determined grin on his face.


Again, Lehner had [Heir of the Wilds](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Heir+of+the+Wilds) as his first creature, to Jůza's [Seeker of the Way](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seeker+of+the+Way). The two creatures traded in combat and were replaced by another [Heir of the Wilds](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Heir+of+the+Wilds) for Lehner and a [Mantis Rider](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mantis+Rider) for Jůza. The latter died to [Lightning Strike](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Strike), the former died to [Stoke the Flames](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stoke+the+Flames).


Lehner only now drew his third land, whereas Jůza's hand appeared to contain nothing but lands while, in fact, Jůza was also accumulating as-of-yet useless [Disdainful Stroke](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Disdainful+Stroke)s. Both, his large number of lands and [Disdainful Stroke](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Disdainful+Stroke)s, came to his rescue though, when the duel entered its homestretch. First, Jůza was able to counter Lehner's [Stormbreath Dragon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stormbreath+Dragon); then Jůza was able to cast his own [Stormbreath Dragon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stormbreath+Dragon) and also keep mana up to counter Lehner's second [Stormbreath Dragon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stormbreath+Dragon); finally, he was able to turn his Dragon monstrous to take the game.


**Berhard Lehner 1 – 2 Martin Jůza**
