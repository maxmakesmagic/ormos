Fifteen of our Top 25 were in action across a busy double-header weekend of Grand Prix action, featuring [Standard in Brussels](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/gpbru15) and [*Battle for Zendikar* Limited in Atlanta](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/gpatl15). There's been a ton of action, so let's get to it.


For the third week in succession, possession of the No. 1 spot in *Magic* has changed hands. At the end of October, it was Owen Turtenwald. Last week, World Champion Seth Manfield took the lead. And now, thanks to a tremendous second-place finish at GP Atlanta, Owen Turtenwald sits once again on top of the rankings, with Manfield dropping back into the No. 2 spot. Turtenwald had a terrific blue-red deck in the Top 8, but Pro Tour *Gatecrash* Champion Tom Martell stayed strong in the final, piloting green-white to victory.


Away from the top of the standings, there were three big movers this week. Reid Duke put in a solid performance in Atlanta, and the 3 points he earned there move him up three places to No. 11. Martin Müller of Denmark had an outstanding weekend in Brussels, where he reached the semifinals. That puts him up five places to No. 17. But the biggest mover of the week goes to another player in Brussels, the Czech Republic's Ondřej Stráský. Despite having two Pro Tour Top 8s, this was Stráský's first Top 8 at the Grand Prix level. Although he lost in the quarterfinals, he was part of a huge weekend of success for two European superteams. Players from EUreka (featuring many top Scandinavian Pros) and the Cabin Crew (which includes Stráský alongside eventual winner Lukas Blohon) were all on Esper Dragons. Stráský leaps up eight spots to enter the Top 10 at No. 8.


Elsewhere in Brussels, there were useful point pickups for No. 21 Joel Larsson and No. 22 Fabrizio Anteri. In Atlanta, Sam Black claimed his first Grand Prix Top 8 of the season after a fairly miserable run of form. He stays at No. 6, but has some space behind him in the table before Player of the Year Mike Sigrist and is now snapping at the heels of No. 5 Paulo Vitor Damo da Rosa. Seth Manfield's 2 point result was solid, but not enough to prevent Turtenwald from reclaiming his position at the head of the list. Now attention turns to [Pittsburgh](http://magic.wizards.com/en/content/fact-sheet-grand-prix-pittsburgh-2015) to see if there's yet another twist in the *Magic* Top 25 Pro Rankings, so join us here next week to find out.
