2006 Japanese National Championship
-----------------------------------


World Champion Leads the Way!
=============================












[日本語の取材へ](http://magic.wizards.com/ja/events/coverage/world-champion-leads-way)


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/jpnat06/fin.jpg)Katsuhiro Mori is the 2006 Japanese National Champion!


Mori had hoped for a scenario where he and his good friend, Pro Tour Charleston winner Tomoharu Saito, could have made the team together. They tried to jockey for position in the closing rounds of the Swiss but their maneuver backfired and they squared off in the quarterfinals ensuring that one of them would be frustrated in their attempt. When Mori defeated Saito, his friend made the former Rookie of the Year promise to win the tournament. Mori did not disappoint him.


Mori was piloting Structure and Force, a three-color control deck that abused [Sensei's Divining Top](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sensei%27s+Divining+Top) in conjunction with both [Dark Confidant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dark+Confidant) and [Counterbalance](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterbalance), that was designed by Saito's Charleston teammate Tomohiro Kaji. After besting Saito's beloved Sea Stompy in the quarters he went on to dispatch Ishimaru Ken's BUG Aggro in the quarters. After Ishimaru fell to Hidenori's Rakdos deck in the third place playoff, Mori took down another Sea Stompy deck -- this one piloted by Shouhei Yamamoto.


The Japanese National Team for 2006 World Championships will be Katsuhiro Mori, Shouhei Yamamoto, and Hidenori Katayama with Ishimaru as the alternate and qualified for Worlds.
