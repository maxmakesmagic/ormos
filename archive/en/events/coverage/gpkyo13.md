Grand Prix Kyoto 2013
---------------------


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/gpkyo13/trophy.jpg)Congratulations to Rich Hoaen, Mike Hron, and Alexander Hayne, winners of Grand Prix Kyoto 2013!


The three foreigners stormed into Kyoto on a whim. After a long break from the game and armed with a weekend off work, Pro Tour Geneva Champion, Mike Hron, paired up with limited master, Rich Hoaen, to play in Kyoto. They needed a third. Recalling his experience in the finals of Grand Prix Montreal 2011, Rich Hoaen asked Alexander Hayne if he would like to join Mike Hron for Kyoto. Hayne obliged, and, after a tense finals match against Makahito Mihara, Kentarou Yamamoto, and Jun'ichiro Bandou, the three became Grand Prix Champions.


The last Team Limited Grand Prix in Japan was in Osaka over eight years ago. While many sets have come out in the interim, Japanese players came out of the woodwork to try their hands at *Theros* Sealed this weekend. Due to the skill required in *Theros* Team Limited, super-teams such as Martin Juza, Shuhei Nakamura, and Yuuya Watanabe, Akira Asahara, Shu Komuro, and Masaya Kitayama, and Shouta Yasooka, Katsuhiro Mori, and Tomoharu Saito were seen at the top of the standings throughout the weekend. Between absurdly powerful mono-color devotion decks, blazingly fast red-white decks, and masterfully controlling blue decks, 578 teams became 1 as we crowned the foreign champions.


As the sun sets on the autumn foliage a new page has been turned on Team **Magic**. Congratulations once again to Rich Hoaen, Mike Hron, and Alexander Hayne!
