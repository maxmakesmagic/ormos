You want deck lists? Oh boy do we have 'em! North America has finished Regionals and tournament organizers are getting their deck lists in even as we speak. Check out 33 Top 8s in so far, and look back for all the rest coming soon.


Of course, we also have the latest in PTQ deck lists and **Magic Online** Premier Events. You want more Standard? Check out the Qualifier from Orlando, Florida, or the tons of lists from the Standard queues in the digital world. We also have Extended, Classic, and *Shards of Alara* Block Constructed. But enough from me; get reading those lists!
