Prolific streamer Jan van der Vegt has typically done pretty well in European Grand Prix scene. While he typically plays something safe like Jund, he showed up with a masterpiece to [Grand Prix Prague](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/magazine/article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/eventcoverage/gppra14/welcome). On the first turn I saw him play, he exiled a [Simian Spirit Guide](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Simian+Spirit+Guide) to cast a turn-one [Sylvan Caryatid](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sylvan+Caryatid). What on earth was he playing?


Thankfully, the coverage team figured that people might want to know that, so they did a quick write-up on his deck [here](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/magazine/article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/eventcoverage/gppra14/day1#4). As it turns out, he was attempting to put [Griselbrand](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Griselbrand) or [Emrakul, the Aeons Torn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Emrakul%2C+the+Aeons+Torn) into play as quickly as possible with [Goryo's Vengeance](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goryo%27s+Vengeance), [Fist of Suns](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fist+of+Suns) (!), and [Through the Breach](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Through+the+Breach). They called it "Tin Fists," after the Legacy deck Tin Fins, which also tries to accomplish the same goals, albeit in a slightly different way.


Jan started 8â€“0 and eventually finished in 44th place. That's not too shabby considering he built an entirely new archetype for Modern.
