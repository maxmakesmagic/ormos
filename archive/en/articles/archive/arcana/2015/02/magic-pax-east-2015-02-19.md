Blake is the content manager for DailyMTG.com, making him the one you should email if you have thoughts on the website, good or less good (or not good). He's a longtime coverage reporter and hasn't turned down a game of Magic in any format ever. 





PAX East is coming up March 6–8 in Boston, MA, and *Magic: The Gathering* has a weekend's worth of exciting plans scheduled, including plentiful opportunities for gaming, a Top 8 PAX East Challenge, and a panel discussing and revealing much of *Magic*'s future—including exclusive PAX East preview cards from *Dragons of Tarkir*!



That's right, as is PAX tradition, the *Magic* panel—held Friday, March 6, 3 p.m.–4 p.m. in the Albatross Theater—will give a number of tantalizing hints about the next several months, including a number of cards from *Dragons of Tarkir*. R&D Design Manager Dave Humpherys, R&D Game Designer Ethan Fleischer, Senior Game Designer and creative guru Doug Beyer, and Global Brand Manager Liz Lamb-Ferro will all be on hand to answer your questions.



Don't worry, if you can't make the panel, you'll still get to see the previews later on DailyMTG.com, but if you want to be the first to see these exclusive previews—or to learn more about what's happening over the next year—then make sure you're in line early. These panels fill up fast!



Additionally, Wizards of the Coast will have tournament space in the Tabletop Area in Hall C, with events all weekend, including:



* On-demand events, drafts, Commander, and free learn-to-play sessions.
* Scheduled events, including Sealed, Two-Headed Giant, Chaos Draft, Foil Fest Plus, Mini-Masters, Modern, Standard, and a special PAX East Challenge that starts on Saturday. Seriously, there's a lot of gaming going on.
* Spellslinging with R&D members Dave Humpherys and Ethan Fleischer.


For a full schedule, details on Wizards of the Coast events at PAX East, and more information, visit [magic.wizards.com/PAXEast](http://magic.wizards.com/PAXEast).



Additionally, PAX East features the return of the Prize Wall—a literal wall of *Magic* prizes there for the winning—and the opportunity to earn a limited-edition PAX East Pinny Pin that looks a little something like this.
