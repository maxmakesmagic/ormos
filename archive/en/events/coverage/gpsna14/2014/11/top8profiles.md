**Occupation:** UPS  
  

**Previous *Magic* Accomplishments:**

[Thoughtseize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtseize) doesn't really help the deck's strategy.

Thanksgiving

Day 2 Pro Tour *Khans of Tarkir*




**What deck are you playing, and why did you choose it?**
  
Abzan Midrange - I am comfortable with this style of deck, it has very few bad matchups, and [Siege Rhino](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Siege+Rhino).
 



**What are your best and worst matchups?**
  
Best – White-Blue Control. Worst - Reanimator.
 



**What card, in the maindeck or sideboard, won you the most matches this weekend?**
  
[Siege Rhino](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Siege+Rhino)




**What changes would you make to your deck and why?**
  
I would like a maindeck answer to [Hornet Queen](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hornet+Queen)—maybe [Bile Blight](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bile+Blight), and I'd like to try [Whip of Erebos](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Whip+of+Erebos).

Top 8ed PTQs
 



**What deck are you playing, and why did you choose it?**
  
Temur Monsters. I love the color combination and thought it was a powerful deck.
 



**What are your best and worst matchups?**
  
 Best - Any control deck. Worst - Green Devotion decks.
 



**What card, in the maindeck or sideboard, won you the most matches this weekend?**
  
[Stubborn Denial](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stubborn+Denial)

### Ryan Scullin


**Age:** 24  
**Hometown:** Narragansett, RI  
**Occupation:** (F)unemployed  
  

**Previous *Magic* Accomplishments:** 
  
Top 33 Grand Prix Chicago
 



**What deck are you playing, and why did you choose it?**
  
Mardu Midrange. I had the most experience with it, and [Tymaret, the Murder King](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tymaret%2C+the+Murder+King) and [Bloodsoaked Champion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodsoaked+Champion) weren't good enough.
 



**What are your best and worst matchups?**
  
 Best - UW Heroic. Worst - [Whip of Erebos](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Whip+of+Erebos) decks.
 



**What card, in the maindeck or sideboard, won you the most matches this weekend?**
  

 Tie between [Crackling Doom](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crackling+Doom) and [Hushwing Gryff](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hushwing+Gryff).
 



**What changes would you make to your deck and why?**
  
Find room in the sideboard for [Liliana Vess](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Liliana+Vess). You lose midrange mirrors to having fewer/worse cards, and Chandra rarely does anything the turn she comes down.
 



**What's the best American holiday? [Hint: It's probably Thanksgiving, right?]**
  
Right!

### Gareth Aye


**Age:** 24  
**Hometown:** Knoxville, TN  
**Occupation:** Dad, Software Engineer at Mozilla Firefox  
  

**Previous *Magic* Accomplishments:** 
  
2 PTQ Top 8s, Top 64 at TSS Championship 2005, Top 16 at Tri-State Regionals 2004
 



**What deck are you playing, and why did you choose it?**
  
Blue-Red Aggro. I thought Red would be well-positioned for Game Ones, and that doing something different with the transformational sideboard would cause some opponents to mis-sideboard.
 



**What are your best and worst matchups?**
  
 Not totally sure. I get uncomfortable when I see [Whip of Erebos](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Whip+of+Erebos).
 



**What card, in the maindeck or sideboard, won you the most matches this weekend?**
  
[Goblin Rabblemaster](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Rabblemaster)




**What changes would you make to your deck and why?**
  
Not sure.
 



**What's the best American holiday? [Hint: It's probably Thanksgiving, right?]**
  
Thanksgiving! I locked it this year for my family!
