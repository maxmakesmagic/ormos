Both of these players had one previous Grand Prix Top 8 to their name and have been around the proverbial block. Sometimes on the Pro Tour, often high in the standings at Grand Prix, they just always seem to be around. And they often play entertaining decks.


This time Michael Bonde had brought a copy of the white devotion deck which, on this same weekend, Sam Black had piloted to a Top 4 berth at the World Championship. Meanwhile, Thoralf Severin was piloting a blue-white control deck which everyone agreed was one of the harder matchups for White Devotion.


The Games
=========


Bonde led with [Soldier of the Pantheon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soldier+of+the+Pantheon) and [Hangarback Walker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hangarback+Walker), Severin with [Jace, Vryn's Prodigy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace%2C+Vryn%27s+Prodigy). Bonde resolved [Mastery of the Unseen](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mastery+of+the+Unseen). Traditionally, the enchantment spells trouble for control decks but here it seemed somewhat lackluster, as Bonde was stuck on three lands and had his subsequent [Knight of the White Orchid](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Knight+of+the+White+Orchid) countered by [Clash of Wills](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Clash+of+Wills).

Over the next couple of turns, Severin used Jace to pull further and further ahead, keeping Bonde's creatures at bay via [Swift Reckoning](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swift+Reckoning). Bonde managed to put Severin to 3 with Thopter tokens but soon he was facing [Jace, Telepath Unbound](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace%2C+Telepath+Unbound) as well as [Elspeth, Sun's Champion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elspeth%2C+Sun%27s+Champion). Things were coming to a close, one way or another.


"Three cards left?" Bonde asked with a sigh.


"And all of them insane," Severin replied.


"One of them's [End Hostilities](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=End+Hostilities)," Bonde guessed.


"What?" Severin retorted in mock shock. "That's a lie!"


Of course Severin did have [End Hostilities](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=End+Hostilities). However, he got a little greedy: he used [Jace, Telepath Unbound](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace%2C+Telepath+Unbound) and went to 2 by cracking a [Flooded Strand](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flooded+Strand) before casting the sorcery. This way, Bonde was able to save two Thopter tokens with a pair of [Valorous Stance](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Valorous+Stance)s and stole the game.


**Michael Bonde 1-0 Thoralf Severin**


In the second game, Bonde again led with [Soldier of the Pantheon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soldier+of+the+Pantheon), but he had no further plays for a while, and no third land for even longer. Eventually, his [Soldier of the Pantheon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soldier+of+the+Pantheon) and Kytheon, Hero of Akroas both met [Ojutai's Command](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ojutai%27s+Command)s.

[Dig Through Time](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dig+Through+Time), [End Hostilities](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=End+Hostilities), [Banishing Light](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Banishing+Light), yet another [Ojutai's Command](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ojutai%27s+Command), Elspeth Sun's Champion, another [End Hostilities](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=End+Hostilities), another Elspeth ... One really only needed to look at the cards Severin played to guess who won this game.


**Michael Bonde 1-1 Thoralf Severin**


"Did you know the deck before yesterday?" Severin asked while they were shuffling.


"I knew it on Tuesday. Craig Wescoe sent a list to Thomas [Enevoldsen]."


"Asking for his opinion?"


"Asking whether he would play Grand Prix Prague and wanted to have a good deck!"


Another game, another [Soldier of the Pantheon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soldier+of+the+Pantheon). And now that it counted, Bonde even had a sweet follow-up in [Hangarback Walker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hangarback+Walker), with [Kytheon, Hero of Akros](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kytheon%2C+Hero+of+Akros) and [Wingmate Roc](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wingmate+Roc) up next! Meanwhile, Severin had taken a mulligan and was still staring at two lonely Islands as his only lands, even after activating [Jace, Vryn's Prodigy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace%2C+Vryn%27s+Prodigy) twice.


**Michael Bonde 2-1 Thoralf Severin**


Severin still bemoaned the loss of the first game. "I knew he could manifest into [Archangel of Tithes](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Archangel+of+Tithes) with [Mastery of the Unseen](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mastery+of+the+Unseen) at end of turn, then flip it, and attack, and there was no way for me to beat that line," Severin explained to me after the match. "So I figured there'd be no difference between 3 life and 2. I didn't even think about double [Valorous Stance](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Valorous+Stance)."
