Hayne Wins Third GP in Six Months!
==================================




January 25-26, 2014












Grand Prix Vancouver 2014
-------------------------


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/gpvan14/trophy.jpg)M att Sperling may have been unstoppable in the Swiss, but come the Top 8 it was Canadian folk hero Alexander Hayne who could do no wrong. *Theros* Standard had been evolving ever since the Pro Tour, and three decks had established themselves as the pillars of the format: Mono-Blue Devotion, Mono-Black Control, and Blue-White-based Control. They were never overwhelming; each tournament seemed to bring with it new designs and new innovations. Still, they were the Decks to Beat. That evolution seemed to reach its logical conclusion this weekend, when those three archetypes alone made up the entire Top 8.


First in was Mono-Black Control, thanks to Matt Sperling's incredible 13-0 run in the swiss. Then came three each of Blue-White and Mono-Blue. Sneaking in at 12-3 was Jon Stern, the other Mono-Black player. He and Sperling clashed in the quarters, and Stern emerged victorious, setting up an All-Canada Grudge Match against Hayne. On the other side of the bracket, Peter Sundholm was the only Mono-Blue player to escape the quarterfinals, and he repeated his victory over Blue-White in the semis. It started to look like he was destined to take home the trophy.


It was not to be. With all deliberate care, Alexander Hayne completed his sweep of the Top 8, dispatching Sundholm in straight games, and taking home his third Grand Prix title in just six months. Coming into this event Hayne was 18th in the Top 25 Player Rankings. Who knows how high he'll climb this season?


Congratulations to Alexander Hayne, Grand Prix Vancouver Champion!
