When [*Planechase*](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/tcg/productarticle.aspx?x=mtg/tcg/planechase/productinfo) came out in 2009, it presented a whole new way to play **Magic**. The shifting plane cards constantly affected the game. And on June 1, 2012, *Planechase* (2012 Edition) will bring even more multiplayer fun!

The four new *Planechase* decks (Chaos Reigns, Night of the Ninja, Primordial Hunger, and Savage Auras) will contain all-new planar decks that contain a new kind of oversized card, and an assortment of new, Eternal-legal **Magic** cards.


Let's take those one at a time. The "all-new planar decks" explain themselves. You'll get to visit planes you've never seen before as well as some old favorites. Long-time players will particularly enjoy this fact: there's a plane card for Shandalar!


Next, the new kind of oversized card. These are phenomenon cards (plural: phenomena) that represent the sort of perils that lurk between planes. Here's one now!

Each deck has eight new plane cards and two new phenomenon cards, and these cards are not shared between decks; there are a total of 32 new planes and 8 new phenomena.


Finally, there are brand new cards that are legal in Eternal formats. It's probably worth mentioning that there's a cycle of multicolored Legendary creatures. Like this one!

And speaking of multicolored Legendary creatures, we've been asked to mention that other Commander-specific products are on their way. That's all we can say! Now, back to *Planechase*.


There are a total of 21 new **Magic** cards in the set, spread across the four decks. Each deck has six of the cards (counting by name), although some appear in multiples.


*Planechase* (2012 Edition) comes out on June 1, 2012. Each of the four decks contains a sixty-card **Magic** deck, a ten-card planar deck, and a planar die. The MSRP for each deck is $19.99. This release will be available in English, French, German, Italian, Japanese, and Spanish.
