**Card of the Day - vendredi 29 août 2003**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Zirilan%20of%20the%20Claw)#### Zirilan of the Claw


 *Mirage* rare.  
Ziliran was actually in the *Scourge* file as a wacky reprint to help the Dragon theme… until someone pointed out that he was on the Reserve List and thus was not eligible to reprint.
 


**Card of the Day - jeudi 28 août 2003**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Karn,%20Silver%20Golem)#### Karn, Silver Golem


 *Urza's Saga* rare.  
Karn's passive nature is reflected in the fact that he becomes 0/8 when engaged in combat. He does, however, deal 4 when unblocked.
 


**Card of the Day - mercredi 27 août 2003**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Jasmine%20Boreal)#### Jasmine Boreal


 *Legends* uncommon.  
We often get emails asking why cards like Jasmine Boreal are Legends; after all, they have no super-powers! *Legends* designers believed that just being 4/5 was enough of an ability for a human character (which were normally all about 1/1) to warrant legendary status.
 


**Card of the Day - mardi 26 août 2003**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Nemata,%20Grove%20Guardian)#### Nemata, Grove Guardian


 *Planeshift* rare.  
Nemata was the one Legend in Planeshift that did not have a special premium alternate art version printed. Tahngarth, Ertai, and the Weatherlight all did.
 


**Card of the Day - lundi 25 août 2003**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Ur-Drago)#### Ur-Drago


 *Legends* rare.  
Looking at cards like Ur-Drago, it is easy to see that landwalk was a dominant ability in the earliest metagames, and therefore needed to be hosed by giant expensive creatures.
 


**Card of the Day - vendredi 22 août 2003**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Crop%20Rotation)#### Crop Rotation


 *Urza's Legacy* common.  
Even though it is restricted in Type 1, Crop Rotation was very close to being reprinted in *Eighth Edition*. It was pulled when development realized it was the only card with an additional cost attached to play it.
 


**Card of the Day - jeudi 21 août 2003**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Tek)#### Tek


 *Invasion* rare.  
The reason Tek has such a short name is because the old template had it appearing in the text box five times. A new template at the last minute cleaned up the wording, but by then the name had stuck.
 


**Card of the Day - mercredi 20 août 2003**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Demystify)#### Demystify


 *Eighth Edition* common.  
Even though enchantments have been around since Day One, there was never a card that simply said, "Destroy target enchantment" - with no other text - until Demystify was printed in *Onslaught*.
 


**Card of the Day - mardi 19 août 2003**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Stone%20Catapult)#### Stone Catapult


 *Portal Three Kingdoms* rare.  
The Catapult is P3K's rather unimpressive take on Royal Assassin. For an additional two mana, you get a point of toughness, but it can't kill black creatures and can only be used in your first main phase.
 


**Card of the Day - lundi 18 août 2003**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Yavimaya%20Elder)#### Yavimaya Elder


 *Urza's Destiny* common.  
When you activate Yavimaya Elder, its triggered ability resolves before the activated one. That means you search for two lands before you draw a card.
 


**Card of the Day - vendredi 15 août 2003**



![](https://web.archive.org/web/20210430212845im_/https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Serendib%20Efreet)#### Serendib Efreet

 Revised rare.  
When is a blue card not a blue card? When it's green! Due to an inexcusable oversight, Revised's Serendib Efreet was printed using Ifh-Biff Efreet's art and card border. The card, for all game purposes, should be treated as a blue card.
 


**Card of the Day - jeudi 14 août 2003**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Zephid's%20Embrace)#### Zephid's Embrace


 *Urza's Saga* uncommon.  
Normally blue creature enchantments don't boost power and toughness. But when cards are created as a cycle, as the Embraces were, some color ends up bending the rules a little.
 


**Card of the Day - mercredi 13 août 2003**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Apprentice%20Wizard)#### Apprentice Wizard


 *The Dark* rare.  
Blue isn't supposed to get good mana acceleration, but I doubt anyone enjoyed getting this fellow as a rare (technically uncommon 1) in packs of *The Dark*.
 


**Card of the Day - mardi 12 août 2003**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Time%20Walk)#### Time Walk


 *Alpha* rare.  
Early playtest versions of this card read "Target player loses next turn," which was supposed to mean your opponent skipped his next turn. Of course, it was misconstrued to mean he lost *the game* on his next turn, and was changed to the printed wording.
 


**Card of the Day - lundi 11 août 2003**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Flight)#### Flight


 *Eighth Edition* common.  
The creature shown in the art is a Spiritmonger.
 


**Card of the Day - vendredi 8 août 2003**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Invisibility)#### Invisibility


 *Eighth Edition* uncommon.  
Ten years ago, Invisibility was considered a powerful card since in could make a Juggernaut completely unblockable. Oh, how far we've come.
 


**Card of the Day - jeudi 7 août 2003**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Underworld%20Dreams)#### Underworld Dreams


 *Eighth Edition* rare.  
Context is everything. Once restricted in Type 1 due to the power of cards like Timetwister and Wheel of Fortune, Underworld Dreams may never even make a dent in Standard.
 


**Card of the Day - mercredi 6 août 2003**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Adarkar%20Wastes)#### Adarkar Wastes


 *Seventh Edition* rare.  
Much to the chagrin of tournament players, the Ice Age pain lands were replaced in the Core Set by Invasion comes-into-play-tapped lands.
 


**Card of the Day - mardi 5 août 2003**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Castle)#### Castle


 *Seventh Edition* uncommon.  
Castle is one of a handful of cards that is *not* appearing in the Core Set for the first time. We wonder if anyone will miss it.
 


**Card of the Day - lundi 4 août 2003**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Rewind)#### Rewind


 *Eighth Edition* uncommon.  
The "free" mechanic is not keyworded, which makes it legal to use in a Core Set, unlike something like cycling or echo.
 


**Card of the Day - vendredi 1 août 2003**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Seeker%20of%20Skybreak)#### Seeker of Skybreak


 *Seventh Edition* common.  
Seeker of Skybreak was one of the last cuts from *Eighth Edition*; it was swapped out for Rushwood Dryad when it was determined that untapping creatures was no longer a green ability.
