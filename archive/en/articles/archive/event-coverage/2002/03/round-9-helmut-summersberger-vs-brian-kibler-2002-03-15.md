### Game 1

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/ptosa02/a786.jpg)Summersberger was not off to a good start. He threw away a one-land hand, only to draw six non-land cards. The five land hand was finally acceptable, allowing him to summon a first turn [Basking of the Wurm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Basking+of+the+Wurm) and putting a [Basking Rootwalla](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Basking+Rootwalla) into play. 

Kibler went on riding his Looter. He discarded [Fiery Temper](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fiery+Temper) to kill off [Wild Mongrel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Mongrel) and summoned a [Psychatog](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psychatog). Once he cleared the board completely, Aether Bursting the Wurm token and using [Fiery Temper](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fiery+Temper) on the Rootwalla, Kibler was able to go on the offensive. Kibler dropped a second [Psychatog](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psychatog), prompting the Austrian player to concede game 1.

Sideboarding

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/ptosa02/a787.jpg)**Kibler:**   

In: [Shower of Coals](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shower+of+Coals), [Cephalid Looter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cephalid+Looter), [Divert](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Divert), [Divert](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Divert)  

Out: [Fiery Temper](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fiery+Temper), [Chainer's Edict](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chainer%27s+Edict), 2 [Upheaval](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Upheaval)  
**Summersberger:**  

Out: Forest, Island, [Aether Burst](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aether+Burst)  

In: Llawan, 2 [Compulsion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Compulsion)  

(Summersberger forgot to register two [Werebear](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Werebear) on his deck list and was forced to play with two extra lands – that is why he boarded two lands out).

### Game 2

Summersberger kept a reasonable hand, but his first turn [Careful Study](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Careful+Study) did not turn up anything useful, forcing him to discard an [Arrogant Wurm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arrogant+Wurm) and a Forest. Both players summoned [Cephalid Looter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cephalid+Looter)s on turn 3, and Summersberger followed it up with yet another Looter – so the game might come down to which player can take advantage of their madness cards better. 

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/ptosa02/a788.jpg)At the end of Kibler's turn Summersberger activated the Looter to put [Basking Rootwalla](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Basking+Rootwalla) into play. Kibler had a perfect answer, casting [Violent Eruption](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Violent+Eruption) to kill all the creatures his opponent had in play. Kibler used Edict to kill the Wurm token and went on gaining card economy via the Looter, discarding [Circular Logic](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Circular+Logic)s and burn spells. 

Both players cast [Compulsion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Compulsion) and were cycling through their libraries quickly. Kibler got out a [Psychatog](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psychatog) and was only a turn or two away from victory. Summersberger was holding an [Upheaval](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Upheaval) but spent several turns unable to drop a land despite cycling through two cards a turn with [Compulsion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Compulsion). Kibler was able to attack for the win before his opponent ever got to the point where he could cast [Upheaval](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Upheaval).

Despite being forced to play with twenty six lands in his deck game 1, Summersberger lost to poor land draws – though it seems like the matchup should be in Kibler's favor anyway.

**Final Result:** Kibler 2 – Summersberger 0
