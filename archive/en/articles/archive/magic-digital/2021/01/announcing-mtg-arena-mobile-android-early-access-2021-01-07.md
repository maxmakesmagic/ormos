Vikings. Gods. Myths. Legends. *Mobile*.


As foretold, *MTG Arena* will soon be available in the palm of your hand starting with Android early access on January 28, with additional Android device, tablet, and iOS support coming later this year.


The app will be accessible to players whose mobile devices meet our planned Android recommended specs, everywhere *MTG Arena* and the Google Play store are currently available. Our Android early access will include cross-platform support and all cards and formats available in *MTG Arena*, including the upcoming release of *Kaldheim.*


We want fans to have fun, enjoyable experiences with the long-awaited mobile version of *Magic*, and we want to make sure our releases are polished and ready to play. Stay tuned for more information coming later this month in our January State of the Game.
