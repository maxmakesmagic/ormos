### **Jon Finkel vs. Ben Rubin**


Game One  

Totally dominating Finkel to begin the match, Rubin dealt 18 points of damage on turn four (Ball Lightning, Jackal Pup, Shock, 2 Fireblasts) for the win.


Game Two  

In another race for the burn finish, Jon Finkel was able to deal 11 points of damage on 12th turn (Cursed Scroll, Mogg Fanatic, 2 Fireblast) to even the match. Many in the crowd agreed double Fireblast is good.


Game Three  

Once again it was a damage race, with Finkel’s Hammer recursion finishing second to Rubin’s Cursed Scroll and multiple burn.


Game Four  

Looking very weak on the opening draw, Finkel’s hand consisted of mainly land and a Hammer of Bogardan, while Rubin’s held his commonly seen Cursed Scroll. In the fourth straight neck and neck race, Finkel gained a decided advantage after his attacking Ball Lightning forced Ben to sacrifice two Mountains to Fireblast. As Finkel went into Hammer recursion (with 8 Mountains) against Rubin’s Scroll action, Jon was forced to Fireblast a Rubin Ball Lightning, potentially losing him his recursion (he went down to 7 Mountains). On his upkeep, Finkel regrew the Hammer and topdecked a Mountain on the draw and used the Hammer to take Ben down to 9. On his next turn, Rubin drew a Ball Lightning, played it, and then Fireblasted Jon to death, ending Finkel’s quest to become the first double Pro Tour Winner.
