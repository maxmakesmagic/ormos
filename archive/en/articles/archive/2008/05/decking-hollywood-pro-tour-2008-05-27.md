Hollywood's breakout star of 2008? Try Charles Gindy. The American made his Pro Tour Top 8 debut last weekend at [Pro Tour–Hollywood](/en/events/coverage/gindy-puts-name-lights) and walked away a champion.


Gindy defeated Jan Ruess of Germany [in three games](/en/articles/archive/event-coverage/finals-gindy-puts-name-lights-2008-05-25) to take home the title and the $40,000 first prize. Mixing in the tribal theme of *Lorwyn* with a few well-placed [Garruk Wildspeaker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Garruk+Wildspeaker)s and [Tarmogoyf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf)s, Gindy's Black-green Elves deck got the better of Ruess's Merfolk.


But there was much more to the weekend than Gindy's performance. The Pros took their whacks at the Standard metagame, with six different decks making it to the [Top 8](/en/articles/archive/event-coverage/top-8-decklists-2008-05-24). Looking for a fresh deck idea? Check out the list of the [**Day Two decklists**](/en/articles/archive/event-coverage/decklists-day-two-decklists-2008-05-25), and then dive in for more analysis and instruction with our video and text Deck Techs.
