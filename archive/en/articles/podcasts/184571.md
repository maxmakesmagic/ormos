Drive to Work: Episode 109
==========================


 







[**Episode 109**](http://media.wizards.com/podcasts/magic/drivetowork109_judgmentpart1.mp3) : *Judgment, Part 1* (13.1 MB) 


My second podcast today is my first podcast about the design of *Judgment*, the third set in the *Odyssey* block. This is the set that balanced out the "Black Set" of *Torment* by focusing on black's enemies, green and white. 


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/mtgcom/authorpics/authorpic_markrosewater.jpg)Magic: The Gathering Head Designer Mark Rosewater shares stories, insights, and more while driving to work. Listen in and learn more about Magic!
