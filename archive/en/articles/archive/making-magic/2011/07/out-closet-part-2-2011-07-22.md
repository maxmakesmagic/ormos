Two weeks ago I wrote [a column about T-shirts](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/mm/151). It wasn't really about T-shirts. It was about **Magic** history using a personal filter as a connecting device. I expected it to be well received, enough so that I made it a two-parter, but then something interesting happened. It became one of my most divisive columns ever. By divisive, I mean that some people really liked it and others hated it.

I don't mind writing divisive columns ([Elegance](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/magazine/article.aspx?x=mtgcom/daily/mr146) and [Playing with Memories](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/mm/103) being two of my most famous examples â€”make sure to read the follow-up to each of these articles if you've never read them before, [here](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/magazine/article.aspx?x=mtgcom/daily/mr148) and [here](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/mm/105).) But usually when I write one, I know what I'm getting myself into. My T-shirt column was not intended to be a divisive column. As a designer (and a writer), it's very important to understand your audience's reactions to your work. When they react differently than you expect, there's a learning opportunity.

Out of the Closet, Part II (or, How Many T-shirts Made Me a Better Designer)
Here's a trick I learned in college. If you want to get a very fast sense of a character in a movie check out what they are wearing and what book they are reading. These are the two easiest places for a writer to quickly capture the essence of a person. If you follow this line of logic through, one of the quickest ways to learn about a person is to check their bookcase or their closet. I'll save my bookcase for another day, but today (and [two weeks ago](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/mm/151)) I'm giving you a chance to get a quick insight into the guy who's in charge of making **Magic** cards, sets, and blocks. My Top 10 **Magic** T-shirts say a lot about the things that matter to me. Today I'm going to walk you through what **Magic** shirts I hold most dear, and I'll explain holistically how those impulses apply directly to how I design **Magic.**
