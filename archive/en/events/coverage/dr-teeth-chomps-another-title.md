Dr. Teeth Chomps Another Title!
===============================











![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gpmelb05/win.jpg)In a weekend filled with sloppy Magic, questionable decisions, and few surprises, a [Psychatog](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psychatog) player managed to snag another title running essentially the same deck that Antoine Ruel took to a Pro Tour victory last weekend. James Zhang, a 19-year-old university student from Sydney, just happened to be the pilot of said [Psychatog](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psychatog) deck and to win he had to overcome Boros, Goblins, and Boros - relatively easy matchups for an experienced master of the 'Tog. Zhang's opponent in the finals was Paul Chalder, a Sydney amateur and one of two players with perfect records at the end of Day 1. Chalder blew Zhang out of the water in game 1 and nearly pulled off the upset in the finals before Zhang struck back in game 2 and Chalder ran out of time, conceding the final game in order to catch his flight.


Other storylines this weekend included Terry Soh also running the table on Saturday before sleeping through round 8 on Sunday morning and getting a match loss. He later took an intentional draw against Tomoharu Saito in round 11 only to have both pros finish 9th and 10th in the standings, shutting the Asian experts out of the elimination rounds. Congratulations go out to all of the great players and staff here in Australia and particularly to James Zhang, winner of Grand Prix-Melbourne 2005.
