 A longtime member of the Pro Tour and Grand Prix coverage staff, Nate Price now works making beautiful words for all of you lovely people as the community manager for organized play. When not covering events, he lords over the @MagicProTour Twitter account, ruling with an iron fist. 





With Round 4 underway, and all of the players with three byes thrown into the mix, it was time to check around the room to see what people were playing, and, more importantly, what was doing well.



 Starting at Table 1 and wandering around, a few things became clear. First, Monoblack Devotion is nowhere near as thoroughly played as it has been and continues to be online. It is still likely one of the top five decks being played this weekend, but it is riding the bottom of that list rather than sitting pretty at number one or two. Monoblue Devotion is in the same boat, and it appears that many of the players who have opted to display their devotion to Thassa have also decided to show [Ephara, God of the Polis](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ephara%2C+God+of+the+Polis), a little love, running the version of the deck that splashes for white.
