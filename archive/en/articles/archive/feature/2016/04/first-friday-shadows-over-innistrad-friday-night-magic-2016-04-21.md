The Walking the Planes crew visits a local store to find out what players brought to battle with at the first Friday Night *Magic* after the rotation and release of *Shadows over Innistrad*. What new brews emerged? What cool combos were set in motion?


Zombies, monsters, enchantments, and Octopi are everywhere on the first Friday of the new Standard.
