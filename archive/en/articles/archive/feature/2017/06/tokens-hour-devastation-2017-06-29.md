 Nicholas Wolfram fell promptly in love with tabletop and video games when he was only two years old, and he has been writing about them since he figured out how words worked. Now he puts together words about Magic, which he started playing way back in 2000. 






*Amonkhet* set a new record for the number of different tokens in a single *Magic* set, and while *Hour of Devastation* won't be breaking that record, we did want to carry over some of the great new token ideas we established with *Amonkhet*. Namely, we wanted to do with eternalize what we did with embalm, in that each creature with the keyword ability gets a unique token to represent its new Zombified form. Here are all of the eternalized tokens in the set, which you've already seen if you've been keeping up with preview season (check out the [Card Image Gallery](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/card-image-gallery/hour-devastation) if you're behind):

In addition, we're bringing three more "traditional" creature tokens that will be created by Crested Sunmare, Rhonas's Last Stand, and The Locust God, respectively:

We hope that you're as excited as we are to start gathering up as many of these tokens as you can! Remember: all of these will be available in *Hour of Devastation* packs, and your first opportunity to crack a pack will be at a [Prerelease](http://magic.wizards.com/en/event-types/prerelease) on July 8â€“9, so [talk to your local store](http://locator.wizards.com/) and make sure they save you a spot!
