Wrapping up our [informal](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/arcana/919)
[Arcana](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/arcana/936)
[series](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/arcana/944) of sneak peeks from the *Ravnica* style guide, we peer today at the Boros Legion.


The Boros guild combines white's community devotion (and occasional autocratic over-zealotry) with red's emotional fervor (and occasional blind rage) -- a potent and potentially scary combination, especially given the fact that the Legion holds the position of law enforcement in Ravnica. It is a guild about combat, more than all others -- but combat to defend and preserve the higher law spoken down from its archangel guild-leader, [Razia, Boros Archangel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Razia%252C%2BBoros%2BArchangel). 


The look and feel of Boros stems from its militaristic nature -- its creatures are heavily armored from head to toe, yet decorated in sun-symbols, reflecting the guild's power structure and devotion to the angel at the top. Here are concept sketches from the *Ravnica* style guide for a Boros paladin and foot soldier.

Boros doesn't just employ humans and fighter-types, however. Its military order applies equally to its wizards and clerics, and more exotic beasts such as its order-following (but still combat-feral) giants, minotaurs and rocs.

The guild-leader, [Razia, Boros Angel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Razia%2C+Boros+Angel), is also depicted in the style guide in this Tomas Giorello sketch.
