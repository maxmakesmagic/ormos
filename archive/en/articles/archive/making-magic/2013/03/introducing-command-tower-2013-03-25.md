There are two exciting changes coming to DailyMTG!


Next week, we are going to launch a new column here on DailyMTG.com called Command Tower, with [Adam Styborski](http://www.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Archive.aspx?author=Adam%20Styborski) at the helm. Along with this news, I am also excited to welcome Bruce Richard to DailyMTG.com as the new author behind [Serious Fun](http://www.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Archive.aspx?tag=seriousfun&description=Serious%20Fun).

The [Commander](http://www.wizards.com/Magic/TCG/Resources.aspx?x=magic/rules/100cardsingleton-commander) format has become one of the most popular casual formats played around the world. Where it was once an oddity, it is no longer unusual to see players with giant stacks of cards battling out in multiplayer games. As Commander’s popularity grew, so did its share of the content for Serious Fun, which is a double-edged sword. We want to reach an often-overlooked group of the **Magic** community: the kitchen table and casual audience, who may or may not play Commander. With that in mind, I decided it was time to give Commander its own home.


Adam Styborski launches Command Tower April 4, 2013, and will continue every Thursday alongside [Top Decks](http://www.wizards.com/Magic/magazine/Archive.aspx?tag=TopDecks) and [Perilous Research](http://www.wizards.com/Magic/magazine/Archive.aspx?tag=Perilous%20Research).


**Introducing Bruce Richard**

The column is dedicated to the casual player. Aimed at the casual kitchen-table player, it has to cast a wide net across the multitude of ways to play **Magic** with your friends.


Perhaps the biggest misconception I think some have about Serious Fun is they think it is meant to be a prescriptive column defining the only ways to play casual **Magic**, but in truth it is meant to be a peek into the possibilities of how to play. A launchpad of possibilities.


It’s a daunting task for anyone, but I am quite confident the new author, Bruce Richard, is up to it.


Bruce first came to my attention as part of the StarCityGames.com Writer Search a few years ago, and then he joined the writing roster at GatheringMagic.com after my departure. All the while, he’s been writing his own Serious Fun–style content, talking about multiplayer and casual **Magic**.
