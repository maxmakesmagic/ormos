 Stybs has played Magic the world over, writing and drafting as part of the event coverage team and slinging Commander everywhere his decks will fit. 





In his third Modern format Pro Tour, and *fourth* total of his career, sixth-ranked player Lee Shi Tian was a bundle of energy. Thanks to testing efforts with his teammates, he set aside his [Jeskai Ascendancy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jeskai+Ascendancy) proclivities to play the deck his team found most suitable: Burn. As arguably the best player in Asia, and certainly one of the best in the world, winning his way through a Pro Tour would put a definitive exclamation point next to his name on future Pro Tour Hall of Fame ballots. Exclamations were suitable for the oft-excited contender.


Antonio Del Moral León was a *Magic* *Online* Championship Series contender. Winning a season, and qualifying for the Pro Tour, Del Moral León represented one of the many ways to not only make it onto the Pro Tour but put in the practice needed for success. While he didn't hail from an organized testing team, he did make fast friends with other Spanish competitors that attended this weekend, including those he fought alongside of as part of Spain's 2014 World *Magic* Cup team.


The Decks
=========


Burn, Lee's deck and similarly built to fellow Top 8 competitor Seth Manfield's, was a straightforward number crunch. With classics such as Lighting Bolt, [Rift Bolt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rift+Bolt), Searing [Blaze](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blaze), and [Goblin Guide](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Guide), the red side of things improved with *Khans of Tarkir*'s addition of [Monastery Swiftspear](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Monastery+Swiftspear). A splash of white allow both the efficient [Lightning Helix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Helix) through the door, and it also brings sideboard cards like [Kor Firewalker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kor+Firewalker) to bear in the mirror. His team's overall success on the weekend made it clear Burn was an appropriate choice.


Before the format's upheaval, Modern was home to a powerful [Delver of Secrets](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Delver+of+Secrets) deck that used cards like Young Pryomancer and [Lightning Bolt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt) to aggressively press in damage. Without that deck's backbone—Treasure Cruise—available, some players returned to blue-red's roots in the format with [Splinter Twin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Splinter+Twin). The powerful Aura not only wins games with either [Pestermite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pestermite) or [Deceiver Exarch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deceiver+Exarch), but also turns one [Snapcaster Mage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snapcaster+Mage) into every spell in the deck among other tricky options. With its victory at the first Modern format Pro Tour, it remained a perennial contender, putting not just Del Moral León but fellow Top 8 player Jelger Wiegersma into the Sunday spotlight.

The Games
=========


In typical Lee fashion, his emotions were running high entering the match.


"Do you feel nervous?" Lee asked Del Moral León as they shuffled.


"No," Del Moral León said.


"It's my fourth time," Lee said, "and I'm still nervous." He shook his hands at his sides, wriggling in his seat to disperse his anxiety. They didn't wait long to get started.


The first game began with Del Moral León following the tried and true path of [Splinter Twin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Splinter+Twin) decks: Massaging his hand, digging for the pieces of the combo he needed with multiple [Serum Visions](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Serum+Visions). Lee similarly ran the line Burn lays, opening with [Monastery Swiftspear](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Monastery+Swiftspear) with a plan to cast [Lightning Bolt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt)-type spells. A defensive [Flame Slash](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flame+Slash) took care of the Swiftspear, but [Goblin Guide](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Guide) replaced it.


Del Moral León passed with three mana up, then cast [Deceiver Exarch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deceiver+Exarch) to block Lee's guide.


"Combo?" Lee asked, wondering what Del Moral León had planned next turn. After failing to deal damage to Del Moral León, Lee just passed the turn leaving his own mana up. [Deceiver Exarch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deceiver+Exarch) attacked Lee, and Del Moral León passed after missing his fourth land.


With mana up, Del Moral León represented another [Deceiver Exarch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deceiver+Exarch) or [Pestermite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pestermite), as well as [Vendilion Clique](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vendilion+Clique) to peek into Lee's hand. Lee cast [Lightning Helix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Helix) at the end of that before drawing for his turn and passing back. Here, [Vendilion Clique](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vendilion+Clique) was Del Moral León's end-of-Lee's-turn play. It saw [Lightning Bolt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt), Shard [Vol](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vol)ley, and [Lightning Helix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Helix) waiting. [Lightning Bolt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt) was cycled away, and with the coast clear of two one-mana instants in Lee's hand Del Moral León jammed [Splinter Twin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Splinter+Twin) onto his [Deceiver Exarch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deceiver+Exarch) to take the first game.

The second game began with a suspended [Rift Bolt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rift+Bolt) by Lee, and the familiar [Serum Visions](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Serum+Visions) by Del Moral León. [Eidolon of the Great Revel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eidolon+of+the+Great+Revel) was Lee's next play, turning any further [Serum Visions](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Serum+Visions) for Del Moral León into self-inflicted [Shock](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shock)s. The Eidolon attacked on Lee's next turn before he cast [Lava Spike](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lava+Spike), and Del Moral León paused before settling on [Negate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Negate).


A suspended [Rift Bolt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rift+Bolt) meant Del Moral León's 12 life was precarious: He took it to 10 playing an untapped [Steam Vents](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Steam+Vents). Then on Lee's turn [Pestermite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pestermite), to tap down the Eidolon, put Del Moral León to 5 after that. Del Moral León stayed at three open lands before passing back to Lee, who cast [Monastery Swiftspear](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Monastery+Swiftspear).


Del Moral León used his [Remand](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Remand), falling to 3. Lee just cast the Swiftspear again and found [Pestermite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pestermite) blocking his Eidolon. The enchantment creature had done its work as Del Moral León was within rage of nearly every spell in Lee's deck.


Another [Serum Visions](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Serum+Visions) gave Del Moral León his fourth mana, and on Lee's upkeep the Swiftspear met a [Lightning Bolt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt). Lee just passed without playing anything, then Del Moral León did likewise. When Del Moral León finally broke the stalemate by casting [Pestermite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pestermite) to tap a land at the end of Lee's next turn, Lee unleashed the two copies of Searing [Blaze](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blaze) he had waiting.


Del Moral León could only handle one.


![](https://media.wizards.com/2015/events/ptfrf/qf3_lee.jpg)  



Both games had been decided by the tip of tempo through an opening that needed to happen for either side to push through. The third game was no different. Lee led off with [Grim Lavamancer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grim+Lavamancer) as Del Moral León massed with [Serum Visions](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Serum+Visions) as usual.


"Always on top," remarked Lee as the cards Del Moral León scrys went back to the top of the library. Lee attacked with his Spellshaper before playing a second and passing. [Lightning Bolt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt), [Deceiver Exarch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deceiver+Exarch), [Flame Slash](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flame+Slash) was Del Moral León's next turn, and it reset Lee to just two lands. [Goblin Guide](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Guide) was a gamely play by Lee that revealed [Dispel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dispel) on top of Del Moral León's library during its attack. When Del Moral León played his fourth land and passed back, Lee cast [Skullcrack](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skullcrack) at the end of the turn. He repeated it again when Del Moral León added his fifth and passed.


It put Del Moral León to just 8 life.


[Snapcaster Mage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snapcaster+Mage) appeared from Del Moral León, bringing [Lightning Bolt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt) back to deal with the pesky [Goblin Guide](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Guide), and Lee just passed back with all his mana open. Another [Snapcaster Mage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snapcaster+Mage) let Del Moral León dig deeper with [Serum Visions](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Serum+Visions) on his turn.


Lees end-of-Del Moral León's turn [Lightning Bolt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt) met dispel, and he used his own to make [Eidolon of the Great Revel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eidolon+of+the+Great+Revel). It was forced to block an incoming [Snapcaster Mage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snapcaster+Mage) as Lee himself was dangerously low on life.


[Splinter Twin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Splinter+Twin) was Del Moral León's next play, and Lee didn't have a response. When the Exarch activated its new create-a-copy ability, [Destructive Revelry](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Destructive+Revelry) stepped in for Lee to stop the combo. Despite the effort, staying alive it was a relative concept in the moment as Lee fell to 4 life on Del Moral León's attack.


[Molten Rain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Molten+Rain) similarly put Del Moral León down to 4 life but Lee didn't have any creatures for blocking. As Del Moral León considered his options, Lee just shook his head. [Snapcaster Mage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snapcaster+Mage) attacked alone, and Lee fell to 2. Lee drew for his turn and simply passed back.


The [Snapcaster Mage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snapcaster+Mage) struck in again with [Deceiver Exarch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deceiver+Exarch) for Del Moral León, but [Lightning Bolt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt) brought Lee one more turn. Out of time to wait, Lee cast the remaining two spells in his hand. [Rift Bolt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rift+Bolt) met [Remand](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Remand), and [Eidolon of the Great Revel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eidolon+of+the+Great+Revel) met [Spell Snare](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spell+Snare).


With Del Moral León controlling the only remaining creature against a tapped out opponent, the Spanish contingent could be heard cheering from all the way across the hall. Lee extended his hand.


**Antinio Del Moral León defeats (6) Lee Shi Tian 2-1 and advances to the semifinals!**
