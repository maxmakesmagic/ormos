*What's your favorite way to win a game of **Magic**?*

![Zac Hill](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/mtgcom/authorpics/authorpic_zachill.jpg)**Zac Hill:** I like to build an aggro deck with ridiculous range. Some people like to just kill the opponent quickly and not ask too many questions, but I like games where I don't just die immediately if my opponent can stabilize.

![Beacon of Destruction](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Beacon+of+Destruction)  
My favorite deck I've played in a tournament was Adrian Sullivan's Johnny Walker Red in [Worlds 2007](/en/events/coverage/historic-wins-peleg-swiss-worlds), because you were a mono-red deck with 32 mana sources. Frequently you'd beat people by just throwing [Beacon of Destruction](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Beacon+of+Destruction) at their face four timesâ€”although the single greatest moment was playing turn-four [Hostility](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hostility), turn-five [Molten Disaster](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Molten+Disaster) as my only two non-mana-producing spells for exactly lethal against Shuhei Nakamura.
