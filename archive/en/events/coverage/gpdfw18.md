Day 1 Coverage



Over 1000 players have gathered in the Fort Worth Convention Center to take an early trip through *Dominaria*. With just a pair of Team Limited GPs and the Prerelease behind us, the format is still ripe for discovery and innovation. Powerful legendary creatures and synergy-focused uncommons can help players shape their Sealed pool. Capitalizing on removal and powerful creatures is the classic Sealed deck course of action, but that still looks different for every player and every pool.


Today, players will battle through nine rounds of Sealed. After the eighth round, only those with a 6-2 record or better will continue - first through a final round of Sealed, and then through two drafts tomorrow. The goal, as always, is to be one of the eight players that top the standings and move on to the Top 8 draft.


With new players, pros, and everyone in between making up the field here in Forth Worth, it's sure to be a tense and exciting weekend of *Magic*. Join us at [twitch.tv/magic](http://twitch.tv/magic) to catch the action!
