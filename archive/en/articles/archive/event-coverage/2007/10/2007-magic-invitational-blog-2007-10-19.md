12:45 p.m. - Drafting with Power
--------------------------------


*by Tim Willoughby*

Here on Day One of the Magic Invitational 2007, the very first format to be played is Cube Draft. For those of you not familiar, it's a draft with a difference. The difference isn't in any of the rules, simply the cards available to pick. Where normally one might have, for example, a triple *Lorwyn* draft, here we just have the best bit of *Lorwyn.* We also have the best bits of every set ever printed.


All in all there are 720 cards within the card pool for players to draft, from the planeswalkers to [Black Lotus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Black+Lotus). These have been picked out for their quality in general, and for Limited in particular. The decks that tend to spring from such drafts are typically approaching the quality of a decent Constructed deck—containing hugely powerful cards.


For the full list (and it's a big one) of what's in the Cube, have a look [here](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgevent/mi07/cubelist). It is the undisciplined drafter's downfall. With so many good cards, first picks become very tough, and everyone is tempted to start splashing all over the place. It's not hard to have a good deck, but unfortunately good decks are often just not good enough. While some players, like Rich Hoaen, have been drafting this way for years, there are many who had their first experience of being able to draft moxes last night, in a practice draft run at our hotel. It's been a pretty exciting time.


Going into Thursday's draft there were some pretty wacky picks. Stephen Menendian had to work out how to choose between [Time Walk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Time+Walk) and [Dark Confidant](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dark+Confidant). It says something that even a dyed-in-the-wool Vintage player went for Bob over the piece of blue power. Craig Jones, who was solidly looking at a white weenie plan, had a bizarre pack 2 where he received [Recurring Nightmare](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Recurring+Nightmare) and [Survival of the Fittest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Survival+of+the+Fittest) in consecutive packs.



![Sneak Attack](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Sneak+Attack)

Some of the decks have turned out to be particularly nutty. Kenji Tsumura has a terrifying red deck sporting [Sneak Attack](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sneak+Attack) and a whole host of fatties and burn, including a [Rorix Bladewing](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rorix+Bladewing) who he snagged 13th. If that plan doesn't work, he also has the option of casting [Illusions of Grandeur](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Illusions+of+Grandeur), and following up with [Donate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Donate). Not a bad plan B. Meanwhile Shuhei Nakamura has drafted a naughty little reanimator deck, which includes [Library of Alexandria](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Library+of+Alexandria) and [Land Tax](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Land+Tax) to fill his hand to bursting, and such fatties as [Angel of Despair](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Angel+of+Despair) to bring back. If that wasn't all, he has the combo of [Black Lotus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Black+Lotus) and [Auriok Salvagers](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Auriok+Salvagers), to potentially just hard-cast every card he draws. Gabriel Nassif has been seen sporting a combo deck, that taps a large amount of mana, untaps its lands a lot, and then taps them again for more. We're still waiting to see what he can do with it all.


On the flip side of the coin, Frank Karsten looks to have made a bit of a metagame choice, with a deck that is pretty much white weenie with [Armageddon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Armageddon), backed up by a nice little blue splash including [Ancestral Recall](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ancestral+Recall). While everyone's trying to be big and clever, Frank could easily nip in and just beat them up with his tiny guys.


Stay tuned for all the results and decklists.




1:27 p.m. - When Land Tax Attacks
---------------------------------


*by Tim Willoughby*

Thursday night at dinner I gave Shuhei Nakamura the gift of life. By virtue of the Pro Player cards, I'd noticed that he had the same birthday as me, and was born one year earlier. However, according to the Top 8 profiles of Pro Tour-Valencia, Shuhei is 26. Something didn't add up there, as I'm just 24. As it turns out, Nakamura had somewhere along the line lost track of how old he was. As if by **Magic**, he was a year younger!


### Game 1


 For this match against Guillaume Wafo-Tapa, Shuhei was on the draw, but had a wickedly good start, of [Land Tax](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Land+Tax) on turn one, and [Sensei's Divining Top](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sensei%27s+Divining+Top) plus an [Azorius Chancery](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Azorius+Chancery) on turn two. One way or another, he wanted to get his draws sorted for the rest of the game. Unfortunately for Nakamura, the tricksy Wafo-Tapa elected to not play a land for turn two, instead discarding Nether Spirit.


The spirit came into play for the Frenchman the following turn, but having held back on land, his hand was still pretty full when Nakamura played a [Mesmeric Fiend](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mesmeric+Fiend), which ate a [Vampiric Tutor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vampiric+Tutor). For a turn or two beats were traded, before Shuhei added an innocuous looking [Altar of Dementia](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Altar+of+Dementia) to his side of the field. Wafo-Tapa just shrugged, and played Night's Whisper to draw more cards, before playing [Mox Jet](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mox+Jet) and a [Rakdos Carnarium](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rakdos+Carnarium). Each player still only had 2 lands in play, so [Land Tax](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Land+Tax) was looking a little weak.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/tournamentcenter/2007/mi07/fm_cube.jpg)*Shuhei's Land Tax got the better of Guillaume.*Eventually, Shuhei chose to block [Nether Spirit](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nether+Spirit) with his *Mesmeric Fiend*, giving back Guillaume his [Vampiric Tutor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vampiric+Tutor), which soon found [Spiritmonger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spiritmonger). This looked like quite the beating for Shuhei. The Japanese player had a cunning plan though, playing [Living Death](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Living+Death) to wipe the French side of the board, and get back a Mesmeric Fiend, who permanently removed [Mirari's Wake](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mirari%27s+Wake) from the game, thanks to Altar of Dementia letting him be sacrificed with his coming into play ability on the stack.


It was up to Guillaume to again reload at this point, and he used [Skeletal Scrying](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skeletal+Scrying) to do just that, drawing 4 cards, but going to 11 life in the process. The Scrying did perform one other useful function—leaving Nether Spirit again alone in the graveyard, to come back again the following turn. Shuhei had a fair blocker for the spirit in the form of [Auriok Salvagers](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Auriok+Salvagers), but it soon got targeted by [Tendrils of Corruption](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tendrils+of+Corruption) for 4. Shuhei used Altar of Dementia to stop the lifegain, and milled himself, in the hope of getting rid of some of the weaker cards he'd seen on top of his deck with Sensei's Divining Top.


Nakamura then played [Angel of Despair](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Angel+of+Despair), to take out Guillaume's Rakdos Carnarium. [Chainer's Edict](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chainer%27s+Edict) dealt with the Angel, though it did mill Wafo-Tapa for 5. Nakamura used a [Faith's Fetters](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Faith%27s+Fetters) to deal with Nether Spirit, and play continued, without either player having a clock except for the [Death Grasp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Death+Grasp) that Wafo-Tapa had been building up to all game—which Nakamura had twice seen with his Mesmeric Fiend.


When it finally came, Shuhei performed a silent little laugh. He had the [Mana Tithe](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Tithe) all ready. The nail was put in the coffin when Shuhei followed up with [Cataclysm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cataclysm), from which he would keep Azorius Chancery, Land Tax and Altar of Dementia, with Sensei's Divining Top on the top of his deck, while Guillaume would have virtually nothing. The Frenchman, out of gas, scooped them up.


### Game 2


For Game 2, Shuhei again had the Land Tax start. He got to use it on his second turn, after Wafo-Tapa played a second swamp and [Night's Whisper](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Night%27s+Whisper). Shuhei discarded a land and [Yosei, the Morning Star](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Yosei%2C+the+Morning+Star) for his turn, and in the turns that followed, got to tax again and again, filling his hand with lands, and ultimately his graveyard with fatties. [Sundering Titan](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sundering+Titan) was the next to hit the bin, but Guillaume had a [Stuffy Doll](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stuffy+Doll), who looked likely to cause trouble even if Shuhei could find a reanimation spell.


As it turns out though, he had the perfect spell for the moment though, with [Living Death](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Living+Death) getting rid of Guillaume's only creature, and giving Nakamura 12 power of monsters, who ate most of Wafo-Tapa's land.


The Frenchman scooped it up.


Shuhei Nakamura wins 2-0




1:52 p.m. - Cube Hits and Misses
--------------------------------


*by Tim Willoughby*

For the first round of the Invitational, there were quite a few saucy plays to show off, as players got to play the draft equivalent of Vintage...


Craig Jones got something of a soft lock out against Jelger Wiegersma, in the form of turn-two [Abeyance](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Abeyance) on an [Isochron Scepter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Isochron+Scepter), only to be trumped by a [Winter Orb](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Winter+Orb).


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/tournamentcenter/2007/mi07/cube_2.jpg)*What would you pick?*
Kenji Tsumura had to mulligan to 5 in Game 2 of his match against Frank Karsten, but pulled out a great hand that let him cast [Wheel of Fortune](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wheel+of+Fortune) to get right back in the game. With [Sneak Attack](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sneak+Attack) in play, Frank cast [Armageddon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Armageddon), leaving him with a [Silver Knight](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Silver+Knight) in play. Kenji's hand sported [Bogardan Hellkite](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bogardan+Hellkite) and [Akroma, Angel of Fury](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Akroma%2C+Angel+of+Fury), all he needed was one more beater and he'd be able to come back with a horde of monsters with haste. Unfortunately for him, Karsten's deck, which seemed ideally set up to beat Tsumura's sporting such awkward cards as [Sword of Fire and Ice](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sword+of+Fire+and+Ice), Silver Knight and [Paladin en-Vec](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Paladin+en-Vec), threw up one more answer—[Maze of Ith](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Maze+of+Ith).


Shuhei Nakamura seemed to have all the answers against Evan Erwin, getting a sea of card advantage between [Library of Alexandria](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Library+of+Alexandria), [Sensei's Divining Top](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sensei%27s+Divining+Top) and [Land Tax](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Land+Tax), only to seal the deal with fatties and reanimation. While Erwin had plenty of bounce spells, including a [Tradewind Rider](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tradewind+Rider), there wasn't a lot he could do in the face of [Sundering Titan](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sundering+Titan) and [Angel of Despair](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Angel+of+Despair), which Nakamura could soon just hard cast.


In slightly shakier play, Gabriel Nassif is currently leading the 'bad play of the day' race, as he cast [Copy Artifact](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Copy+Artifact) on his [Mindslaver](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mindslaver). Ladies and gentlemen, this is not a combo. Mindslaver is legendary, and Nassif put 8 mana's worth of cards in the bin. Learn from the best kids. Don't make these mistakes at home, these are professionals here.




Podcast: Let's Get This Party Started
-------------------------------------


*by Rich Hagon*

It's Thursday morning, and time to get the **Magic**  Invitational 2007 under way. We meet the 16 players who will battle across fiveformats and 15 rounds to reach the summit of Sunday's final showdown. We give you the lowdown on The Cube, the first format of the week, and foolishly predict which of these card cavaliers will bring home the bacon. Tune in later Thursday for full coverage of the first three rounds.

Video: Auction of the People
----------------------------


*by Mark Rosewater*

This year's auction is alphabet-themed, where each deck had to contain at least one non-land card starting with each letter of the alphabet. Mark Rosewater breaks it down.

Podcast: It's The Cube Show!
----------------------------


*by Rich Hagon*

Ridiculous decks abound in the monster format that is The Cube. Elsewhere, assorted combo pieces were seen floating amid the wreckage of decks that almost, but not quite, came together to do unspeakable things. With no Swiss rounds at the Invitational, the standings promise to be tight all the way, and at the end of the first series only one competitor made it out unscathed, and only one has yet to notch a victory. Who are they? Listen to find out.

5:37 p.m.: Man o' Mana(bond)
----------------------------


*by Analynn Bustamante*

This is the first round of the second format here at the Invitational: the Auction of the People. Guillaume Wafo-Tapa's playing a 42 land deck vs. Steve Menendian's Elves! (The exclamation point is part of the name; I'm really not that excited that he's playing elves.) In this format, the players bid life totals and cards in opening hand on various decks. Wafo-Tapa has seven cards and is starting at 18 life, while Steve has 5 and 25.


### Game 1



![Manabond](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Manabond)

After winning the die roll, Wafo-Tapa decided to draw. Menendian sent his five-carder back for a possibly better four. Wafo led with an [Exploration](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Exploration) which Menendian answered with a [Quirion Dryad](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Quirion+Dryad). Wafo-Tapa complimented his Exploration with a [Manabond](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Manabond), dumping a whole mess of land into play.


Steve then followed up with a [Summoner's Pact](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Summoner%27s+Pact) for [Priest of Titania](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Priest+of+Titania). There was a little confusion with life totals and Wafo-Tapa forgets that they're not starting at 20, but even after this Wafo-Tapa had a plan. He used [Ghost Quarter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ghost+Quarter) on his own land to gain threshold for [Barbarian Ring](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Barbarian+Ring+) to kill the priest. With Menendian unable to pay for the pact, he had to shuffle up and go to Game 2.


### Game 2


For the Frenchman in Game 2 it was time to take a trip to Paris. After checking out the six-carder, Wafo-Tapa went to five. Steve once again shipped back his five cards for four.


Steve's first land drop got hit by [Wasteland](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wasteland) and from there he was forced to ship his next few turns with no plays, while Wafo-Tapa had a Manabond allowing his 42 land deck to take off. Wafo decided to dredge [Life from the Loam](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Life+from+the+Loam) in consecutive turns, which seems just fine for him. Steve finally got back into it with a forest into a [Llanowar Elves](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Llanowar+Elves), albeit many turns later. Wafo used Wasteland on his own [Plateau](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plateau) in order to, once again, gain threshold for [Barbarian Ring](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Barbarian+Ring), killing the lone elf.


Steve tried to fight back with a forest and two more mana elves, but during his turn Guillaume cast Life from the Loam for Barbarian Ring and killed another one of Steve's elves. Menendian was still kicking, swinging in with a [Fyndhorn Elf](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fyndhorn+Elf). Another dredge from Wafo-Tapa returned Life from the Loam to his hand, only to be cast, again, for Barbarian Ring. There seemed to be a pattern here.


Steve called the judge a couple of times to check on that tricky Manabond. Steve could never really get anything going with recurring Barbarian Rings offing his team, and when Wafo-Tapa started using [Rishadan Port](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rishadan+Port) on Steve's only Forest during the American's upkeep, things looked bleak. As Steve had no elves and only two Forests, Wafo-Tapa decided to start the attack with two Nantuko Monasteries. During his next turn, he attacked for 14 with various land-creatures. Steve played Summoner's Pact again, with two lands, then offered the hand.


Wafo-Tapa wins 2-0.


This is the first loss for Menendian, leaving him on 3-1, still at the top of the standings for now.




7:01 p.m.: Auction Decks in Action
----------------------------------


*by Tim Willoughby*

The Auction of the People was a pretty crazy bid-fest on Wednesday night, and while some players were celebrating their great bargains during the players dinner that evening, many others were wondering how they got so caught up in a bidding frenzy. The big talk for a lot of players was whether their deck could stand up to the five-card opening hands they had forced themselves to live with. The chances of getting two lands in a five-card hand are not especially high, and a mulligan to four is pretty horrible. The consensus seemed to be that choosing to draw first was where the money was at, and even then there were various decks that looked to be faced with an uphill battle winning against those with more starting cards in hand.



![Brand](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Brand)

One player who is certainly smiling for the Auction rounds is Rich Hoaen. When it was just him and Tiago Chan left in the Auction, there were three decks left. There were two that Hoaen *really* didn't want to be stuck with, namely Transformers and Thunderbluff. When Tiago chose to take Transformers, Hoaen let down his grumpy façade, and briskly took Cultural Exchange, the deck that "wins any time it draws [Brand](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brand)." With eight cards and 25 life to play with, he will quite happily let opponents choose to draw, and just go about his game plan according to plan.


So how is the format actually looking? Well Kenji has skillfully managed to not mulligan all day, and has lived the dream of a turn-four win (turn four or turn infinity, depending on how you look at it). Meanwhile, there have been mulligans to oblivion from Jelger Wiegersma, whose Suicide Black deck is a touch short on black sources, and a little heavy on the suicide at five cards to start.


Games seem to be really really fast, with the exception of those where both decks work, or both decks mulligan a lot. Rich Hagon compared watching some of these decks play to "Watching two blind 90-year-old men in a field trying to find each other for a fist fight." With Evan Erwin gaining a whole mess of life with his Test of Endurance deck, some games are definitely running longer than others.
