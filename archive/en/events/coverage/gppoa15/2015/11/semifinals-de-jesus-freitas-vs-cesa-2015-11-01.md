Both players are piloting Naya-colored decks with [Wild Nacatl](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Nacatl), but have slightly different takes.


De Jesus Freitas is playing slower, but more powerful, threats such as [Voice of Resurgence](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Voice+of+Resurgence), [Tarmogoyf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf) and [Knight of the Reliquary](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Knight+of+the+Reliquary), while Alejandro has the more aggressive approach as characterized by his creature choices of [Goblin Guide](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Guide), [Monastery Swiftspear](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Monastery+Swiftspear) and [Eidolon of the Great Revel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eidolon+of+the+Great+Revel).


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Lightning+Bolt)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt) [![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Wild+Nacatl)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Nacatl)
Also, there is way more direct damage in Cesa's deck, including everything from [Lightning Bolt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt), [Lava Spike](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lava+Spike), [Boros Charm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Boros+Charm) and [Atarka's Command](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Atarka%27s+Command)! De Jesus Freitas has [Lightning Bolt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt)s too, but as the “control player” of this matchup, he'll need to use it defensively to preserve his life totals and take over the game later.


Game 1
======


**![](https://media.wizards.com/2015/events/gppoa15/gppoa15_sf_de-jesus-freitas.jpg)**  
*Marcos Paulo De Jesus Freitas assumes the role of the control player in this blistering fast matchup.*


Cesa led with [Goblin Guide](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Guide) and De Jesus Freitas gladly took the trade with his 2/2 [Wild Nacatl](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Nacatl). [Tarmogoyf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf) was the replacement and De Jesus Freitas toasted [Grim Lavamancer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grim+Lavamancer) with [Lightning Bolt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt) before he could do any harm.


However, the Naya manabase does not come without cost and he had to pay quite a few life “fetching” and “shocking”. Coupled with [Boros Charm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Boros+Charm) and [Lava Spike](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lava+Spike), Cesa reduced De Jesus Freitas down to 8 life.


However, being “the Burn deck”, Cesa had no board presence whatsoever. Holding [Boros Charm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Boros+Charm) and [Atarka's Command](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Atarka%27s+Command), he was one damage short of dealing the killing blow. De Jesus Freitas steals the first game with a lethal attack by [Wild Nacatl](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Nacatl) and [Voice of Resurgence](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Voice+of+Resurgence), in the nick of time!

Game 2
======


Being on the play made a colossal difference.


Cesa was able to open with [Wild Nacatl](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Nacatl) and [Eidolon of the Great Revel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eidolon+of+the+Great+Revel), against De Jesus Freitas' lone [Noble Hierarch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Noble+Hierarch).


Now that each and every move would cost him two damage, De Jesus Freitas would need to tread carefully. That didn't stop him from paying 2 life with [Sacred Foundry](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sacred+Foundry), before taking another 4 damage to add [Wild Nacatl](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Nacatl) and [Voice of Resurgence](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Voice+of+Resurgence) to the board. Collating damage from previous attacks, fetchlands and the shocklands, De Jesus Freitas was down to 8 life, and this was just turn three!

*Alejandro Cesa mounts a brutal counterattack!*


Summoning [Goblin Guide](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Guide) and attacking with everything, [Searing Blaze](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Searing+Blaze) further reduced De Jesus Freitas down to just 3 life. [Spellskite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spellskite) put him down to one, but that was it. Although he could stay alive with [Noble Hierarch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Noble+Hierarch) for the time being, he couldn't cast any spells.


Unless that spell was [Worship](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Worship), Cesa had inevitability.

Game 3
======


Now, it was De Jesus Freitas' turn to be on the play, leading with [Wild Nacatl](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Nacatl) into [Scavenging Ooze](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scavenging+Ooze). Cesa was forced to cast an embarrassing 1/1 [Wild Nacatl](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Nacatl) off [Copperline Gorge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Copperline+Gorge). A pair of [Noble Hierarch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Noble+Hierarch) turned [Scavenging Ooze](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scavenging+Ooze) into a 4/4 in combat, while another [Scavenging Ooze](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scavenging+Ooze) joined the board.

Stuck on only 1 land, he could only suspend [Rift Bolt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rift+Bolt) to kill one of the Oozes as he watched De Jesus Freitas run him over. Effortlessly.
