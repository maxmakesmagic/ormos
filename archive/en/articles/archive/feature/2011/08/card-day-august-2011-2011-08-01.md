![Moan of the Unhallowed](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/tcg/products/isd/kwfftgnjmk_en.jpg)  
**Moan of the Unhallowed** – *Innistrad* uncommon. To see all the *Innistrad* cards that have been officially previewed, consult the [*Innistrad* Card Image Gallery](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/tcg/article.aspx?x=mtg/tcg/innistrad/cig)!


![Wooden Stake](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/tcg/products/isd/4hy2891i3e_en.jpg)  
**Wooden Stake** – *Innistrad* common. To see all the *Innistrad* cards that have been officially previewed, consult the [*Innistrad* Card Image Gallery](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/tcg/article.aspx?x=mtg/tcg/innistrad/cig)!

![Goblin Berserker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Goblin+Berserker)**[Goblin Berserker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Berserker)** – *Urza's Destiny* uncommon. The flavor text for [Goblin Berserker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Berserker) was written by Monty Ashley. He still feels bad that he used pretty much the same gag on [Phyrexian Monitor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phyrexian+Monitor) in the same set.
 ![86](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&multiverseid=86)**[Terror](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=86)** – *Limited Edition Alpha* common. Ever wonder why that terrified person is in the upper left? Ron Spencer's original illustration for [Terror](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=86) was done with a vertical aspect ratio, rather than the horizontal one that **Magic** cards use. Art director Jesper Myrfors simply rotated the art ninety degrees!
 ![1656](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&multiverseid=1656)**[Hazezon Tamar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=1656)** – *Legends* rare. [Hazezon Tamar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hazezon+Tamar) and [Dune-Brood Nephilim](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dune-Brood+Nephilim) are the only sources of the Sand creature type. Sorry, [Sand Golem](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sand+Golem)! You're just not sandy enough!
 ![Centaur Rootcaster](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Centaur+Rootcaster)**[Centaur Rootcaster](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Centaur+Rootcaster)** – *Judgment* common. [Centaur Rootcaster](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Centaur+Rootcaster) is a druid that attacks with a giant mace while simultaneously merging its enemies with the ground. When there's no enemy to root into the ground, the centaur presumably gets you whatever land you want.
 ![1841](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&multiverseid=1841)**[Armor Thrull](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=1841)** – *Fallen Empires* common. The flavor text for this version of [Armor Thrull](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=1841) makes it clear that "armor" is not meant figuratively. The [Order of the Ebon Hand](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Order+of+the+Ebon+Hand) literally wear them as armor. Weird!
 ![AWOL](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=AWOL)**[AWOL](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=AWOL)** – *Unhinged* common. This week's secret Card of the Day theme has been references to *Monty Python and the Holy Grail*. [Skinshifter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skinshifter) looks a lot like Roger the Shrubber, [Angus Mackenzie](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Angus+Mackenzie) is a dead ringer for Tim the Enchanter, [Master of the Wild Hunt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Master+of+the+Wild+Hunt) makes an acceptable Knight Who Says Ni, and [Sol Grail](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sol+Grail) stands for itself. And today, we close out with [Sir Not-appearing-in-this-film](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sir+Not-appearing-in-this-film).
 ![3057](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&multiverseid=3057)**[Sol Grail](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=3057)** – *Alliances* uncommon. [Sol Grail](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sol+Grail) is an anagram of "Gorillas." It got this name because at one point during playtesting, every single card in *Alliances* had the word "Gorilla" in its title. That happened because the design team was annoyed that the continuity team was planning to throw out their carefully planned story in favor of one about intelligent gorillas on a rampage.
 ![Master of the Wild Hunt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Master+of+the+Wild+Hunt)**[Master of the Wild Hunt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Master+of+the+Wild+Hunt)** – ***Magic** 2010* mythic rare. [Master of the Wild Hunt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Master+of+the+Wild+Hunt) has two wolves at his feet. But behind him, there are an unknown number of wolves coming up through the fog. Because after all, there's no way to know how many wolves will eventually be showing up to wreak havoc.
 ![1643](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&multiverseid=1643)**[Angus Mackenzie](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=1643)** – *Legends* rare. [Angus Mackenzie](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Angus+Mackenzie) refers to the legendary land [Karakas](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Karakas) via flavor text. Between the two cards, a picture is built up of a land where battles don't take place and famous people don't stick around for long. In other words, the exact opposite of a place where interesting things happen. Is it any wonder **Magic** never returned to it?
 ![Skinshifter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Skinshifter)**[Skinshifter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skinshifter)** – ***Magic** 2012* rare. According to [Doug Beyer](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/magazine/article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/stf/153), "[Skinshifter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skinshifter) is a form of beastmaster, a nature mage who can alter his appearance and become one of the living creatures belonging to the forest he reveres. He's a kind of wild-man who can become a wild beast."
 ![Monomania](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Monomania)**[Monomania](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Monomania)** – ***Magic** 2012* rare. [Monomania](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Monomania), a psychological disorder that went out of vogue in the mid-nineteenth century, consists of a single obsession taking over an otherwise sane mind. Before it was replaced with more specific diagnoses, it was very popular in literature, appearing by name in works like *Crime and Punishment* and *Moby Dick*.
 ![Peregrine Griffin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Peregrine+Griffin)**[Peregrine Griffin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Peregrine+Griffin)** – ***Magic** 2012* common. A griffin (or sometimes "griffon" or "gryphon") is a mythical beast with the head and wing of an eagle but the rear half of a lion. In **Magic**, either the eagle or the lion part can be swapped out for a different bird or cat, as [Peregrine Griffin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Peregrine+Griffin) (peregrine falcon) and [Spotted Griffin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spotted+Griffin) (leopard) show.
 ![Kite Shield](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Kite+Shield)**[Kite Shield](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kite+Shield)** – ***Magic** 2012* uncommon. In the real world, kite shields (named for their shape) began to replace the smaller round shields around the tenth century. They were prominent in the Battle of Hastings and can be seen in the Bayeux Tapestry. Their big advantage is that they're long enough to protect a soldier's legs and torso at the same time.
 ![Smallpox](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Smallpox)**[Smallpox](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Smallpox)** – ***Magic** 2012* uncommon. [Smallpox](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Smallpox) got its name because it's a smaller version of [Pox](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pox). Which is kind of odd when you think about it, because in the real world, smallpox is one of the more deadly varieties of pox.
 ![Arbalest Elite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Arbalest+Elite)**[Arbalest Elite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arbalest+Elite)** – ***Magic** 2012* uncommon. An arbalest is a real-world device. It evolved out of the crossbow and looks, well, like the thing on [Arbalest Elite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arbalest+Elite). The "elite" part presumably comes from the fact that this archer does more damage than a random person assigned to operate a [Heavy Arbalest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Heavy+Arbalest).
 ![Bloodthirsty Ogre](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Bloodthirsty+Ogre)**[Bloodthirsty Ogre](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodthirsty+Ogre)** – *Champions of Kamigawa* common. [Bloodthirsty Ogre](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodthirsty+Ogre) has a abilities that mirrors the ones on [Pious Kitsune](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pious+Kitsune). Foxes and ogres, as you know, are locked in an eternal struggle for dominance.
 ![Bogardan Lancer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Bogardan+Lancer)**[Bogardan Lancer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bogardan+Lancer)** – *Future Sight* common. Every card with bloodthirst appears in either *Guildpact* or ***Magic** 2012*. Except for [Bogardan Lancer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bogardan+Lancer), which is in *Future Sight*. That means it might theoretically come back, if a set ever gets printed that includes both bloodthirst and flanking!
 ![Scab-Clan Mauler](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Scab-Clan+Mauler)**[Scab-Clan Mauler](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scab-Clan+Mauler)** – *Guildpact* common. Believe it or not, the art on [Scab-Clan Mauler](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scab-Clan+Mauler) was not the final art submitted by Liam Sharp. The creative team actually preferred an earlier sketch, so they used the sketch for the card! Learn the whole story in [this Arcana from 2006](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/arcana/1004).
 ![Gristleback](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Gristleback)**[Gristleback](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gristleback)** – *Guildpact* uncommon. [Gristleback](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gristleback) was printed as a Beast, with no other distinguishing creature types. When Boars became an official type in the [Grand Creature Type Update](/en/articles/archive/grand-creature-type-update-2007-09-26), [Gristleback](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gristleback) got retroactively Boar-ified . And so, incidentally, did [Scandalmonger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scandalmonger)!
 ![Vampire Outcasts](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Vampire+Outcasts)**[Vampire Outcasts](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vampire+Outcasts)** – ***Magic** 2012* uncommon. When Bloodthirst was introduced in *Guildpact*, it was on a bunch of Gruul creatures, meaning that it appeared in red and green. When it came into ***Magic** 2012*, it appeared on a lot of black creatures. Because what makes more sense for vampires than bloodthirst?
