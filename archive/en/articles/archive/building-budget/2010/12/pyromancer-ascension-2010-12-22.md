Pyromancer Ascension

Jacob Van Lunen began playing Magic in 1995. He has participated in organized play at every level of competition and was a member of the winning team at Pro Tour San Diego in 2007, thanks to an innovative draft strategy. As a writer, Van Lunen has had more than three hundred Magic strategy pieces published 







*There are few times in my life where I've actually broken a format. [Pyromancer Ascension](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyromancer+Ascension) is, without any doubt, the most competitive Building on a Budget deck in years. It was the best deck in its format, and, at the time this was printed, the entire deck was easy to come by.* 


*I had tried to make four-color variants of the deck be viable prior to **Magic** 2011, but the mana issues were usually too much of a hindrance.* 


*I saw [Call to Mind](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Call+to+Mind) in the previews a few days before **Magic** 2011 was released. I immediately went to the drawing board and designed a deck. I posted this exact list on a forum within hours of seeing [Call to Mind](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Call+to+Mind) and [Preordain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Preordain).* 


*There were a lot of naysayers when the column went live, but I silenced the critics quickly by finishing second at a 310-person standard Pro Tour Qualifier that very weekend with a list that was within four rare lands of the original.* 


*Since then the deck has posted Top 8 finishes in Standard tournaments around the world. It was even the second most played archetype at [Pro Tour–Amsterdam](/en/events/coverage/rietzl-sweeps-victory-amsterdam), an Extended Pro Tour.* 


*This article originally ran on July 21, 2010.*


 

***Magic** 2011* is on the shelves! Everyone is brewing up new Standard decks to see how they match up against the existing metagame. I wrote about a [Pyromancer Ascension](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyromancer+Ascension) deck a [few months ago](http://www.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/boab/92). The response to this deck was overwhelming; I received emails from hundreds of players looking to improve on the archetype and help it reach tier one status. 2011's core set gives the deck a number of huge improvements that I would like to talk about today. Don't worry, guys, you will be taking infinite turns in no time at all.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/boab/boab100_callToMind.jpg)The biggest improvement from the new core set is the introduction of [Call to Mind](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Call+to+Mind). Previously, the deck splashed white and green for [Naya Charm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Naya+Charm). [Call to Mind](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Call+to+Mind) allows us to only play two colors, as opposed to four. [Call to Mind](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Call+to+Mind) and [Time Warp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Time+Warp) create an infinite loop with an active [Pyromancer Ascension](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyromancer+Ascension) on the battlefield. You cast the [Time Warp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Time+Warp), take two extra turns, use your next turn to [Call to Mind](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Call+to+Mind) the [Time Warp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Time+Warp) and [Call to Mind](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Call+to+Mind) back to your hand, use the next turn to [Time Warp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Time+Warp) again ... you get the picture.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/boab/boab100_3Cards1.jpg)[Call to Mind](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Call+to+Mind) would have been enough to get me excited again about the archetype, but the new core set offers up a lot more than that. [Preordain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Preordain) essentially lets us play eight copies of [Ponder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ponder). Gone are the days when our combo decks would be plagued with inconsistency. Playing eight [Ponder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ponder) effects makes our combo deck into a well-oiled machine that can reliably execute its game-winning series of plays.




|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| 
Preordain
 | 
Foresee
 |

Another card that really pushes this over the top is [Foresee](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Foresee). If you haven't had the opportunity to [Foresee](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Foresee) yet, then I highly recommend you devote your next first draft pick to this absurdly powerful spell. Scry 4 ensures that the two cards you draw will be precisely what you're looking for. The card advantage gained from drawing two cards helps the deck battle plays that used to cause a lot of problems, like [Blightning](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blightning).


[Ponder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ponder) is an absolute all-star. I've already written volumes on this card's application in decks that rely on specific cards or card combinations. We get to play with ***Magic** 2010* until the fall and [Ponder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ponder) will certainly be a four-of until the rotation.


The new two-color version of the deck gets to play with more disruption than its four-color counterpart. I no longer need to devote slots to mana fixing like [Harrow](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Harrow) or [Prophetic Prism](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Prophetic+Prism). This gives me the opportunity to play with the new core set's least talked about, most thought about spell. [Mana Leak](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak) is battle tested and player approved. Versatile two-mana counterspells have been gone for a long enough period of time that players seems to have forgotten how powerful they can be. [Mana Leak](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak) protects our combo pieces and disrupts our opponent. In many match-ups, it can slow our opponent down enough to give us the time we need to combo. Drawing multiple [Mana Leak](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak)s is especially devastating; you can pass the turn and threaten putting more counters on your [Pyromancer Ascension](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyromancer+Ascension).




|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| 
Mana Leak
 | 
Spreading Seas
 |

I still had room for another suite of disruption, so I decided to play with a set of [Spreading Seas](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spreading+Seas). Jund has been a very poor match-up for me with the old version of [Pyromancer Ascension](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyromancer+Ascension). [Blightning](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blightning) is a difficult card to deal with and [Maelstrom Pulse](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Maelstrom+Pulse) is a main-deck answer to our game winning enchantment. [Spreading Seas](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spreading+Seas) in combination with all our cantrips can be very deadly here. We have the ability to draw multiple copies of [Spreading Seas](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spreading+Seas) in the same game because of cards like [Ponder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ponder) and [Preordain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Preordain). If you've ever played Jund against an opponent who drew more than one [Spreading Seas](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spreading+Seas), then you can probably understand why this is such a good inclusion.


I still want to play with [Lightning Bolt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt). The power of an instant burn spell like this cannot be underestimated. [Lightning Bolt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt) also doubles as our win condition. Once we start taking infinite turns we can eventually engineer a turn where we can play enough [Lightning Bolt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt)s to kill our opponent. It isn't even a lot of work. You get a second Ascension active, cast a Bolt, copy it twice, [Call to Mind](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Call+to+Mind) multiple [Lightning Bolt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt)s or a single [Lightning Bolt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt) and other [Call to Mind](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Call+to+Mind)s and then fire off a lethal dose of burn.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/boab/boab100_3Cards2.jpg)The sideboard is very important here. I chose to play with [Terramorphic Expanse](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Terramorphic+Expanse) and [Evolving Wilds](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Evolving+Wilds) because they let me splash [Rest for the Weary](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rest+for+the+Weary) out of my sideboard. Red has a very difficult time beating this spell even when it isn't copied. When you start casting two-mana "Gain 16"s it's probably about time for your opponent to pack it in.


The sideboard also plays [Jace Beleren](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace+Beleren) for control match-ups. [Jace Beleren](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace+Beleren) has become significantly easier to trade for since [Jace, the Mind Sculptor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace%2C+the+Mind+Sculptor) was printed with *Worldwake*. [Jace Beleren](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace+Beleren) was already printed in *Lorwyn* and ***Magic** 2010*, so you may already have them. If you don't, you can acquire them from packs of ***Magic** 2011*.




|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| 
Earthquake
 | 
Overwhelming Stampede
 |

The sideboard also plays with [Earthquake](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Earthquake), ***Magic** 2011* has given us an extra [Overrun](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Overrun) effect and I suspect overrun themed green decks will gain a lot of power and popularity in the coming weeks. [Earthquake](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Earthquake) gives you a very respectable board-sweep effect against these types of deck. It seems like [Earthquake](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Earthquake) is better here than [Pyroclasm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyroclasm) because it can also kill their [Garruk Wildspeaker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Garruk+Wildspeaker). These types of decks cannot deal a lot of damage without their [Overrun](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Overrun) effects, so the damage we deal ourselves won't be too relevant.


I also decided to include a single copy of [Burst Lightning](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Burst+Lightning) as an out to cards like [Meddling Mage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Meddling+Mage), these cards may not be very popular, but just auto-losing to them is not a good plan.

I played some games with a friend to make sure the deck functioned properly.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/boab/boab100_raging.jpg)I win the roll and keep [Terramorphic Expanse](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Terramorphic+Expanse), [Mountain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mountain), [Island](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island), [Spreading Seas](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spreading+Seas), [Ponder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ponder), [Ponder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ponder), and [Mana Leak](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak). I play my Expanse and pass the turn. My opponent plays a [Savage Lands](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Savage+Lands) and passes the turn back. I pop my Expanse on his end step and grab an [Island](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island). I draw a [Time Warp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Time+Warp), cast [Spreading Seas](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spreading+Seas) on the [Savage Lands](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Savage+Lands), draw a [Pyromancer Ascension](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyromancer+Ascension), and pass the turn. My opponent uses his turn to play a [Raging Ravine](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Raging+Ravine) and passes the turn. I cast [Ponder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ponder), see a [Mountain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mountain), a [Ponder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ponder), and another [Spreading Seas](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spreading+Seas). I put them back [Spreading Seas](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spreading+Seas) on top, then [Ponder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ponder), then [Mountain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mountain). I draw the [Spreading Seas](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spreading+Seas), cast it on the [Raging Ravine](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Raging+Ravine), draw the [Ponder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ponder), and pass the turn.

I draw the [Mountain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mountain), play it, cast [Pyromancer Ascension](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyromancer+Ascension), then I cast [Ponder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ponder), putting a counter on the Ascension. I shuffle my library and draw another [Island](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island), then cast the second [Ponder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ponder). I find a [Call to Mind](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Call+to+Mind), put a second counter on the Ascension, and finally pass the turn. My opponent plays a [Savage Lands](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Savage+Lands) off the top of his library and passes the turn.


I draw another [Mana Leak](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak), cast [Time Warp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Time+Warp), use the [Pyromancer Ascension](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyromancer+Ascension) to copy it, and I start my next turn. I cast [Call to Mind](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Call+to+Mind) returning [Ponder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ponder) and [Time Warp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Time+Warp) to my hand on the next turn.

I cast [Time Warp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Time+Warp) again the next turn and copy it. I do the same the next turn. I cast [Foresee](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Foresee) and copy it the next turn and I find a second [Call to Mind](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Call+to+Mind). My friend sees that I can take infinite turns and he concedes.


Jund used to be a very difficult match-up. The match still isn't easy, especially if they're on the play, but things have certainly gotten a lot better. [Spreading Seas](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spreading+Seas) helps us buy enough time to combo off without getting our Ascension hit by a [Maelstrom Pulse](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Maelstrom+Pulse). [Mana Leak](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak) also helps protect our combo.

My opponent concedes.


Red is surprisingly good for this deck. The first game can get very scary, but after sideboarding we have access to [Rest for the Weary](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rest+for+the+Weary). Game 1 may be slightly in their favor, but games two and three are very easy for the [Pyromancer Ascension](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyromancer+Ascension) deck.

This match seems pretty easy, a one-of [Qasali Pridemage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Qasali+Pridemage) and [Oblivion Ring](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oblivion+Ring) are their only ways to interact with our combo. Their deck isn't aggressive enough to put us on a reasonable clock.


That went very well. I think this deck may have what it takes to be a contender in the new Standard. If you have any new ideas I would love to hear them in an email or on the forums.


Happy brewing!
