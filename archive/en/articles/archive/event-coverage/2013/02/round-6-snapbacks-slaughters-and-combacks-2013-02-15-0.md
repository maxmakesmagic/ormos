Guillaume Wafo-Tapa (Esper Control) vs. Conley Woods (Black By Popular Demand)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------


[Raphael Levy (Wolf Run Bant) vs. Ben Stark (Esper Control)](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/eventcoverage/ptgtc13/fm8)


No points will be awarded for guessing what type of deck Guillaume Wafo-Tapa chose to play for this weekend. Wafo-Tapa is probably the purest control mage since Andrew Cuneo, and with even without [Sphinx's Revelation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sphinx%27s+Revelation) in the format, he'd find a way to make [Island](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island)s work.


However, if you had Conley Woods in the brewery with the [Griselbrand](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Griselbrand)s as your deduction, then step right up and collect your prize. He asserts that at long last Mono-Black Control (or nearly, anyways, as he's playing 17 [Swamp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swamp)s, So I think that counts) is a real deck and not just a cruel prank being carried about by the return of [Mutilate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mutilate). 3-2 isn't the most comfortable record, and both players were doing their best to think positive.

*Guillaume Wafo-Tapa and Conley Woods surprised approximately nobody today when they showed up with trademark deck choices: a control deck with [Island](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island)s, and an unexpected creation.* 
### Game 1


Wafo-Tapa went to six, and after keeping his new hand, they were off. Woods led out with a pair of [Swamp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swamp)s, and after [Augur of Bolas](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Augur+of+Bolas) served up [Azorius Charm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Azorius+Charm), Woods dispatched it with [Victim of Night](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Victim+of+Night). This let Woods play Lilana of the Veil unopposed. Wafo-Tapa discarded the Charm and Woods pitched a spare land.


This situation was unacceptable to Wafo-Tapa, who played his third land and put Liliana in the [Detention Sphere](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Detention+Sphere). Woods played his fourth land and passed. This would prove to be something of a theme for the game. Wafo-Tapa cast [Divination](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Divination), and then [Tamiyo, the Moon Sage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tamiyo%2C+the+Moon+Sage), locking up Woods's only red source.


Woods continued to hit land drops and little else. Eventually he found a second red and tried to [Dreadbore](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dreadbore) Tamiyo, but after short reflection, Wafo-Tapa [Dissipate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dissipate)d. [Think Twice](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Think+Twice)s had kept Wafo-Tapa's hand stocked. He had [Ultimate Price](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ultimate+Price) for [Vampire Nighthawk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vampire+Nighthawk), and then got Tamiyo's Emblem. It only took one activation of [Nephalia Drownyard](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nephalia+Drownyard) to "draw" three cards (thanks to the Tamiyo emblem) to convince Woods to pack it in.


Wafo-Tapa 1, Woods 0


### Game 2


"I'm still not entirely sure what you're playing." - Guillaume Wafo-Tapa


"\*I'M\* not entirely sure what I'm playing." - Conley Woods


Woods drew up seven with no lands and sent them packing. The next six were sufficient. Woods's first play was [Vampire Nighthawk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vampire+Nighthawk), met with [Ultimate Price](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ultimate+Price) from Wafo-Tapa, who cycled his [Azorius Charm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Azorius+Charm) and continued playing lands. Not much happened until Woods found a [Dragonskull Summit](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragonskull+Summit) and cast [Slaughter Games](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Slaughter+Games). Wafo-Tapa could only [Sphinx's Revelation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sphinx%27s+Revelation) for one in response, thanks to his fifth land coming into play tapped. Still, Woods named [Sphinx's Revelation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sphinx%27s+Revelation). Wafo-Tapa turned over a hand of two [Detention Sphere](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Detention+Sphere)s, [Ultimate Price](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ultimate+Price), Tribute to Hunter, and two lands. Woods looked through the rest of his deck, took out the [Revelation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Revelation)s, then played a [Pithing Needle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pithing+Needle) on [Nephalia Drownyard](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nephalia+Drownyard).


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/ptgtc13/r6_woods.jpg)  
*Woods had some powerful plays after the first game. Turns out, it's easier to out-draw the blue deck when you can exile all of their [Sphinx's Revelation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sphinx%27s+Revelation)s.* 
Wafo-Tapa untapped, then played [Detention Sphere](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Detention+Sphere) to take out the Needle. Woods untapped and played [Rakdos's Return](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rakdos%27s+Return) for the full amount, leaving Wafo-Tapa empty-handed. He could only laugh when Wafo-Tapa plucked [Augur of Bolas](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Augur+of+Bolas), revealing [Think Twice](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Think+Twice). Luckily, Woods had some Undercity Connections he could draw on for cards of his own.


Despite the fact that [Think Twice](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Think+Twice) turned into [Divination](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Divination), and that into another [Think Twice](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Think+Twice), Wafo-Tapa was fighting a losing battle. He found Tamiyo to shut off the Connections, but Woods had [Dreadbore](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dreadbore) at the ready, so it was only a temporary reprieve. Worse was the follow-up: [Griselbrand](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Griselbrand).


Wafo-Tapa nodded slowly, then picked up his cards.


Wafo-Tapa 1, Woods 1


### Game 3


Wafo-Tapa led out with a pair of [Glacial Fortress](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glacial+Fortress)es. Woods [Duress](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress)ed him on turn two, seeing [Dissipate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dissipate), two [Snapcaster Mage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snapcaster+Mage)s, [Sphinx's Revelation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sphinx%27s+Revelation), [Azorius Charm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Azorius+Charm) and [Nephalia Drownyard](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nephalia+Drownyard). He took [Dissipate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dissipate). Wafo-Tapa played a tapped [Godless Shrine](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Godless+Shrine) and passed, ensuring Woods knew the coast was clear for Undercity Connections. He lowered the boom on the following turn with [Slaughter Games](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Slaughter+Games).


On the other side of the table, Wafo-Tapa was in a bind. He had cycled his [Azorius Charm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Azorius+Charm) into a second [Sphinx's Revelation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sphinx%27s+Revelation), and groaned internally when his draw step gave up a third copy. He only had four lands. He could [Revelation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Revelation) for one, but then Woods was bound to name [Snapcaster Mage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snapcaster+Mage). He decided to put his eggs in the beatdown basket and played [Snap](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snap)caster, targeting [Azorius Charm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Azorius+Charm), then let the Games begin. Woods naturally named [Sphinx's Revelation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sphinx%27s+Revelation) and laughed at his good fortune.


Wafo-Tapa flashed back the Charm for a card. He untapped, played a land, and though it was completely out of character for him, attacked for 2.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/ptgtc13/r6_wafotapa.jpg)  
*Wafo-Tapa surprises spectators by switching to an aggressive back-up plan.* 
Woods drew for his turn, and one extra from his Connections, then tried [Liliana of the Veil](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Liliana+of+the+Veil). Wafo-Tapa [Snap](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snap)castered his [Dissipate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dissipate), upping his clock. Better still, Woods had no fifth land. Wafo-Tapa brought Woods to thirteen. The Connections made it twelve. [Dreadbore](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dreadbore) resolved on one of the [Snap](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snap)casters, but he still had no land. Nor did he on the following turn after Wafo-Tapa took care of [Vampire Nighthawk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vampire+Nighthawk) with [Ultimate Price](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ultimate+Price).


Wafo-Tapa played [Divination](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Divination) and knocked Woods to seven. Connections took him to six. Finally he founda fifth land for Woods, and a [Rakdos's Return](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rakdos%27s+Return) for two, but again Wafo-Tapa had [Dissipate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dissipate). Another attack had him at four. Wafo-Tapa tapped five for [Jace, Memory Adept](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace%2C+Memory+Adept), and drew a card, milling Woods for one. He paid two life for [Hallowed Fountain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hallowed+Fountain) to have three mana open.


Here Woods had to think. He was very close to stabilizing the game. He had [Crypt Ghast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crypt+Ghast) and [Duress](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress), as well as a sixth land. He decided he couldn't risk Wafo-Tapa having the [Dissipate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dissipate) just for a point of extort. He played [Duress](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress). Wafo-Tapa put [Think Twice](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Think+Twice) in his graveyard. Still, Woods got his [Crypt Ghast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crypt+Ghast) in play. He passed with his Connections untapped.


Wafo-Tapa flashed back [Think Twice](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Think+Twice), then untapped, drew with Jace, and attacked. Woods refused to risk his Ghast and fell to two. Wafo-Tapa cycled [Azorius Charm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Azorius+Charm), then played [Devour Flesh](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Devour+Flesh) targeting Woods to get rid of the Ghast. That put him to four, and he went to three for a card. Wafo-Tapa had just one card in hand. Woods tapped six for [Staff of Nin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Staff+of+Nin), finally ending Wafo-Tapa's beatdown plan.


However, he was still on a clock. Wafo-Tapa had his [Nephalia Drownyard](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Nephalia%2BDrownyard) and Jace in play. He milled for three, untapped, and thought. He counted Woods's library, which contained just 33 cards. He gave Jace the go-ahead, and milled him for ten cards. Woods drew three and looked at his options. He tapped out for [Griselbrand](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Griselbrand). [Nephalia Drownyard](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Nephalia%2BDrownyard) and Jace did their thing, and Woods was at seven cards. Then five on his turn. He counted his options again and again. He could do sixteen: A [Griselbrand](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Griselbrand) attack, a [Rakdos's Return](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rakdos%27s+Return) for seven, a ping from the Staff, and then one more ping with its draw effect on the stack.


Wafo-Tapa was at 17. One point out of range. One extort trigger.


Woods scooped. Wafo-Tapa took some of the sting out by showing the [Dissipate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dissipate) he had in hand.
