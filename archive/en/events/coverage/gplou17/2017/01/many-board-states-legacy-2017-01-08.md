One of *Magic's* best qualities is that it can play out in so many ways. And in Legacy, where players can play so many different cards, it often does play out in any way imaginable — and sometimes even in ways you wouldn't believe. This is a format where this weekend we've witnessed players stare down a [Sire of Insanity](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sire+of+Insanity) and [Inkwell Leviathan](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inkwell+Leviathan), and then untap for their turn and win the game. It's been a wild tournament, and I've collected some of the more interesting board states of the weekend.

We've seen a lot here in Louisville. And with the Top 8 just around the corner, we're going to see quite a bit more before it's all said and done.
