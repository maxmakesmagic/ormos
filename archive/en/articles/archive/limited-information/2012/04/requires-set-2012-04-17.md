A select few cards, such as [Lightning Bolt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt), are good in the majority of situations that come up in Limited. If your opponent is at 3 life, you can use [Lightning Bolt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt) to just win the game. If there's an evasion creature that you need to deal with, you can burn it right out of the sky. If you want to keep your offense going, you can use [Lightning Bolt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt) to take out a key blocker. All for only one mana!

But most cards aren't going to be all-stars in any deck you put them in. Some cards, like Sigarda, Host of Herons, are amazing when you cast them—but have very strict mana requirements. Tandem Lookout is great in a deck full of removal spells—or when paired with a Wingcrafter (or just about any other evasion creature)—but if you don't have any good way to break through your opponent's defenses you might be better off replacing it with a bigger body.

Ghostly Flicker looks like it could be really good in a deck full of soulbond creatures, and other cards with enter-the-battlefield effects, but if you're just using it to protect your creatures from removal spells you might find yourself pretty disappointed by its relatively high price tag.

My preview card this week has a lot of upside when it's working properly—but it can be extremely difficult (and dangerous) to set up. Ready to see it?

Here you go!

Under the right circumstances, Homicidal Seclusion can be the most important card in the game. But if things go wrong, it can be a huge liability.

If you have a Latch Seeker pumped up by Homicidal Seclusion, it won't take long for you to swing to victory. But even if your creature doesn't have evasion, if you're able to attrition away both players' boards, every creature you play will be a fantastic, must-kill threat.

Obvious Interactions
Alright, let's get some of the obvious interactions out of the way first.

If there are any [Pacifism](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pacifism) or [Claustrophobia](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Claustrophobia)-type cards in *Avacyn Restored,* it will be possible for your opponents to completely shut down your Homicidal Seclusion, at least until you use a removal spell on your own creature or (preferably) flicker it in and out of play with a card like Cloudshift.

![](https://media.wizards.com/images/magic/daily/li/li191_a8rj1nik4m.jpg)Demonic Taskmaster | Art by [Chris Rahn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoileramp;method=visualamp;action=advancedamp;artist=+[%22Chris+Rahn%22])

Homicidal Seclusion does not combine well with soulbond creatures. However, it does work particularly well with Demonic Taskmaster and other cards that force you to sacrifice your own creatures, since they allow you to reduce your board down to a single creature (without your opponent's help).
