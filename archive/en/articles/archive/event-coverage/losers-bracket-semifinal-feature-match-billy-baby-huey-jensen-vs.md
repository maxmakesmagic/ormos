### Game 1


The game didn't start the way Billy wanted, with his opening hand's insufficiency forcing him to mulligan to six. Billy was only able to muster a 3rd turn Birds of Paradise, which was immediately killed by Seal of Fire before Fires of Yavimaya entered play.


Turn four saw Dave continue his mana manipulation, using the Port as he cast a Fire Diamond with the next turn seeing him Stone Rain Huey's forest, keeping him at four lands. After Huey cast a second Fires, Dave Stone Rained the second forest leaving the big man with two mountains and one forest, with one pain land being Pillaged on the following turn as Huey continued to draw expensive spells. One turn later, Dave played a Dust Bowl and destroyed a Brushland, using his two active Ports to lock Huey down. Slowly but surely, Billy was reduced to just the two mountains before finally drawing a Forest, enabling him to cast Llanowar Elf, which he apparently forgot had haste. The Elf and two Fires died to two Pyroclasms and the early Seal.


Finally, Dave put down the lock in the form of Ensnaring Bridge. With only three cards in hand, this meant Huey's fat creatures would be unable to attack. Dave added a Grafted Skullcap to the mix two turns later, and despite Huey's best efforts to break out of the lock, Dave's card advantage was enough to secure the first game win.


Bachmann 1, Jensen 0


### Game 2


Game 2 started with Huey casting a turn 1 Birds of Paradise with a Brushland, indicating a lack of mana in hand. As Dave played Mountains, Huey dropped a Port on turn two before casting Blastoderm on turn three.


Fortunately for Dave, he had an answer: Flowstone Wall, a 0/6 came into play, nullifying the 'Derm, and Huey could only cast a Fires of Yavimaya incapable of targeting his own Green fatty. Soon, both players had two Rishadan Ports in play and the mana wars began, with Dave slowly creeping ahead with two Pillages, killing the Fires with a Pyroclasm.


At this point, the game entered a holding pattern that saw Dave draw a number of land while Billy couldn't draw any. Finally, Dave drew a Pyroclasm, killing the Bird and then he played a second Flowstone Wall as he began to take a solid grip on the game.


Billy cast a Yavimaya Barbarian and a Fires, but it just wasn't to be. Dave cast Seal of Fire, Grafted Skullcap and Ensnaring Bridge in one turn, emptying his hand, and while Billy had the Thornscape Battlemage in hand to kill the Bridge, it really didn't matter. Dave played a Dust Bowl on his next turn and started whittling away at Jensen's non-basic lands, eventually leaving him with none. Billy managed to get a Shivan Wurm in play, but it didn't help as a second Bridge had come into play.

Billy started this game like the last one, with a Birds of Paradise, but this time Dave had the Seal of Fire he needed to dispatch it. Fortunately for Bill, this time he had another bird and an Elf back and he was able to get the mana jump he needed in the match up. Jensen cast a Fires of Yavimaya on turn three, and after Dave Stone Rained his only non-creature red source, Bill cast Blastoderm, which was met by a Bachmann Flowstone Wall.


When the Wall blocked Blastoderm, it was killed by a Thornscape Battlemage, but Dave's Pyroclasm evened the score, killing the Elf, Fires and Battlemage before a Seal killed the bird. With Dave at nine, his next turn was a pivotal one, casting Ensnaring Bridge in the nick of time and following it up with a Grafted Skullcap on his next turn.


With the Blastoderm fading away and a Barbarian getting Pyroclasmed, Bachmann started wresting control of the game from Jensen. He played first one Millstone, then a second as Billy's deck started decreasing in size rapidly. With a second Bridge hitting the table, it became increasingly obvious that the game would be Dave's with a third Millstone sealing victory and a spot at World Championships in Toronto.


**Final Result:** Bachmann 3, Jensen 0
