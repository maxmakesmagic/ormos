The Release Notes include information concerning the release of a new *Magic: The Gathering* set, as well as a collection of clarifications and rulings involving that set's cards. It's intended to make playing with the new cards more fun by clearing up the common misconceptions and confusion inevitably caused by new mechanics and interactions. As future sets are released, updates to the *Magic* rules may cause some of this information to become outdated. If you can't find the answer you're looking for here, please contact us at [Wizards.com/CustomerService](http://www.wizards.com/CustomerService).


The "General Notes" section includes release information and explains the mechanics and concepts in the set.


The "Card-Specific Notes" section contains answers to the most important, most common, and most confusing questions players might ask about cards in the set. Items in the "Card-Specific Notes" section include full card text for your reference. Not all cards in the set are listed.

*Rivals of Ixalan* Story Spotlight Cards
----------------------------------------


There are many important moments in the *Rivals of Ixalan* story, but some of the most crucial—called "story spotlights"—are shown on cards. You can read more about these events in the official *Magic* fiction at [mtgstory.com](http://www.mtgstory.com/).


Story spotlight 1: Flood of Recollection  

Story spotlight 2: Induced Amnesia  

Story spotlight 3: Mastermind's Acquisition


The story spotlight cards in this set feature a Planeswalker symbol icon in their text boxes. The icon has no effect on game play. The printed cards also include the mtgstory.com URL and a number indicating the sequence of the cards in the story.




---

New Keyword: Ascend
-------------------


As the *Rivals of Ixalan* story opens, all four competing factions from the *Ixalan* set have reached the fabled golden city, and now their fight begins in earnest to claim the Immortal Sun! If you can make your way to the Sanctum of the Sun in Orazca's highest temple, you can touch its power and turn the tide of battle in your favor.


![](https://media.wizards.com/2017/rix/en_PWJhBSvWcD.png)


Storm Fleet Swashbuckler  

1R  

Creature — Human Pirate  

2/2  

Ascend *(If you control ten or more permanents, you get the city's blessing for the rest of the game.)*  

Storm Fleet Swashbuckler has double strike as long as you have the city's blessing.


![](https://media.wizards.com/2017/rix/en_zp8jqgjaLL.png)


Pride of Conquerors  

1W  

Instant  

Ascend *(If you control ten or more permanents, you get the city's blessing for the rest of the game.)*  

Creatures you control get +1/+1 until end of turn. If you have the city's blessing, those creatures get +2/+2 until end of turn instead.


The official rules for ascend are as follows:


702.130 Ascend


702.130a Ascend on an instant or sorcery spell represents a spell ability. It means "If you control ten or more permanents and you don't have the city's blessing, you get the city's blessing for the rest of the game."


702.130b Ascend on a permanent represents a static ability. It means "Any time you control ten or more permanents and you don't have the city's blessing, you get the city's blessing for the rest of the game."


702.130c Having the city's blessing is a designation that has no rules meaning other than to act as a marker that other rules and effects can identify. Any number of players may have the city's blessing at the same time.


702.130d After a player gets the city's blessing, continuous effects are reapplied before the game checks to see if the game state or preceding events have matched any trigger conditions.


* Once you have the city's blessing, you have it for the rest of the game, even if you lose control of some or all of your permanents. The city's blessing isn't a permanent itself and can't be removed by any effect.
* A permanent is any object on the battlefield, including tokens and lands. Spells and emblems aren't permanents.
* If you cast a spell with ascend, you don't get the city's blessing until it resolves. Players may respond to that spell by trying to change whether you get the city's blessing.
* Ascend on a permanent isn't a triggered ability and doesn't use the stack. Players can respond to a spell that will give you your tenth permanent, but they can't respond to getting the city's blessing once you control that tenth permanent. This means that if your tenth permanent is a land you play, players can't respond before you get the city's blessing.
* If you control ten permanents but don't control a permanent or resolving spell with ascend, you don't get the city's blessing. For example, if you control ten permanents, lose control of one, then cast Golden Demise, you won't have the city's blessing and the spell will affect creatures you control.
* If your tenth permanent enters the battlefield and then a permanent leaves the battlefield immediately afterward (most likely due to the "Legend Rule" or due to being a creature with 0 toughness), you get the city's blessing before it leaves the battlefield.
* Some cards have triggered abilities with an intervening "if" clause that checks whether you have the city's blessing. These are worded "[Trigger condition], if you have the city's blessing, [effect]." You must already have the city's blessing in order for these abilities to trigger; otherwise they do nothing. In other words, there's no way to have the ability trigger if you don't have the city's blessing, even if you intend to get it in response to the triggered ability.
* Some cards have triggered abilities that check if you have the city's blessing, but don't use an intervening "if" clause. These abilities trigger regardless of whether you have the city's blessing and check whether you do only as they resolve.
* Some cards get power, toughness, and/or abilities once you have the city's blessing. If another card has an ability that triggers when creatures with certain characteristics enter the battlefield (such as [Mentor of the Meek](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mentor+of+the+Meek) or [Elemental Bond](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elemental+Bond) do), use the entering permanent's characteristics after you have the city's blessing to determine whether those abilities trigger. This is true even if the entering permanent is your tenth permanent.

Returning *Ixalan* Themes and Mechanics
---------------------------------------


The *Rivals of Ixalan* set features some returning mechanics from the *Ixalan* set. For more information on "tribal" bonuses, double-faced cards, explore, enrage, and raid, please see the [*Ixalan* Release Notes](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/feature/ixalan-release-notes-2017-09-15).

CARD-SPECIFIC NOTES
-------------------


![](https://media.wizards.com/2017/rix/en_U6tBZ01oWa.png)


Aggressive Urge  

1G  

Instant  

Target creature gets +1/+1 until end of turn.  

Draw a card.


* If the target creature is an illegal target by the time Aggressive Urge tries to resolve, the spell is countered. You won't draw a card.



---

![](https://media.wizards.com/2017/rix/en_JZGdbMbeJh.png)


Angrath, Minotaur Pirate *(Planeswalker Deck Only)*  

4BR  

Legendary Planeswalker — Angrath  

5  

+2: Angrath, Minotaur Pirate deals 1 damage to target opponent and each creature that player controls.  

−3: Return target Pirate card from your graveyard to the battlefield.  

−11: Destroy all creatures target opponent controls. Angrath, Minotaur Pirate deals damage to that player equal to their total power.


* Angrath's first and last abilities target only the player. Creatures with hexproof that player controls will be affected.
* Angrath's last ability uses the power of those creatures as they last existed on the battlefield to determine their total power. If a creature's power was somehow less than 0, it subtracts from the total power of the other creatures. If the total power of those creatures is 0 or less, Angrath doesn't deal damage.
* If a creature controlled by the target opponent isn't destroyed as Angrath's last ability resolves (most likely because it has indestructible), its power still contributes to the amount of damage dealt. Use its power as it currently exists on the battlefield to determine the total power of the creatures.
* Any abilities that trigger when creatures die while resolving Angrath's last ability won't be put on the stack until after the player is dealt damage. If the player's life total becomes 0 or less, those triggers won't resolve in time to save that player.
* Any abilities of the destroyed creatures that trigger when the player is dealt damage won't trigger.



---

![](https://media.wizards.com/2017/rix/en_RqqUVmWl4h.png)


Angrath, the Flame-Chained  

3BR  

Legendary Planeswalker — Angrath  

4  

+1: Each opponent discards a card and loses 2 life.  

−3: Gain control of target creature until end of turn. Untap it. It gains haste until end of turn. Sacrifice it at the beginning of the next end step if it has converted mana cost 3 or less.  

−8: Each opponent loses life equal to the number of cards in his or her graveyard.


* Angrath's first ability causes each opponent to lose 2 life even if some or all of those players were unable to discard a card.
* You can target and gain control of an untapped creature with Angrath's second ability. You can also untap a creature you already control and give it haste.
* Whether the target creature has converted mana cost 3 or less is checked only as the delayed triggered ability from Angrath's second ability resolves during the end step.
* In a Two-Headed Giant game, Angrath's first ability causes the opposing team to lose 4 life, and each player on that team discards a card. His last ability causes the opposing team to lose life equal to the number of cards in both graveyards.



---

![](https://media.wizards.com/2017/rix/en_fJTTSzb3Gs.png)


Angrath's Fury *(Planeswalker Deck Only)*  

3BR  

Sorcery  

Destroy target creature. Angrath's Fury deals 3 damage to target player. You may search your library and/or graveyard for a card named Angrath, Minotaur Pirate, reveal it, and put it into your hand. If you search your library this way, shuffle it.


* You can't cast Angrath's Fury unless you choose both a target creature and a target player.
* If either target becomes illegal after you cast Angrath's Fury but before it resolves, the other is still affected as appropriate and you'll search for Angrath. However, if both targets become illegal, the spell is countered and you won't search.



---

![](https://media.wizards.com/2017/rix/en_apVjVa8bzd.png)


Aquatic Incursion  

3U  

Enchantment  

When Aquatic Incursion enters the battlefield, create two 1/1 blue Merfolk creature tokens with hexproof. *(They can't be the targets of spells or abilities your opponents control.)*  

3U: Target Merfolk can't be blocked this turn.


* Activating the last ability of Aquatic Incursion after a Merfolk has become blocked won't cause it to become unblocked.



---

![](https://media.wizards.com/2017/rix/en_Y3RFa60kov.png)


Arterial Flow  

1BB  

Sorcery  

Each opponent discards two cards. If you control a Vampire, each opponent loses 2 life and you gain 2 life.


* Whether you control a Vampire is checked as Arterial Flow resolves.
* Arterial Flow causes each opponent to lose 2 life if you control a Vampire, even if some or all of those players were unable to discard any cards.
* In a Two-Headed Giant game, Arterial Flow causes the opposing team to lose 4 life, and each player on that team discards two cards. You gain 2 life.



---

![](https://media.wizards.com/2017/rix/en_5XXvc2bIfR.png)


Atzocan Seer  

1GW  

Creature — Human Druid  

2/3  

T: Add one mana of any color to your mana pool.  

Sacrifice Atzocan Seer: Return target Dinosaur card from your graveyard to your hand.


* Atzocan Seer's second ability doesn't include the T symbol. You can activate that ability even if it's already been tapped, perhaps because you activated its first ability.



---

![](https://media.wizards.com/2017/rix/en_kN4X2pl8JV.png)


Awakened Amalgam  

4  

Artifact Creature — Golem  

\*/\*  

Awakened Amalgam's power and toughness are each equal to the number of differently named lands you control.


* The ability that defines Awakened Amalgam's power and toughness works in all zones, not just the battlefield.
* To determine the number of differently named lands you control, count each land you control once, but only if its English name isn't exactly the same as another land you've already counted this way. For example, if you control four lands named Plains, two named Island, and one named [Drowned Catacomb](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Drowned+Catacomb), Awakened Amalgam is a 3/3 creature.



---

![](https://media.wizards.com/2017/rix/en_VZIOSQXtGb.png)


Azor, the Lawbringer  

2WWUU  

Legendary Creature — Sphinx  

6/6  

Flying  

When Azor, the Lawbringer enters the battlefield, each opponent can't cast instant or sorcery spells during that player's next turn.  

Whenever Azor attacks, you may pay XWUU. If you do, you gain X life and draw X cards.


* If multiple effects say that an opponent can't cast instant or sorcery spells during that player's next turn, they all apply to the same turn.



---




![](https://media.wizards.com/2017/rix/en_Sy9d5zkrVp.png)
![](https://media.wizards.com/2017/rix/en_KWyLmnHBFL.png)

Turn Over


Azor's Gateway  

2  

Legendary Artifact  

1, T: Draw a card, then exile a card from your hand. If cards with five or more different converted mana costs are exiled with Azor's Gateway, you gain 5 life, untap Azor's Gateway, and transform it.


//


Sanctum of the Sun  

Legendary Land  
*(Transforms from Azor's Gateway.)*  

T: Add X mana of any one color to your mana pool, where X is your life total.


* The cards you exile from your hand are exiled face up.
* The converted mana cost of a split card, such as a card with aftermath from the *Amonkhet* block, is based on the combined mana cost of its two halves. A split card doesn't have two converted mana costs.
* If a card in exile has X in its mana cost, X is considered to be 0.
* If an object has no mana cost, its converted mana cost is 0. A converted mana cost of 0 can still help unlock Azor's Gateway.
* The ability of Sanctum of the Sun is a mana ability. It doesn't use the stack and can't be responded to.



---

![](https://media.wizards.com/2017/rix/en_bah2vuKKQN.png)


Baffling End  

1W  

Enchantment  

When Baffling End enters the battlefield, exile target creature an opponent controls with converted mana cost 3 or less.  

When Baffling End leaves the battlefield, target opponent creates a 3/3 green Dinosaur creature token with trample.


* While Baffling End's two abilities are flavorfully related, they are independent. If the first ability doesn't resolve (perhaps because the target gained hexproof), the second will still create a Dinosaur token when Baffling End leaves the battlefield.
* In a multiplayer game, the target opponent who creates a Dinosaur token doesn't have to be the same one whose creature was exiled.



---

![](https://media.wizards.com/2017/rix/en_u5YGleHaif.png)


Bishop of Binding  

3W  

Creature — Vampire Cleric  

1/1  

When Bishop of Binding enters the battlefield, exile target creature an opponent controls until Bishop of Binding leaves the battlefield.  

Whenever Bishop of Binding attacks, target Vampire gets +X/+X until end of turn, where X is the power of the exiled card.


* If Bishop of Binding leaves the battlefield before its first triggered ability tries to resolve, the target creature won't be exiled.
* Auras attached to the exiled creature will be put into their owners' graveyards. Any Equipment will become unattached and remain on the battlefield. Any counters on the exiled creature will cease to exist.
* If a token is exiled this way, it will cease to exist and won't return to the battlefield.
* The value of X is determined only as Bishop of Binding's second ability resolves. It won't change if the card leaves exile later in the turn.
* If there is no exiled card as Bishop of Binding's last ability resolves, most likely because Bishop of Binding left the battlefield while that ability was on the stack, X is 0. The same is true if the exiled card doesn't have a power, most likely because it's a noncreature card that had become a creature.
* If a Vehicle is exiled with Bishop of Binding, use its printed power to determine the value of X.



---

![](https://media.wizards.com/2017/rix/en_UrhEKZIGh5.png)


Blood Sun  

2R  

Enchantment  

When Blood Sun enters the battlefield, draw a card.  

All lands lose all abilities except mana abilities.


* A mana ability is an ability that produces mana, not an ability that costs mana.
* Land cards not on the battlefield aren't affected.
* If a land has an ability that triggers "when" it enters the battlefield, it will lose that ability before it triggers.
* If a land has an ability that causes it to enter the battlefield tapped, it will lose that ability before it applies. The same is also true of any other abilities of a land that modify how it enters the battlefield or apply "as" it enters the battlefield, such as the first ability of [Unclaimed Territory](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Unclaimed+Territory).
* If a land gains an ability after Blood Sun has entered the battlefield, it keeps that ability.
* If a land has an ability that continuously changes the types of other lands (such as [Urborg, Tomb of Yawgmoth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Urborg%2C+Tomb+of+Yawgmoth) does), that ability will apply before Blood Sun removes that land's abilities. If a land has an ability that grants abilities to other objects, Blood Sun will stop it from doing so.

![](https://media.wizards.com/2017/rix/en_XaMrosoV0P.png)


Captain's Hook  

3  

Artifact — Equipment  

Equipped creature gets +2/+0, has menace, and is a Pirate in addition to its other creature types.  

Whenever Captain's Hook becomes unattached from a permanent, destroy that permanent.  

Equip 1


* Captain's Hook becomes unattached from the creature it's equipping if you equip it to a new creature, if Captain's Hook leaves the battlefield, if the equipped creature ceases to be a creature, or if Captain's Hook ceases to be an Equipment. (It also becomes unattached if the equipped creature leaves the battlefield, but the triggered ability won't do anything in that case.)



---

![](https://media.wizards.com/2017/rix/en_bw3swVHbSI.png)


Champion of Dusk  

3BB  

Creature — Vampire Knight  

4/4  

When Champion of Dusk enters the battlefield, you draw X cards and you lose X life, where X is the number of Vampires you control.


* The number of Vampires you control is counted only as Champion of Dusk's ability resolves. If Champion of Dusk is still on the battlefield, it'll count itself.



---

![](https://media.wizards.com/2017/rix/en_tWWYeVJRiZ.png)


Charging Tuskodon  

3RR  

Creature — Dinosaur  

4/4  

Trample  

If Charging Tuskodon would deal combat damage to a player, it deals double that damage to that player instead.


* If Charging Tuskodon has trample damage to assign to a player, that damage is assigned based on its actual power and is doubled only as it's dealt. For example, if Charging Tuskodon is blocked by a 3/3 creature, the attacking player can assign 1 damage to the defending player and then Charging Tuskodon deals 2 damage to that player.
* The doubled damage Charging Tuskodon deals is still combat damage.



---

![](https://media.wizards.com/2017/rix/en_hoEpkXTWmT.png)


Cherished Hatchling  

1G  

Creature — Dinosaur  

2/1  

When Cherished Hatchling dies, you may cast Dinosaur spells this turn as though they had flash, and whenever you cast a Dinosaur spell this turn, it gains "When this creature enters the battlefield, you may have it fight another target creature."


* During the turn Cherished Hatchling dies, you may cast any number of Dinosaurs as though they had flash.
* You must pay the costs for spells you cast this way. If there's an alternative cost you can pay instead of the mana cost for a Dinosaur spell, you may pay that cost instead.
* For the triggered ability that the entering Dinosaur gains, if the target is illegal when it tries to resolve or if the Dinosaur that entered the battlefield has left the battlefield, no creature will deal or be dealt damage.
* For the triggered ability that the entering Dinosaur gains, you choose a target when the ability goes on the stack, but you don't choose until that ability resolves whether those creatures fight.



---

![](https://media.wizards.com/2017/rix/en_UvefggsLjC.png)


Crafty Cutpurse  

3U  

Creature — Human Pirate  

2/2  

Flash  

When Crafty Cutpurse enters the battlefield, each token that would be created under an opponent's control this turn is created under your control instead.


* Crafty Cutpurse's replacement effect is applied before any other replacement effects that would also modify how the token enters the battlefield. For example, if an opponent controls [Anointed Procession](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Anointed+Procession), your Crafty Cutpurse's effect applies before that of [Anointed Procession](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Anointed+Procession) and you won't get twice as many tokens.
* Crafty Cutpurse won't retroactively change the control of tokens that have already entered the battlefield.
* If a token would be created tapped and attacking, but the token's controller isn't an attacking player, that token is created tapped but not attacking. If a token would be created blocking a creature, but the token's controller isn't a defending player, that token is created but isn't blocking.
* If the effect that creates the token also creates a delayed triggered ability, Crafty Cutpurse doesn't change who controls that ability. For example, if your opponent activates the ability of [Kiki-Jiki, Mirror Breaker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kiki-Jiki%2C+Mirror+Breaker), that opponent controls the delayed triggered ability. When the ability triggers, that player can't sacrifice the token, so it remains on the battlefield.
* On the other hand, if the effect that creates the token grants a triggered ability to the token, the player who controls the token at the time the ability triggers will be the player who controls that ability. For example, if your opponent activates the second ability of [Jace, Cunning Castaway](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace%2C+Cunning+Castaway), the token has the ability. If the ability triggers, you'll control it, so you'll have to sacrifice the token.
* If two or more players each have resolved Crafty Cutpurse's triggered ability and a token would be created, the token's would-be controller chooses one of the applicable Crafty Cutpurse effects to apply. Then the new would-be controller of the token repeats this process among the remaining Crafty Cutpurse effects, and so on, until there are no more possible such effects to apply. Each effect can be applied to the token only once this way.
* The above procedure means that if each player in a two-player game has resolved Crafty Cutpurse's triggered ability and one would create a token, it really will enter the battlefield under that player's control. The token would enter the battlefield under player A's control, so player B's effect affects it. Now that token would enter the battlefield under player B's control, so player A's effect affects it. Each replacement effect has now been used, so the token will enter the battlefield under player A's control.

Crashing Tide  

2U  

Sorcery  

Crashing Tide has flash as long as you control a Merfolk.  

Return target creature to its owner's hand.  

Draw a card.


* Once you announce that you're casting Crashing Tide, players can't try to remove your Merfolk to make it lose flash until you're done casting it. If it loses flash after it's been cast, it will still resolve if able.
* If the target creature is an illegal target by the time Crashing Tide tries to resolve, the spell is countered. You won't draw a card.

Curious Obsession  

U  

Enchantment — Aura  

Enchant creature  

Enchanted creature gets +1/+1 and has "Whenever this creature deals combat damage to a player, you may draw a card."  

At the beginning of your end step, if you didn't attack with a creature this turn, sacrifice Curious Obsession.


* Curious Obsession's last ability is satisfied if any creature has attacked, similar to raid abilities. The creature it enchants doesn't have to have attacked.



---

![](https://media.wizards.com/2017/rix/en_4CqwOBGdgu.png)


Dead Man's Chest  

1B  

Enchantment — Aura  

Enchant creature an opponent controls  

When enchanted creature dies, exile cards equal to its power from the top of its owner's library. You may cast nonland cards from among them for as long as they remain exiled, and you may spend mana as though it were mana of any type to cast those spells.


* If you gain control of the enchanted creature, Dead Man's Chest will be put into your graveyard.
* If Dead Man's Chest and the enchanted creature are both put into graveyards at the same time, the last ability of Dead Man's Chest still triggers.
* To determine how many cards to exile, use the enchanted creature's power as it last existed on the battlefield.
* You are a creature's owner if the card representing it began the game in your deck, or if it's a token that entered the battlefield under your control. If Dead Man's Chest enchants a creature that you own but an opponent controls, you'll exile cards from your library.
* The effect of Dead Man's Chest doesn't change when you can cast the exiled cards. For example, if you exile a creature card without flash, you can cast it only during your main phase when the stack is empty.
* Casting an exiled card causes it to leave exile. You can't cast it multiple times.
* In a multiplayer game, if a player leaves the game, all cards that player owns leave as well. If you leave the game, any spells or permanents you control from Dead Man's Chest's ability are exiled.

Dinosaur Hunter  

1B  

Creature — Human Pirate  

2/2  

Whenever Dinosaur Hunter deals damage to a Dinosaur, destroy that creature.


* If an opponent's Dinosaur has an enrage ability and your Dinosaur Hunter deals damage to it during your turn, that ability resolves before Dinosaur Hunter's ability destroys the Dinosaur. If it's that opponent's turn, the Dinosaur is destroyed first, but its enrage ability still resolves afterward.

Dire Fleet Daredevil  

1R  

Creature — Human Pirate  

2/1  

First strike  

When Dire Fleet Daredevil enters the battlefield, exile target instant or sorcery card from an opponent's graveyard. You may cast that card this turn, and you may spend mana as though it were mana of any type to cast that spell. If that card would be put into a graveyard this turn, exile it instead.


* The effect of Dire Fleet Daredevil doesn't change when you can cast the exiled card. For example, if you exile a sorcery card, you can cast it only during your main phase when the stack is empty.
* Casting an exiled card causes it to leave exile. You can't cast it multiple times.

Elenda, the Dusk Rose  

2WB  

Legendary Creature — Vampire Knight  

1/1  

Lifelink  

Whenever another creature dies, put a +1/+1 counter on Elenda, the Dusk Rose.  

When Elenda dies, create X 1/1 white Vampire creature tokens with lifelink, where X is Elenda's power.


* If Elenda dies at the same time as another creature, both of its triggered abilities trigger. However, the first one won't do anything since you can't put a +1/+1 counter on Elenda.
* To determine how many Vampire tokens are created, use Elenda's power as it last existed on the battlefield.
* If Elenda would die and it's your commander in the Commander variant, you may put it into the command zone instead. However, if you save Elenda this way, it doesn't die and you won't create any Vampire tokens.

Enter the Unknown  

G  

Sorcery  

Target creature you control explores. *(Reveal the top card of your library. Put that card into your hand if it's a land. Otherwise, put a +1/+1 counter on the creature, then put the card back or put it into your graveyard.)*  

You may play an additional land this turn.


* Enter the Unknown's effect allows you to play an additional land during your main phase. Doing so follows the normal timing rules for playing lands.
* The effects of multiples of Enter the Unknown in the same turn are cumulative. They're also cumulative with other effects that let you play additional lands, such as the one from Wayward Swordtooth.
* If you somehow manage to cast Enter the Unknown when it's not your turn, the target creature explores when it resolves, but you won't be able to play a land that turn.
* If the target creature is an illegal target by the time Enter the Unknown tries to resolve, the spell is countered. It won't explore, and you won't be able to play an additional land.

Etali, Primal Storm  

4RR  

Legendary Creature — Elder Dinosaur  

6/6  

Whenever Etali, Primal Storm attacks, exile the top card of each player's library, then you may cast any number of nonland cards exiled this way without paying their mana costs.


* If an exiled card has X in its mana cost, you must choose 0 as the value of X when casting it without paying its mana cost.
* If you cast any of the exiled cards, you do so as part of the resolution of the triggered ability. You can't wait to cast them later in the turn. Timing permissions based on a card's type are ignored, and the spells resolve before blockers are declared.
* If you cast more than one of the exiled cards, you choose the order in which to cast them. A spell you cast this way can be the target of a later spell you cast this way. However, permanent spells cast this way won't resolve until you're done casting spells, so the permanents they become can't be the target of spells cast this way. For example, if you exile [Twincast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Twincast) and [Lightning Strike](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Strike), you can cast [Lightning Strike](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Strike) and then cast [Twincast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Twincast) targeting it; but if you exile a creature card and an Aura card, you can't cast that Aura targeting that creature.
* If you cast a card "without paying its mana cost," you can't pay any alternative costs. You can, however, pay additional costs. If the card has any mandatory additional costs, such as that of [Silvergill Adept](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Silvergill+Adept), those must be paid to cast the card.
* Any cards not cast, including land cards, remain in exile. They can't be cast on later turns, even if Etali attacks again.
* Because all attacking creatures are chosen at once, a creature cast this way can't attack during the same combat as Etali, even if it has haste.
* In a multiplayer game, if a player leaves the game, all cards that player owns leave as well. If you leave the game, any spells or permanents you control from Etali's ability are exiled.

Everdawn Champion  

1WW  

Creature — Human Soldier  

2/2  

Prevent all combat damage that would be dealt to Everdawn Champion.


* Combat damage can be assigned to Everdawn Champion as normal, even though that damage will be prevented. For example, if Everdawn Champion blocks a 4/4 creature with trample, the attacking player may assign 2 of that creature's combat damage to the player or planeswalker it's attacking.

2B  

Creature — Human Pirate  

2/2  

When Forerunner of the Coalition enters the battlefield, you may search your library for a Pirate card, reveal it, then shuffle your library and put that card on top of it.  

Whenever another Pirate enters the battlefield under your control, each opponent loses 1 life.


* In a Two-Headed Giant game, the last ability of Forerunner of the Coalition causes the opposing team to lose 2 life.

Form of the Dinosaur  

4RR  

Enchantment  

When Form of the Dinosaur enters the battlefield, your life total becomes 15.  

At the beginning of your upkeep, Form of the Dinosaur deals 15 damage to target creature an opponent controls and that creature deals damage equal to its power to you.


* For your life total to become 15, you gain or lose the appropriate amount of life. For example, if your life total is 4 when Form of the Dinosaur's first ability resolves, it will cause you to gain 11 life; alternatively, if your life total is 40 when it resolves, it will cause you to lose 25 life. Other cards that interact with life gain or life loss will interact with this effect accordingly.
* Form of the Dinosaur's last ability isn't optional. You have to pick a fight with an opponent's creature if any are legal targets. If that creature leaves the battlefield after it becomes the target of Form of the Dinosaur's ability but before it resolves, you won't be dealt damage.
* In a Two-Headed Giant game, Form of the Dinosaur's first ability causes your team's life total to become 15. Only you gain or lose life this way.

Ghalta, Primal Hunger  

10GG  

Legendary Creature — Elder Dinosaur  

12/12  

Ghalta, Primal Hunger costs X less to cast, where X is the total power of creatures you control.  

Trample


* To determine Ghalta's total cost, start with the mana cost (or an alternative cost if another card's effect allows you to pay one instead), add any cost increases, then apply any cost reductions. Ghalta's converted mana cost remains unchanged, no matter what the total cost to cast it was.
* The total cost to cast Ghalta is locked in before you pay that cost. For example, if you control three 2/2 creatures, including one you can sacrifice to add C to your mana pool, the total cost of Ghalta is 4GG. Then you can sacrifice the creature when you activate mana abilities just before paying the cost.
* If a creature's power is somehow less than 0, it subtracts from the total power of your other creatures. If the total power of your creatures is 0 or less, Ghalta's cost remains 10GG.
* Ghalta's first ability can't reduce its cost below GG.

All creatures get -2/-2 until end of turn. If you have the city's blessing, instead only creatures your opponents control get -2/-2 until end of turn.


* Golden Demise affects only creatures that are on the battlefield at the time it resolves. Creatures that enter the battlefield later in the turn won't get -2/-2. Similarly, if you have the city's blessing, creatures that come under your opponents' control later in the turn won't get -2/-2.

Path of Mettle  

RW  

Legendary Enchantment  

When Path of Mettle enters the battlefield, it deals 1 damage to each creature that doesn't have first strike, double strike, vigilance, or haste.  

Whenever you attack with at least two creatures that have first strike, double strike, vigilance, and/or haste, transform Path of Mettle.

Metzali, Tower of Triumph  

Legendary Land  
*(Transforms from Path of Mettle.)*  

T: Add one mana of any color to your mana pool.  

1R, T: Metzali, Tower of Triumph deals 2 damage to each opponent.  

2W, T: Choose a creature at random that attacked this turn. Destroy that creature.


* Path of Mettle's first ability deals 1 damage to each creature that doesn't have any of the four listed abilities. It doesn't deal 1 damage to each creature for each ability that creature doesn't have.
* For Path of Mettle's last ability to trigger, any two attacking creatures you control need to each have any one of the four listed abilities. They don't need to share one of those abilities. For example, attacking with Sun Sentinel (a creature with vigilance) and Fanatical Firebrand (a creature with haste) will cause Path of Mettle's ability to trigger, as will attacking with two Sun Sentinels.
* Metzali's last ability can be activated before blockers are chosen.
* Metzali's last ability can be activated after combat damage has been dealt. You'll choose a creature at random that attacked this turn and has survived combat damage.
* A creature with indestructible can be chosen at random. It won't be destroyed.
* A creature with hexproof can be chosen at random. It will be destroyed.
* A creature that was put onto the battlefield attacking didn't attack, so it can't be chosen at random.
* A creature that attacked and was removed from combat (such as by [Spires of Orazca](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spires+of+Orazca)) still attacked, so it can be chosen at random.
* Players can't take actions between choosing the creature at random and destroying it.
* In a Two-Headed Giant game, Metzali's second ability causes the opposing team to lose 4 life.

*Enrage* — Whenever Polyraptor is dealt damage, create a token that's a copy of Polyraptor.


* The token will have Polyraptor's ability. It will also be able to create copies of itself.
* The token won't copy counters or damage marked on Polyraptor, nor will it copy other effects that have changed Polyraptor's power, toughness, types, color, or so on. Normally, this means the token will simply be a Polyraptor. But if any copy effects have affected that Polyraptor, they're taken into account.
* If Polyraptor leaves the battlefield before its triggered ability resolves, most likely because it was dealt lethal damage, the token will still enter the battlefield as a copy of Polyraptor, using Polyraptor's copiable values from when it was last on the battlefield.

* If Profane Procession or Tomb of the Dusk Rose somehow has exiled cards other than with Profane Procession's ability, those exiled cards aren't linked to Tomb of the Dusk Rose's second ability. They can't be put onto the battlefield with that ability.
* If you have enough mana, you can activate Profane Procession's ability multiple times before any activation resolves. It will be transformed if one activation exiles the third card. Further activations waiting to resolve won't cause Tomb of the Dusk Rose to transform back into Profane Procession, but they will exile creatures that Tomb of the Dusk Rose can bring back.
* In a multiplayer game, if a player leaves the game, all cards that player owns leave as well. If you leave the game, any permanents you control from Tomb of the Dusk Rose's ability are exiled.

* Protean Raider copies exactly what was printed on the original creature (unless that creature is copying something else or is a token; see below). It doesn't copy whether that creature is tapped or untapped, whether it has any counters on it or Auras attached to it, or any non-copy effects that have changed its power, toughness, types, color, or so on.
* If the chosen creature has X in its mana cost, X is considered to be 0.
* If the chosen creature is copying something else (for example, if the chosen creature is another Protean Raider), then Protean Raider enters the battlefield as whatever the chosen creature copied.
* If the chosen creature is a token, Protean Raider copies the original characteristics of that token as stated by the effect that created the token. Protean Raider is not a token in this case.
* Any enters-the-battlefield abilities of the copied creature will trigger when Protean Raider enters the battlefield. Any "as [this creature] enters the battlefield" or "[this creature] enters the battlefield with" abilities of the chosen creature will also work.
* If Protean Raider somehow enters the battlefield at the same time as another creature, Protean Raider can't become a copy of that creature. You may choose only a creature that's already on the battlefield.

If that target becomes illegal after the ability has triggered but before it resolves, you also won't sacrifice the Elemental token. In either case, it will trigger again during your next upkeep.
* If another card copies Rekindling Phoenix (such as Protean Raider may), the Elemental token's triggered ability will look for a card named Rekindling Phoenix, not one with the other card's name. This is true even if the card copying Rekindling Phoenix keeps its name while it's copying Rekindling Phoenix (such as [Lazav, Dimir Mastermind](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lazav%2C+Dimir+Mastermind) does).

* If a creature's power is somehow less than 0, it subtracts from the total power of the other creatures its controller chooses. This can cause creatures with power 5 or greater to survive.

For example, if a 3/3 Dinosaur you control blocks a 5/5 creature with trample, the attacking player may assign 2 of that creature's combat damage to the player or planeswalker it's attacking and Temple Altisaur will prevent 2 of the 3 damage assigned to the defending Dinosaur.
* If multiple sources would deal damage to another Dinosaur you control, all but 1 damage from each of those sources is prevented.
* The effects of two Temple Altisaurs won't reduce the damage from one source below 1 damage.
* If multiple replacement and/or prevention effects could apply to a Dinosaur you control, you choose the order in which to apply those effects.

* Effects that modify a creature's power and/or toughness, such as the effect of [Titanic Growth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Titanic+Growth), will apply to the creature no matter when they started to take effect.

* Wayward Swordtooth's middle ability is cumulative if you control more than one. It's also cumulative with other effects that let you play additional lands, such as the one from Enter the Unknown.

Zacama, Primal Calamity  

6RGW  

Legendary Creature — Elder Dinosaur  

9/9  

Vigilance, reach, trample  

When Zacama, Primal Calamity enters the battlefield, if you cast it, untap all lands you control.  

2R: Zacama deals 3 damage to target creature.  

2G: Destroy target artifact or enchantment.  

2W: You gain 3 life.


* Zacama's triggered ability triggers if you cast it from any zone. It doesn't trigger if you put Zacama onto the battlefield without casting it.
* Zacama's damage-dealing ability can be activated during combat, perhaps targeting a creature blocking it. If all creatures blocking Zacama are destroyed, its combat damage is assigned to the player or planeswalker it's attacking because of trample. If the blocking creatures are dealt nonlethal damage, that damage is considered when assigning trample damage.
