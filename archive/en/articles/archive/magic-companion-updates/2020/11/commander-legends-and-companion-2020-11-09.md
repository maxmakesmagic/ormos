The *Commander Legends* Prerelease is just around the corner, and I am pumped! In addition to the global debut of one of the most innovative *Magic* sets of all time, the event marks the debut of two new digital tools for the first time on a massive scale: EventLink and the *Magic: The Gathering Companion* app. I'm the product manager for both tools, and today, I'm here to explain how they'll work to make sure you have the best experience with the *Commander Legends* Prerelease in an extraordinary time. Let's go!


What is EventLink?
==================


Wizards EventLink is a new browser-based piece of technology that enables your local Wizards Play Network (WPN) store to run sanctioned *Magic* events. It replaces older technology called WER and is currently in open beta. The *Commander Legends* Prerelease is the first time retailers around the world will be using the software en masse. Players don't need to worry about EventLink; instead, you can use the *Magic: The Gathering Companion* app for the smoothest experience at your local Prerelease.


Prerelease and *Companion*
==========================


You can now use the *Companion* app to participate in your local Prerelease! Whether it's an at-home Prerelease due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic or in a region where it's safe to play in-store, *Companion* makes your experience easier.


Download *Companion* on [iOS here](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/magic-the-gathering-companion/id1455161962?src=app_page).


Download *Companion* on [Android here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wizards.winter_orb&src=product_page).


Once you've downloaded *Companion*, you'll log in with your Wizards Account. What's a Wizards Account? It's the new single sign-on account system for just about everything that requires a login from Wizards of the Coast! In fact, if you've ever played a game of *Magic Arena* or logged into our customer service website, you already have a Wizards Account. If you don't, you can get [one here](https://myaccounts.wizards.com/). As an added bonus for the *Commander Legends* Prerelease, signing up for your event using your Wizards Account qualifies you to receive the exclusive Baron SengirÂ participation promo card (while supplies last):

If you don't want to sign up for a Wizards Account or can't for some reason, you can still participate in your Prerelease! Your local store can add you as a guest using EventLink, though you won't be eligible for the participation promo. You can also participate in your events with a Wizards Account login even if you're not using the *Companion* app. *Companion* is there to help make your experience easier, but you don't *have* to use it to participate in your local events.


Prereleasing with *Companion*
=============================


If you're living in a region where it's safe to play in-store, *Companion* helps you stay safe and makes getting tournament information easier than ever. You can use *Companion* to:


* Find out who you're paired against
* Receive your table assignment so you know where to sit
* Check the standings to see how you're doing
* Enter the result of your match
* Receive notifications when a new round starts

All this functionality is right in the palm of your hands! With *Companion* you no longer need to crowd around other players to read pairings information or sign a match slip to record how you did. You can also check your results at any time, handy for checking on how you're doing or catching any reporting mistakes that may occur during the event. When you arrive at your event, ask your WPN staff for the entry code to your event. Enter the code into *Companion* to "join," and voila! You're off to the races. Pairings, match slips, and other notifications will be sent to the app automatically.


Commander and *Companion*
=========================


Even when you're not using the *Companion* app to participate in your local store's events, it's got great features to support your at-home play! You can use it to organize your own tournament at home with product you picked up for an at-home Prerelease. No mental math necessary; just enter your family and friends, and let *Companion* do the rest! (**Note**: Please follow local guidelines regarding safety in gathering with other people during these times.)


The life tracker in *Companion* is great for Commander! Track up to four players in a game. Rocking the new [Jeska, Thrice Reborn](https://media.wizards.com/2020/cmr/en_H0eOxLWERK.png) or any other Commander with the "partner" ability? You can track those abilities, too! Poison, energy, storm, and more are all available at a tap in the life tracker to make playing your Commander games as easy as Eldrainian pie.


What's Up Next?
===============


*Companion* and EventLink are just getting started! I'm very excited about the features on the horizon for both products, like a card database in *Companion* and new capabilities for EventLink to support digital play organized by WPN stores. For now, I hope you have a fun, safe *Commander Legends* Prerelease and enjoy EventLink and *Companion* working together as a bonus set of "partners" for the event!
