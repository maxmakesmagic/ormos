Card of the Day - June, 2010
============================

By Wizards of the Coast











![Exotic Orchard](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Exotic+Orchard)**[Exotic Orchard](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Exotic+Orchard)** – *Conflux* rare. Are you enjoying the Summer of Multiplayer? Good! If you're thinking about whipping up a deck for *Archenemy*, may we recommend including an [Exotic Orchard](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Exotic+Orchard)? It can be very satisfying to use your opponents' mana capabilities against them, you know.
 ![Gravedigger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Gravedigger)**[Gravedigger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gravedigger)** – *Tempest* common. This [Gravedigger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gravedigger) is not an employee of a cemetery, which is good, because it would probably present a conflict of interest to employ a zombie. Instead of putting creatures *in* graves, [Gravedigger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gravedigger) takes them *out*. And gives them a new, shambling unlife in the bargain!
 ![Goblin Balloon Brigade](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Goblin+Balloon+Brigade)**[Goblin Balloon Brigade](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Balloon+Brigade)** – *Ninth Edition* uncommon. The giant inflatable toad is the most memorable thing about the *Ninth Edition* version of [Goblin Balloon Brigade](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Balloon+Brigade). So when the card comes back for ***Magic** 2011*, it will have the same art but new flavor text: *"The enemy is getting too close! Quick! Inflate the toad!"*
![Xun Yu, Wei Advisor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Xun+Yu%2C+Wei+Advisor)**[Xun Yu, Wei Advisor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Xun+Yu%2C+Wei+Advisor)** – *Portal Three Kingdoms* rare. The Oracle text for a lot of Portal cards contains the sentence "Activate this ability only during your turn, before attackers are declared." This is because Portal used a cut-down version of **Magic** rules that didn't have a postcombat main phase or instants, so the combat tricks tended to say "On your turn, before you attack ...."
 ![Xira Arien](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Xira+Arien)**[Xira Arien](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Xira+Arien)** – *Masters Edition III* rare. Although [Xira Arien](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Xira+Arien)'s flavor text mentions a costume, the creature type "Insect" suggests those wings aren't just for show. It's established in *Assassin's Blade* that Xira is, in fact, a eumidian insect. Anyway, who says insects can't wear costumes occasionally?
 ![Xathrid Demon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Xathrid+Demon)**[Xathrid Demon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Xathrid+Demon)** – ***Magic** 2010* mythic rare. [Xathrid Demon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Xathrid+Demon) would like to remind you that it's the Summer of Multiplayer, and would also like to know if you have any creatures you'd like to sacrifice in order to cause pain all across the table.
 ![Xiahou Dun, the One-Eyed](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Xiahou+Dun%2C+the+One-Eyed)**[Xiahou Dun, the One-Eyed](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Xiahou+Dun%2C+the+One-Eyed)** – *Portal Three Kingdoms* rare. According to the *Romance of the Three Kingdoms,* when Xiahou Dun got Cao Xing's arrow in his left eye, he pulled the arrow out and *ate his own eyeball* to frighten his enemies!
 ![Xantid Swarm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Xantid+Swarm)**[Xantid Swarm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Xantid+Swarm)** – *Scourge* rare. Ever wonder just how big [Xantid Swarm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Xantid+Swarm) can make [Our Market Research Shows That Players Like Really Long Card Names So We Made This Card to Have the Absolute Longest Card Name Ever Elemental](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Our%2BMarket%2BResearch%2BShows%2BThat%2BPlayers%2BLike%2BReally%2BLong%2BCard%2BNames%2BSo%2BWe%2BMade%2BThis%2BCard%2Bto%2BHave%2Bthe%2BAbsolute%2BLongest%2BCard%2BName%2BEver%2BElemental)? Doug Beyer once [did the math](/en/articles/archive/ask-wizards-may-2007-2007-05-01) and found 725 creatures in the swarm. But it's possible he missed a couple.
 
![Topsy Turvy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Topsy+Turvy)**[Topsy Turvy](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Topsy+Turvy)** – *Unhinged* rare. Because [Topsy Turvy](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Topsy+Turvy) doesn't reverse the order of steps within phases, a three-card combo of it, [Opalescence](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Opalescence), and [Mistmeadow Witch](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mistmeadow+Witch) should be able to create a single endless turn, going forward and backward forever.
 ![Fortune Thief](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Fortune+Thief)**[Fortune Thief](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fortune+Thief)** – *Time Spiral* rare. Many *Time Spiral* cards are loaded up with references to old cards, like [Fortune Thief](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fortune+Thief)'s reference to [Ali from Cairo](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ali+from+Cairo). But you have to look pretty carefully to notice that the [Fortune Thief](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fortune+Thief) stole [Ali from Cairo](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Ali%2Bfrom%2BCairo)'s turban *and* the pendant!
 ![Pulse Tracker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Pulse+Tracker)**[Pulse Tracker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pulse+Tracker)** – *Worldwake* common. You know who's excited about the Summer of Multiplayer? [Pulse Tracker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pulse+Tracker)! This sassy little vampire just loves having multiple opponents. The more the merrier!
 ![Alchor's Tomb](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Alchor%27s+Tomb)**[Alchor's Tomb](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Alchor%27s+Tomb)** – *Legends* rare. [Alchor's Tomb](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Alchor%27s+Tomb) was supposed to be Alchor's *Tome*, a book that would belong to a D&D wizard played by Wizards of the Coast founder Peter Adkison. But the artist misread the title and poor Alchor suddenly turned up dead. 
 ![Mana Tithe](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Mana+Tithe)**[Mana Tithe](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Tithe)** – *Planar Chaos* common. [Force Spike](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Force+Spike) first appeared in *Legends* (1994), then hit the core set in *Fifth Edition* (1997) and *Seventh Edition* (2001) before making a colorshifted appearance as [Mana Tithe](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Tithe) in *Planar Chaos* (2007). It's been a long ride!
 ![Terror](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Terror)**[Terror](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Terror)** – *Tenth Edition* common. The creepy *Tenth Edition* art depicts a human's body jumping out of its skin, while the skeleton jumps out of the body. Scary!
 ![Gigadrowse](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Gigadrowse)**[Gigadrowse](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gigadrowse)** – *Guildpact* common. [Gigadrowse](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gigadrowse) just naturally lends itself to complicated situations. Like elaborate puzzles. Such as, for example, a couple of [these puzzles](/en/articles/archive/magic-puzzling%E2%80%94guildpact-2006-02-27) from 2006. Enjoy!
 ![Meglonoth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Meglonoth)**[Meglonoth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Meglonoth)** – *Conflux* rare. For the Summer of Multiplayer, why not renew your friendship with [Meglonoth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Meglonoth)? No one will be attacking you with this monster on your side!
 ![Dodecapod](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Dodecapod)**[Dodecapod](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dodecapod)** – *Time Spiral* timeshifted. The name "[Dodecapod](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dodecapod)" literally means "twelve feet." And the creature depicted in the art does, in fact, have twelve arms and legs. You might have to squint to see some of them, though.
 ![Millikin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Millikin)**[Millikin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Millikin)** – *Odyssey* uncommon. [Millikin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Millikin) and [Manakin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Manakin) are clearly related, and they might be the same thing. By comparing them, we can learn that milling your own deck is apparently a benefit worth losing one point of power for.
 ![Order of the Sacred Bell](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Order+of+the+Sacred+Bell)**[Order of the Sacred Bell](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Order+of+the+Sacred+Bell)** – *Ninth Edition* common. Ever wish you could know more about the sacred bell? [This story](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/TCG/Article.aspx?x=magic/chk/jugan) about [Jugan, the Rising Star](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jugan%2C+the+Rising+Star) will edify you! 
 ![Second Sunrise](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Second+Sunrise)**[Second Sunrise](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Second+Sunrise)** – *Mirrodin* rare. The 2006 Extended combo deck that combined [Second Sunrise](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Second+Sunrise) with cards like [Mossfire Egg](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mossfire+Egg) was called, of course, "Sunny Side Up." Did you notice that it continued the "breakfast food" theme of Trix, Fruity Pebbles, and Full English Breakfast?
 ![Farewell to Arms](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Farewell+to+Arms)**[Farewell to Arms](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Farewell+to+Arms)** – *Unhinged* common. It can be challenging to play *Unhinged* when you've got [Working Stiff](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Working+Stiff) and your opponent has [Farewell to Arms](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Farewell+to+Arms). It makes [Mesa Chicken](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mesa+Chicken) practically unplayable, for example.
 ![Old Man of the Sea](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Old+Man+of+the+Sea)**[Old Man of the Sea](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Old+Man+of+the+Sea)** – *Arabian Nights* rare. The original type line for [Old Man of the Sea](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Old+Man+of+the+Sea) read "Summon Marid." A marid is an Arabian water spirit and not, as some have assumed, the first name of the Old Man in question.
