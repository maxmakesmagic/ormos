*Saviors of Kamigawa* enhances the rest of the Kamigawa block in part by making hand size explicitly matter. Two blue creatures, [Minamo Scrollkeeper](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Minamo+Scrollkeeper) and [Trusted Advisor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Trusted+Advisor), do that by increasing your maximum hand size, allowing you to build up bigger and bigger [Soramaro, First to Dream](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Soramaro%252C%2BFirst%2Bto%2BDream)s or [Sokenzan Spellblade](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sokenzan+Spellblade)s, for example.


Since black is the color of discard, it instead forces your opponent to have a *smaller* hand size. Two black creatures punish your opponent's hand in ways that mirror the Scrollkeeper and the Advisor. Both are rat shamans, representing a particular sect of the Nezumi: *insect* shamans.

These hand-size-surpressing shamans use incantations to summon and control insects to swarm their enemies. The incessant buzzing distracts and irritates, lowering a mage's potential for [Cowed by Wisdom](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Cowed%2Bby%2BWisdom).



Note that the *Mirage* card [Miser's Cage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Miser%27s+Cage) also punishes an opponent with a full hand. ([Mise](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mise) from *Unhinged*, however, is actually is a card-drawing spell. It refers to the **Magic** slang term referred to in its flavor text, not to the quality of being a stingy hoarder.)
