This is the path to get to the event site here in San José, Costa Rica. It’s fantastic, really.

Yup, we’re here at Hotel Barceló, with a hall full of players slinging some cardboard.

Last time a Grand Prix was in Costa Rica in 2012, much of the *Magic* world learned of all the wonderful majesty that Costa Rica provides. And this time, the *Magic* community is luxuriating in it. I mean check out Ariel Nagy just hanging out. Mind you, this is *during* the tournament!

But it’s not just around the Grand Prix event site where exciting things are happening. Just like last time, players toured beaches, waterfalls, volcanoes, zip lines, and night life. On Craig Wescoe’s adventures, he snapped this photo of a cute monkey with its child, themselves just hanging around at the Manuel Antonio National Park.

Everyone knows how to relax when you’re here. At the hall, your downtime can be spent just sitting by the pool.

Unless, of course, you’re Pro Tour Hall of Fame member Frank Karsten. I caught him turning around and heading back from the awesome hammocked area. He said, “I just realized, I’m not really dressed for the pool, am I?”

But overall, this entire weekend (and for many, a week before and a week after) are turning out well. Except of course for Pascal Maynard. On a day-long tour (that he barely made at 6 am), the French Canadian got a little too much sun, and found himself “turning out well” also, just in a completely different way.

The Pro Tour *Oath of the Gatewatch* Top 8er is red and white all over, and it matches his deck choice quite appropriately.

This is the flavor of the weekend here in Costa Rica. For many, this is the first time they’ve been able to play a high-level Grand Prix without traveling very long distances. For some, it’s a chance to get away, and play the game they love at the same time. But for all, it’s a weekend to live the *Magic* life the best way we know how.


Cheers from (currently) sunny San José, Costa Rica!
