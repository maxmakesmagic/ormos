![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/digital/magiconline/ken-nagle-cc.jpg)**Name:** Kenneth Nagle  
**Age:** 30  
**How long have you been playing **Magic Online**?** Since Beta test of V1.

**Favorite Magic card(s):** [Norritt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Norritt), (most) all of *Worldwake*  
**What work do you do that affects **Magic Online** and how?** I submitted a bug during V1 Beta that was upgraded by chrisg to “Critical”. Other than that, I’ve done user interface testing whenever that team has a new working prototype. The biggest contribution I make is new cards in expansion sets.   
**Do you think that Wizards will be able to defeat the community this year?** I hear the community team will be hitting harder this year, but it will be for naught. Good for me; I take particular delight watching Evan Erwin lose to cards I designed.

**Do you think that Wizards will be able to defeat the community this year?** With our super secret tech combined with savory spices from faraway lands, I expect we will X-0 them.

**Age:** 28

I serve on the Banned/Restricted team to make decisions about what cards need to be banned and restricted in various paper and **Magic Online** formats. I also serve on the Magic Templating Team, which is responsible for making sure **Magic** cards work within the rules and are worded in a way that players will be able to correctly understand how they work. I keep myself involved with all sorts of things!   
**Do you think Wizards will be able to defeat the community this year?**  According to my 8-ball, it is certain.

I also maintain and update the Oracle card database so that the cards in each Legacy set released Online match their printed functionality as much as possible.   
**Do you think that Wizards will be able to defeat the community this year?**  Yes, because I am not a double agent hired by the Community team to torpedo the **Wizards** team from the inside. Why would you even make such a ridiculous accusation? This interview is over!!!

[Soul Burn](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soul+Burn), which won me my first tournament way back in *Mirage*. Also a few that I've designed: [Knight-Captain of Eos](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Knight-Captain+of+Eos), and some I can't mention because they are in upcoming sets.   
**What work do you do that affects **Magic Online** and how?** I'm the Software Architect. I oversee the technical design of the big changes to the system.   
**Do you think that Wizards will be able to defeat the community this year?**  We've made sure to hide all the multiballs this year, so it shouldn't be an issue.

**Do you think that Wizards will be able to defeat the community this year?** 
**Magic** is an unpredictable game. I mean, we could be winning by a lot—I mean a lot—and all of a sudden we’re run over by a gigantic multiball. I’ve seen stranger things happen. I hope to continue my undefeated streak in Community Cup competition, however.

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/digital/magiconline/mike-gills-cc.jpg)**Name:** Mike Gills  
**How long have you been playing **Magic Online**?** Off and on since its launch  
**Favorite **Magic Online** format:**  Sealed  
**Favorite Magic card(s):**  Any card with the word Saproling on it and [Carrion Ants](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Carrion+Ants). These are the cards I played the most in the 10 player free-for-all games we used to run in my apartment back in the day.   
**What work do you do that affect **Magic Online** and how?**  I have been the Community Manager, then the Tournament Manager, and then the Program Manager for **Magic Online** over the last 2 years. I am currently cross training in **Magic** Brand where I still put together the **Magic Online** newsletter  
. **Do you think that Wizards will be able to defeat the community this year?**  If I wasn’t playing I’d say it would be a sure **Wizards** victory but as I will be a weak link, anything is possible.   


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/digital/magiconline/charles-rapkin-cc.jpg)**Name:** Charles Rapkin  
**Age:**  27  
**How long have you been playing **Magic Online**?** Magic Since Revised, **Magic Online** since November '07  
**Favorite **Magic Online** format:**  Commander/EDH  
**Favorite Magic card(s):** 
[Serra Angel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Serra+Angel), [Shivan Dragon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shivan+Dragon), [Privileged Position](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Privileged+Position), and [Hit//Run](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hit%2F%2FRun).   
**What work do you do that affect **Magic Online** and how?**  I work in Customer Service, so I help players in their times of need, and make sure dev is aware of any and all issues going on with **Magic Online**.  
**Do you think that Wizards will be able to defeat the community this year?**  Community winning again? Inconceivable!   


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/digital/magiconline/jason-radabaugh-cc.jpg)**Name:** Jason Radabaugh  
**Age:**  25  
**How long have you been playing **Magic Online**?:** 5 or so years by now.   
**Favorite **Magic Online** format:**  Standard is my go-to format, though Pauper and Commander are also good fun. My absolute favorite formats are limited, but that’s harder for **Wizards** employees to participate in online, so I draft a fair amount with paper cards. ROE in particular has been a blast.   
**Favorite Magic card(s):**  Recently, [Artisan of Kozilek](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Artisan+of+Kozilek). I seem to open one every time I play sealed ROE, and I always play him, and he is always awesome (my favorite thing to with Artisan is return a [Pelakka Wurm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pelakka+Wurm). That’s fair, right?).   
**What work do you do that affects **Magic Online** and how?**  I am a Software Developer on the **Magic Online** Content Team. Functionally, this means I write and debug code for the rules engine behind all the in-game card interactions on **Magic Online**. I do a little work with the **Magic Online** client and work on process support tools as well. I also occasionally help play test new products that R&D comes up with.   
**Do you think that Wizards will be able to defeat the community this year?:**  Definitely. The community is going to have to play at their best to take home the title.   


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/digital/magiconline/ethan-schwager-cc.jpg)**Name:** Ethan Schwager  
**Age:**  31  
**How long have you been playing **Magic Online**?**  9 months  
**Favorite **Magic Online** format:**  Commander  
**Favorite Magic card(s):** 
[Mana Drain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Drain), [Sudden Spoiling](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sudden+Spoiling), and [Timetwister](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Timetwister)  
**What work do you do that affect **Magic Online** and how?**  Game support, I answer phone calls, live chat, and emails from customers with rules/product questions. I also process compensation requests and help test and report bugs.   
**Do you think that Wizards will be able to defeat the community this year?**  Yes, I’ll do my part!   


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/digital/magiconline/ron-foster-cc.jpg)**Name:** Ron Foster  
**Age:**  39  
**How long have you been playing **Magic Online**?**  From the very first internal betas.   
**Favorite **Magic Online** format:**  Commander.   
**Favorite Magic card(s):** 
[Foster](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Foster), of course! (Current collection: 980 cards, 38 of which are foil)   
**What work do you do that affect **Magic Online** and how?**  I am the Japan premier event manager, so I don't deal directly with **MTGO**, although I do work with a lot of people who are involved with it in some way.   
**Do you think that Wizards will be able to defeat the community this year?**  In the end it doesn't matter who wins as long as we all have fun, but I know we have some surprises planned for them in the Commander format that hopefully will give us the edge in that round.   


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/digital/magiconline/tom-lapille-cc.jpg)**Name:** Tom LaPille  
**Age:**  24  
**How long have you been playing **Magic Online**?** Since the beta!   
**Favorite **Magic Online** format:**  Classic  
**Favorite Magic card(s):** 
[Psychatog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psychatog), [Arcbound Ravager](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arcbound+Ravager), [Grim Lavamancer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grim+Lavamancer)

**What work do you do that affect **Magic Online** and how?**  I work on the **Magic** creative team. I write and coordinate card names, flavor text, art descriptions, and other flavor stuff for **Magic**.   
**Do you think that Wizards will be able to defeat the community this year?**  Is this even a question? I don’t think we’ll be *physically able* to lose. I don’t really recall what happened last year… I think it got rained out or something? But the past doesn’t even matter—history is nothing but a bunch of crazy accidents that have culminated in our imminent, unavoidable victory.

**Do you think that Wizards will be able to defeat the community this year?**  Without a doubt, but only if we continue using our secret research tech weapon to make all our decks. I still have the goods on Forsythe, and he’ll be indentured for years to come.
