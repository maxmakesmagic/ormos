It's *Modern Masters 2017 Edition* preview week, which means I get to show you a preview card. It's the first day, and I have a little pull behind the scenes, so I have a pretty cool preview for you. Everyone ready?




Check out the first *Modern Masters 2017 Edition* preview!

Yes, the *Zendikar* fetch lands are finally back, and you'll be able to get them in *Modern Masters 2017 Edition*.






  

I don't have much to say about the design of *Modern Masters 2017* *Edition* as I wasn't on the design team (and there's [an article by the lead designer Adam Prosak](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/card-preview/took-us-long-enough-2017-02-27) to go read), so I thought I would use today's column as a history lesson to talk about the many dual lands that we've designed over the years. I'm going to introduce them in the order we made them and talk a bit about what went into their designs. Note that for today, I am only talking about dual lands—that is lands that tap for two, and only two, colors of mana. I'm also only talking about lands, so no dual mana producing artifacts.


[**The Original Dual Lands—*Limited Edition (Alpha*/*Beta**)***](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&set=+%5b%22Limited+Edition+Beta%22%5d&type=+%5b%22Land%22%5d&rarity=+%5bR%5d)


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&multiverseid=287)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=287)[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&multiverseid=279)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=279)[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&multiverseid=282)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=282)
The very first dual lands are the most famous, probably evidenced by the fact that people refer to them as "the dual lands." These were the creation of Richard Garfield and were simply each combination of the basic lands. The original dual lands showed up in *Limited Edition (Alpha)*. (Well, technically only nine of them did, as [Volcanic Island](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=383147) was accidentally left off the rare sheet; the problem was corrected in *Beta*). The lands do nothing other than count for each type and tap for the appropriate color. Richard was aware that these were powerful, but using the assumption that people would spend on *Magic* what they would spend on any normal game, he thought the cards wouldn't exist in a high enough number to be problematic. This is why Richard put them at rare.


[**The Ally Pain Lands—*Ice Age***](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&type=+%5b%22Land%22%5d&rarity=+%5bR%5d&set=+%5b%22Ice+Age%22%5d&text=+!%5bdepletion%5d+!%5bupkeep%5d)


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&multiverseid=2750)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=2750)[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&multiverseid=2759)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=2759)[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&multiverseid=2755)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=2755)
The next dual lands didn't show up for two years until the set *Ice Age* in the summer of 1995. *Ice Age* introduced not one, but two new dual-land cycles, although both are only for the ally color pairs. It was decided that we wanted to stress that the ally colors were more willing to work together. (We would move away from this many years later.) The pain lands all tap for a colorless mana without any drawback and can tap for one of two colors—but if you do, the card deals 1 damage to you. Why was this damage rather than a life payment? Because damage protection was a big thing back in the day.


Both new dual-land cycles came about because it was decided that the original dual lands were a little too strong. R&D adopted a philosophy that we didn't want lands that were "strictly better" than basic lands. For example, there was almost no reason not to play the original dual lands in place of basic lands (the only exception being nonbasic land hate, of which there was little at the time). This meant that there had to be some kind of drawback if you got more than one colored mana out of a land. The pain lands' approach was to damage you every time you got colored mana. The colorless mana option was added to lessen the drawback, meaning you only took damage when you specifically needed the color.


The pain lands were considered a success and for many years were the dual lands in the core sets (appearing in each one from *Fifth Edition* through *Tenth Edition*, with the exception of *Eighth Edition*).


[**The Ally Depletion Lands—*Ice Age***](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&type=+%5b%22Land%22%5d&rarity=+%5bR%5d&set=+%5b%22Ice+Age%22%5d&text=+!%5bdamage%5d+!%5bcumulative%5d)


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&multiverseid=2756)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=2756)[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&multiverseid=2757)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=2757)[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&multiverseid=2762)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=2762)
The depletion lands, in contrast, were not as popular. The depletion lands used a different drawback. Whenever you tapped them for one of the two colors, the land didn't untap during your next untap, meaning you only got mana out of them every other turn. The big problem with depletion lands was that they didn't give you the option to tap for colorless mana without a drawback, which meant that you were often paying for the drawback without even needing the colored mana. The ally depletion lands have never been reprinted.


[**The Ally Slow Fetch Lands—*Mirage***](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&type=+%5b%22Land%22%5d&set=+%5b%22Mirage%22%5d&rarity=+%5bU%5d&name=+!%5bCrystal%5d)


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&multiverseid=3572)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=3572)[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&multiverseid=3575)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=3575)[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&multiverseid=3574)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=3574)
*Mirage* tried a different approach to dual lands. Instead of making lands that could tap for two different colors, we made a cycle of ally-affiliated lands that could search out one of two different basic lands from your library and put it onto the battlefield. The idea being that the lands had the potential to tap for one of two colors, but you locked in which color when you played it. The lands entered the battlefield tapped because without a drawback, they would break the "better than a basic land" rule. This drawback proved to be a little too much of a drawback and the cycle would never be reprinted (with the one exception of *Vintage Masters* online). It would though be the inspiration for today's preview cards (as well as the ally cycle that compliments it).


[**The Enemy Slow Pain Lands—*Tempest***](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&type=+%5b%22Land%22%5d&set=+%5b%22Tempest%22%5d&rarity=+%5bR%5d&text=+!%5bland%5d)


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&multiverseid=4930)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=4930)[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&multiverseid=4935)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=4935)[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&multiverseid=4940)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=4940)
After three ally dual-land cycles, we decided in *Tempest* it was time to do another enemy one. This cycle took the ally pain lands from *Ice Age* and added in one more drawback: they entered the battlefield tapped. The extra drawback was us trying to represent mechanically that enemy colors didn't work as well together as ally colors. The lands saw some play as they were the only option for enemy dual lands, but the enters-the-battlefield tapped drawback proved to be too harsh and, other than some online-only sets, the enemy slow pain lands never saw a reprint.


[**The Fixed Ally Depletion Lands—*Tempest***](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&type=+%5b%22Land%22%5d&set=+%5b%22Tempest%22%5d&rarity=+%5bU%5d&text=+%5buntap%5d+!%5bshadow%5d)


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&multiverseid=4942)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=4942)[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&multiverseid=4937)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=4937)[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&multiverseid=4934)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=4934)
*Tempest* also was the first time we attempted to correct a previous dual-land design. I explained above that depletion lands not having the option to tap for colorless made them mostly unplayable, so the *Tempest* versions added that option. This change helped significantly, and the cycle saw some tournament play. It would later get reprinted in *Champions of Kamigawa* with new names. (It also got reprinted in *Tempest Remastered* online.)


[**The Ally Tap Lands—*Invasion***](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&type=+%5b%22Land%22%5d&rarity=+%5bU%5d&set=+%5b%22Invasion%22%5d&text=+!%5bsacrifice%5d)


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&multiverseid=23240)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=23240)[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&multiverseid=23242)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=23242)[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&multiverseid=23244)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=23244)
The next new dual-land cycle wouldn't happen for three years, and it was one of the most contentious dual-land cycles ever made. We had just hired Randy Buehler into R&D because we wanted our development to have more experts from the Pro Tour. Randy felt that our dual lands had never been good enough and pushed to make the tap lands. There was a lot of pushback because many of R&D didn't feel the enters-the-battlefield tapped drawback was enough. Randy managed to convince us to print the tap lands, and history would prove that not only was Randy correct, but we'd also have room to add even more, as the drawback was actually a significant drawback. The ally tap lands would be reprinted in *Eighth Edition*.


[**The Enemy Pain Lands—*Apocalypse***](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&type=+%5b%22Land%22%5d&rarity=+%5bR%5d&set=+%5b%22Apocalypse%22%5d)


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&multiverseid=23246)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=23246)[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&multiverseid=23250)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=23250)[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&multiverseid=23249)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=23249)
*Apocalypse* was the enemy-color expansion, so it seemed only apropos to introduce a new cycle of enemy dual lands. After the disaster that was the *Tempest* slow pain lands, we decided to just make enemy versions of the original *Ice Age* ally pain lands without the enters-the-battlefield tapped drawback. Like the ally pain lands, the enemy pain lands saw a bunch of reprinting (*Ninth Edition*, *Tenth Edition*, *Magic 2015*, and *Magic Origins*).


[**The Weak Ally Filter Lands—*Odyssey***](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&type=+%5b%22Land%22%5d&rarity=+%5bR%5d&set=+%5b%22Odyssey%22%5d&text=+!%5btarget%5d+!%5bdamage%5d&name=+!%5bcrystal%5d)


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&multiverseid=29793)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=29793)[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&multiverseid=29795)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=29795)[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&multiverseid=29796)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=29796)
*Odyssey* tried a different take on dual lands. This cycle got you two colors of mana, but you had to activate it by spending a colorless mana. It filtered your mana into the two colors. This cycle's drawback was a bit subtler—they're useless as a turn-one play because until you have another mana source, you can't get mana out of them. From a design standpoint, I'm not a huge fan of filtering because it requires more cognitive load to track what colored mana you have access to. Individual cards would get reprinted in *Commander (2016 Edition)*, but the full cycle has never been reprinted.


[**The Tainted Lands—*Torment***](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&type=+%5b%22Land%22%5d&set=+%5b%22Torment%22%5d&rarity=+%5bU%5d&name=+!%5bCoffers%5d)


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&multiverseid=31757)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=31757)[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&multiverseid=31758)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=31758)[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&multiverseid=31760)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=31760)
Here's a fine trivia question: What's the only dual-land cycle with only four cards? The answer is the tainted lands from *Torment*. *Torment* was the "black set," where the color balance was weighted toward black and away from green and white, black's enemies. Each land could tap for black and another color if you controlled a Swamp. It tapped for colorless regardless of whether you had a Swamp. Because it was connecting to one color, the cycle is only four cards and is half ally, half enemy. It's one of the quirkiest dual-land cycles in existence. Individual cards would get reprinted in various supplemental products, but the full cycle has never been reprinted.


[**Riftstone Portal—*Judgment***](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=34398)


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&multiverseid=34398)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=34398)
I wasn't even sure if I was supposed to include this card, as it's clearly not from a cycle and it's questionably a dual land. *Judgment* was the "green-white set" to *Torment*'s "black set," so it included one card that, when in your graveyard, turned all your lands into green-white dual lands. I've included it mostly for completeness. It's never been reprinted.


[**The Ally Fetch Lands—*Onslaught***](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&type=+%5b%22Land%22%5d&rarity=+%5bR%5d&set=+%5b%22Onslaught%22%5d&text=+!%5btarget%5d+!%5btapped%5d)

We'd always liked what *Mirage* had tried to do with dual lands, but it took us a while to figure out how to make them better. The answer was to exchange the enters-the-battlefield tapped restriction with a life payment to activate the ability. Note that this cycle makes you pay life rather than damaging you. We long regretted the decision to have the pain lands damage you rather than being a life payment, both because it made the template longer and because damage prevention had been something we'd long been moving away from. I also believe this is the first dual-land cycle where we were a bit more careful about naming them, as we were aware of the fact that we might want to one day reprint them. This cycle would go on to be very popular and get reprinted in *Khans of Tarkir* and in the *Zendikar Expeditions* in *Battle for Zendikar*.


[**The Fixed Ally Depletion Lands—*Champions of Kamigawa***](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&type=+%5b%22Land%22%5d&rarity=+%5bU%5d&set=+%5b%22Champions+of+Kamigawa%22%5d)

This cycle is just the fixed ally depletion lands from *Tempest* but with new names. The names were chosen to fit within the world of Kamigawa but be reprintable on another world with a little creative massaging.


[**The Shock Lands—*Ravnica*/*Guildpact*/*Dissension***](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&type=+%5b%22Land%22%5d&block=+%5b%22Ravnica+Block%22%5d&rarity=+%5bR%5d&text=+%5blife%5d)

This is my favorite dual land-cycle I've designed. The idea behind it was that I knew both the pain lands and the tap lands were a bit week, so I made a ten-card cycle that let you choose one or the other. To simplify the template and gameplay, I changed the pain land option to be a one-time 2-life payment rather than losing life each time you tapped the land for colored mana. Also, because I realized that no dual-land cycle since the original dual lands had had both its basic land types, I also added that to the mix. What resulted was a very potent and popular dual-land cycle. It was reprinted in *Return to Ravnica* block as well as in *Zendikar* *Expeditions*. It's interesting to note that we named them to be reprintable on any world—then the first time we reprinted them was also on Ravnica.


[**The "Karoo" Dual Lands—*Ravnica*/*Guildpact*/*Dissension***](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&type=+%5b%22Land%22%5d+!%5b%22Basic%22%5d&block=+%5b%22Ravnica+Block%22%5d&rarity=+%5bC%5d)

This ten-card cycle was made because we wanted a dual-land cycle at common in Limited. The design was based off of the five-card monocolor cycle of lands from *Visions*. The white one was called [Karoo](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Karoo), which is where this dual-land cycle gets its nickname. That we named each land after a guild was a sign that we had no intention of using this cycle anywhere else. Looking back, this wasn't a great common cycle as it has a similar cognitive load problem like the weak filter lands in *Odyssey*. These lands have seen a bunch of reprints in various supplemental products, especially *Commander*, which needs lots of color fixing due to the singleton construction limit.


[**The Ally Storage Lands—*Time Spiral***](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&type=+%5b%22Land%22%5d&set=+%5b%22Time+Spiral%22%5d&rarity=+%5bU%5d&text=+!%5bassembly-worker%5d)

This dual-land cycle explores new space. Each land has three activated abilities. One, they can tap for colorless mana. Two, they can turn generic mana into storage counters. Three, for one generic mana, they can turn storage counters into one of two colors of mana. *Time Spiral* block had a time theme, so the storage lands were an evolution of a few monocolor land cycles from the past (*Fallen Empires* and *Mercadian Masques* being the most influential) that built up mana over time by accumulating counters on themselves. These lands were a bit fiddly and, other than in supplemental products, they have never been reprinted.

This is the dual-land cycle I'm second proudest of designing, mostly because the high concept of it entertains me to no end. This is a cycle of five ally future-shifted land cards (aka cards from potential futures) each from its own cycle. [Nimbus Maze](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=136045) is a dual land that provides colored mana if you control the other type of basic land (having an Island, for instance, gets you white mana). [River of Tears](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=126210) provides one of two colors depending on whether or not you've played a land this turn. [Graven Cairns](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=409559) filters one of two colors into any combination of two mana of the two colors. [Grove of the Burnwillows](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=287335) has the downside of giving your opponent life. And [Horizon Canopy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=409571) is a dual land that makes you lose a life whenever you get mana out of it, but allows you to trade it in for a new card. Of this cycle, only [Graven Cairns](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=409559) has gone on to have its cycle fleshed out (in *Shadowmoor* and *Eventide*), but we often discuss making cycles out of the other cards.


[**The Tribal Lands—*Lorwyn*/*Morningtide***](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&type=+%5b%22Land%22%5d&rarity=+%5bR%5d&block=+%5b%22Lorwyn+Block%22%5d&text=+%5breveal%5d)


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&multiverseid=153458)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=153458)[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&multiverseid=153467)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=153467)[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&multiverseid=153464)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=153464)
This is another odd cycle. Five appear in *Lorwyn* and three more appear in *Morningtide* ([Primal Beyond](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Primal+Beyond) taps for five colors, so it technically isn't a dual land, and [Rustic Clachan](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rustic+Clachan) doesn't even tap for more than one color mana—but I've included them as they're clearly part of this cycle). These dual lands enter the battlefield tapped unless you reveal a creature of a particular type as you play them. *Lorwyn* block had a tribal theme and these lands line up with the eight supported tribes. These and the lands from *Torment* and *Judgment* are why there's not an equal amount of ally or enemy dual lands. These cards have only seen reprints in supplemental products.


[**The Ally Filter Lands—*Shadowmoor***](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&type=+%5b%22Land%22%5d&rarity=+%5bR%5d&set=+%5b%22Shadowmoor%22%5d&name=+!%5breflecting%5d)

[Graven Cairns](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=409559) from *Future Sight* turned out to be from a very immediate future. *Shadowmoor* had the ally color cycle. It would later be reprinted in *Zendikar Expeditions*.


[**The Enemy Filter Lands—*Eventide***](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&type=+%5b%22Land%22%5d&rarity=+%5bR%5d&set=+%5b%22Eventide%22%5d&text=+!%5bgoat%5d)

And *Eventide* had the enemy cycle. It too would be reprinted in *Zendikar Expeditions*.


[**The Ally Check Lands—*Magic 2010***](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&type=+%5b%22Land%22%5d&rarity=+%5bR%5d&text=+!%5bgoat%5d+!%5bgargoyle%5d&set=+%5b%22Magic+2010%22%5d)


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&multiverseid=190562)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=190562)[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&multiverseid=191091)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=191091)[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&multiverseid=191100)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=191100)
*Magic 2010* was the first core set (outside of *Alpha*/*Beta*) to create new cards, among them a new ally dual-land cycle. This cycle enters the battlefield tapped unless you control one of the two basic lands connected to the land's colors. This land cycle appeared in all the core sets from *Magic 2010* through *Magic 2013*.


[**The Enemy Fetch Lands—*Zendikar***](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&type=+%5b%22Land%22%5d&rarity=+%5bR%5d&text=+!%5bgoat%5d+!%5bgargoyle%5d+%5bpay%5d&set=+%5b%22Zendikar%22%5d)


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&multiverseid=190393)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=190393)[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&multiverseid=193400)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=193400) [![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&multiverseid=177584)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=177584)
We finally get to today's preview cards. We had done the ally fetch lands in *Onslaught*, and it was finally time for the enemy fetch lands to get a turn. These lands, like the ally fetch lands, were very popular and were reprinted in *Zendikar Expeditions* and *Modern Masters 2017 Edition*.


[**The Ally Refuge Lands—*Zendikar***](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&type=+%5b%22Land%22%5d&text=+!%5bgoat%5d+!%5bgargoyle%5d&set=+%5b%22Zendikar%22%5d&rarity=+%5bU%5d)


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&multiverseid=189627)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=189627)[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&multiverseid=189638)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=189638)[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&multiverseid=423543)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=423543)
We wanted a cycle of uncommon dual lands. Tap lands had proven to be a little weak, so we were looking for a bonus to add to them, and gaining life was both simple and useful. This cycle gets reprinted often in supplemental sets, and returned in *Khans of Tarkir* with new names.


[**The Ally Creature Lands—*Worldwake***](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&type=+%5b%22Land%22%5d&text=+!%5bgoat%5d+!%5bgargoyle%5d+!%5beldrazi%5d&set=+%5b%22Worldwake%22%5d&rarity=+%5bR%5d)


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&multiverseid=177545)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=177545)[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&multiverseid=177520)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=177520) [![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&multiverseid=177583)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=177583)
This cycle was a riff on a popular monocolor land cycle from *Urza's Legacy* ([Treetop Village](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treetop+Village) being the most famous member) where each land tapped for a particular color and then had an activation including that color to turn into a creature until end of turn. The design in *Worldwake* was to make an ally dual-land version of that cycle.


[**The Ally Fast Lands—*Scars of Mirrodin***](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&type=+%5b%22Land%22%5d&text=+!%5bgoat%5d+!%5bgargoyle%5d+!%5beldrazi%5d&set=+%5b%22Scars+of+Mirrodin%22%5d&rarity=+%5bR%5d)


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&multiverseid=209399)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=209399)[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&multiverseid=209401)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=209401)[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&multiverseid=209408)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=209408)
Normally, the trouble with enters-the-battlefield-tapped dual lands is they aren't good in aggressive decks. This cycle tried to correct this problem by allowing them to enter the battlefield untapped as long as it was the first, second, or third land you had played. We knew that dual lands with an enters-the-battlefield-tapped restriction got a little bonus, so why not the bonus of not having the restriction situationally? This cycle has yet to be reprinted.


[**The Enemy Check Lands—*Innistrad***](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&type=+%5b%22Land%22%5d&text=+!%5bgoat%5d+!%5bgargoyle%5d+!%5beldrazi%5d+%5bunless%5d&rarity=+%5bR%5d&set=+%5b%22Innistrad%22%5d)


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&multiverseid=241979)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=241979)[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&multiverseid=241980)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=241980)[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&multiverseid=241988)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=241988)
This is the enemy version of the check lands from *Magic 2010*. Normally, the dual lands are chosen by the development team and the design team just puts in whatever the development team tells them. I was a little hesitant to put in the enemy check lands in the set, as *Innistrad* was focused on ally tribes and the rare dual-land cycle was an odd fit, but sometimes you include things for the greater environment and not just your set. This cycle has yet to be reprinted.


[**The Guildgates—*Return to Ravnica*/*Gatecrash***](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&type=+%5b%22Land%22%5d&text=+!%5bgoat%5d+!%5bgargoyle%5d+!%5beldrazi%5d&subtype=+%5b%22Gate%22%5d)


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&multiverseid=366374)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=366374)[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&multiverseid=270961)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=270961)[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&multiverseid=270964)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=270964)
We needed a common dual-land cycle, so we started looking for small bonuses we could give to a Tap Land. After much searching, we finally decided to try something a little more parasitic. We made them subtype "Gate" (the idea of Guildgates had come from worldbuilding) and then we designed a handful of cards that mechanically cared about Gates. The Guildgates would all get reprinted in *Dragon's Maze*, the final set in the block.


[**The Scry Lands—*Theros/Born of the Gods/Journey into Nyx***](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&type=+%5b%22Land%22%5d&text=+!%5bgoat%5d+!%5bgargoyle%5d+!%5beldrazi%5d&rarity=+%5bR%5d&name=+%5btemple%5d&block=+%5b%22Theros%22%5d)


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&multiverseid=373734)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=373734)[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&multiverseid=380514)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=380514)[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&multiverseid=373571)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=373571)
Erik Lauer had wanted to make a dual-land cycle with scry for a while, so when development added scry to *Theros* (this was before scry became evergreen), Erik realized he finally had his chance. The lands in this cycle are basically tap lands with the added bonus that you get to scry 1. The ten-card cycle was a bit quirky in that it was put out slowly during the course of the whole *Theros* block, with five lands in *Theros*, three in *Born of the Gods*, and two in *Journey into Nyx*. The cycle was given a temple creative to match the scry flavor. This cycle has yet to be reprinted, but with scry now evergreen, I think its chance are high.


[**The Ally and Enemy Refuge Lands—*Khans of Tarkir***](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&type=+%5b%22Land%22%5d+!%5b%22Basic%22%5d&text=+!%5bgoat%5d+!%5bgargoyle%5d+!%5beldrazi%5d&set=+%5b%22Khans+of+Tarkir%22%5d&rarity=+%5bC%5d)

This ten-card cycle is the five ally Refuge lands from *Zendikar* with new plane-neutral names along with a cycle of enemy Refuges printed for the first time. This cycle will see a lot of reprinting in supplemental sets. The cycle was also reprinted in *Fate Reforged*.


[**The Ally Battle Lands—*Battle for Zendikar***](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&type=+%5b%22Land%22%5d&text=+!%5bgoat%5d+!%5bgargoyle%5d+!%5beldrazi%5d+!%5bcreature%5d+!%5bcast%5d&rarity=+%5bR%5d&set=+%5b%22Battle+for+Zendikar%22%5d)


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&multiverseid=402051)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=402051)[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&multiverseid=401841)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=401841)[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&multiverseid=401837)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=401837)
This ally cycle of dual lands is kind of the opposite of the fast lands. This cycle enters the battlefield tapped unless you control two or more basic lands. The basic land rider is to keep players from playing too many versions of this cycle in the same deck. This cycle is also the third dual-land cycle (along with the original dual lands and the shock lands) to have both basic land types on them. This was done to make them synergistic with the fetch lands that had been reprinted in *Khans of Tarkir* block.


[**The Enemy Creature Lands—*Battle for Zendikar*/*Oath of the Gatewatch***](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&type=+%5b%22Land%22%5d&text=+!%5bgoat%5d+!%5bgargoyle%5d+!%5beldrazi%5d+!%5bcast%5d+%5bbecomes%5d&rarity=+%5bR%5d&block=+%5b%22Battle+for+Zendikar%22%5d)


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&multiverseid=402031)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=402031)[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&multiverseid=407692)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=407692)[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&multiverseid=407681)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=407681)
For the return to Zendikar, we made the companion enemy creature lands to match the ally creature lands that appeared in *Worldwake*. This five-card cycle was stretched out over the block with two cards appearing in *Battle for Zendikar* and three appearing in *Oath of the Gatewatch*.


[**The Simple Ally Tap Lands—*Oath of the Gatewatch***](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&type=+%5b%22Land%22%5d&text=+!%5bgoat%5d+!%5bgargoyle%5d+!%5beldrazi%5d&set=+%5b%22Oath+of+the+Gatewatch%22%5d&rarity=+%5bU%5d)

We decided that we wanted our introductory products to have access to the simplest version of dual lands possible, so we remade the tap lands with no upside and nice clean names we could use in any setting. The ally versions were put into *Oath of the Gatewatch*.


[**The Simple Enemy Tap Lands—*Shadows over Innistrad***](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&type=+%5b%22Land%22%5d&text=+!%5bgoat%5d+!%5bgargoyle%5d+!%5beldrazi%5d&rarity=+%5bU%5d&set=+%5b%22Shadows+over+Innistrad%22%5d)

And the enemy versions were put into *Shadows over Innistrad*.


[**The Ally Reveal Lands—*Shadows over Innistrad***](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&type=+%5b%22Land%22%5d&text=+!%5bgoat%5d+!%5bgargoyle%5d+!%5beldrazi%5d+%5breveal%5d&set=+%5b%22Shadows+over+Innistrad%22%5d&rarity=+%5bR%5d)

This is a different take on the fast lands. In this version, the land enters the battlefield tapped unless you reveal one of the two affiliated basic lands from your hand.


[**The Enemy Fast lands—*Kaladesh***](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&type=+%5b%22Land%22%5d&text=+!%5bgoat%5d+!%5bgargoyle%5d+!%5beldrazi%5d&rarity=+%5bR%5d&set=+%5b%22Kaladesh%22%5d&name=+!%5bfair%5d)

*Kaladesh* introduced the enemy versions of the ally fast lands from *Scars of Mirrodin*. This is a cycle that players had been asking us to complete for many years.


The Dual Is Over
================


And that, my faithful readers, is every dual land we've ever printed . . . so far. I hope you enjoyed this jaunt through history and look forward to the enemy fetches returning in *Modern Masters 2017 Edition*. As always, I'm interested to hear your feedback on today's column. Do you all like history columns, and would you like to see more or would you rather see fewer? You can [email me](mailto:making.magic@hotmail.com) or contact me through any of my social media accounts ([Twitter](https://twitter.com/maro254), [Tumblr](http://markrosewater.tumblr.com/), [Google+](https://plus.google.com/107824009487778543249), and [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/mtgmaro/)) to let me know your thoughts.


Join me next week as I share some card-by-card stories from long ago (and some maybe not so long ago).


Until then, may you learn to love *Magic*'s history as much as I do.
