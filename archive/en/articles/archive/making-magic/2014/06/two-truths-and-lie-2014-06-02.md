 Working in R&D since '95, Mark became Magic head designer in '03. His hobbies: spending time with family, writing about Magic in all mediums, and creating short bios. 





On most nights, my family sits down to a home-cooked dinner. We each quickly recap our day and then, if there is time left over, we will often play a game. My kids all enjoy games but my youngest, Sarah, is the most passionate about what she calls dinner games. She bought books and has searched the Internet for more games to play during dinner. Last week, she explained that she had a new game called "Two Truths and a Lie." It was very cute because she believed she had come across a brand-new game, not realizing that the game is probably older than both her parents.


For those who have never played "Two Truths and a Lie," the game is pretty much explained in its title. One person comes up with three "facts" about him- or herself. Two are truths and one is a lie. The group tries to figure out which one the lie is. It dawned on me when Sarah brought up the game that it would actually make for a fun article, so here's what we're going to do today. We're going to play "Two Truths and a Lie," and you all can see how much you know about **Magic**.

For each round, I will print three "facts" about **Magic** and you will have to deduce which one is the lie. I will then reveal the answer and explain the details behind each one. Pretty simple. Okay, ready to play?


### Round 1


This first round is going to be about *Journey into Nyx*.



> **Fact #1:** The *Journey into Nyx* design team spent time trying to make an enchantment land.

Figure out which one is the lie. When you have your answer, [click here](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/mm/302&page=2).
