Two players were disqualified from the main event here at Grand Prix Auckland yesterday.


James Fazzolari was disqualified in Round 4 for Unsporting Conduct – Cheating. In the past this particular infraction would have been described as “Manipulation of Game Materials.”


Greg Quinn was also disqualified in Round 5 for Unsporting Conduct – Cheating. In this case, it would come under Fraud – hiding an infraction, or to quote the Magic: The Gathering Infraction Procedure Guidelines – “...notices an offense committed in his or her (or a teammate's) match and does not call attention to it.”
