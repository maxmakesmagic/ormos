Hello, everyone!


*Innistrad: Midnight Hunt* brings with it some frightening new rules changes and transformations. Well, maybe not that frightening, but rules about frightening mechanics, at any rate. In addition to detailing how disturb, decayed, daybound/nightbound, and the day and night game designations work, there are a few other minor updates to older rules as well. There is also one minor change to the Oracle text of a *Magic* card. This document was written while the rules changes and Oracle changes were still under review, so it's possible they'll be a little different from the final changes. When they're finalized, you'll be able to see them on the [rules page](https://magic.wizards.com/en/game-info/gameplay/rules-and-formats/rules) and [Gatherer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=508148).


Alrightâ€”let's dive in!
