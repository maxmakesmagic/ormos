As everyone is gearing up for [*Khans of Tarkir* Prereleases](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/feature/khans-tarkir-prerelease-primer-2014-09-15), taking place this weekend, the number of tournaments that are streaming this coming weekend is a little lighter than usual. Hey, content creators and video producers want to play with the new set too!


Aside from the usual tournaments, however, there are still some matches you can watch from last weekend that may actually get you primed and ready for your Prerelease.

The 2014 [*Magic Online* Community Cup](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/occ14) took place last weekend, and after the Community Team finished, achieving a very close victory over Team Wizards (CURSE THEM!!!), the team got a chance to enjoy a new perk for this event: a chance to play with the upcoming *Magic* set a week before anyone else!


Watch the eight Community Team members build their *Khans of Tarkir* Prerelease decks, then see how it plays out as the eight battle in a single-elimination event to see which Community Team member—and clan—will emerge at the top going into the Prerelease!


You can catch all video from Sunday's Pre-Prerelease below.

Last week, Community Team member and *Spellslingers* host Sean "Day[9]" Plott took on Joshua Ovenshire of Smosh Games in a royal rumble between YouTube video game superstars….


…and this week, the Gag Reel for that episode is now available for your viewing pleasure. Among other things, Sean really struggles with saying that Joshua is equipping his rhino.


Yep.


We're just going to leave it at that, and let the Gag Reel speak for itself.


You can catch all the outtakes below.

And finally, lined up for Tuesday, September 23, is Week 5 of the Vintage Super League, hosted by Pro Tour Hall of Famer Randy Buehler!


Week 5 features some marquee matches, including longtime rivals Rich Shay and Steven Menendian. Shay tries to hand Menendian his first loss of the season in a rematch of the 2007 Vintage World Championship. Josh Utter-Leyton will also square off against longtime friend and teammate, Hall of Famer Luis Scott-Vargas. The ten players are moving into their second week with new decks that cover a wide span of what is possible in Vintage: two storm combo decks, two different [Mishra's Workshop](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mishra%27s+Workshop) decks, three different control decks, a [Delver of Secrets](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Delver+of+Secrets) deck, and Dredge.


Meanwhile, the Vintage Super League now has a website! You can visit [VintageSuperLeague.com](http://www.vintagesuperleague.com) for league standings, details, text coverage, and links to decklists as well as archives of previous shows.


All the action of Week 5 for the Vintage Super League begins on [Twitch.TV/Magic](http://www.twitch.tv/magic) at 7 p.m. PT/2 a.m. GMT.
