Although you may think of Gen Con as primarily a role-playing convention, the **Magic** cards were flying fast and furious all weekend. From crowning *Time Spiral* Block, Legacy, and Vintage champions to a 112-person Grand Melee to PTQs to Extended tournaments, players were slinging cards 24 hours a day in the Trading Card Games hall, and [we were on site to take in all in](http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=welcome/conventions/gencon07).


Here are a few of the highlights:

### Legacy Championship


Now that it has been announced as a format for the 2007 World Championships, a few more eyes than normal were focused on the Legacy Championship this year. Canada represented, putting Peter Olszewski and Ryan Trepanier into the finals. Peter, playing a popular Threshold build, took down Ryan's 42Land specialty.

### Vintage Championship


The man behind Team Meandeck backed up his words by taking home the title. It was a Groatog vs. Groatog final, with Steve Menendian defeating Richard Shay to earn the title "Vintage Champion."

### Time Spiral Block Championship


Now here's a sexy prize for you: a complete foil playset of *Time Spiral* block. Yup, four of each and every card, including the Timeshifted cards. And the skilled player who took home the set? None other than Sam Black, playing a blue-black splash green-red Mystical Teachings deck.
