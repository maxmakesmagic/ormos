Grand Prix Brisbane has the crown for largest constructed event in Australia, what will Melbourne be able to deliver? 

The event takes place on February 28-March 2, just after the Australian Tennis Open and just before the Australian Formula 1 Grand Prix. Both of these events share the same location as Grand Prix Melbourne, Melbourne Park. When the lights go out, who will be crowned Grand Prix Melbourne Champion?

The format of the main event is Standard, and with an enormous side event program, this will be a GP weekend not to be missed. The main event features $35,000 USD in prize money and Pro Tour invites, while the side events schedule is packed with something for everyone. Grand Prix Melbourne also features the launch of the Australian Super Star! This is a special series of event for Eternal players—there is one Eternal event each day, and the person who amasses the most points at the end of the weekend takes out the title and the trophy. 

Artists Adam Paquette and Chris Rahn will be gracing us with their presence signing cards. Five amazing vendors from all over Australia will be on site to buy, sell and trade cards with you. There really is something for everyone at Grand Prix Melbourne! Be part of history—we'll see you there.

The first 350 players registered or checked in (if preregistered) on the Friday will receive a Grand Prix Melbourne playmat.

* [Standard Constructed](http://www.wizards.com/Magic/TCG/Resources.aspx?x=judge/resources/sfrstandard)
* Deck lists are required.
* Players must use the same deck on Day Two that they used on Day One.


**Tournament Structure** 


* Modified Swiss-style (50-minute rounds).
* Day One will consist of a maximum of 9 Swiss rounds. Day Two will consist of 6 Swiss rounds and the Top 8 single-elimination finals.
* If 799 or less players register for the event, all players with an X-2-0 record (or better) or the top 64 players – whichever is greater – advance to the second day of competition for prizes and invitations.
* If 800 or more players register for the event, all players with an X-2-0 record (or better) or the top 128 players – whichever is greater – advance to the second day of competition for prizes and invitations.
* The Top 8 players after the final Swiss round on Day Two will advance to the Top 8 single-elimination finals.
* Top 8 matches will be best 2 of 3.
* Top 8 matches will have no time limit. (Players are still expected to play at a normal pace and complete playoff matches in a reasonable amount of time.)
* Standings after the Swiss rounds will be used to determine final order in the standings for losing players in the quarterfinal and semifinal playoff rounds.
* For the first game of each match in the Top 8, the player that finished higher in the Swiss rounds chooses either to play first or to play second. For subsequent games in each Top 8 match, the usual Play/Draw rule applies (loser of the previous game decides whether to play first in the next game).


**Judges**
  
 The Head Judge of this event is Chris Richter (Level 4), and he will be flanked by an all-star cast of great judges. For more information about judging, please [click here](http://apps.magicjudges.org/events/754/).
