Some eyes were on the thirteen year old New Zealand National Champion coming into Worlds, but the novelty interest of a young National Champion has turned into serious surprise, as Swannack went 5-1 in today's Standard portion, beating accomplished Pro Tour players such as Gary Wise and Albertus Law. While it's still a bit early to jump to conclusions, the buzz around the venue today is that Cole would look great as a World Champion on the cover of Sideboard Magazine. Gary Wise even told Cole as he extended his hand in defeat, "You're going to make a great World Champion." I sat down with Cole after the first day of competition had ended to see what he thought about his impressive showing, and his chances for the rest of the tournament.

**Sideboard:** How long have you been playing?  
**Swannack:** I've been playing for about four years, and started playing when I was eight.

**Sideboard:** Why do you like Magic?  
**Swannack:** It's quick and a big game. There's a lot of thinking involved.

**Sideboard:** Is there a specific kind of deck you prefer to play?  
**Swannack:** I like beatdown. I'd rather play beatdown than control, but I like decks with creatures and counterspells.

**Sideboard:** So that's like what you're playing today.  
**Swannack:** Pretty much.

**Sideboard:** Do you have any other hobbies besides Magic?  
**Swannack:** Yeah, I play Basketball, and...Magic Online!

**Sideboard:** Like everyone else!  
**Swannack:** Right. And I play lots of sports.

**Sideboard:** How does it feel to be a National Champion?  
**Swannack:** Pretty good. It's not much being New Zealand...

**Sideboard:** Well you got to carry the flag!  
**Swannack:** That's good, yeah.

**Sideboard:** Do you think you're ready to hang with the big boys like Kai and Finkel even though you're only thirteen?  
**Swannack:** Nah, not them.

**Sideboard:** Well you're 5-1, you might have to tomorrow.  
**Swannack:** (Laughs) Yeah, it's not bad. 

**Sideboard:** I hear that two years ago when the Invitational was here, you were there and you were watching every single match. Did you learn anything?  
**Swannack:** Yeah, I was learning style of play, and just little things, little tips of what they were doing while they were playing. Not so much how they played it.

**Sideboard:** So you mean how they were acting physically to show what they were thinking?  
**Swannack:** Right.

**Sideboard:** Anyone specific you admired while watching them play?  
**Swannack:** No, not really. Just little things. I wasn't very good at that stage.

**Sideboard:** How does it feel to be getting so much attention? You had a huge crowd cheering you on against Gary Wise.   
**Swannack:** That's not bad! I'd prefer not, it's less pressure that way.

**Swannack:** I don't really look at them. I don't really concentrate on the player I'm up against; I just concentrate on the game.

**Sideboard:** By the same token, some people might see a thirteen year old and underestimate you.  
**Swannack:** It's better in draft where they don't know if you're taking the signals and things like that, but a lot of people have heard about me now, so...

**Sideboard:** Worlds is pretty close to home for you, isn't it?  
**Swannack:** It's a lot better. I don't get jetlagged, and I prefer a three hour flight to a fifteen hour flight.

**Sideboard:** Why did you decide to play the green/blue deck today?  
**Swannack:** Just because it's basic and it beats Psychatog. That was the deck I was trying to beat, and it turned out pretty well. 

**Sideboard:** How do your parents feel about this?  
**Swannack:** They're happy. They like traveling. Mom shops and Dad sees his friends.

**Sideboard:** And if you do well, you'll be on the Pro Tour and they'll be able to travel all over with you.  
**Swannack:** Hang on, that hasn't happened yet! Wait until that happens!

**Sideboard:** Do you feel any pressure now that people are saying you're going to win the whole thing? After you beat Gary, he extended his hand and said "You're going to make a great World Champion." Do you feel any extra pressure now that some people are actually expecting you to make Top 8?   
**Swannack:** No, I'm not really bothered. I still I don't have high expectations, because other people aren't expecting me to do well. This is my first Pro Tour, so...

**Sideboard:** Well, then do you feel any added pressure personally?  
**Swannack:** The pressure doesn't really get to me.

**Sideboard:** Any predictions?  
**Swannack:** Anything can happen.
