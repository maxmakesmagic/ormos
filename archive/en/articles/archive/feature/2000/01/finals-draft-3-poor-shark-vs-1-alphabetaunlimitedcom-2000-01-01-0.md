Williams opened the first pack, which gave him a [Recoil](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Recoil) and Benafel a [Zap](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Zap). Kuroda got a Wax/Wane, Otsuka got a [Strength of Unity](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Strength+of+Unity), and Morita got a [Benalish Lancer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Benalish+Lancer).


The second pack emphasized Benafel's red start with a [Shivan Emissary](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shivan+Emissary), with Kuroda going Green and Otsuka staying in the red-black zone she's inhabited for much of the day.


Kuroda's pack provided him with a [Charging Troll](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Charging+Troll), cementing him in green-white. Otsuka took the [Tribal Flames](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tribal+Flames), and Morita the [Benalish Trapper](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Benalish+Trapper). Otsuka's pack gave her even more removal in the form of [Exotic Curse](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Exotic+Curse), while Morita took a [Goham Djinn](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goham+Djinn), getting a [Tsabo's Decree](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tsabo%27s+Decree) in the next pack, which also held and Assault/Battery and an [Agonizing Demise](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Agonizing+Demise) (which went to Fuller and Benafel, respectively).


The players in black-red (Benafel and Otsuka) continued to get plenty of quality removal, including an [Urza's Rage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Urza%27s+Rage) (Benafel) and another [Agonizing Demise](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Agonizing+Demise) (Otsuka). Otsuka also got a [Scorching Lava](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scorching+Lava) and both players got [Plague Spores](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plague+Spores).


In *Planeshift*, there was so much removal that Poor Shark decided to give [Tahngarth, Talruum Hero](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tahngarth%2C+Talruum+Hero) to Kuroda, while Otsuka took [Bog Down](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bog+Down). Toward the end, AlphaBetaUnlimited.com started arguing about picks, with Ryan Fuller taking cards that Benafel clearly thought were distinctly suboptimal.
