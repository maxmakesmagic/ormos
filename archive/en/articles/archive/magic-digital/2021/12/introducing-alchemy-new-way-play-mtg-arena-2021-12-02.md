Introducing Alchemy
===================


![Alchemy logo](https://media.wizards.com/2021/images/daily/urj5kf9j5pz5.jpg)


Alchemy is our new *MTG Arena* play mode based on the Standard format that incorporates new-to-digital *Magic* alongside rebalanced Standard cards to create a fast, ever-evolving experience for our players.


* **An Ever-Evolving Play Mode**  

 Build decks with Standard cards, new-to-digital cards, and rebalanced cards in a new *MTG Arena* play mode that evolves as fast as our players.
* **New-to-Digital Cards**  

 Alchemy will launch with 63 new-to-digital *Magic* cards featuring mechanics designed specifically for digital play, and players can expect more new cards alongside every Standard set release.
* **Rebalanced *Magic* Cards**  

 Alchemy features rebalanced versions of existing Standard cards to shake up the meta for digital play. Players can expect these regular changes to the format to create a dynamic play experience between Standard set releases.

For more information on the creation and development of Alchemy, check out the [December State of the Game](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/magic-digital/mtg-arena-state-game-alchemy-2021-12-02).

* 1 Alchemy mythic rare ICR

Alchemy FAQ
===========


**When will Alchemy launch?**


Alchemy will launch with our December Game Update, currently scheduled for December 9, 2021.


**Where can I see the new-to-digital *Magic* cards?**


We will be previewing more of the new-to-digital *Magic* cards in the upcoming days, and cards will be available for viewing in the [*Alchemy: Innistrad* Card Image Gallery](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/card-image-gallery/alchemy-innistrad).


**Where can I see the rebalanced cards?**


You can check out the December 2 [Weekly MTG livestream](https://www.twitch.tv/magic) to preview all the upcoming planned balance changes. These cards will also be available for viewing in our [*Alchemy: Innistrad* Card Image Gallery](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/card-image-gallery/alchemy-innistrad).


**How do I play Alchemy?**


Like Historic, Alchemy will be a new digital-only format playable on *MTG Arena*. You will be able to play Alchemy in Best-of-One and Best-of-Three matches, both ranked and unranked.


Alchemy will also feature in upcoming special events, such as Midweek *Magic*, Festivals, etc.


**How much do Alchemy boosters cost?**


Players will be able to purchase Alchemy boosters either individually for 1,000 gold or fifteen for 3,000 gems—the same price as Standard set boosters.


A special Alchemy bundle containing 20 Alchemy boosters will be available for 3,000 gems or 15,000 gold—limit one purchase per player.


**How do I collect Alchemy cards?**


Players can purchase Alchemy boosters from the store or craft Alchemy cards using wildcards of the appropriate rarity to receive the new-to-digital *Magic* cards. Players can collect rebalanced Alchemy cards in both Alchemy and the adjacent Standard set boosters:


* Alchemy boosters will contain the new-to-digital *Magic* cards, rebalanced cards, and cards from the adjacent Standard set (i.e., *Innistrad: Crimson Vow*).
* When you receive a rebalanced card from an Alchemy booster, you will also receive the Standard version of the card.
* The same is true when opening a Standard booster that contains a card that has been rebalanced for Alchemy—you will receive ***both*** versions of the card.

#### **How do I tell if a card is the rebalanced Alchemy version or the Standard version?**


Alchemy versions of rebalanced Standard cards will contain the *MTG Arena* "A" in-line with the card name. They will also have the *MTG Arena* "A" as a "foil stamp" at the bottom of the card.

**What if I've already collected cards that have been rebalanced for play in Alchemy?**


Players who have already collected cards that will have an Alchemy version should automatically see both in their collection when Alchemy releases; you will not need to "re-collect" these cards. This will also apply to future Alchemy balance changes.


**How does duplicate protection work with Alchemy boosters?**


Alchemy boosters will use a modified version of duplicate protection.


* When opening an Alchemy booster, it will prioritize the new-to-digital *Magic* cards created for the current Alchemy set.
* If you've collected playsets of all the new Alchemy cards from the current set, you will instead receive cards of the same rarity from the adjacent Standard set (i.e., *Innistrad: Crimson Vow*).
* If you are "set complete" for both Alchemy and the adjacent Standard set, normal duplicate protection rules apply.

As a reminder, when you craft or open a booster containing a card rebalanced for Alchemy, you will receive both the Standard and the Alchemy version of the set; you will not need to collect them separately.


**How often should we expect balance changes or new cards for Alchemy play?**


We currently plan to release new Alchemy sets in the weeks following the adjacent Standard release. For example, players should expect the Alchemy set for *Kamigawa: Neon Dynasty* to become available sometime in March.


We intend to rebalance cards on a more frequent basis to keep the format fun, fast, and dynamic.


**I still have questions!**


We'd be happy to answer them! You can reach out to us at [@MTG\_Arena](https://twitter.com/MTG_Arena) using the hashtag #MTGAlchemy, and we'll include any additional questions and answers in next week's blog.
