As part of the [Fantasy Pro Tour](http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=sideboard/fantasypt) prizes awarded by the [Sideboard Online](/en/articles/archive/event-coverage/3rd4th-place-playoff-rob-nadebaum-vs-daniel-clifton-2015-07-22), winners receive one of these spiffy Sideboard deck boxes.

The box features card art from [Hammer of Bogardan](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hammer+of+Bogardan), [Morphling](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Morphling), [Cursed Scroll](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cursed+Scroll), and [Shadowmage Infiltrator](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shadowmage+Infiltrator), and the texture of the box very subtly contains all the mana symbols from *Arabian Nights* to *Apocalypse*. (So subtly that you can't see it in this picture.)

The fine print on the bottom of the box refers to [Shadowmage Infiltrator](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shadowmage+Infiltrator) as "Shadowmage of Leknif." The deck box was designed while *Odyssey* was still in development and the card names were not yet finalized.

Make sure to enter the next Fantasy Pro Tour for your chance to get one of these!
