### Play the Game, See the World


Wondering about life on the Pro Tour? Watch as some of the game's best players from past and present talk about the role the Pro Tour has played in their lives. [Download now!](http://webcast.wizards.com/ptq_commercial/ptq_promo.wmv.zip) (26.1 MB zip WMP)

Situated on the island of Oahu, Honolulu is the capital of Hawaii. The most populated of Hawaii's six major islands, Oahu offers amazing beaches for surfing and sunbathing. The volcanic Diamond Head provides a majestic backdrop to Waikiki a few miles outside of downtown Honolulu. The Pro Tour visits Honolulu on March 3-5, when the average temperature is 74° F (23° C).


Pro Tour-Honolulu is a Standard format event with a last-chance qualifier run the day before the event starts. But you don't have to be a Pro to enjoy the Pro Tour -- there will be wall-to-wall Magic to play in Side Events all weekend, with prizes including an iPod, a helicopter tour of Oahu, and qualification plus an airplane ticket to Pro Tour-Prague (prizes may vary).
