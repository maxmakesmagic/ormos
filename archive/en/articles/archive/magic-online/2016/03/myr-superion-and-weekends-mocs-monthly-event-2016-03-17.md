As you may know, there is currently a bug with [Myr Superion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Myr+Superion) that ignores its mana restriction. While we have a fix scheduled for the March 23 downtime, there is the [MOCS Monthly Event](http://magic.wizards.com/en/content/2016-magic-online-championship-series#MonthlyEvents) on Saturday and other events between now and then.


Please note that we expect all players to help ensure fair gameplay by not intentionally playing a card known to be bugged to gain an unfair advantage in or alter the outcome of a match. Players who are found to be taking advantage of cards in this manner may have administrative action taken against their account.


For the MOCS Monthly event this weekend, if you believe your opponent is abusing this or any other card bug, please notify the Digital Event Coordinator who is supporting the event. For other events, please contact [Game Support](http://wizards.custhelp.com/).


Thank you for your cooperation. Good luck and have fun!
