Grand Prix Kobe has been postponed following Friday’s magnitude 9.0 earthquake and resulting tsunami in Japan. Originally to be held March 19-20, the Grand Prix will be rescheduled at a later date.

Due to significant safety, power, and travel concerns across the eastern portion of the country as well as a national call to conserve resources, Wizards of the Coast believes it is not appropriate to continue with the event as planned. We extend our thoughts and sympathies to all those affected by the disaster. 

**Magic**  Weekend Nagoya remains scheduled for June 11-13, 2011 in Nagoya, Japan. At this time Wizards of the Coast has no plans to postpone or cancel **Magic**  Weekend Nagoya. If this changes, we will communicate this through our normal announcement channels.
