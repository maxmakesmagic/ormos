Before we turn toward *Magic Origins* when previews start next week, we wanted to take one last look back at Modern Masters Weekendâ€”the biggest celebration of *Magic* ever, held around the world.


From Chiba to Las Vegas to Utrecht, the weekend produced memorable stories, fun moments, exciting games and drafts, and memories that more than 15,000 players will take with them for a long time.


Let's start by taking a short look back at the weekend as a whole.
