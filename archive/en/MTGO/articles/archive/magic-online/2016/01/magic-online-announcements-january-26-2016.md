**Important Changes Coming with *Oath of the Gatewatch* on January 27**


To support the *Oath of the Gatewatch* release, *Magic Online* had to make some changes to the entire system that governs paying mana costs (watch for Alli Medwin’s R&D article tomorrow). As a result, there are two major changes players need to be aware of.


First, adding mana to the mana pool prior to selecting a spell to cast or activating an ability will require players to manually select the mana in the mana pool to fulfill generic mana requirements, as this mana will no longer be auto-consumed as players might be used to. While we hope to improve this process with a future update, players can avoid the extra clicks this change causes by selecting the spell or ability first and then tapping their lands to pay the mana cost. Animations showing what these changes will look like, alongside step-by-step directions, can be found below.


Second, this change affects the accuracy of all replays captured prior to the change. Since they will no longer be accurate, all replays will be permanently deleted during the downtime. Players who have replays they want to view should make sure to do so prior to the downtime or use another method, such as screen capture software, to record games they wish to save.


**Tapping for mana, then casting a spell:**


* The player taps for two red and one blue mana.
* With that mana floating, the player casts [Wee Dragonauts](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wee+Dragonauts).
* The red floating mana must then be selected to designate that it's paying the generic mana required to cast [Wee Dragonauts](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wee+Dragonauts).

![](https://media.wizards.com/2015/mtgo/mana_then_cast.gif)
**Casting a spell, then tapping for mana:**


* The player selects a spell they would like to cast, [Wee Dragonauts](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wee+Dragonauts).
* Using any combination of lands, the player then generates enough mana to cast [Wee Dragonauts](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wee+Dragonauts). In this example, the player taps one Island and two Mountains.
* Mana is automatically consumed and [Wee Dragonauts](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wee+Dragonauts) is cast.

***Oath of the Gatewatch* Release Known Issues**


***Oath of the Gatewatch* Cards**


* Cardset | [Stone Haven Outfitter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stone+Haven+Outfitter)’s triggered ability incorrectly triggers when a creature is destroyed if an Equipment had previously been destroyed while equipping that creature.
* Cardset | Players are incorrectly unable to undo [Kozilek's Translator](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kozilek%27s+Translator)‘s activated ability.
* Cardset | When a player casts [Kozilek, the Great Distortion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kozilek%2C+the+Great+Distortion), its triggered ability incorrectly triggers if the casting player has seven or more cards in hand. Upon resolution, the player will not draw cards if he or she already has seven or more cards in hand.
* Cardset | If a player controls multiple [Endbringer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Endbringer)s, only one will untap during other players’ untap steps as intended.
* Cardset | In certain circumstances, [Chandra, Flamecaller](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chandra%2C+Flamecaller) incorrectly exiles creature tokens created by [Kalitas, Traitor of Ghet](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kalitas%2C+Traitor+of+Ghet).
* Cardset | Cards that ask players to choose a basic land type incorrectly include the option to choose Wastes. If a player attempts to choose Wastes, he or she will be asked to choose a basic land type again. Wastes are basic lands, but are not a basic land type.
* Cardset | Several prompt boxes are incorrect or uninformative. Affected cards include [Kalitas, Traitor of Ghet](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kalitas%2C+Traitor+of+Ghet), [Harvester Troll](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Harvester+Troll), and [Devour in Flames](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Devour+in+Flames).

**Gameplay**


* Cardset | Cards with the “may additionally reveal a dragon” condition do not correctly trigger the additional effect when a dragon is revealed from hand.
* Cardset | [Crumble to Dust](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crumble+to+Dust) incorrectly causes the player to search the library of the land’s controller, not owner.
* Cardset | [Fireball](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fireball) lacks visual indicators during targeting to show whether or not it is targeting a player.
* Cardset | [Harbinger of the Tides](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Harbinger+of+the+Tides)’s casting options are displayed incorrectly. Players can still pay Harbinger of the Tides’s alternative casting cost by selecting the lower “Cast” option from the menu that appears when the card is clicked.
* Cardset | [Mass Polymorph](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mass+Polymorph) incorrectly does not count exiled creature tokens when determining how many creature cards to put onto the battlefield.
* Cardset | Some spells that return multiple permanents from different zones to a player’s hand (such as [Rise // Fall](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rise+%2F%2F+Fall)) only return one permanent. Notably, this does not affect any cards in *Battle for Zendikar* or *Oath of the Gatewatch*.
* Cardset | Spells that require a specific color of mana to be spent (such as [Drain Life](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Drain+Life)) incorrectly allow any color of mana to be spent.
* Cardset | The additional cost ability of [Chorus of the Conclave](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chorus+of+the+Conclave) does not function.
* Cardset | When a user destroys [Auratouched Mage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Auratouched+Mage) before its triggered ability finishes resolving, a facedown card will be added to the owner's hand.
* Duel Scene | Emblems display with an extra border.
* Duel Scene | If a player controls multiple planeswalkers and is dealt noncombat damage, incorrect prompt box text will be displayed when the player is asked to apply the planeswalker damage redirection effects. This is a display issue only.
* Duel Scene | Mana abilities of permanents that do not include a tap symbol still appear to cause the permanent to tap. This is a display issue only, and is corrected when the game advances to the next step or phase.
* Duel Scene | The “No Possible Play: Yield All” function, commonly mapped to the F8 keyboard shortcut, no longer works as intended.
* Duel Scene | When casting with Convoke, creatures used for the ability have a green highlight for some turns after casting the spell.

**Build Notes**


To support the *Oath of the Gatewatch* release, *Magic Online* had to make some changes to the entire system that governs paying mana costs. Please read Alli Medwin’s January 27 R&D article on [DailyMTG](http://magic.wizards.com/en/content/articles) for more details.


Due to these changes, adding mana to the mana pool prior to selecting a spell to cast or activating an ability will require players to manually select the mana in the mana pool to fulfill generic mana requirements, as this mana will no longer be auto-consumed as players might be used to. While we hope to improve this process with a future update, players can avoid the extra clicks this change causes by selecting the spell or ability first and then tapping their lands to pay the mana cost.


**Promo Grants**


* The Season 2 MOPR promos and the corrected promo for Season 1 will be granted during this downtime.

**Game Play**


* Cardset | [Anafenza, the Foremost](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Anafenza%2C+the+Foremost) no longer incorrectly exiles token creatures.
* Duel Scene | Colorless mana is no longer autoconsumed before special mana (e.g. from [Cavern of Souls](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cavern+of+Souls) and [Mishra's Workshop](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mishra%27s+Workshop)).
* Cardset | Costs that include a snow mana symbol now work as expected.
* Cardset | [Oblivion Sower](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oblivion+Sower)’s triggered ability no longer incorrectly allows players to put face-down exiled land cards onto the battlefield.
* Cardset | Creatures that would die after being dealt damage by [Kumano, Master Yamabushi](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kumano%2C+Master+Yamabushi) or one of his friends from *Kamigawa* are now properly exiled instead.
* Duel Scene | Cards that tutor for multiple cards at once now properly show the tutored cards in the Revealed Zone.
* Cardset | [Caged Sun](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Caged+Sun)’s mana ability now correctly triggers when a land is tapped for an ability that produces more than one mana.
* Cardset | Casting [Ray of Command](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ray+of+Command) without paying its mana cost, via a spell or ability such as cascade or [Mizzix's Mastery](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mizzix%27s+Mastery), now works as expected.
* Cardset | A bug that caused a crash when a player targeted a card with split second with [Spelltwine](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spelltwine) has been resolved.
* Cardset | Players who use the “Attack with all creatures” function will now see their flip creatures (such as [Erayo, Soratami Ascendant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Erayo%2C+Soratami+Ascendant) and [Akki Lavarunner](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Akki+Lavarunner)) attack as expected.

**Client**


* General | Players eliminated from Premier events no longer falsely appear higher in the standings than players who are still active in the event.
* General | Several bugs not listed elsewhere that caused crashes have been resolved.

**Look and Feel**


* Collection | Planeswalker cards have received additional visual polish. In particular, the premium version of [Gideon, Ally of Zendikar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gideon%2C+Ally+of+Zendikar) no longer displays a mysterious second forehead.
