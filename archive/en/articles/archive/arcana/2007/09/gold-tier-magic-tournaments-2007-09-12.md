Starting September 14th and running until September 22nd, official Wizards of the Coast "Gold Tier" Premier stores will be running exclusive *Gold Tier **Magic** Tournaments.* These one-day tournaments will be held across North America, at locations selected from some of the very best hobby game stores on the continent. To find a location near you (and which day they are running the tournament), check out [the list](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/arcana/1417a).

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/mtgcom/arcana1000/1417_bag.jpg)What do you get for participating? Prizes! Popularity! The envy of your peers!

The first 32 players to register at each location receive a [Memory Lapse](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Memory+Lapse) foil promo card. In addition, prizes will be awarded at the "Top 16" (**Magic** Deck Box) and "Top 8" (**Magic** Hat) level. Even better, the first-place winner from each store will also receive an ultra-cool **Magic** Duffel Bag (pictured here) AND be awarded a FREE booster box of the upcoming **Magic** set, *Lorwyn,* shortly after the set's prerelease event.

All you have to do is find the participating store nearest you, contact them with any questions about participating, and show up ready to make your best friend cry in the wake of your glorious victory.
