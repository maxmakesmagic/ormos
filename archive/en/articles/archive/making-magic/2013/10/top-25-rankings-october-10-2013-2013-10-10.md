It's Week 2 of the Top 25 **Magic** Pro Rankings, and it's very much the calm before the storm. For many of the Top 25, their plans last weekend were literally up in the air, with many *en route* to Dublin for Pro Tour *Theros*. While [Grand Prix Brisbane](/en/events/coverage/justin-robb-triumphant-brisbane) might have been the closest available for the Japanese contingent, Shuhei Nakamura opted instead for *Theros* Limited practice at [Grand Prix Oklahoma City](/en/events/coverage/mondon-devoted-victory-okc). He was joined there by [World Champion](/en/events/coverage/woc13) Shahar Shenhar, Brazil's Willy Edel, and [ChannelFireball](http://store.channelfireball.com/landing) mainstays Eric Froehlich and Ben Stark.


Through the Gods, monsters, and heroes of Sealed Deck play, neither Froehlich nor Shenhar could advance to Day Two, leaving the other three to try to make progress up the rankings. Both Edel and Stark nudged their Pro Point total nicely upwards with top 32 finishes, while Nakamura came closest to a big jump when missing out on the Top 8 by just one place.


That allowed Edel to close the gap to Reid Duke in 5th place to exactly 4 points, while Nakamura leapfrogged Tom Martell into 7th place. Martell was already busy preparing for [Pro Tour *Theros*](http://www.wizards.com/magic/tcg/events.aspx?x=mtg/event/protour/theros13) as part of the [StarCityGames](http://www.starcitygames.com/) super team, happily ensconced in their County Meath castle.


Now for the big shakeupâ€”Pro Tour *Theros* is going to make a huge difference to the rankings, as you would expect. With more than 1,500 Pro Points potentially up for grabs, there could be a very different look to the top of the table next week. Can reigning Player of the Year Josh Utter-Leyton keep the top spot? Enjoy the Pro Tour, and we'll see you next week with all new Top 25 **Magic** Pro Rankings.
