Ahh, summer has finally come to the Northern Hemisphere. The sun is shining, birds are singing, our future robot overlords are laying the foundation for their eventual dominion. Wait, what?


That's right, the time has come to unveil the *Secret Lair*: Summer Superdrop!


![Summer Superdrop family shot](https://media.wizards.com/2020/images/daily/SummerSuperdrop_Lineup.jpg)


Now, you may be wondering what a "superdrop" is. If you've been with us since way back in December 2019, I'm sure you remember the very first group of *Secret Lair* drops we released back-to-back-to-back in rapid-fire succession. That's a superdrop! The *Secret Lair Drop Series* is built around 24-hour flash releases, and superdrops are our marquee moments—our let's-blow-the-roof-off extravaganzas where we bring a whole bunch of different drops together and really showcase the wide range of exciting *Secret Lair* weirdness.


Beginning June 1, we'll be releasing five unique *Secret Lair* drops for preorder in quick succession—each with blink-and-you'll-miss-it 24-hour availability only at [secretlair.wizards.com](https://secretlair.wizards.com/). These drops will also be available in a bundle that includes a very special bonus! These are all preorders, meaning all drops will ship at a later date once product is available.


So, what's in these drops? Scroll down to see!

This drop celebrates the quintessential red spell: the humble and efficient [Lightning Bolt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt). Whether it's destroying your opponent's mana dork on turn one or simply being hurled into their face, [Lightning Bolt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt) does it all, as long as "all" can be done with 3 direct damage. Each piece shows a different creature getting totally wrecked by the cruel and unforgiving power of nature (out of respect for the feelings of Ornithological Studies, Birds will be getting a pass). These full-art foil cards feature electrifying, brand-new art by Noah Bradley, Brigitte Roka, Robbie Trevino, and Alexis Ziritt.


ORNITHOLOGICAL STUDIES

**Price**: $29.99/€34.99\*/£29.99\*  

\*inclusive of local VAT


Of all of *Magic*'s fictional creatures, Birds are far and away the most popular. First invented by Richard Garfield in 1987, Birds eventually made their way into *Limited Edition (Alpha)* via the powerful [Birds of Paradise](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Birds+of+Paradise) card. We thought it would be cool to envision what Birds would look like if they existed in real life, so we commissioned some naturalistic, classical illustrations from Ovidio Cartagena and Allen Douglas.


SUMMER SUPERDROP BUNDLE
=======================


What's cooler than getting your hands on all five drops in one easy package? Getting all five drops *and* a special bonus—a non-foil enemy fetch land! That's right, we've gone and made the Summer Superdrop even more fetching. (Thank you, thank you, we'll be here all . . . until June 15.)


![Fetch land image](https://media.wizards.com/2020/images/daily/SummerSuperdrop_Bundle.jpg)


The bundle will be available June 1–15, sticking around for a bit after the individual drop days end in case you miss a drop or can't make up your mind quite fast enough for those 24-hour timers. But don't wait too long! Once the bundle is gone, the sun will have truly set on the Summer Superdrop.


**On sale**: June 1, 9 a.m. PT – June 15, 9 a.m. PT


**Contents**:


One of each *Secret Lair* drop included in the Summer Superdrop.


* Full Sleeves: The Tattoo Pack
* Can You Feel with a Heart of Steel?

* Mountain, Go
* Ornithological Studies
* PLUS! One (1) enemy fetch land

**Price**: $169.95/€194.95\*/£169.95\*
