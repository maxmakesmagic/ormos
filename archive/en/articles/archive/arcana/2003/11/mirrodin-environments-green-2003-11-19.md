Today we take our fifth look behind the scenes of the development of *Mirrodin's* look and feel: the green-aligned environments. See also our looks at [white](/en/articles/archive/mirrodin-environments-white-2003-10-01), [blue](/en/articles/archive/mirrodin-environments-blue-2003-10-06), [black](/en/articles/archive/mirrodin-environments-black-2003-10-20) and [red](/en/articles/archive/mirrodin-environments-red-2003-10-30).

Central to the green locations is the Tangle, an enormous, sprawling "forest" made of copper structures. The greenish tint the Tangle bears comes from verdigris (no, not the card [Verdigris](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Verdigris); it's the crust of copper sulfate or copper chloride that forms on copper after being exposed to air for long periods). The Tangle's inhabitants call this "the Molder" (hence cards like [Molder Slug](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Molder+Slug)).

**Below:** Here's an early concept illustration by Vance Krovacs of the upper canopy of the Tangle. Note how metallic the tree-analog structures are here. Note also the scale of the piece: the small figure on the extreme left is human-sized (probably an elf).

![Trolls of Tel-Jilad](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Trolls+of+Tel-Jilad)**Left:** The Tangle's structures resemble organic branches, foliage, and vines, but are not plants. Here's a detail sketch of one of the Tangle's "trees." Deep within the Tangle is a huge tree-structure that the [Viridian Shaman](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Viridian%2BShaman) call Tel-Jilad, the [Tree of Tales](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tree+of+Tales). The surface of Tel-Jilad is carved with runes [Tel-Jilad Stylus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Tel-Jilad%2BStylus) there by the [Trolls of Tel-Jilad](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Trolls%2Bof%2BTel-Jilad) over hundreds of years.

**Below:** This is a later illustration of the Tangle by Mark Tedin. Note again the scale here - the cables connecting this stucture to other "trees" are basically rope bridges used by Viridian elves.
