*MTG Arena*'s First Play-In Event Is May 21
===========================================


Our first [Qualifier Play-In event](https://magic.gg/events/qualifier-play-in), which can earn you an invitation to this month's Qualifier Weekend, is set for May 21! Compete in Best-of-One Phantom *Streets of New Capenna* Sealed matches for prizes and reach six wins for an invitation to the [May 28–29 Qualifier Weekend](https://magic.gg/events/qualifier-weekend)!

*Streets of New Capenna* Family Festivals Continue!
===================================================


The [Rise of the Five Families Festival](https://magic.wizards.com/mtga-snc-rise-of-the-families) is in full swing, with the Cabaretti poised to show the power of a good party May 18–21.


What's in these festival events for you? Well, here's the deal: you can score golden age showcase card styles that'll prove you're a big shot and not some chump with a lot of chin music.


Plus, for these events only, as long as you participate in an event, you’ll be granted all card styles for that event—even if you don’t make it to five wins. This is only for the Rise of the Five Families Festival events.


Each event's format is Alchemy Singleton with Best-of-One matches, but with a unique emblem twist inspired by each family!


**Rise of the Cabaretti: May 18–21**


* Emblem: "Whenever a creature enters the battlefield under your control, scry 1. If this is the second time this ability has resolved this turn, draw a card instead."
