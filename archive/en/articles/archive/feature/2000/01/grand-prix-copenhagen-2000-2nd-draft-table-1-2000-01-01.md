**The players' perspectives.**


**Neils:** Opening up a Crooked Scales in his first booster, then a Flagship in the second, the cards were just falling into his lap here - later on came Vitalizing Wind, Squirrel Wrangler, Volrath the Fallen, Jorael, Empress of Beasts, and a bunch of green fat cards. Peter, to his left, had picked a Vine Trellis in the first booster over a Cateran Brute and an Enslaved Horror, so Franck moving into green seriously affected Myrvig's draft, neither one of them backing down. As long as people don't give him trouble in the early game he will do very well with this gift.




|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Booster 1:** |  |
| 10 Forests | Rath's Edge |
| 7 Swamps | Crooked Scales |
| Cateran Brute | Cateran Persuader |
| Deathgazer | Misshapen Fiend |
| Snuff Out | Collective Unconsciousness |
| Tiger Claws | Predator Flagship |
| Volrath the Fallen | Blastoderm |
| Skyshroud Claim | Skyshroud Poacher |
| 3 Skyshroud Sentinels | Woodripper |
| Jorael, Empress of Beasts | Silt Crawler |
| Squirrel Wrangler | Thresher Beast |
| Vintara Elephant | Vitalising Wind |

**Peter:** Vine Trellis, Waterfront Bouncer, Deepwood Tantif, Darting Merfolk, Ramosian Sergeant, Steadfast Guard, Lure, Arrest, Ramosian Lieutenant, Bloackade Runner, Seal of Strength - there are no signs at this stage that he has chosen 2 colours. To his right is black/green and to his left is red/black, so I guess blue and white might have been good, but when a Saproling Burst came his way he stayed undecided till the end of the draft.




|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Booster 1:** |  |
| 3 Forest | Arrest |
| 6 Island | Ramosian Lieutenant |
| 8 Plains | Ramosian Sergeant |
| Steadfast Guard | Blockade Runner |
| Waterfront Bouncer | Lawbringer |
| Voice of Truth | Cloudskate |
| Jolting Merfolk | Rootwater Commando |
| Seal of Removal | Trickster Mage |
| Saproling Burst | Divining Griffin |
| Megeta the Lion | Rhystic Shield |
| Shield Dancer | Soul Charmer |
| Troubled Healer | Silt Crawler |
| Vintara Elephant |  |

**Gottlieb:** This draft table managed to support four black players, but Gottlieb's deck is not tht impressive.He was a little unlucky as Neils only joined black for certain when he opened up a Slaver at the end of Masques, otherwise he might have had four black Nemesis picks from his left. Still - he does have a game winner (Flowstone Slide), and a Thopter, but the black evasion creatures evaded him.




|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Booster 1:** |  |
| 9 Mountains | Deepwood Ghoul |
| 9 Swamps | Enslaved Horror |
| Intimidation | Molting Harpy |
| Kyren Sniper | Lunge |
|
| Ogre Taskmaster | Shock Troops |
| Flowstone Thopter | Carrion Wall |
| Flowstone Crusher | Flowstone Slide |
| Laccolith Grunt | Avatar of Woe |
| Chilling Apparition | Flay |
| Greel's Caress | Steal Strength |
| 2 Kledon Berseker | Ridgeline Racer |
| Spur Grappler |  |

**Gunnar:** With two red/black players surrounding him he was handed his u/w deck on a plate. His only off colour pick in the first set was a Silverglade Pathfinder. However, with only a reasonable rebel engine that lacks early plays and a flyer, and only two flyers (one of which needs to sack land), his deck is not as strong as you might expect. I think the cards just didn't fall well for him.




|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Booster 1:** |  |
| 8 Islands | Arrest |
| 9 Plains | 2 Devout Witness |
| Disenchant | Ramosian Captain |
| Ramosian Commander | Darting Merfolk |
| Lawbringer | 2 Lightbringers |
| Silkenfist Order | Topple |
| Ensnare | Oraxid |
| Seal of Removal | 2 Mageta's Boon |
| Mirror Strike | Reville Squad |
| Coastal Hornclaw | Spiketail Hatchling |
| Withdraw |  |

**Johan:** Brute, Lightning Hounds, Highway Robbers, Blaster Mage, Kris Mage were his first picks and he stcuk to these colours all the way through. Mattias tried to shake him off red to his left (which is a hard thing to do from that position, but prophecy red is good enough to worry about) but failed, although the Swede ended up with red/green anyway. There is nothing really scary in his deck, but he can do ok.




|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Booster 1:** |  |
| 7 Mountain | Cateran Brute |
| 10 Swamp | Highway Robber |
| Specter's Wail | Blaster Mage |
| Kris Mage | Kyren Sniper |
| Lightning Hounds | 2 Belbe's Percher |
| Carrion Wall | 2 Plague Witch |
| Spineless Thug | Vicious Hunger |
| Rupture | Agent of Shauku |
| Bog Glider | Death Charmer |
| Greel, Mind Raker | Soul Strings |
| Barbed Field | Keldon Berserker |
| Scoria Cat |  |

**Mattias:** He first picked a tremor and tried to stay in red, but was heavily shut out by the two red players to his left. Decidilng that green was the best way to go, with the two other green payers round the other side of the table, was definitely the right decision. His deck went from looking appalling to being reasonably good when 2 Blastoderms were thrown at him.




|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Booster 1:** |  |
| 2 Forest | Horned Troll |
| 6 Mountain | 2 Invigorate |
| Spidersilk Armor | Vine Trellis |
| Laccolith Grunt | 2 Blastoderm |
| 2 Seal of Strength | 2 Treetop Bracers |
| Woodripper | Fault Riders |
| Panic Attack | Zerapa Minotaur |
| Pygmy Razorback | 2 Rib Cage Spider |
| Spitting Spider | Thresher Beast |

**Niels:** He got some great picks at the beginning of the draft- a Blessing, Sergeant, Nightwond Glider, Skycaptain, Lieutenant and Slaver! His nemesis was almost as good - Belbes Armour , Falcon, Battlefield Percher and Massacre! There were only 2 and a half white players in the draft and all the good cards landed here. In fact - he built such a good deck that he defensively drafted a Spiketail Drake first pick in the penultimate booster.




|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Booster 1:** |  |
| 9 Plains | Cho-Manno's Blessing |
| 8 Swamp | Disenchant |
| Nightwind Glider | Ramosian Lieutenant |
| Ramosian Sergeant | Ramosian Sky Marshal |
| Cateran Slaver | Highway Robber |
| Skulking Fugitive | Belbe's Armor |
| Battlefield Percher | Carrion Wall |
| Massacre | Rathi Intimidator |
| Angelic Favor | Defiant Falcon |
| 2 Agent of Shauku | 2 Mageta's Boon |
| 2 Soul Charmer | 1 Trenching Steed |

**Sigurd:** In the first booster Neils took a Highway Robber so Sigurd left him the Skulking Fugitive and took a Stone Rain and a Ceremonial Guard, even though they are very bad picks. Later on in the draft Neils did not return the favour with that Spiketail Drake. The next booster saw a Thwart, then a Panacea, Outrigger, Wild Jhovall and a Drake Hatchling, so his colours were farily decided. The next two boosters gave him 2 Thunderclaps, and his first pick Ancient Hydra was another bomb in what became a powerful deck. There were four red players n the table, but the lack of blue players allowed him to get a good pick of either one or the other in the Prophecy sets. Sigurd should do well with this one.
