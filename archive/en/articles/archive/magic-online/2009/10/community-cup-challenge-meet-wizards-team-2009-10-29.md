[Triskelion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Triskelion), [Warp World](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Warp+World), [Trinket Mage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Trinket+Mage), [Gravedigger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gravedigger), and [Deranged Hermit](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deranged+Hermit)

**Do you think the Community Team can defeat the WoTC team at their own game?**  They’ll misclick less than us, so maybe. But if there’s a tie, we’ll surely win the dance-off.

**What work do you do that affects Magic Online and how?** I work on the Magic brand team and provide marketing support for Magic Online.   
**Do you think the Community Team can defeat the WoTC team at their own game?** With me playing that is a distinct possibility…but we’ll see.

**What work do you do that affects Magic Online and how?** My main responsibility is the ecommerce side of MTGO, with a side of Business Team thrown in for good measure.   
**Do you think the Community Team can defeat the WoTC team at their own game?** Can they? Sure. But with WotC pride on the line, I wouldn’t bet on it.

**Favorite Magic Format:** EDH/Commander and draft!   
**Favorite Magic Card(s):**  I’m not sure I have a specific card.  [Kaervek the Merciless](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=+Kaervek+the+Merciless+)  has been a loyal leader of my EDH/Commander decks, so I’ll go with that.   
**What work do you do that affects Magic Online and how?**  I used to be a game server developer that coded the game server (e.g. game rules and cards), but now I mainly work on the finance / data analysis side of things. I gather all the data for the MOCS and MOPR programs, and with our web event coverage of MTGO events. Finally, I help R&D with rules and card templating issues, and do some playtesting from time to time. And I try to be helpful in any other way I can!   
**Do you think the Community Team can defeat the WotC team at their own game?** Of course they can. I mean it’s \*possible\* we all get mana screwed every game, right?

**What work do you do that affects Magic Online and how?** I write, maintain, and update the Magic game rules (without which **Magic Online** would pretty much be a card encyclopedia). I also maintain and update the Oracle card database so that the cards in each Legacy set released Online match their printed functionality as much as possible.   
**Do you think the Community Team can defeat the WoTC team at their own game?** No. If it looks like it might happen, I’ll just change the rules.

**Age:** 42   
**How long have you been playing Magic?** Since it first came out.   
**Favorite Magic Format:**  A wacky tournament format I call the “Magic Invitational”

**What work do you do that affects Magic Online and how?** I don’t have much to do with the Online part but I dabble quite a bit in the Magic part.   
**Do you think the Community Team can defeat the WoTC team at their own game?**  Yes, if the Community Team makes their own game, I believe they’d have a real chance. Oh, they’re playing Magic. Yeah, not so much.

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/digital/magiconline/matt-tabak.jpg)**Name:**  Matt Tabak   
**Age:** 33   
**How long have you been playing Magic?** 13 years   
**Favorite Magic Format:** There are formats other than draft?   
**Favorite Magic card(s):**
[Hidden Path](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hidden+Path) (my first deck!), [Demonfire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Demonfire) (got me to a PT!), [Gurzigost](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gurzigost) (a fellow 6/8!)   
**What work do you do that affects Magic Online and how?** Previously I was the **Magic Online** Game Support Team lead, helping players in times of difficulty. I have since moved to R&D where I support the Editing and Rules teams. I still contribute to the **Magic Online** Business Team, crafting the awesome tournaments and events of tomorrow.   
**Do you think the Community Team can defeat the WotC team at their own game?**  Sure, but most of the scenarios where this happens involve swine flu, rampant flooding at our offices, or the Mayan apocalypse.

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/digital/magiconline/mike-turian.jpg)**Name:** Mike Turian   
**Age:** 30   
**How long have you been playing Magic?** I started playing during *The Dark* in 1994.   
**Favorite Magic Format:** I love drafting. I would draft right now!   
**Favorite Magic card(s):**
[Spitting Slug](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spitting+Slug), [Wasteland](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wasteland)  
**What work do you do that affects Magic Online and how?** Working in Magic R&D I work on all (most) of the cards that end up in **Magic Online**. Besides my work directly on Magic, for **Magic Online** I have helped with the newly previewed redesign that Adriana and her team have been working on.   
**Do you think the Community Team can defeat the WoTC team at their own game?** The Community Team has a great love of Magic, and I hope they keep this quote in mind after their defeat. “When all is said and done, it's not the shots that won the championship that you remember, but the friendships you made along the way."

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/digital/magiconline/ryan-dhuse.jpg)**Name:** Ryan Dhuse   
**Age:** 30   
**How long have you been playing Magic?** I started playing Magic during Revised.   
**Favorite Magic Format:** Drafting   
**What work do you do that affects Magic Online and how?** I’m the Software Architect for **Magic Online**. I contribute to the long term vision for the game. I’ve been spending a lot of time on the UI Redesign project over the last few months.   
**Do you think the Community Team can defeat the WoTC team at their own game?** The rumor is that you start to lose your competitive edge when you get hired by WoTC. I’ve certainly seen my game decline a bit, so I’d say they have a shot. Plus, *Zendikar* draft and current Standard are old news for us now. We’ll beat them in FFL Standard any day though. At least, that’ll be my excuse when we lose.

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/digital/magiconline/tolena%20thorburn.jpg)**Name:**  Tolena Thorburn   
**Age:** 27

**Favorite Magic Format:** Sealed   
**Favorite Magic card(s):**
[Akroma](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Akroma) and [Lotus Cobra](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lotus+Cobra)  
**What work do you do that affects Magic Online and how?** I’m the Communications Manager, so I try to keep Matt Tabak in line.   
**Do you think the Community Team can defeat the WoTC team at their own game?** Ooooh, I don’t think so, but I wish them the best of luck!

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/digital/magiconline/tom-lapille.jpg)**Name:**  Tom LaPille   
**Age:** 23   
**How long have you been playing Magic?** 12 years   
**Favorite format:**
**Magic Online** Classic   
**Favorite Magic card(s):**
[Psychatog](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psychatog), [Arcbound Ravager](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arcbound+Ravager), [Tribal Flames](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tribal+Flames)  
**What work do you do that affects Magic Online and how?** I help decide what Magic cards should do before they get printed or coded.   
**Do you think the Community Team can defeat the WoTC team at their own game?** Sure, but they probably won’t!

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/digital/magiconline/vincent-price.jpg)**Name:**  Vincent Price   
**Age:** 34   
**How long have you been playing Magic?** Started in 1993 with *Antiquities* and have taken two sabbaticals over the years to return last during *Time Spiral*. I liked being able to play my old cards again!   
**Favorite Magic Format:** EDH... er Commander, yes definitely Commander. Also, I enjoy Block Constructed, Shards block is a blast!   
**Favorite Magic card(s):** From my start it would have to be [Force of Nature](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Force+of+Nature). In more current times it would be have to be [Doran, The Siege Tower](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Doran%2C+The+Siege+Tower). He is a sound general and three mana for a 5/5!   
**What work do you do that affects Magic Online and how?** I get to work with the ORCs and help with general day to day maintenance of MTGO with event creation. Plus I have the big red button that can disconnect everyone at once... but I don’t get to use that one :(   
**Do you think the Community Team can defeat the WoTC team at their own game?** Fortune favors the bold and we are bold!

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/digital/magiconline/worth-wollpert.jpg)**Name:** Worth Wollpert   
**Age:** 34   
**How long have you been playing Magic?** Since September, 1993

**What work do you do that affects Magic Online and how?** You know the answer to this, feel free to make some stuff up!   
**Do you think the Community Team can defeat the WoTC team at their own game?** Of course not, they will be crushed by the massive intellect of Magic R&D who we’ve wisely “contracted” to do all the work on our behalf. Either that or we have compromising photos of Forsythe and Liliana.
