Of all the windows to the public, the letters are the most personal. You get anywhere from one hundred to five hundred letters a week. You read them all because each one has a very different insight from the last. Players will write in about all types of different concerns. Some letters are humorous while others are very serious. Some critique while others compliment. But each letter is a peek into the desires of a unique individual. And the information contained in those letters is very valuable in shaping the game's future. Reading the public's letters, incidentally, is one of your favorite activities of the week.
