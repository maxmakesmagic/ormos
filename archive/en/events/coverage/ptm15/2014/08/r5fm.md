 Owen Turtenwald is a titan of the current scene. Currently the No. 5-ranked player in the world, Turtenwald has fifteen Grand Prix Top 8s and a Pro Tour Top 8 already. Turtenwald is armed with a tremendously powerful White-Black deck. Black Devotion has long been considered the best deck in Standard. [Caves of Koilos](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Caves+of+Koilos), an exciting land reprint in *Magic 2015*, makes the white-black version of the deck more consistent than it once was. Consistency issues removed, White-Black Midrange has become the weapon of choice for ChannelFireball's Pantheon team. Turtenwald has already established his platinum status for next year, but a strong finish this weekend would secure him a spot at the World Championship.



His opponent, Martin Juza, has suffered an unusually rough year, especially considering how consistently strong he's been in the past. Juza has a staggering eighteen Grand Prix Top 8s and two Pro Tour Top 8s to boot. He's been in the top 10 for the Player of the Year race five times in the last ten years. Juza brought an interesting aggressive Green/-White Aggro deck to war this weekend. Aggressive green-white strategies had fallen out of favor, despite being very powerful, because of a very weak match-up against Blue Devotion. This weekend, Juza and his teammates made the assumption that Blue Devotion wouldn't be very popular. They were right. The Blue Devotion deck is less than 10% of the field and Green-White Aggro seems like it could be a great choice. 





*While No. 5 Ranked Player Owen Turtenwald is looking to lock in a World Championship seat, Martin Juza is fighting for Pro Player Club status.*
