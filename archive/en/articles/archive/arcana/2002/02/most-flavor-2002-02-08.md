[Llanowar Elves](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Llanowar+Elves) have been in the basic set since the beginning, making them one of the true constants of the game. But one thing keeps changing – their flavor text! Throughout seven printings of the basic set, they have gone through four different flavor text variations. They are:

***Alpha*/*Beta*/*Unlimited*/*Revised***

Whenever the Llanowar Elves gather the fruits of their forest, they leave one plant of each type untouched, considering that nature’s portion.

  
***4th Edition***

Hardened by their life in the haunted Llanowar Forest, these fierce beings are outcasts among elvenkind.

  
***5th Edition*/*6th Edition***One bone broken for every twig snapped underfoot.  
 
—Llanowar penalty for trespassing

  
***7th Edition***

Llanowar covers a million square miles, yet nobody enters the forest without the elves knowing it.
