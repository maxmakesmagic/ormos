What's in it for you? Here's the deal: you can score golden age showcase card styles that'll prove you're a big shot and not some chump with a lot of chin music.


Each event's format is Alchemy Singleton with Best-of-One matches, but with a unique emblem twist inspired by each family!


The first two events feature the Maestros and the Obscura back to back.


**Rise of the Maestros: May 12–15**
