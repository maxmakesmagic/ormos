Mastery System FAQ
------------------






INTRODUCTION
------------


**What is the Mastery System?**


The Mastery System is a way for players to earn experience and unlock rewards by playing *Magic: The Gathering Arena*.


  
**What's the difference between "Account Mastery" and "Set Mastery"?**


Set Mastery is a system specific to each new Standard set on *Magic: The Gathering Arena*. Players earn XP through play, and as they level up will receive rewards based on their current level. Account Mastery was a previously part of the new player experience as a way for players to unlock all 15 starter decks, as well as various upgrades and cosmetics. This systemw as replaced in March 2020 with Color Challenges.


  
**Does the Mastery System cost anything?**


All players receive access to the base Set Mastery at no additional cost. Players can unlock Set Mastery rewards by purchasing a Mastery Pass.


  
**Does the Mastery System ever reset?**


Your Set Mastery level and rewards will reset with the release of every new Standard set on *MTG Arena*.


SET MASTERY
-----------


**How long is each Set Mastery available?**


Set Masteries are available for the most recent Standard set, starting on the day the set is released and ending when the next set is released.


**How do I earn rewards?**


By play! Every time you complete a quest, or earn one of your weekly wins in a support format (up to 15 each week), you'll receive experience points towards your current Mastery level. Additional XP may be available through special events or promotional items (such as codes). As you level up, you'll receive rewards based on your current level.


**What rewards can I earn?**


All players can earn booster packs and a limited number of Mastery Orbs to unlock certain card styles. Additional rewards are available for players who have purchased a Mastery Pass.


**What happens when a new set is released on *MTG Arena*?**


When a new set is released on *MTG Arena*, a new Set Mastery reward track becomes available and your Set Mastery level is reset to 1.


**Can I complete older Set Masteries?**


There is currently no plans to allow players to complete Set Masteries for older sets. While you will keep any rewards you may have received from the previous Set Mastery, you will not be able to unlock any remaining rewards once the Set Mastery is no longer available.


MASTERY PASS
------------


**What is the "Mastery Pass"? How is different than the Mastery System?**


While all players have access to the base Mastery System, the Mastery Pass is an optional way for players to earn additional rewards through Set Mastery.


**How much does the Mastery Pass cost?**


The Mastery Pass can be purchased for 3,400 gems. Players can earn gems through rewards in certain events, or by purchasing them directly from the store.


**What do I receive when I purchase the *Ikoria* Mastery Pass?**


All players who purchase the *Ikoria* Mastery Pass will automatically receive the Regal Cub pet, as well as the Lukka, Coppercoat Outcast Avatar and Greatshark Basic Sleeve. Additionally, you will receive all the Mastery Pass rewards based on your current level, including any rewards from earlier levels you have not received.


  
**If I purchased the *Ikoria* Mastery Pass, what happens when a new Set Mastery is released?**


Each Mastery Pass is tied to a specific Set Mastery. Once a new Set Mastery is released, the older set (and its corresponding Mastery Pass) will no longer be available.
