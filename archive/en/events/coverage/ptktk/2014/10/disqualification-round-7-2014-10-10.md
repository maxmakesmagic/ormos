During Round 7 of Pro Tour *Khans of Tarkir*, competitor Lee Joong-Won was disqualified from the tournament.


Below is a statement from head judge Toby Elliott regarding the disqualification:


"During Round 7, Lee Joong-Won used a [Wooded Foothills](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wooded+Foothills). In response, his opponent cast [Jeskai Charm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jeskai+Charm) to put Lee's only creature on top of his library, at which point Lee tried to skip the resolution of the [Wooded Foothills](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wooded+Foothills) ability. After interviewing him, we determined that the error had been intentional so as to redraw the creature, and disqualified him from the tournament."
