The end of day one saw two players with undefeated records: Florian Koch, whose first draft we already covered, and Helge Nelson who is currently 8-0 in draft matches over the weekend. 8-0? Why, yes, he started the tournament early, by winning one of the last-chance qualifiers on Thursday. That meant 5-0 and his 7-0 winning streak in the main event obviously included a 3-0 in the draft portion. He definitely considers draft his stronger format, and we considered him an ideal pick to watch in the second draft.


He opened a booster with lots of unexciting cards, [Greater Basilisk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Greater+Basilisk), [Aven Fleetwing](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aven+Fleetwing), and two stand-outs in [Oblivion Ring](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oblivion+Ring) and [Doom Blade](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Doom+Blade). He went with [Doom Blade](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Doom+Blade) and was passed a choice between [Merfolk Looter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Merfolk+Looter), [Stingerfling Spider](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stingerfling+Spider), and [Wring Flesh](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wring+Flesh) as the only black card. Time for a second color, apparently, and after some deliberation he picked [Stingerfling Spider](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stingerfling+Spider).


Next up was [Sorin's Thirst](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sorin%27s+Thirst) over [Greater Basilisk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Greater+Basilisk) and [Griffin Sentinel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Griffin+Sentinel), then [Acidic Slime](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Acidic+Slime) over [Wring Flesh](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wring+Flesh) and [Duskhunter Bat](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duskhunter+Bat). He stuck with green for his fifth pick and took [Sacred Wolf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sacred+Wolf), passing [Assault Griffin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Assault+Griffin) as well as [Aven Fleetwing](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aven+Fleetwing).

### The rest of pack one:



[Rampant Growth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rampant+Growth) › [Auramancer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Auramancer), [Armored Warhorse](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Armored+Warhorse), [Crumbling Colossus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crumbling+Colossus)  



The second booster he opened had exactly one green card ([Fog](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fog)) and exactly one black card ([Child of Night](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Child+of+Night)). Even the blue, in which Nelson had dabbled a little, disappointed with [Aven Fleetwing](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aven+Fleetwing). The goodies, like [Gideon's Lawkeeper](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gideon%27s+Lawkeeper) and [Blood Ogre](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Ogre), were all elsewhere on the color wheel. He picked [Child of Night](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Child+of+Night). The next pack had [Rampant Growth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rampant+Growth) and [Tormented Soul](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tormented+Soul) as well as [Merfolk Looter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Merfolk+Looter) and [Skywinder Drake](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skywinder+Drake). He chose blue, specifically [Skywinder Drake](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skywinder+Drake).


Black returned to him with a third-pick [Sorin's Thirst](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sorin%27s+Thirst), passing [Belltower Sphinx](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Belltower+Sphinx), and fourth-pick [Gravedigger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gravedigger), passing [Devouring Swarm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Devouring+Swarm). Even green found its way back to Nelson, when his fifth pick offered him the choice between [Lurking Crocodile](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lurking+Crocodile) and [Mind Rot](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mind+Rot). He took the Crocodile.



### The rest of pack two:



[Vastwood Gorger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vastwood+Gorger) › [Zombie Goliath](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Zombie+Goliath)  
[Greater Basilisk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Greater+Basilisk) › [Mana Leak](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak)  
[Drifting Shade](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Drifting+Shade)  
[Goblin Arsonist](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Arsonist) › [Mind Unbound](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mind+Unbound)  
[Greatsword](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Greatsword) › [Ice Cage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ice+Cage)  
[Stampeding Rhino](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stampeding+Rhino)  
[Circle of Flame](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Circle+of+Flame)s  
[Lure](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lure)  
[Bountiful Harvest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bountiful+Harvest)


The third pack compensated for the weak second pack with the obvious first pick of [Grave Titan](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grave+Titan) which moved to Nelson's draft pile in record speed. The next booster gave him pause, though. So far, the packs in this draft had seemed a tad on the low side of the power curve. This one contained: [Archon of Justice](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Archon+of+Justice), [Incinerate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Incinerate), [Chandra's Outrage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chandra%27s+Outrage), [Azure Mage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Azure+Mage), [Assault Griffin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Assault+Griffin), [Merfolk Looter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Merfolk+Looter), [Volcanic Dragon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Volcanic+Dragon), [Lurking Crocodile](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lurking+Crocodile), *and*[Gravedigger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gravedigger), which Nelson took.


Next, he had a hard time deciding between [Mind Control](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mind+Control) and [Consume Spirit](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Consume+Spirit). It was still unclear, whether green or blue would make up his second main color, but, by my count, the green seemed to be ahead. A three-color deck was also very possible, what with the [Rampant Growth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rampant+Growth) and the Darkwater Catacomb he already had, so he chose [Mind Control](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mind+Control). Then he took [Devouring Swarm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Devouring+Swarm) out of a rather empty pack.



### The rest of pack three:



[Consume Spirit](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Consume+Spirit) › [Æther Adept](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=%C3%86ther+Adept)  
[Phantasmal Dragon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phantasmal+Dragon) › [Plummet](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plummet), [Stampeding Rhino](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stampeding+Rhino)  
[Belltower Sphinx](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Belltower+Sphinx) › [Stampeding Rhino](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stampeding+Rhino)  
[Mana Leak](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak)  
[Plummet](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plummet)  
[Merfolk Looter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Merfolk+Looter) › [Lurking Crocodile](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lurking+Crocodile)  
[Titanic Growth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Titanic+Growth)  
[Buried Ruin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Buried+Ruin)  
[Ponder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ponder)  
[Lure](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lure)


In the end, his deck indeed turned out to be three-colored.
