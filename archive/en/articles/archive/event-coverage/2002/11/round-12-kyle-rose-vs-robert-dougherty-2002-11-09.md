### Game 1

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/pthou02/a456.jpg)Kyle wins the flip and starts off with a mulligan. His first land of the game is a [Polluted Delta](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Polluted+Delta), meaning he's either with [Psychatog](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psychatog) or with one of the Black-Blue reanimator decks. Rob's [Duress](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress) reveals that Kyle is with Pyschatog. Kyle takes out an [Intuition](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Intuition), leaving a [Psychatog](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psychatog) and an [Engineered Plague](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Engineered+Plague). Kyle fetches an [Island](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island) and plays another one. Rob plays another [Duress](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress) taking the Plague, and then casts [Cabal Therapy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cabal+Therapy), which draws an "Oh great" from Kyle.

However, Rob targets himself and discards a [Phantom Nishoba](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phantom+Nishoba). Kyle plays another [Polluted Delta](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Polluted+Delta) next turn, and Rob plays a [City of Traitors](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=City+of+Traitors), and then [Exhume](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Exhume)s. That gets [Mana Leak](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak)ed but Rob had another one so the Nish got to beat soon. Kyle's turn four play was a [Wonder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wonder), and his fifth turn had the [Psychatog](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psychatog). Those however were the last spells he would cast this game as the Nishoba did him in.

### Game 2

Kyle plays an [Island](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island) this time around, and again gets [Duress](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress)ed by Rob the next turn. This time however, things don't look as good as they did last time. Having to choose between [Accumulated Knowledge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Accumulated+Knowledge), [Intuition](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Intuition), [Fact or Fiction](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fact+or+Fiction) and [Counterspell](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterspell) along with some land Rob comments "That's a good hand". Kyle just replied, "That depends on how fast your hand is". The [Counterspell](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterspell) hits the yard.

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/pthou02/a458.jpg)On Rob's next turn another [Duress](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress) hits Kyle, this time taking the [Intuition](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Intuition). Kyle 'cycles' his Knowledge, plays a land and says go. Rob [Entomb](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Entomb)s a [Petradon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Petradon), Tutors during his upkeep, plays a [City of Traitors](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=City+of+Traitors) and [Exhume](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Exhume)s it. That however gets [Mana Leak](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak)ed. Rob's next turn goes without any action spells whatsoever. That gives Kyle the opportunity to cast that [Fact or Fiction](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fact+or+Fiction) he's been holding and he's presented with the choice between [Swamp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swamp), [Diabolic Edict](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Diabolic+Edict) and [Polluted Delta](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Polluted+Delta) or [Mana Leak](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak) and [Accumulated Knowledge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Accumulated+Knowledge). He takes the latter, and then game enters Draw, Land, Go mode.

At 7 mana Rob casts an [Urborg Shambler](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Urborg+Shambler) which gets countered, Kyle then gushes and drops a [Psychatog](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psychatog) and comes in for lethal damage next turn.

### Game 3

Rob got to go first again this game, a huge advantage in this extended format. He doesn't have the [Duress](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress) this time around, instead he [Entomb](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Entomb)s at the end of Kyle's turn. It gets [Force Spike](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Force+Spike)d though. Rob gets even with a [Duress](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress) taking an [Accumulated Knowledge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Accumulated+Knowledge).

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/pthou02/a457.jpg)That left a [Psychatog](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psychatog) and a [Wonder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wonder) in Kyle's hand along with some land, so he looked like he was in great shape. Land, go is Kyle's next turn, and Rob Tutors, plays a [City of Traitors](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=City+of+Traitors) and drops a [Stronghold Taskmaster](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stronghold+Taskmaster). Kyle doesn't play the Atog next turn and takes 4 from the Taskmaster. The Atog does hit play the next turn, but it gets [Butcher](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Butcher)ed and the Taskmaster comes in for more.

Kyle Treacheries the Taskmaster, [Duress](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress)es Rob taking a [Reanimate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reanimate) but he sees another [Faceless Butcher](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Faceless+Butcher). That [Butcher](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Butcher) came down next turn and freed the Taskmaster from Kyle's control. The other [Butcher](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Butcher) took Kyle down to 10. Kyle could only play a wonder next turn and didn't draw another good spell for the rest of the game. We all know what happens when 2 2/3's beat up one someone with a 2/2.

**Final Result:** Rob Dougherty 2 â€“ Kyle Rose 1
