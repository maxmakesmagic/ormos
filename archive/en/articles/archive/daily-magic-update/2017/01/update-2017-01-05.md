The January 5, 2017 Update

The Daily *Magic* Update is a roundup of everything *Magic* you should know on January 5, 2017. Today's Update is brought to you by Atog, er, Ravenous Intruder. Now we know what to do with all of those [Ornithopter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ornithopter)s!


Today's Previews
================


A one-week preview cycle is a bit of a task. We're jamming more and more preview cards into each day to keep up and keep you satiated. So I'm going to list all of the non-DailyMTG previews (with links), and only comment on a couple of them. After all, it's not me you're here for—it's the previews. I know my place.


1. Ravenous Intruder | [Snack Time with Mike and Ant](http://www.gatheringmagic.com/snacktimewithmikeandant-01052017-snack-time-47-aether-revolt-preview/)

Now you have something to do with [Ornithopter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ornithopter)! Feed it to your other (virtual) reprint! Of course, Atogs don't exist on Kaladesh, but their spirit certainly lives on in Gremlins.


1. Hope of Ghirapur | [So Many Insane Plays](http://www.eternalcentral.com/so-many-insane-plays-podcast-episode-61-aether-revolt-preview-hope-of-ghirapur/)

It's pretty rare that we get to point at a card and say "Yeah, that might be Vintage and Legacy playable," but this card has the hope of many who love those formats. Its similarity to [Xantid Swarm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Xantid+Swarm) mixed with its colorless cost means the So Many Insane Plays crew was eager to declare "This is a card that will be played for years, if not decades, to come."


1. Hidden Herbalists | [Canal Uncle K](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ev6fJMXUdZw)

My favorite comment on this was ["I found them. They did a bad job hiding."](https://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/5m3krw/aerhidden_herbalists/dc0jcdk/)


1. Metallic Rebuke| [Gathering Magic](http://www.gatheringmagic.com/alexullman-01052017-leaking-aether/)

Here is the traditional "could be good in Pauper" common. And ya know what? This could be good in Pauper! The secret, though? This could be good in other places too...


5. Everything else
==================

What People Are Talking About
=============================


1. [The chance of opening a Grindstone and Painter's Servant in a draft is 1 in 7.5 million](https://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/5m1y7k/the_chance_of_opening_a_grindstone_and_painters/)

So you're saying there's a chance...


1. [Add 3 Mana](http://theblogeternities.tumblr.com/image/155432494554)

Just—yes. Though, fair warning, sacrificing a Lotus *car* will not go the way you want it to.


Deck of the Day
===============


1. [White-Blue Reservoir](http://www.starcitygames.com/article/34303_New-Aether-Revolt-Cards-That-Revive-Old-Archetypes.html) | StarCityGames.com | Ross Merriam (Premium Subscription Required)

Here's a fringe Standard deck that might just get a little less fringy with *Aether Revolt*. The basic setup is to cast a bunch of zero-cost cards with [Aetherflux Reservoir](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aetherflux+Reservoir) to gain the necessary life to kill someone, often refilling with [Paradoxical Outcome](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Paradoxical+Outcome). The addition of Sram, Senior Edificer was what got Merriam looking at this deck again. It's probably a bit gimmicky, but there's just enough power here to make you sit up and say "Hmmm."
