### *What is the most underrated card in Scars of Mirrodin Block Constructed? What is the most overrated?*


 


![](https://media.wizards.com/legacy/mtg/images/daily/events/ptnag11/qqwa.jpg)
**Yuuya Watanabe:** Underrated? Hmm... [Entomber Exarch](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Entomber+Exarch). Overrated is [Tempered Steel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tempered+Steel).


 


 


![](https://media.wizards.com/legacy/mtg/images/daily/events/ptnag11/qqdu.jpg)
**Reid Duke:** I think the most overrated card in Block is [Elspeth Tirel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elspeth+Tirel). A five-drop in the control decks just needs to turn the game right there, and she doesn't quite do it. The most underrated card is [Darkslick Drake](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Darkslick+Drake) for the same reason why Elspeth is bad. It fits exactly what the control decks want to do at its slot.

**Alex West:** Underrated is [Thrun, the Last Troll](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thrun%2C+the+Last+Troll) and overrated is... [Puresteel Paladin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Puresteel+Paladin).


 


 


![](https://media.wizards.com/legacy/mtg/images/daily/events/ptnag11/qqbl.jpg)
**Sam Black:** For underrated, I should definitely say [Piston Sledge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Piston+Sledge), but for general application, I'll say [Into the Core](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Into+the+Core). I think the most overrated is probably [Stoic Rebuttal](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stoic+Rebuttal).


 


 


![](https://media.wizards.com/legacy/mtg/images/daily/events/ptnag11/qqgo.jpg)
**Simon Görtzen:** The most overrated is definitely [Consecrated Sphinx](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Consecrated+Sphinx). I think the most underrated is probably [Karn Liberated](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Karn+Liberated). People think he's good, but he's even better than that.


 


 


![](https://media.wizards.com/legacy/mtg/images/daily/events/ptnag11/qqoc.jpg)
**David Ochoa:** Heh, for overrated I would say [Island](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island). Underrated though? Hmm... yeah, I think I'm going to say [Pristine Talisman](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pristine+Talisman).


 


  

 


### *What's the Best Piece of Equipment in Scars of Mirrodin Block Constructed?*


 


![](https://media.wizards.com/legacy/mtg/images/daily/events/ptnag11/qqne.jpg)
**Brad Nelson:**  [Lashwrithe](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lashwrithe).


 


 


![](https://media.wizards.com/legacy/mtg/images/daily/events/ptnag11/qqvi.jpg)
**Gaudenis Vidugiris:** My deck wouldn't work without [Piston Sledge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Piston+Sledge), but I'm still going to have to go with [Batterskull](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Batterskull).


 


 


![](https://media.wizards.com/legacy/mtg/images/daily/events/ptnag11/qqut.jpg)
**Josh Utter-Leyton:** [Lashwrithe](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lashwrithe).


 


 


![](https://media.wizards.com/legacy/mtg/images/daily/events/ptnag11/qqdo.jpg)
**Rob Dougherty:** [Batterskull](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Batterskull), but it's not in my deck! [Mortarpod](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mortarpod) is probably the best piece of Equipment that I'm playing.


 


 


![](https://media.wizards.com/legacy/mtg/images/daily/events/ptnag11/qqmi.jpg)
**Kazuya Mitamura:** None of them! Or maybe [Batterskull](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Batterskull).


 


 


![](https://media.wizards.com/legacy/mtg/images/daily/events/ptnag11/qqca.jpg)
**Gabe Carleton-Barnes:** [Mortarpod](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mortarpod).


 


  

 


### *What's the best planeswalker in Scars of Mirrodin Block Constructed?*


 


![](https://media.wizards.com/legacy/mtg/images/daily/events/ptnag11/qqvi.jpg)
**Gaudenis Vidugiris:** [Koth of the Hammer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Koth+of+the+Hammer)


 


 


![](https://media.wizards.com/legacy/mtg/images/daily/events/ptnag11/qqwe.jpg)
**Alex West:** [Karn Liberated](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Karn+Liberated); he's the end boss in control mirrors.


 


 


![](https://media.wizards.com/legacy/mtg/images/daily/events/ptnag11/qqut.jpg)
**Josh Utter-Leyton:** [Koth of the Hammer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Koth+of+the+Hammer).


 


 


![](https://media.wizards.com/legacy/mtg/images/daily/events/ptnag11/qqdu.jpg)
**Reid Duke:** Koth. [Tezzeret, Agent of Bolas](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tezzeret%2C+Agent+of+Bolas) and [Koth of the Hammer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Koth+of+the+Hammer) are the only planeswalkers that come down fast enough to impact the game, but Tezzeret forces you to play with too many artifacts for your deck to stay competitive against [Tempered Steel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tempered+Steel).


 


 


![](https://media.wizards.com/legacy/mtg/images/daily/events/ptnag11/qqko.jpg)
**Conrad Kolos:** [Karn Liberated](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Karn+Liberated). The planeswalkers in this block are generally aggressive rather than defensive, so you can't really protect Koth.


 


 


![](https://media.wizards.com/legacy/mtg/images/daily/events/ptnag11/qqwo.jpg)
**Conley Woods:** [Elspeth Tirel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elspeth+Tirel). Koth puts too much of a constraint on how you build your deck. You can build a two-color Elspeth deck, but you can't build a two-color Koth deck.
