Grand Prix Osaka 2005
---------------------


P.S. 2 Repeats in Osaka!
========================




January 5-7












[日本語の取材へ](/en/node/566041)


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gposaka05/win.jpg)1350 "Drafto" later, we now know that the story of this incredible Grand Prix is none other than "[Lava Spike](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lava+Spike) for the win." That's how P.S. 2 finished off both their semifinals and their finals opponents on their way to winning their second Team Limited Grand Prix title. First [they swept One Spin](#10) in three tense 2-1 results in the semis, setting up half of a possible dream matchup with other storied Japanese team ShopFireball.com. The men of ShopFireball.com took care of their part of the bargain by dispatching Gatos Brihantes 2-1 and the stage was set for the ultimate in Japanese team face-off.


Neither team seemed to have a huge advantage coming out of the draft, so it would be entirely up to playskill and the luck of the draw to determine which team was taking home the hardware. Katsuhiro Mori was the first to win a match, defeating Tsuyoshi Ikeda 2-1, but Itaru Ishida defeated Masahiro Kuroda 2-0 right behind him, leaving the outcome of the entire tournament riding on the outcome of game 3 between Jin Okamoto and Masahiko Morita. Morita's deck was clearly better than Jin's, but that didn't stop the Last Emperor from pulling out game 2 courtesy of a well-timed [Hideous Laughter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hideous+Laughter). Game 3 looked like it was all Morita until Okamoto miraculously stabilized at two life and knocked Morita down to four courtesy of some incredible stalling on the part of his team. Fortunately for P.S. 2, Morita's deck [finally delivered](#11) one of the three burn spells that would squirrel away his victory in the form of [Lava Spike](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lava+Spike), giving P.S. 2 yet another impressive credential to add to their already incredible resumes.

Sunday, January 9: 10:15 pm - Semifinals Round-up
-------------------------------------------------


Two brackets. Four outstanding teams. One winner. We're in the first Grand Prix of 2005 and we already have a contender for match of the year. Before we get to that, however, allow me to set the stage with our semifinals matchups.


On one side of the bracket you have Japanese Team Limited goliaths P.S. 2 (Masahiro Kuroda, Katzuhiro Mori, and Masahito Morita). They were the first team to qualify for the Top 4 and finished in first at the end of the swiss, in spite of conceding to Ichiro Shimura's team in round 10 to put them into the semis. Kuroda, Mori, and Morita have been on fire all weekend and they are two wins away from repeating as Team Limited Grand Prix champions. Sitting across the draft table from them is One Spin, a team of young guns featuring Tomoharu Saitou, Japan National Team member Kenji Tomura, and Tomohiro Kaji. They had to win their last match in order to make it into the semis, and are now faced with the daunting task of drafting against this crew of Japanese superstars.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gposaka05/sf2.jpg)*Komuro vs. Ikeda*
On the other side of the bracket you have another set of Team Limited goliaths in shopfireball-pros.com. Joined by Jin Okamoto and Tsuyoshi Ikeda, Itaru Ishida has again managed to put his team into the big money rounds, inadvertently drawing in the last round against Asayan to seal their place in the semis. Their opponents, Gatos Brihantes, are led by PT-Seattle Top 4 member Ichiro Shimura, who is flanked by Tomohide Sasagawa and Shu Komuro. They were the beneficiaries of a concession in the last round from P.S. 2, but now have to defeat the other of the two greatest Japanese teams ever in order to keep playing.


**Gatos vs. Fireball**


Tsuyoshi Ikeda fell early to Komuro, putting Fireball behind a match, while the other two matches split their opening games, leading up to a tense game 3 for both Ishida and Okamoto. Ishida pulled his third game out with by controlling Sasagawa's attack with [Teller of Tales](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Teller+of+Tales) until he finally built up enough land to cast [Strength of Cedars](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Strength+of+Cedars) on the Teller for the win. This left the outcome of the semis riding on Okamoto vs. Shimura in Seat C. Jin's deck in round 10 had [Yosei, the Morning Star](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Yosei%2C+the+Morning+Star) and [Meloku the Clouded Mirror](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Meloku+the+Clouded+Mirror), but he could only eek out a draw in that match. This time he had not one, but *two* [Nagao, Bound by Honor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nagao%2C+Bound+by+Honor) and [Hikari, Twilight Guardian](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hikari%2C+Twilight+Guardian) to boot. The legendary "Last Emperor" put his white Legends to work in game 3, obliterating Shimura in the process and locking up one half of the dream Shop Fireball vs. P.S. 2 finals matchup.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gposaka05/sf3.jpg)*Kaji vs. Morita*
**P.S. 2 vs. One Spin**


This was the match I was referring to as an early contender for match of the year. Coming out of the draft, P.S. 2 looked to have a solid advantage in deck strength, but when all three of the team members lost their first game. Mori and Tomura in the B seat looked to be racing each other to see who could play the fastest, though Mori's mana screw in game 1 certainly contributed to a quick finish in that game. Morita was the next to fall down in Seat C, and when Tomoharu Saitou cast [Dance of Shadows](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dance+of+Shadows) to win the game at one life in spite of Kuroda casting [Jugan, the Rising Star](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jugan%2C+the+Rising+Star), things looked bleak for the superstars.


Mori then put away game 2, breaking a creature stall with a fearful [Marrow-Gnawer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Marrow-Gnawer) and [Nezumi Ronin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nezumi+Ronin), and kickstarting a comeback. Kuroda then smashed back in his match against Saitou when the spiky-haired One Spin member could only find [Swamp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swamp)s to pair with his hand full of white spells. The only Japanese Pro Tour winner even went stylish for the finish, doing the final points of damage with Mind Blaze naming [Nezumi Graverobber](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nezumi+Graverobber). While Morita was again engaged in a fierce battle against Kaji for their second game, Mori won his match. Tomura was land screwed early, and Mori used a [Befoul](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Befoul) to keep it that way, pushing his advantage to the max before Kenji could recover enough to stabilize. When Katzu won his match, you could actually feel the momentum swing in P.S. 2's direction. This feeling was enhanced when Morita used to [Devouring Greed](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Devouring+Greed) to finish off Kaji and even his match at one each.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gposaka05/sf1.jpg)*Kuroda vs. Saito*
Kuroda took an early lead in his game 3, abusing early beats from [Orochi Sustainer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Orochi+Sustainer) and [Matsu-Tribe Decoy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Matsu-Tribe+Decoy) to get out of the gates quickly. Saitou's discard package did a number on Kuroda's hand, forcing him to discard Jugan, a [Moss Kami](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Moss+Kami), and [Waking Nightmare](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Waking+Nightmare) on consecutive turns, but the Decoy proved to be a wrecking ball against Saitou's deck, particularly when it was enhanced with [Serpent Skin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Serpent+Skin). Plink, plink, plink went Kuroda's little men, and Saitou was never able to find the right combination of men to stop the bleeding. He thought long and hard about his plays for the final turn, trying to determine the best way to stop Kuroda's army of [Feral Deceiver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Feral+Deceiver), [Humble Budoka](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Humble+Budoka), Sustainer and Decoy without losing an extra men an protecting his precious six life in the process. He eventually played a [Harsh Deceiver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Harsh+Deceiver) to join his [Kitsune Blademaster](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kitsune+Blademaster) and [Cursed Ronin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cursed+Ronin), dropping to two after the attack step. Kuroda the flashed a quick smile before flipping over the last card in his hand, a [Lava Spike](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lava+Spike) he had been holding for two turns.


Morita then completed the comeback against Kaji, rolling over Tomohiro's technicolor red/green deck with an old school horde of black and white creatures. P.S. 2's win completed the second half of the bracket and set up a dream final between the two greatest Japanese teams of all time.
