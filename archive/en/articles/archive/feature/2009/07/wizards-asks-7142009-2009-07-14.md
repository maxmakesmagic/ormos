*You get the chance to sit down and play for an afternoon with a famous **Magic** personality. Who do you choose, and why?*

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/mtgcom/authorpics/authorpic_tomlapille.jpg)**Tom Lapille:** This is not entirely a theoretical exercise given that I work with many of **Magic**'s brightest stars, but I'm still leaving the building with my choice. In fact, I'm leaving the country altogether. 

I would choose Pro Tour Hall of Famer [Kai Budde](/en/articles/archive/event-coverage/2007-11-26). He has a very strong claim to the title of strongest **Magic** player to have ever played the game. He clearly had tons of talent, but unlike some of **Magic**'s best players, his reputation hinges less on raw talent and more on the hours and hours of practice that he put in. I would relish the opportunity to experience the intensity he brought to his preparation firsthand from an afternoon of practice with him.
