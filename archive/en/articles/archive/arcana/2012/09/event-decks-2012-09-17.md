Unlike Intro Packs, Event Decks are designed for fairly competitive players. The idea is that you can buy the deck off the shelf and immediately play it at Friday Night **Magic**. And here's what the Event Decks for *Return to Ravnica* look like!

There are two decks, which the discerning eye will immediately recognize as being associated with Rakdos and Golgari. Each one contains a sixty-card deck and fifteen-card sideboard that will be Standard-legal when the Event Decks go on sale at MSRP $24.99 on October 26, 2012.
