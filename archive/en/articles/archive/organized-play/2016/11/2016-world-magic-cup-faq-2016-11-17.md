73 countries compete, but only one country can be crowned the winner at the 2016 World *Magic* Cup, a team-based three-day tournament with a $250,000 prize purse and a scope that rivals the Pro Tour.


The World *Magic* Cup challenges teams comprising four members—the country's top Pro Point earner from the 2015–16 season and the three winners from each country's World *Magic* Cup Qualifiers—as they take on three rounds of *Kaladesh* Team Sealed before diving into the debut of Team Unified Modern for the rest of the weekend. And we'll be bringing you it all live on [twitch.tv/magic](https://www.twitch.tv/magic) and this website!

World *Magic* Cup Basics
========================


Here's all you need to know about the 2016 World *Magic* Cup:


* The 2016 World *Magic* Cup is a three-day, invitation-only event featuring the national champion of each country (the person from that country who earned the most Pro Points in the 2015–16 season) along with each country's three World *Magic* Cup qualifiers as they compete in teams for national pride and a $250,000 prize pool.
* The World *Magic* Cup is divided into different stages each day, where three of the four team members will battle against opposing teams and the fourth team member will act as a coach for the other teammates during their rounds.
* The formats for the first three rounds of this tournament are *Kaladesh* Team Sealed, where teams will build the best 40-card decks they can from twelve boosters of *Kaladesh* per team.
* The remaining rounds of the World *Magic* Cup feature Team Unified Modern, a format that uses the Modern Constructed card pool. In this format, with the exception of basic lands, no two decks a team brings to the table can feature the same card. That means once one player puts a card like [Scalding Tarn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scalding+Tarn) in their deck, the other two decks that the team uses cannot include that card. Players will have to find the best combination of Modern decks to outwit what their opponents will bring to the tournament. Beat the format, then beat the players in the games!
* Day One consists of seven rounds divided into two stages: the first features three rounds of *Kaladesh* Team Sealed, and the second is four rounds of Team Unified Modern. The Top 48 teams will advance to Day Two. The 48 teams that advance will be split into eight pools of six teams for the start of Day Two.
* Day Two consists of two stages of pool play. In the first stage, the first round will feature an elimination match. If a team wins, they remain in. If a team loses, they're out. The Top 16 teams from the end of Day One will be granted byes past this round, so standing matters! Finish well on Day One, and the pressure is off. Finish in the middle of the pack, and your tournament life is at risk!
* Once the elimination match in the first stage of Day Two is complete, the remaining teams will compete in a modified double-elimination tournament structure for three rounds. Once a team wins two matches, they're through to the second stage of Day Two. Once a team loses two matches in this stage, they're out.
* The remaining teams will be split into eight pools of four for the second stage of Day Two, where they will again compete in a modified double-elimination tournament structure for three rounds. Teams that get two wins during this stage of the tournament advance to the Top 8 on Sunday.
* The Top 8 will play out in traditional single-elimination until there is only one team remaining.
* Top 8 teams get invitations and airfare to compete in Pro Tour *Aether Revolt* in Dublin, Ireland, February 3–5, 2017. The $250,000 prize pool pays down to the Top 32 finishing teams, with first place getting $48,000 divided equally among the four team members of the winning country.

As you can see, the World *Magic* Cup is unlike any tournament in the year for *Magic*, making this one of our most intriguing offerings for you to watch! We'll be breaking down how teams are doing in the stages on our live video coverage, so if you need some assistance on seeing how the country you are rooting for is doing, tune in!
