| [Caw](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=208279)-[Blade](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=382200) is still number one, at least in pure numbers. But now, that probably didn't surprise anyone, did it? Actual news, however, is the rise of U/B control brought about by Ali Aintrazi's win at US Nationals last weekend. Indeed, most of those decks are carbon copies or minor tweaks of his winning list.
In third place among the most-played decks is [Valakut](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Valakut), as it was in the US. So far, the deck was not particularly succesful, but it sure is popular. A more unusual favorite among German players seems to be the mono-red aggro deck in all its different forms. Feuer frei! |
