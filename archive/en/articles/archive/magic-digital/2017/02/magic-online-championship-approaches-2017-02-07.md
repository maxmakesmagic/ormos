 Mike Rosenberg is a writer and gamer and has been part of the Magic text coverage team since 2011. He joined Wizards as organized play’s content specialist in June 2014. 






The *Magic Online* Championship features the sixteen players who qualified through success in last year's *Magic Online* Championship Series (MOCS) events, either by making it to the finals of one of last year's quarterly MOCS Playoff events or by amassing enough Leaderboard Points through last year's MOCS tournaments to qualify.


Those players will be traveling to Wizards HQ to compete in a three-day tournament March 3–5 on *Magic Online* for their share of a $116,000 prize pool. Simply competing in the event will earn them $4,000, but the winner will receive $25,000, an invitation to compete in the 2017 *Magic: The Gathering* World Championship, an invitation to compete in next year's *Magic Online* Championship, and Platinum status in the Pro Tour Players Club.


The Tournament
==============


The *Magic Online* Championship features fourteen rounds of Swiss across the first two days of competition. Both days will start with three rounds of *Aether Revolt*-*Kaladesh* Booster Draft and will be followed by four rounds of Standard Constructed.


At the end of fourteen rounds of Swiss, the field will cut down to the Top 4 players, who will compete using their Standard Constructed decks in a best-two-out-of-three *matches* playoff.


The Competitors
===============


Here are this year's competitors.

Coverage
========


We're doing things a bit differently this year for coverage of the *Magic Online* Championship and have turned over the keys to Randy Buehler and Athena Froehlich of Super League fame to bring their coverage model to *Magic Online*'s big tournament.


Randy and Athena, along with the rotating cast of commentators, have become a Tuesday staple on *Magic*'s Twitch channel and have played a key role in *Magic Online* coverage through their seasonal broadcasts. We're excited to work with them to showcase *Magic Online*'s biggest event of the year.


With the Super League model in place, a wider range of commentators will be able to participate in providing coverage of this exciting show, as they call in and commentate remotely while Randy and Athena run the show from Wizards HQ. Expect to see some familiar faces from Tuesday's Super League events, along with a couple special appearances from the *Magic* community, such as:


* David Williams
* Marshall Sutcliffe
* Patrick Chapin
* Patrick Sullivan
* Reid Duke
* Chris Pikula

*Editor's Note: Chris Pikula was added to the commentary roster after this article was published, and has been added to the list above to reflect that announcement.*


Joining the crew on-site will be Maria Bartholdi as the floor reporter and interviewer. She'll talk to *Magic Online* Championship competitors between rounds and report on how their tournament is going.


You'll be able to catch all three days of the *Magic Online* Championship on [twitch.tv/magic](https://www.twitch.tv/magic), March 3–5, so be sure to tune in!


The *Magic Online* Championship is sure to be a great event, and I look forward to seeing all the competitors here at Wizards HQ, as well as seeing you in our Twitch channel in the coming weeks!
