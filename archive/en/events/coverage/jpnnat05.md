Morofuji, Oiso, Shimura Form Team Japan
=======================================




September 19-21

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/jpnat05/fin.jpg)"Mou kari makka?"


It is a traditional Osakan greeting that literally translated means, "Have you earned money today?"


"Bochi - bochi - denna," would be Takuma Morofuji's reply. Translation: "Not bad at all."


Not bad, indeed! The Fukuoka pharmacist earned himself $20,000 by defeating Jun'ya Iyamaga in a five game finals. Five games and then some actually as it was an unprecedented finals in which the instant replay rule was instituted and the game was backed up with the help of video to rectify an incorrect ruling.


Originally both players in the finals had planned to rescind their invites but now that Takuma was the Japanese National Champion - the tenth time that award has been handed out - he was having second thoughts. Should Takuma be able to play he was have two wingmen that are more than capable. Masashi Oiso won the third/fourth playoff with Ichirou Shimura. With Jun'ya officially rescinding, Ichirou joined the team as well. The new alternate was fifth place finisher Makahito Mihara.
