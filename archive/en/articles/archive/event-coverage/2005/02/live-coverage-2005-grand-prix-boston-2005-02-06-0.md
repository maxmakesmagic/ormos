It's the best nice way to start the second day of a Grand Prix. The undefeated American Osyp Lebedowicz, playing Desire, against one of the Japanese, Kenji Tusumura playing Scepter-Chant. So it should be the classic, tense battle between Combo and Control. ![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gpbost05/fm10_1.jpg)*Osyp set up his table.*They started slowly with Osyp trying a turn two [Sapphire Medallion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sapphire+Medallion). Tsumura had the [Counterspell](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterspell) for it, but had no answer for the next turn [Sunscape Familiar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sunscape+Familiar). So he used [Cunning Wish](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cunning+Wish) to find one. The Familiar bit the dust with a techy [Last Breath](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Last+Breath).

Osyp's land kept coming while Kenji was locked at three mana. That clearly wasn't very good for the Japanese. He had to allow Osyp's card drawing spells because taping out might cost him the game. 

By the time he found his fourth land, Lebedowicz already had seven mana. Tsumura had to make a move: He played [Isochron Scepter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Isochron+Scepter) and got [Orim's Chant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Orim%27s+Chant) on it. When it resolved he probably thought he had the game somewhat under control. 

But he didn't. Osyp fired an end of turn [Turnabout](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Turnabout) on Tsumura's lands. Tapped out the Japanese could only watch in horror as the American went for it. Two [Cloud of Faeries](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloud+of+Faeries), two [Snap](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snap)s, one [Cunning Wish](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cunning+Wish) (for [Brain Freeze](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brain+Freeze)) and two [Brain Freeze](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brain+Freeze)s later... Tsumura was scooping.

Osyp started the game with turn two [Sunscape Familiar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sunscape+Familiar) but Kenji put a stop to any plans of a fast game with a turn two [Isochron Scepter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Isochron+Scepter) on [Orim's Chant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Orim%27s+Chant). Smiling the American [Intuition](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Intuition)ed to put two [Deep Analysis](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deep+Analysis) in his graveyard.

Still the Japanese wasn't in good shape. Sure he had the Scepter out but again his mana was nowhere to be found. He was locked at two lands, limited to using the Scepter on Osyp's upkeep. Calmly the American set up an end of turn [Cunning Wish](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cunning+Wish) to find [Echoing Truth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Echoing+Truth). The Scepter left the table.

Unleashed once again Lebedowicz flexed his Combo muscles. The mana-screwed Kenji Tsumura - by now discarding on his end step - could do little but watch Osyp play [Sapphire Medallion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sapphire+Medallion) and dig deep for the right cards.

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gpbost05/fm10_2.jpg)*Kenji got no love from his deck.*He did find a third mana source, [Chrome Mox](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chrome+Mox), but again Lebedowicz was just about ready to put the game away. He [Intuition](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Intuition)ed for [Turnabout](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Turnabout) walked it into [Counterspell](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterspell), nearly tapping out the Japanese. All he had to fear now was [Mana Leak](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak) or [Orim's Chant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Orim%27s+Chant).

He started going through the motions and when he went for [Mind's Desire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mind%27s+Desire) Tsumura tried [Orim's Chant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Orim%27s+Chant). Osyp used [Cunning Wish](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cunning+Wish) to find [Mana Leak](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak) and he now had the table all to himself.

Desire resolved for four, getting [Merchant Scroll](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Merchant+Scroll). That got [Snap](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snap), which bounced Could of Faeries... and Osyp played another [Mind's Desire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mind%27s+Desire). This time for twelve. Tsumura waited to see the cards, but as soon as he saw some business spells he extended his hand.
