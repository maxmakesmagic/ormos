Almost every European answered Jens Thoren. After this weekend and a second place finish, it seems that the rest of the Magic community will now know just how good he is.


Thoren, a 22 year old student from Sweden, has had a few solid finishes in the past, most notable of which was Top 8 at European Championships. His strategy going into the tournament was to "Draft blue, green and black. Some combination of those colors." I wondered which cards he preferred to draft, and he simply answered, "Rabid Elephant. I like that card a lot." After making the Top 8, Thoren wasn't incredibly inspired by taking a Pro Tour championship trophy home to Sweden. "I just wanted to win my first match, I really didn't have any expectations." Unlike the swiss rounds of the Pro Tour, the Top 8 players know exactly who their first round opponent will be, and can draft their deck accordingly. "I chose my second color to have a chance in my first match." But why draft green/white, a color combination most players avoid like the plague? "I started off in green, but my opponent picked up Second Thoughts and Healers, and I wanted to go into white to get some Shelters."


As far as preparation is concerned, Thoren has surrounded himself with good company. He is a member of Team Punisher, which includes Johan Sadeghpour, Mattias Kettil, Tomi Walamies, Anton Jonsson and Mattias Jorstedt. "We draft a lot once a week and I played a lot of Magic Online." It obviously paid off, as Thoren was able to reach the finals with a deck archetype most players avoid no matter what. It's safe to say that Jens Thoren is no longer "the most overrated player". He has arrived.
