[A*gents of Artifice*](/en/articles/archive/agents-artifice-sneak-preview-2009-01-05), the first planeswalker novel, releases on January 27 and that's just one week away. In honor of the event we are pleased to present the first of three web comics featuring Tezzeret, one of the three planeswalkers you'll be able to read about in *Agents of Artifice.*


So sit back, enjoy Web Comic Tuesday, and we'll see you back here over the following Tuesdays as the story unfolds and the book hits some shelves somewhere near you soon.
