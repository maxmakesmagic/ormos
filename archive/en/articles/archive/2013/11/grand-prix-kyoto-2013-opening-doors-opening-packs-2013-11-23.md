Grand Prix Kyoto 2013 - Opening Doors by Opening Packs
======================================================

Team Sealed Deck is an interesting affair. The addition of extra packs to the card pool adds a level of complexity that is unseen in individual Sealed Deck. Linear strategies, like devotion, require a critical mass of the appropriate cards to run, thus are often relegated to Booster Draft or Constructed formats. In Team Sealed, they offer a serious avenue of thought. After all, if you are trying to divide up five colors between three decks, it becomes much easier when one of the deck only lays claim to one color. Even strategies like heroic, which aren't strictly linear, benefit from the additional cards. In individual Sealed Deck, cards with heroic are effectively cards with upside, as opposed to the focus of a deck. With access to so many more cards, though, it is easier to approach them as the foundation for a deck as opposed to ornaments.


Considering this, I was really hoping for some sweet devotion decks with five copies of Gray Merchant of Asphodel, or decks with all of the Wingsteed Riders. I sifted through hundreds of Japanese Decklists (not an easy task when you don't speak much Japanese), looking for these diamonds in the rough. Instead, I found very few decks with more than two of a given common or uncommon. Instead, I saw a plethora of "fair" card pools, each with its own unique take on how to disburse their cards. Without the stupid multi-Gray Merchant decks floating around, I figured it might be a bit harder to make devotion work. True, many players shied away from purely monocolored decks. Yet there were a few who either tried to wedge their decks into that mold, or at least splashed for a couple of cards, so as not to dilute the average power level of their deck.


 


Playing cards like Returned Phalanx without the ability to activate it or cards like Fleshmad Steed and Asphodel Wanderer are a bit of a stretch in a format with a higher average power per deck, yet I saw many attempts to maintain decks as close to mono-black as possible that looked just like this. It's hard to say how right or wrong these decisions were, as the allowed considerably more freedom to the other two decks to come from the pool. Don't forget: there are three decks to consider. If making this deck marginally worse makes the other two significantly better, the average power level of all three decks goes up, making the decision clearly worthwhile.


I figured that mono-black would be the most likely devotion deck to appear, mostly because of the strength of Gray Merchant and the abundance of removal. Interestingly, I was wrong. The most common mono-colored decks I saw, and the ones that were most consistently purely one color, were the green decks.


Here's a look at one:


 


Decks like this make me smile. Unlike the mono-black deck shown above, even the "bad" green cards are still pretty reasonable. It even has removal in the form of a pair of Time to Feeds. This deck is saucy. It has the ramp associated with green, the fat associated with green, and a bit of versatility to back it up. It may not have the same ability to deal with scary cards (which you will face in Team Sealed), but it has a higher overall power level than the previous deck.


Speaking of power level, another set of decks to greatly benefit from the addition of extra cards are the heroic decks. In individual Limited formats, you are fortunate if you are able to pick up five or six good heroic creatures for your deck. With access to so many more packs, the number of heroic cards you are able to cram in your deck goes up and up. This, in turn, makes all of your bestow creatures and heroic-enabling spells that much better.


Here's a look at a red/white heroic deck I found in the pools:


 


This deck has got some very powerful cards in it. While it only has six heroic cards in it, two of them are powerful rares, two of them are one of the best uncommons in the set, and two of them are Wingsteed Riders. That's a sick complement of creatures. The deck has an insane complement of enablers, as well, with some great bestow creatures, a pair of Battlefield Valors, and a couple of Chosen of Heliods to help smooth things out. Sure, there are some other creatures thrown in for curve considerations, but the deck seems quite strong.


Here's another, this time using blue instead of red:


 


This deck has a lot it can do on turn two, which is incredibly important in this powerful *Theros* Team Sealed Deck format. While the Setassan Battle Priests aren't particularly powerful, the presence of so many good bestow creatures in this deck makes them considerably better. This deck lacks some of the bomb power that the previous deck possessed, but it has a much more powerful late game with the additional fliers, Evangel, and the undervalued Aqueous Form. I'm not sure which of the two I'd prefer, but it's clear that these decks are far more focused and stronger than their counterparts in Individual Sealed Deck would be.
