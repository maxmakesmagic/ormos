Brandon Bercovich and Nathan Holiday sat down for what has been a classic Standard match-up between the two popular Devotion strategies of the Constructed format: black versus blue. Oftentimes the match-up has a lot of weight placed on who can be on the play, favoring who can get their spells online first. 


Holiday, who entered today undefeated and sat at the second seed, had the luxury to choosing this preferred option of being on the play. 



**The Games**




 Holiday had a back-breaking start with [Tidebinder Mage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tidebinder+Mage), [Thassa, God of the Sea](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thassa%2C+God+of+the+Sea), and his one main-deck copy of Domesication for Bercovich's [Nightveil Specter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nightveil+Specter) on the second through fourth turns, prompting Bercovich to burn a [Hero's Downfall](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hero%27s+Downfall) on his stolen creature to prevent himself from an early demise.
