Andy Wolf (USA) vs. Kyle Rose (USA)


In the first round of the second day, Americans Andy Wolf and Kyle Rose faced each other at the feature match table. Both of them played a red and blue Academy decks, but while Rose won by playing a Phyrexian Processor or a Phyrexian Colossus, Wolf's win cards were Karn, Silver Golem and Pyromancy.

Wolf won the die roll and chose to play first, but Rose got out the first Tolarian Academy. Both players cast various artifacts, but Rose got out a turn four Phyrexian Processor, paid seven life, and put immediate pressure on Wolf.


Wolf cast a Ring of Gix and so he was able to prevent the first Minion Token from attacking. Karn, Silver Golem blocked the second one, but Rose got out a third one, and as if that wasn't enough, he also Tinkered for a Phyrexian Colossus.


On the other side of the table, Wolf cast another Ring of Gix to try and stall Rose's nasty horde, but Rose played Wildfire to get rid of Karn and attacked with two Processor Tokens and the Phyrexian Colossus to win the game.


Wolf 0 - Rose 1


Wolf chose to go first in the second game as well, and this time, he was able to play a Tolarian Academy before Rose. He cast a turn two Voltaic Key and a turn three Worn Powerstone.


Rose, on the other hand, had other plans. He got out a turn two Temporal Aperture that would eventually be pretty important in the duel, and then he played a turn three Rack and Ruin, destroying Wolf's Key and Powerstone.


Wolf, shaken but not stirred, cast a Ring of Gix, but Rose effectively got rid of it by playing a Viashino Heretic. In order to deal with the Heretic, Wolf had to sacrifice the Ring as he didn't have enough mana to both pay the echo and to cast Arc Lightning.


At this point, the game was pretty open. Wolf attacked once with his Ghitu Encampment, while Rose wasted a Tolarian Academy to activate his Temporal Aperture. His first try netted him another Tolarian Academy. This, he wasted to try again, getting an Island. But on the third try, he got a Confiscate, taking Wolf's Academy.


Wolf had by then drawn his Pyromancy, and he cast it, but it was a bit too late as Rose had enough mana to play a Phyrexian Colossus. An Avalanche Riders killed Wolf's Ghitu Encampment, and his own Encampment joined the Colossus and the Darwin Kastle in an attack where they hit Wolf down to eight life. Then Rose cast a Voltaic Key, the last nail in Wolf's coffin.


Wolf managed to get Rose down to twelve by activating Pyromancy, and then he cast a Ring of Gix, but of course, that wasn't enough. Rose even had another Avalanche Riders that he cast, and then he untapped his Colossus with the Key. Of course, Wolf tapped it again with the Ring, but Rose just had to pay eight life to untap it again and attack for the victory.


Wolf 0 - Rose 2
