Saturday is more than just Day 1 of Grand Prix Indianapolis. In the United States, it’s also Halloween, and *Magic* players love to celebrate the holiday by dressing up and doing flashback *Innistrad* drafts on *Magic Online* (not necessarily in that order).


This weekend, tournament attendees didn’t let the opportunity go to waste. Judges passed out candy at the beginning of every round, and more than a few players arrived to the Grand Prix ready to celebrate the occasion.

*Prolific Magic author and competitor Jarvis Yu tries to run from his friends, who drag him back for a photo. Yu’s friends surprised him at the start of Round 2, gathering around the pairings board all dressed as Yu, complete with the full range of possibilities including “golfer Jarvis” and “handsome Jarvis.”*
