We've chipped a bit more chilly content for you out of the glaciers of northwestern Terisiare, and hung them out to dry on the [*Coldsnap* minisite](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=magic/coldsnap/home). Here's what we found:

* NOW: “The Battle of Kjeldor”: Original fiction by *Coldsna*p flavor text writer Monty Ashley, featuring more art from *Coldsnap*!
* NOW: Volume 2 of 2 of that meticulously-scanned classic *Ice Age* comic!
* LATER: Original fiction by *Coldsnap* flavor text writer Adam Lee!
