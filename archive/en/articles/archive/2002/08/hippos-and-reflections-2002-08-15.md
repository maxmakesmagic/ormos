There are 13 cards in *Invasion* and *Planeshift* combined that create creature tokens. Most of their offspring are covered by the fine people in [Player Rewards](http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=mtgcom/arcana/103), from [Assault/Battery](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Assault%252FBattery)'s Elephant to [Aura Mutation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aura+Mutation)'s Saprolings to [March of Souls](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=March+of+Souls)' Spirits.


But there are two token makers--one in each set--that produce tokens for which real physical versions do not exist: [Pure Reflection](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pure+Reflection) and [Questing Phelddagrif](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Questing+Phelddagrif).


Just as we [showed earlier](/en/articles/archive/unseen-tokens-2002-07-30) for a few *Judgment* cards, these tokens do have art associated with them, art that is visible in [***Magic** Online*](http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=magic/magiconline). If you create a Reflection or Hippo token online, here's what you'll see:
