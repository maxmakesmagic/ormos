Former Player of the Year (2011) Owen Turtenwald won [Grand Prix Washington DC](/en/events/coverage/turtenwald-finally-triumphant-dc) last weekend, beating a tough Top 8 that included Top 25 players Craig Wescoe and Sam Black, as well as longtime pro Andrew Cuneo. The best part of this story, though, is that DC was Owen's first GP win but his *thirteenth* Top 8 appearance, demonstrating that, in **Magic**, you should never give up! Congratulations, Owen! If you're inspired by Owen's perseverance and want to join him in the pro ranks, you can get your start at a local PTQ, which you can find with [this handy link](https://www.wizards.com/Magic/TCG/Events.aspx?x=mtg/event/protour/qualifierlist#bog)! Good luck; have fun!
