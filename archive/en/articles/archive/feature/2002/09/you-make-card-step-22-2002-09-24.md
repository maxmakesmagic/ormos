Well, the votes are in and no one name managed to run off with the victory. This means that the top three vote-getters will have a runoff to see what [Mr. Babycakes](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=magic/images/mtgcom/fcpics/features/MrBabyCakes6.jpg) will officially be called. Those names are: (in alphabetical order)

* Evolutionary Force
* Forgotten Ancient
* Verdant Nexus

The deadline for the run-off is midnight (EDT), Sunday, September 29th, and afterwards we'll vote for the winning flavor text.

We are in the home stretch of "[You Make the Card](http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=mtgcom/columnarchive&column=youmakethecard)." If you haven't participated yet, I highly encourage you to cast a vote.
