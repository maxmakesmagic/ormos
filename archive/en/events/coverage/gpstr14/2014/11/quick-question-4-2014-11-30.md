***Willy Edel:** I think the best team I saw was Canada or Switzerland. They are the favorites; my personal favorite would be Brazil.*

***Paulo Vitor Damo da Rosa:** Hopefully Brazil.*

***Shahar Shenhar:** I'm on it, so it has to be Team Israel. But since we're working together with Denmark and Sweden, those guys also have a good shot.*
