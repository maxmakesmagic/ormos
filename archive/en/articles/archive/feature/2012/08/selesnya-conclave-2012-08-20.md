Selesnya Conclave
**My Belief. My People. My Guild.**
The Selesnya guild sees itself as the voice of Mat’Selesnya, a mysterious consciousness they believe to be the manifestation of nature itself. All within the guild are considered mouthpieces of that singular voice, and they seek to expand their guild by evangelizing their message and adding members. The Selesnya message is personal as well as public: individuals must silence their own consciousness in order to hear the will of their guildmaster, a three-headed dryad who is the spiritual transmitter of Mat’Selesnya.  
  

The guild’s goal is to subsume the identities of individual members, transforming them into instruments of the Conclave. Selesnya has an immense reach. The guild is spread across Ravnica. Each settlement, called a vernadi, is a small commune built around a central tree and led by a dryad leader. The vernadi expand outward from Vitu-Ghazi, and all are connected through an underground network of roots.

**Trostani, Selesnya’s Voice.** The three-headed dryad Trostani rules the guild from the massive tree known as Vitu-Ghazi. However, the Selesnyans would say that she is ultimately led by the will of Mat’Selesnya. The three heads of Trostani each embody a particular Selesnya value: order, life, and harmony.

**Vitu-Ghazi, the City-Tree.** Although Selesnyans believe power is not centered in any one location, the massive tree of Vitu-Ghazi serves as the focus and guildhall of the Selesnya guild. Other communes reflect the perfect form and structure of Vitu-Ghazi, and its trunk acts as a cathedral for worshippers from all around Ravnica. Suniel the Woodwise, an elf woodshaper, was responsible for healing the damage to Vitu-Ghazi after an assault by the vampire Szadek, then guildmaster of House Dimir. Now an elder within the guild, Suniel is the head architect of Selesnya, overseeing the immense gardens, parks, and arboreal pathways through the great Selesnya forests.
