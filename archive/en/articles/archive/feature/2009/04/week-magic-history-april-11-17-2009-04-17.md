### April 11: *Seventh Edition*

On April 7, 2001, *[Seventh Edition](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/tcg/productarticle.aspx?x=mtg_tcg_seventh_productinfo)* came out, bringing with it the following changes to **Magic**:

* Unusually for a core set, *Seventh Edition* had a plot.This was expressed through lots of new art and carefully deployed flavor text:  


|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Eastern Paladin | Southern Paladin |
* Although the core set was still white-bordered, foils had been introduced to **Magic** in *Urza's Legacy*, and *Seventh Edition* foils had black borders.
* [Serra Angel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Serra+Angel) was back in the core set, which meant that new players had a chance of pulling a black-bordered foil Serra. Hence this ad:
