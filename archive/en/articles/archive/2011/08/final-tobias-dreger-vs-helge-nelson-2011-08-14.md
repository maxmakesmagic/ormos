This is it. The culmination of one weekend of thrilling *Magic*. Three more wins and one of these players would be crowned champion of German Nationals 2011. The match-up was [Pyromancer Ascension](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyromancer+Ascension) played by Tobias Dreger and, on the other side, a deck and a player not many had expected at the beginning of the weekend to end up here. Helge Nelson won a last-chance qualifier on Thursday and made it all the way to the finals with his mono-red deck.



### **Game One**



Dreger won the die-roll and kept his seven, Nelson took two mulligans. Both players had tapped lands on their first turn, [Halimar Depths](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Halimar+Depths) for Dreger, [Teetering Peaks](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Teetering+Peaks) for Nelson.


On turn two, Nelson summoned two [Goblin Guide](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Guide)s, one of which was stopped by [Mana Leak](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak). Dreger cast [Pyromancer Ascension](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyromancer+Ascension) and passed the turn with one [Mountain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mountain) untapped. Nelson used the opportunity and cast [Shrine of Burning Rage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shrine+of+Burning+Rage) as well as a third [Goblin Guide](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Guide). One of the Guides died to [Burst Lightning](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Burst+Lightning), the other got Dreger down to 16.


Dreger cast [Preordain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Preordain), paid 2 life for [Gitaxian Probe](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gitaxian+Probe), saw that the single card in Nelson's hand was [Staggershock](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Staggershock), paid 1 more life to fetch [Island](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island) with [Misty Rainforest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Misty+Rainforest), and cast another [Preordain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Preordain) to put the first counter on [Pyromancer Ascension](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyromancer+Ascension). He passed the turn with no blue mana available, an opportunity Nelson used to resolve [Staggershock](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Staggershock).


[Goblin Guide](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Guide) was hit by [Lightning Bolt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt). Now, since Nelson was tapped out and couldn't use his Shrine, Dreger seized the opportunity and bounced the artifact. He passed the turn with [Mana Leak](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak) mana up. Nelson didn't have much choice and re-cast his Shrine and Dreger did indeed have the [Mana Leak](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak), which also put a second counter on [Pyromancer Ascension](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyromancer+Ascension)


Now on 9 life with a fully-powered Ascension, Dreger looked firmly in control. The game continued for a couple of turns in a flurry of copied [Preordain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Preordain)s, [Ponder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ponder)s, [Gitaxian Probe](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gitaxian+Probe)s, with the occasional [See Beyond](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=See+Beyond) for good measure. Nelson fought back valiantly with [Chandra's Phoenix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chandra%27s+Phoenix), a second [Staggershock](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Staggershock), and [Lightning Bolt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt). And in fact, he did manage to get Dreger down to 4. But when a second [Pyromancer Ascension](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyromancer+Ascension) made its way to the table and was charged in record time, a couple of Lightnings soon finished the game


Tobias Dreger 1 – 0 Helge Nelson


The match-up was about to change considerably, because both players boarded some extremely effective cards, though it was hard to say who gained most from his sideboard.


Nelson's sideboarding:


-4 [Searing Blaze](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Searing+Blaze)  



Dreger's sideboarding:  

-4 [Gitaxian Probe](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gitaxian+Probe)  

-4 [See Beyond](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=See+Beyond)  

-1 [Foresee](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Foresee)  

-1 [Red Sun's Zenith](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Red+Sun%27s+Zenith)  

-2 [Into the Roil](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Into+the+Roil)  

+2 [Batterskull](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Batterskull)  

+4 [Flashfreeze](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flashfreeze)  

+3 [Pyroclasm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyroclasm)  

+3 [Mental Misstep](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mental+Misstep)

### **Game Two**



Both players kept their opening seven, neither had a play on turn one. Turn two, Nelson had [Grim Lavamancer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grim+Lavamancer), whereas Dreger had [Pyromancer Ascension](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyromancer+Ascension). What Dreger lacked, however, was blue mana. Nelson attacked, summoned [Plated Geopede](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plated+Geopede), and played a [Scalding Tarn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scalding+Tarn).


Dreger still didn't have an [Island](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island), but he did have a [Lightning Bolt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt) for the Geopede. Dreger was in dire trouble as Nelson cast [Koth of the Hammer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Koth+of+the+Hammer), which Dreger couldn't stop without blue mana. Dreger killed it with two [Burst Lightning](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Burst+Lightning)s which got him a first counter on [Pyromancer Ascension](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyromancer+Ascension), but not without taking 5 damage on the attack.


Again no [Island](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island), while Nelson made [Hero of Oxid Ridge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hero+of+Oxid+Ridge), exactly when Dreger was out of instant burn. He did have [Pyroclasm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyroclasm) to take out Hero and [Grim Lavamancer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grim+Lavamancer), but Nelson simply untapped, and pointed two [Lightning Bolt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt)s and a [Staggershock](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Staggershock) at Dreger's face


Tobias Dreger 1 – 1 Helge Nelson



### **Game Three**



Dreger's start was much better this time, with [Preordain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Preordain), [Pyromancer Ascension](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyromancer+Ascension), [Preordain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Preordain), [Ponder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ponder), and [Burst Lightning](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Burst+Lightning), all in the first three turns.


Nelson's draw was certainly not bad either, with [Grim Lavamancer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grim+Lavamancer), [Shrine of Burning Rage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shrine+of+Burning+Rage), and [Vulshok Refugee](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vulshok+Refugee). Nelson continued with [Grim Lavamancer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grim+Lavamancer) and left three mana up for [Shrine of Burning Rage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shrine+of+Burning+Rage).


Dreger had [Burst Lightning](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Burst+Lightning) for the [Lavamancer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lavamancer), putting a second counter on his Ascension. But on his turn, when this reporter was expecting a number of spells and copies, Dreger just laid a land and passed. A quick peek at his hand confirmed: he only held red cards, and a [Batterskull](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Batterskull) which was still one turn away from being cast.


[Staggershock](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Staggershock), its rebound, [Vulshok Refugee](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vulshok+Refugee), and [Shrine of Burning Rage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shrine+of+Burning+Rage) ended the game before it ever came to that.


Tobias Dreger 1 – 2 Helge Nelson

### **Game Four**



Nelson had [Goblin Guide](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Guide) on turn one, Dreger had [Mental Misstep](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mental+Misstep). Nelson tried [Shrine of Burning Rage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shrine+of+Burning+Rage), Dreger had [Mana Leak](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak). When he continued to not do anything on his turn, it became clear that Dreger's deck was giving him the full counter suite this time.


Next, he countered [Manabarbs](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Manabarbs) with [Flashfreeze](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flashfreeze), then made a [Pyromancer Ascension](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyromancer+Ascension) and allowed [Chandra's Phoenix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chandra%27s+Phoenix). The Phoenix swung in for 4 thanks to [Teetering Peaks](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Teetering+Peaks) and was joined on the following turn by [Goblin Guide](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Guide). Dreger really had to manage his resources, one of which was [Pyroclasm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyroclasm) and killed both of Nelson's creatures. Another couple of spells were traded against counters which left Dreger with a fully active [Pyromancer Ascension](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyromancer+Ascension), but no cards in hand, to his opponent's [Grim Lavamancer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grim+Lavamancer). He drew his card and made a face of pleasant surprise. Down came [Batterskull](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Batterskull). Nelson found no way to handle the Skull and was competently battered.


Tobias Dreger 2 – 2 Helge Nelson


Dreger made a little adjustment to his deck, switching the third [Pyroclasm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyroclasm) for a third [Into the Roil](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Into+the+Roil).



### **Game Five**



Nelson was happy to play first in the final game, but not too happy with his opening seven, happy enough, though, to keep. Dreger had the first play with [Preordain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Preordain), Nelson had the very important [Shrine of Burning Rage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shrine+of+Burning+Rage). Dreger cast a second [Preordain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Preordain) and triggered his Ascension.


At the end of his turn, Nelson cast [Staggershock](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Staggershock), which Dreger stopped with [Flashfreeze](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flashfreeze). Nelson untapped, played a fourth land and cast [Koth of the Hammer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Koth+of+the+Hammer). On his turn, Dreger cast [Into the Roil](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Into+the+Roil) on [Koth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Koth) and left mana up to be able to counter the planeswalker if needs be. Nelson chose to play [Grim Lavamancer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grim+Lavamancer) instead, leaving mana up for [Shrine of Burning Rage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shrine+of+Burning+Rage), which had six counters already.


Dreger had [Burst Lightning](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Burst+Lightning) for the [Lavamancer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lavamancer), but apart from that all he had left was [Mental Misstep](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mental+Misstep) and [Flashfreeze](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flashfreeze), and nothing with which to advance his [Pyromancer Ascension](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyromancer+Ascension) status. Meanwhile, Nelson was prepared to wait for his Shrine to reach lethality.


[Preordain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Preordain) changed the plans, however, because a) it revved [Pyromancer Ascension](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyromancer+Ascension) and b) found [Into the Roil](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Into+the+Roil). When Dreger cast it on [Shrine of Burning Rage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shrine+of+Burning+Rage), it dealt 9 damage and he went to 6. But now Nelson actually had to fight to get rid of the rest. [Koth of the Hammer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Koth+of+the+Hammer) met [Flashfreeze](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flashfreeze), [Goblin Guide](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Guide), however, went unimpeded directly into the red zone and revealed Dreger's next draw to be [Mana Leak](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak). Nelson cast [Burst Lightning](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Burst+Lightning) to put Dreger at 2. [Mana Leak](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak) didn't really help.


**Tobias Dreger 2 – 3 Helge Nelson**
