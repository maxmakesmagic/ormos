![Mortipede](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Mortipede)First of all, thanks to everyone who felt I was in need of a pep talk after last week's article. I truly wasn't feeling as defensive as I must have come across, nor was I fishing for compliments. Still, people flooded my e-mail inbox and the Message Boards with support for this article's format and my three-week evolutions. It's good to know you're all out there, and it's good to know you're enjoying the column. 
 Speaking of deckbuilding evolutions, [last week](/en/articles/archive/building-budget/drafting-golgari-staring-insects-2006-01-23) I decided to draft myself a Golgari deck as a starting point for a Standard deck. I ended up liking the [Mortipede](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mortipede)-[Gaze of the Gorgon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gaze+of+the+Gorgon) interaction so much that I used it as the major theme for my ensuing deck. After five games and a few card changes, here is where I left off:

![](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Swamp)


















People posted a lot of good feedback on the Boards with regards to cards that don't fit the [Mortipede](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mortipede) idea along with other cards that do fit. Many of these ideas matched my own thoughts as well. Before I can make changes, though, I want to see how this new configuration plays online.


*Game 6: Black/Blue/Green Milling*


![Glimpse the Unthinkable](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Glimpse+the+Unthinkable)This was an interesting game even though I lost. I hit him four times with a [Sakura-Tribe Elder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sakura-Tribe+Elder) while he did nothing but lay land. Eventually I tried to cast a [Bramble Elemental](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bramble+Elemental) and he used [Perplex](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Perplex) on it. All I had in hand was land and a [Last Gasp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Last+Gasp) so I discarded my hand only to see my Elemental die to [Putrefy](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Putrefy). Sigh. Back went my Elder on offense until my opponent put down [Dimir Infiltrator](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dimir+Infiltrator) to block. I then had a [Stinkweed Imp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stinkweed+Imp) on offense while he transmuted another Infiltrator for [Glimpse the Unthinkable](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glimpse+the+Unthinkable). He Glimpsed me once, used [Recollect](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Recollect), then did it again. I played [Vigor Mortis](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vigor+Mortis) on my Elemental and hit him down to nine life before it died to a second [Putrefy](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Putrefy). He transmuted [Muddle the Mixture](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Muddle+the+Mixture) for another Glimpse, and now I was too low on cards in my library to use dredge. I drew a [Trophy Hunter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Trophy+Hunter) to attack with once I killed his Infiltrator with [Last Gasp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Last+Gasp), but my opponent had another [Recollect](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Recollect) and killed my Hunter with [Putrefy](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Putrefy). Another [Glimpse the Unthinkable](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glimpse+the+Unthinkable), and I lost during my next draw phase.
 *Game 7: Green/Black [Doubling Season](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Doubling+Season)*


Another fun game, and another one I lost. I had an early [Sakura-Tribe Elder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sakura-Tribe+Elder) to match his [Elves of Deep Shadow](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elves+of+Deep+Shadow) and [Civic Wayfinder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Civic+Wayfinder). My first [Mortipede](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mortipede) died to [Keening Banshee](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Keening+Banshee), and my second [Mortipede](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mortipede) died to [Last Gasp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Last+Gasp). I put out another Elder, then [Trophy Hunter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Trophy+Hunter) to kill his Banshee. [Brainspoil](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brainspoil) killed my Hunter, but I brought it back with [Vigor Mortis](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vigor+Mortis). He played [Doubling Season](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Doubling+Season), then played his own [Vigor Mortis](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vigor+Mortis) to revive his Banshee and kill my third Elder. I had enough mana to kill his 4/4 Banshee and attack. I followed that up with [Strands of Undeath](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Strands+of+Undeath) to empty his hand. He topdecked [Moldervine Cloak](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Moldervine+Cloak) on his Wayfinder and we stared at each other for awhile. My next two draws were land, though, and his next two draws were [Fists of Ironwood](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fists+of+Ironwood) (four tokens) and [Shambling Shell](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shambling+Shell) (two counters). I died with him at six life.


*Game 8: White/Red Samurai*


![Oathkeeper, Takeno's Daisho](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Oathkeeper%2C+Takeno%27s+Daisho)He got out a [Devoted Retainer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Devoted+Retainer) while I had a [Stinkweed Imp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stinkweed+Imp) and [Mortipede](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mortipede). I took a few hits from the Retainer and eventually cast [Strands of Undeath](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Strands+of+Undeath) on my [Mortipede](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mortipede) with [Regeneration](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Regeneration) mana open. He put [Oathkeeper, Takeno's Daisho](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oathkeeper%2C+Takeno%27s+Daisho) into play, which slowed me down a little, but I had more than enough mana to activate [Mortipede](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mortipede) and regenerate it while still casting creatures. Another [Stinkweed Imp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stinkweed+Imp) came into play, then [Shambling Shell](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shambling+Shell). Luckily, he never put down [Hand of Honor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hand+of+Honor), so my 'Pede cleared away his creatures and the rest of my creatures attacked at their leisure. A [Golgari Rotwurm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Golgari+Rotwurm) showed up to speed up the victory.
 *Game 9: Mono-Blue Control*


My opponent mulliganed to four cards, then got stuck on two lands for several turns. When he tapped out to play [Kraken's Eye](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kraken%27s+Eye), I dropped [Golgari Rotwurm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Golgari+Rotwurm). After I hit him once with the Rotwurm, I tried [Strands of Undeath](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Strands+of+Undeath) on it but he had found a third land for [Hinder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hinder). A fourth Island showed up, bringing [Mystic Restraints](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mystic+Restraints), so I sacrificed my Rotwurm. [Helldozer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Helldozer) hit the table next. The Dozer hit my opponent once, twice, and when he tapped out for [Higure, the Still Wind](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Higure%2C+the+Still+Wind) to block, I had [Disembowel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Disembowel) for the win.


*Game 10: Black/Blue Ninja*


I played a quick [Golgari Signet](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Golgari+Signet), then [Greater Mossdog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Greater+Mossdog), then [Golgari Germination](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Golgari+Germination). My opponent had two [Dimir Signet](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dimir+Signet)s and [Dark Confidant](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dark+Confidant). I killed it with [Last Gasp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Last+Gasp), then played [Sakura-Tribe Elder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sakura-Tribe+Elder). He played a second Confidant. I was sort of hoping he would attack with it so that I could sacrifice my Elder for a Saproling token to block, but he never fell for it and instead drew two land off of his Confidant. [Ninja of the Deep Hours](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ninja+of+the+Deep+Hours) showed up next while I played [Trophy Hunter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Trophy+Hunter) (I sure draw him a lot for only one copy in my deck... and I *still* have barely drawn [Gaze of the Gorgon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gaze+of+the+Gorgon)). He double-blocked my Hunter, but I [Disembowel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Disembowel)ed his Confidant before damage was assigned. That was pretty much game, and my next attack sealed the victory.

Okay, the deck is still winning, which is a nice bonus. As odd as it may sound, though, it's not winning in the ways I would want it to win. Game 8 is the only one of the bunch in which my deck played the way I had hoped it would when settling on [Mortipede](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mortipede) as an idea. The other two victories were because of cards I consider pretty non-essential, and my losses were to cards that should probably be in my deck. Time, I'd say, for a change or two...


*OUT*: 1 [Junktroller](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Junktroller)


The two problems with [Junktroller](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Junktroller) are that it can't attack and has zero power. Yes, it helps stall while I find the mana for [Mortipede](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mortipede) and its tricks, and yes, it can help reload my deck with cards like [Last Gasp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Last+Gasp) and [Gaze of the Gorgon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gaze+of+the+Gorgon). Yet this is pretty minor compensation for a four-mana, non-flying, 0/6 defender that will never kill opposing attackers. [Will-o'-the-Wisp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Will-o%27-the-Wisp) provides more reliable defense for one mana, and [Dancing Scimitar](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dancing+Scimitar) is both more intimidating and able to attack for the same cost. Neither of these cards feel like a good fit for the deck I'm making, which means that [Junktroller](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Junktroller) is definitely out. As for the graveyeard-restocking stuff, [Recollect](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Recollect) would be an overall better card for this effect if I feel I have room for it.


*OUT*: 1 [Bramble Elemental](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bramble+Elemental)


[Bramble Elemental](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bramble+Elemental) is a tougher card to drop than you might think. I've fantasized through seven draft games and ten Standard games about enchanting my Elemental with [Strands of Undeath](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Strands+of+Undeath). It's never happened, which is no surprise given that there's only one Elemental and three Strands. So now I have to decide whether to add more auras and additional copies of [Bramble Elemental](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bramble+Elemental) or drop my lone copy. Both [Fists of Ironwood](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fists+of+Ironwood) and [Moldervine Cloak](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Moldervine+Cloak) sound juicy for a [Mortipede](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mortipede) deck, and for about an hour I thought this was the direction I would go. The thing is, my deck already has a pretty high mana curve, so adding cards of five or more mana sounds suspiciously like a death knell. It's easiest to drop one Elemental than do a bunch of deck gymnastics to have it succeed in my deck. [Moldervine Cloak](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Moldervine+Cloak), though... Yummy. I may have to come back to this idea.


*OUT*: 3 [Stinkweed Imp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stinkweed+Imp)


Could I really be dropping [Stinkweed Imp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stinkweed+Imp)? The Imp is a strong Standard card for defense and for filling my graveyard, and one I find myself using in a bunch of different deck ideas. What I'm realizing more and more, though, is that I'm afraid to use dredge with this deck. I don't want [Mortipede](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mortipede) to get milled into my graveyard, or [Last Gasp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Last+Gasp), or [Vigor Mortis](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vigor+Mortis), or [Gaze of the Gorgon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gaze+of+the+Gorgon), or [Strands of Undeath](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Strands+of+Undeath), or... You get the idea. Dredge, I'm realizing, in general is sort of a scary proposition for my deck, and a dredge cost of five is darned near terrifying. The question for me is whether this spells doom for the other dredge cards in the deck, [Shambling Shell](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shambling+Shell) and [Greater Mossdog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Greater+Mossdog). See? I told you two weeks ago that whatever Golgari deck I made wouldn't be the normal dredge-focused fare.


*IN*: 4 [Shinen of Life's Roar](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shinen+of+Life%27s+Roar)


![Shinen of Life's Roar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Shinen+of+Life%27s+Roar)You had to have seen this one coming. It's a [Mortipede](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mortipede)-inspired deck, people, which means it's built to make [Lure](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lure) effects dangerous. Folks on last week's boards said as much. [Shinen of Life's Roar](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shinen+of+Life%27s+Roar) is not only the cheapest [Lure](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lure) creature in Standard, but it can be channeled to give any other creature in the deck [Lure](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lure). It's a great target for [Vigor Mortis](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vigor+Mortis) once it dies, or for [Shambling Shell](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shambling+Shell) counters, [Strands of Undeath](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Strands+of+Undeath), and [Gaze of the Gorgon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gaze+of+the+Gorgon) while alive. If the deck adds any other ways to make [Mortipede](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mortipede) effective, it will enhance the Shinen as well. This makes the deck less of a [Mortipede](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mortipede) deck, in fact, and more of a [Lure](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lure) deck. I like this better because it places the emphasis on the mechanic more than four cards in a sixty-card deck without tutors and card-drawing.
 *IN*: 1 [Vigor Mortis](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vigor+Mortis)


I keep coming back to the fact that it was the first card that I picked in my draft deck and that every time I play it I smile. Using it on [Shinen of Life's Roar](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shinen+of+Life%27s+Roar) sounds pretty good as well. I suppose the deck might start to get crowded enough to make [Vigor Mortis](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vigor+Mortis) unseemly, but right now I want to draw more copies rather than less. 


My deck now looks like this:

![](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Swamp)


















Now I'll hop back into the Casual Decks room of ***Magic** Online* to see how the deck performs. 


*Game 11: Blue/Black Reanimator Control*


![Clutch of the Undercity](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Clutch+of+the+Undercity)It's amazing that I did so well against his powerhouse deck. I started off with [Sakura-Tribe Elder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sakura-Tribe+Elder) and [Golgari Germination](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Golgari+Germination) while he had [Necroplasm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Necroplasm). I killed his Ooze with [Last Gasp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Last+Gasp) and cast [Shambling Shell](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shambling+Shell) to keep hitting him for damage. He [Mana Leak](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak)ed a [Mortipede](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mortipede), then tapped out to cast [Kokusho, the Evening Star](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kokusho%2C+the+Evening+Star). I used the opportunity to cast [Helldozer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Helldozer). He attacked, I attacked, then he played [Keiga, the Tide Star](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Keiga%2C+the+Tide+Star). Hm. After thinking awhile, I put [Strands of Undeath](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Strands+of+Undeath) on his Dragon, figuring that I could regenerate it and keep him from stealing a creature. The discard made him drop his last two cards: [Clone](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Clone) and [Zombify](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Zombify). He attacked me down for three and topdecked [Clutch of the Undercity](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Clutch+of+the+Undercity), killing me the turn before I would have won. 
 *Game 12: Black/Blue Dimir Mill*


I guess it was a milling deck, since it used [Circu, Dimir Lobotomist](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Circu%2C+Dimir+Lobotomist) and [Psychic Drain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psychic+Drain). Then again, it also used [Umezawa's Jitte](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Umezawa%27s+Jitte), so go figure. Anyway, I played a [Sakura-Tribe Elder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sakura-Tribe+Elder) and [Civic Wayfinder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Civic+Wayfinder) into play then got two [Mortipede](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mortipede)s countered by two [Mana Leak](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak)s. My opponent played Circu and made me discard two cards via [Consult the Necrosages](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Consult+the+Necrosages). I topdecked [Golgari Rotwurm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Golgari+Rotwurm) and started attacking. After he [Psychic Drain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psychic+Drain)ed me for four, I drew [Last Gasp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Last+Gasp) to kill his legend. He played Jitte, I played [Strands of Undeath](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Strands+of+Undeath) to make him discard [Mikokoro, Center of the Sea](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mikokoro%2C+Center+of+the+Sea) and [Szadek, Lord of Secrets](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Szadek%2C+Lord+of+Secrets). Two more attacks and he was dead.


*Game 13: White/Green Weenie*


For the third straight game, I had a turn 2 [Sakura-Tribe Elder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sakura-Tribe+Elder). I killed his second-turn [Selesnya Guildmage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Selesnya+Guildmage) with [Last Gasp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Last+Gasp), then cast [Shambling Shell](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shambling+Shell) and [Greater Mossdog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Greater+Mossdog). He made a [Phytohydra](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phytohydra), but I had another [Last Gasp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Last+Gasp) to kill it. After that, I enchanted my Mossdog with [Strands of Undeath](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Strands+of+Undeath), making my opponent discard [Lure](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lure)(!) and [Naturalize](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Naturalize). I attacked with my Shell and Mossdog. He drew land. I attacked again, dropping him to four life. He drew, looked at his card, and conceded.


*Game 14: White/Red Boros Weenie*


He had a [Sensei Golden-Tail](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sensei+Golden-Tail) and I had a [Greater Mossdog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Greater+Mossdog). A [Boros Swiftblade](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Boros+Swiftblade) learned bushido while I enchanted my Mossdog with [Strands of Undeath](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Strands+of+Undeath) to hold it off. A [Skyknight Legionnaire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skyknight+Legionnaire) hit me, but as least I had stalled his ground attack. Things got better for me when I played [Shinen of Life's Roar](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shinen+of+Life%27s+Roar), then killed his Swiftblade and Sensei with [Gaze of the Gorgon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gaze+of+the+Gorgon). A second Legionnaire joined the party, while I drew and played [Mortipede](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mortipede). I hit him down to four life, praying for a [Last Gasp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Last+Gasp). Instead I drew [Vigor Mortis](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vigor+Mortis), which didn't help against his fliers so I died on his next attack. I guess [Lure](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lure) effects don't help as much when an opponent is using flying creatures with haste.


*Game 15: Mono-White Token deck*


![Spiritual Visit](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Spiritual+Visit)n8ivebear had one freaky (and cool) deck. It was built around [Spiritual Visit](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spiritual+Visit), a bunch of arcane cards, [Ronin Warclub](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ronin+Warclub), and [Twilight Drover](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Twilight+Drover), with [Charge Across the Araba](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Charge+Across+the+Araba) as a finisher. Like I said: Weird. Anyway, the game went forever. He would get some tokens and I would kill them and keep attacking with two [Sakura-Tribe Elder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sakura-Tribe+Elder)s. I got a [Shinen of Life's Roar](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shinen+of+Life%27s+Roar), but n8ivebear used [Faith's Fetters](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Faith%27s+Fetters) on it. I then got a [Mortipede](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mortipede) to see a second Fetters. A second Shinen died to [Terashi's Verdict](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Terashi%27s+Verdict). A second [Mortipede](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mortipede) died to [Devouring Light](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Devouring+Light). [Shambling Shell](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shambling+Shell) attacked, died, came back, attacked, and died for awhile. Eventually I used [Vigor Mortis](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vigor+Mortis) on [Helldozer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Helldozer) (put in my graveyard from dredge), but I [Fear](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fear)ed [Devouring Light](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Devouring+Light) and [Terashi's Verdict](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Terashi%27s+Verdict), so I spent time blowing up his land. He played [Twilight Drover](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Twilight+Drover) and two [Ronin Warclub](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ronin+Warclub)s, and I found another [Vigor Mortis](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vigor+Mortis) for [Trophy Hunter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Trophy+Hunter). I killed his flying tokens before the Warclubs could equip. At this point I had a 10/9 [Helldozer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Helldozer) from [Shambling Shell](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shambling+Shell) tokens and a 7/8 Hunter from Spirit token deaths. n8ivebear played a [Charge Across the Araba](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Charge+Across+the+Araba) and dropped me to five life, leaving himself only one land. Since he didn't kill me, though, I could attack with my beefy fatties and use [Shambling Shell](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shambling+Shell) to block. Two attack phases later, I had won.
 Okay, so things are looking up. [Strands of Undeath](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Strands+of+Undeath), [Gaze of the Gorgon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gaze+of+the+Gorgon), and [Lure](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lure) critters are starting to play heavily into games. Right now I'm more certain about what I want to take out of the deck than what I want to add. Basically I'm going to look at taking out the cards that don't play into the [Lure](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lure) vibe and use those slots to patch a few holes I see in the deck. After that, I think that I will have nullified most of the “noise” distracting me from [Mortipede](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mortipede) and I'll be better able to decide what my deck needs to increase its winning percentage. 


*OUT*: 1 [Greater Mossdog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Greater+Mossdog)


I sort of telegraphed this move earlier by saying that dredge has less of a place in my deck than most Golgari decks. [Greater Mossdog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Greater+Mossdog) is certainly a solid creature choice as [Hill Giant](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hill+Giant)s go, but he's basically playing the role of filler in my deck, and while a 3/3 body is nice to have around, I can certainly do without more four-mana cards. [Strands of Undeath](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Strands+of+Undeath), [Gaze of the Gorgon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gaze+of+the+Gorgon), and [Vigor Mortis](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vigor+Mortis) all make [Mortipede](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mortipede) and [Shinen of Life's Roar](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shinen+of+Life%27s+Roar) better. [Greater Mossdog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Greater+Mossdog)... not so much.


*OUT*: 2 [Golgari Signet](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Golgari+Signet)


[Golgari Signet](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Golgari+Signet), [Selesnya Signet](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Selesnya+Signet), [Gruul Signet](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gruul+Signet), and Simic Signet have much less chance of being used in Constructed decks over their other guild counterparts. Why? Because any deck relying on Green automatically has access to the best mana-acceleration and fixing in the game. [Sakura-Tribe Elder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sakura-Tribe+Elder), [Kodama's Reach](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kodama%27s+Reach), [Llanowar Elves](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Llanowar+Elves), [Elves of Deep Shadow](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elves+of+Deep+Shadow), [Birds of Paradise](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Birds+of+Paradise), [Utopia Tree](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Utopia+Tree), [Rampant Growth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rampant+Growth), [Farseek](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Farseek), [Civic Wayfinder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Civic+Wayfinder), etc. etc. etc. - These cards provide significant benefits other than just mana-acceleration and mana-fixing, either because they're creatures or because they thin land from your deck or both. I added the second Signet last week because I was only adding cards already in the deck and knew that I need some sort of mana-acceleration in a deck relying on expensive spells. Now I'm not worrying about such restrictions and can think about what mana-acceleration, if any, I want besides [Sakura-Tribe Elder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sakura-Tribe+Elder). 


*IN*: 3 [Civic Wayfinder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Civic+Wayfinder)


So why [Civic Wayfinder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Civic+Wayfinder)? First, it has a respectable body for three mana, able to both attack and block with some effectiveness. This is important for a deck using auras and other effects that require me to attack and/or block with my creatures. Second, I'm almost guaranteed to reach four mana once I've successfully cast a Wayfinder, which isn't true for, say, [Llanowar Elves](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Llanowar+Elves) or [Rampant Growth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rampant+Growth). Finally, it has a comes-into-play effect that is a nice bonus for a deck using reanimation like [Vigor Mortis](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vigor+Mortis) and the other card I'm adding in this round of changes (see below). I'm guessing that between [Sakura-Tribe Elder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sakura-Tribe+Elder), [Civic Wayfinder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Civic+Wayfinder), and twenty-four land that I have plenty of mana to play my tricks. In fact, I may find myself mana-flooded now, which is something to watch.


*OUT*: 1 [Golgari Germination](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Golgari+Germination)


[Golgari Germination](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Golgari+Germination) actually has nice synergy with some of the cards I'm using. If my [Lure](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lure) creatures are going to die, it's comforting to get something back for them. [Sakura-Tribe Elder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sakura-Tribe+Elder) gives me instant-speed blockers if I need them, and extra tokens are always a welcome addition to a deck hoping to win through creature damage. The problem is that [Golgari Germination](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Golgari+Germination) doesn't have *enough* synergy with my overall game plan. It doesn't fill a particular hole or need for the deck in the same way [Civic Wayfinder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Civic+Wayfinder) does, nor does it directly benefit my [Lure](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lure) tactic. This makes the Germination a “nice to have” and “fun when it shows up” sort of card, but not something upon which I'm particularly relying.


*OUT*: 1 [Golgari Rotwurm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Golgari+Rotwurm)


![Golgari Guildmage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Golgari+Guildmage)With [Scatter the Seeds](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scatter+the+Seeds) and [Golgari Germination](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Golgari+Germination) out of the deck, [Golgari Rotwurm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Golgari+Rotwurm) loses a lot of its appeal. It's still a good, beefy body for its cost, and its self-sacrifice ability is certainly welcome for a deck using [Vigor Mortis](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vigor+Mortis). That said, the deck has bent away from the Rotwurm as a theme, which was evident when I dropped [Thoughtpicker Witch](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtpicker+Witch) from the deck. Much like [Golgari Germination](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Golgari+Germination), I now find that the Rotwurm is good in my deck, but not great. It remains to be seen, I suppose, if I've just neutered a lot of the deck's power by stripping it of beefy critters like [Bramble Elemental](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bramble+Elemental), [Greater Mossdog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Greater+Mossdog), and [Golgari Rotwurm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Golgari+Rotwurm). 
 *IN*: 2 [Golgari Guildmage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Golgari+Guildmage)


This may be too preemptive, but I'm thinking that with all of the mana I'm likely to have access to that [Golgari Guildmage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Golgari+Guildmage) will be a welcome addition to the deck. It directly enhances the effectiveness of my [Lure](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lure) creatures with both of its abilities, and it gives me something to cast early in the game. I also like that I'm upping the creature count in my deck since I'm still relying on cards like [Strands of Undeath](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Strands+of+Undeath) and [Gaze of the Gorgon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gaze+of+the+Gorgon) to not sit in my hand uselessly. If I like these two copies, I can easily see adding one or two more.


The deck feels like it's coming along. As I said, I feel like I've now gotten rid of the “noise” in the deck and can focus on maximizing its central themes.

*Game 16: Green/Red Beatdown*


My opponent had a [Sakura-Tribe Scout](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sakura-Tribe+Scout) and [Sakura-Tribe Elder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sakura-Tribe+Elder) while I had [Civic Wayfinder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Civic+Wayfinder) and [Shambling Shell](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shambling+Shell). He blocked my Wayfinder, then killed it with [Shock](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shock) after I put a +1/+1 counter on it. Both sides of the table were now clear. He filled the void with [Sokenzan Bruiser](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sokenzan+Bruiser) while I played [Mortipede](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mortipede), then enchanted it with [Strands of Undeath](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Strands+of+Undeath). He blew his last card in hand - a [Naturalize](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Naturalize) - to kill my Strands, and for awhile we beat on each other with our two creatures. I had a ton of land, so when I drew [Golgari Guildmage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Golgari+Guildmage), the game started to swing my way. [Shambling Shell](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shambling+Shell) started recurring while the Guildmage kept adding counters to my Insect, and by the end of the game I had a 9/6 [Mortipede](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mortipede) and won.


*Game 17: Green/White Selesnya tokens*


I kept a hand with [Shinen of Life's Roar](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shinen+of+Life%27s+Roar), three [Civic Wayfinder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Civic+Wayfinder)s, [Gaze of the Gorgon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gaze+of+the+Gorgon), a Forest and a Swamp. I missed my third land drop, but the good news was that my Shinen ate his [Llanowar Elves](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Llanowar+Elves) and reminded my opponent that playing 1/1 guys wasn't a good idea. I think the Shinen paralyzed him, or at least stalled him long enough for me to find my third land and start pumping out [Civic Wayfinder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Civic+Wayfinder)s. He played [Fists of Ironwood](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fists+of+Ironwood) on my Shinen and killed it with both tokens, but I played [Vigor Mortis](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vigor+Mortis). [Sosuke, Son of Seshiro](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sosuke%2C+Son+of+Seshiro) eventually killed my Shinen for good, but not before I had played all three Wayfinders, plus [Shambling Shell](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shambling+Shell) and [Mortipede](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mortipede). Neither [Scatter the Seeds](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scatter+the+Seeds) nor Vitu-Ghazi, the City Tree would save him, and my opponent quickly lost.


*Game 18: Green/Blue Aggro-Control*


Oh man was this a cool game. He had a first-turn [Traproot Kami](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Traproot+Kami) while I had a [Sakura-Tribe Elder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sakura-Tribe+Elder), [Civic Wayfinder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Civic+Wayfinder), then [Shinen of Life's Roar](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shinen+of+Life%27s+Roar). My opponent played [Trained Armodon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Trained+Armodon), then put [Fists of Ironwood](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fists+of+Ironwood) on it, then drew some cards with [Compulsive Research](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Compulsive+Research). I killed everything but the Armodon with [Gaze of the Gorgon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gaze+of+the+Gorgon), then played [Shambling Shell](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shambling+Shell). He played [Belltower Sphinx](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Belltower+Sphinx) to block and I added a counter to my now 2/3 Shinen so it would survive. My last card in hand was [Vigor Mortis](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vigor+Mortis), so I let him keep milling me via the Shinen and kept dredging up the Shell to add counters to it. Eventually I was low enough on life that I added a counter to make my Shinen a 4/5, then used [Vigor Mortis](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vigor+Mortis) on it to block his counterattack. He attacked, I killed something (I forget what) with my Shell, then made my Shinen 5/6. My opponent now had his Sphinx, another [Traproot Kami](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Traproot+Kami), and [Carven Caryatid](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Carven+Caryatid) to my big Shinen and Wayfinder. With the [Vigor Mortis](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vigor+Mortis) out of my hand, I decided to draw instead of get my Shell, and I drew [Gaze of the Gorgon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gaze+of+the+Gorgon). Down went his blockers, and my Wayfinder dropped him to eight life. I was pretty confident that I could now kill whatever he played as long as he wasn't using bounce in his deck. Apparently he wasn't, because he drew a card and then conceded.


*Game 19: Mono-Green Snakes*


![Kashi-Tribe Elite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Kashi-Tribe+Elite)The Shinen struck again. I had yet another quick [Shinen of Life's Roar](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shinen+of+Life%27s+Roar), along with a couple [Sakura-Tribe Elder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sakura-Tribe+Elder)s. My opponent's [Sakura-Tribe Scout](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sakura-Tribe+Scout) died, then he played [Sosuke's Summons](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sosuke%27s+Summons). I put [Strands of Undeath](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Strands+of+Undeath) on my Shinen, killing one of his tokens and regenerating my Spirit to allow my Elders to attack. [Mortipede](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mortipede) joined the party, and now my opponent was on a serious clock. He tried [Kashi-Tribe Elite](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kashi-Tribe+Elite), but I had [Last Gasp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Last+Gasp) for it. I drew [Helldozer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Helldozer), so after my attack I sacrificed both Elders to give me mana to both regenerate my Shinen and cast my Zombie Giant. With my opponent at ten life, and my side of table looking like Shinen, [Mortipede](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mortipede), and [Helldozer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Helldozer), it only took one mighty swing to end the game. In hand I had another Strands, [Gaze of the Gorgon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gaze+of+the+Gorgon), and [Last Gasp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Last+Gasp).
 *Game 20: Black/Blue Ninja*


When he put a first-turn [Plague Beetle](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plague+Beetle) on the table, I knew something peculiar was happening. It all made sense once he ninjutsued his Beetle into a [Skullsnatcher](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skullsnatcher) the following turn. I played two Forests and a [Sakura-Tribe Elder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sakura-Tribe+Elder). Thankfully he attacked with only his Beetle on the next turn, so I blocked it with the Elder, then fetched a Swamp. A [Civic Wayfinder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Civic+Wayfinder) hit play for me next, but it died to [Last Gasp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Last+Gasp). I killed his [Skullsnatcher](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skullsnatcher) with my own [Last Gasp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Last+Gasp), then played another Wayfinder. [Strands of Undeath](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Strands+of+Undeath) hit two cards in his hand, but [Nekrataal](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nekrataal) killed my Wayfinder despite its [Regeneration](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Regeneration). He had two more cards in hand, so I cast a second Strands on his [Grayscaled Gharial](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grayscaled+Gharial). Two [Mortipede](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mortipede)s followed for me, one of which died to the blocking Gharial. My [Mortipede](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mortipede) and his [Nekrataal](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nekrataal) traded attacks for awhile, then I played [Shambling Shell](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shambling+Shell). The Shell allowed my 'Pede to survive a blocking [Ravenous Rats](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ravenous+Rats), but unfortunately his [Nekrataal](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nekrataal) became [Mistblade Shinobi](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mistblade+Shinobi) to bounce my 5/2 Insect. I replayed my [Mortipede](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mortipede) and [Shambling Shell](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shambling+Shell), and my opponent mistakenly recast his [Nekrataal](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nekrataal), killing his Shinobi. Three +1/+1 counters later, I had a 7/4 [Mortipede](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mortipede) that couldn't die to [Last Gasp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Last+Gasp). Two attacks with it and I won.


Now *that's* more like it! Sure I had another five-game winning streak, which is nice to see. More importantly, unlike my first five wins, this time I was winning on my own terms. The deck is now performing how I want it to perform, making my opponents' lives miserable with [Lure](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lure) effects and creature enhancers. Also, despite the fact that my deck has changed considerably, I'm still keeping several of the peculiar choices begun in my Golgari draft deck. For example, I was thinking that [Shambling Shell](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shambling+Shell) would get cut next, but it proved itself too valuable during that last batch of changes. [Last Gasp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Last+Gasp) has also held off [Putrefy](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Putrefy) admirably. 


Sadly for [Strands of Undeath](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Strands+of+Undeath), however, its time has come.


*OUT*: 3 [Strands of Undeath](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Strands+of+Undeath)


What I've noticed about [Strands of Undeath](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Strands+of+Undeath) in my games is that, yes indeed, it costs four mana. Strands effectively costs five mana, actually, since I would need to be desperate to cast it without leaving [Regeneration](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Regeneration) mana open. Too often my Strands-enchanted creature dies somehow, whether it's to [Last Gasp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Last+Gasp), [Nekrataal](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nekrataal), [Putrefy](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Putrefy), [Faith's Fetters](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Faith%27s+Fetters), or the like. [Regeneration](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Regeneration) just isn't as great as it once was. Also too often, I dredge a Strands into the graveyard never to be seen again. I appreciate its discard quite a bit, but it also seems like about one mana too expensive for me to happy with it. All of that said, it would certainly stay in my deck if I didn't think a vastly superior card could replace it (insert foreshadowing here). 


*OUT*: 1 [Gaze of the Gorgon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gaze+of+the+Gorgon)


Gaze, on the other hand, has proven its worth. It's messed with an opponent's side of the table or regenerated a key creature often enough that I want it in my final deck. The problem is that it also costs four mana, and also has a tendency to vanish into my graveyard. It's still a mighty cool trick for a [Lure](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lure) deck to have but, like I said, I think I've found something slightly better for a lower cost.


*IN*: 4 [Moldervine Cloak](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Moldervine+Cloak)


![Moldervine Cloak](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Moldervine+Cloak)Boy, does [Shinen of Life's Roar](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shinen+of+Life%27s+Roar) seem dinky to me as a 1/2. Boy does [Mortipede](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mortipede) seem fragile to me as a 4/1. If only there was a way to pump these creatures up easily without losing card advantage if my creature dies. Let me think about it. Hm... 
 In all seriousness, I think the answer in my [Lure](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lure) deck is not to necessarily make my creatures regenerate, but to make them instead a lot tougher and meaner. Equipment is one solution, but I like that my deck isn't currently using any artifacts. Besides, [Moldervine Cloak](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Moldervine+Cloak) is a Golgari card and this is a Golgari deck. Its dredge cost is relatively minor and unlikely to mill my critical cards away. It also allows me very realistically to play a Shinen on turn 2 and a Cloak on turn 3. That's a 4/5 attacker with [Lure](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lure) on the third turn, for those keeping score at home.


A couple other housekeeping items..


*OUT*: 1 [Helldozer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Helldozer)


I think I would have kept [Helldozer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Helldozer) through to the end simply because it was one of the two rares I happened to draft, but the Message Boards last week were surprisingly down on him. It's true that he does nothing in particular to help the [Lure](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lure) concept except as a big body, and his land destruction ability has no other support in the deck. I like him because it's fun to dredge him into my graveyard and then play a surprise [Vigor Mortis](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vigor+Mortis), but that doesn't occur very often. No, dropping [Helldozer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Helldozer) means that I have now banished all of the Big Fat Fellas that made my draft deck so potent. The transformation is complete; My draft deck is now a [Mortipede](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mortipede)/[Gaze of the Gorgon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gaze+of+the+Gorgon) inspired Golgari deck.


Interestingly, dropping [Helldozer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Helldozer) means that my decklist is a Rare-Free Zone. That's the first time any deck evolution has whittled away its rares without replacing them. Neat.


*OUT*: 1 [Trophy Hunter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Trophy+Hunter)


Some people will notice that [Trophy Hunter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Trophy+Hunter) has been huge - both literally and figuratively - in several games. For a deck like mine that can generate a lot of mana, the Hunter is a superb answer for fliers. The question, though, is whether I've lost all that often to fliers. A simple [Last Gasp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Last+Gasp) or [Disembowel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Disembowel) helps out at instant speed, never mind the fact that I can remove many non-haste fliers with [Lure](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lure) creatures. Right now I would rather tighten the deck in other ways, shift [Trophy Hunter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Trophy+Hunter) into the sideboard, then decide whether I regret my decision. I may very well decide that my deck needs a maindeck answer to flying creatures, but right now I think there are more significant holes.


*IN*: 2 [Golgari Guildmage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Golgari+Guildmage)


You wouldn't know it from reading my most recent game logs, but I was frequently praying to draw a [Golgari Guildmage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Golgari+Guildmage). My deck has been very good at stockpiling land since the addition of [Civic Wayfinder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Civic+Wayfinder), and with five or more mana the Guildmage makes my deck ridiculously good. Going to kill my guys? Use its Black ability. Thinking about blocking or, better yet, do you have to block? Use its Green ability. With ten mana - something I've hit routinely - things get even sillier. Also note that a Guildmage makes a very fine 5/5 third-turn attacker as well.


Also, one small adjustment to my mana with the inclusion of [Moldervine Cloak](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Moldervine+Cloak) and the emphasis on early Green mana:


*OUT*: 2 Swamp


*IN*: 2 Forest


The deck I'll pick up and play next week looks like this:

Is the deck finished? I don't think so. In fact, here is a list of the things currently bugging me (no pun intended) about my [Mortipede](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mortipede)-inspired deck:


* It can't deal with opposing artifacts and enchantments. At all.
* It seems ridiculous to not use the best uncommon in Ravnica: [Putrefy](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Putrefy), and yet [Last Gasp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Last+Gasp) has worked really well.
* I'm worrying about dredge again with both [Shambling Shell](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shambling+Shell) and [Moldervine Cloak](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Moldervine+Cloak) in the deck and wish I had more ways to take advantage of cards in my graveyard. Right now there's [Vigor Mortis](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vigor+Mortis), [Golgari Guildmage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Golgari+Guildmage), and... that's it.
* Speaking of [Vigor Mortis](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vigor+Mortis), I'd like to fit in a fourth copy without dropping the overall creature count if possible.
* Will fliers be a problem and, if so, how much of one?

Those are concerns for another day, however. A day like, say, next Monday. Until then, speak up on the Message Boards about what you think should or shouldn't happen with the deck. As always, your feedback is very important to me and I always enjoy reading it.


Think hard and have fun,
