Coverage of 2003 Dutch Nationals
================================











Congratulations to Rogier Maaten, Dutch National Champion 2003. Joining him in the top 3 are Jelger Wiegersma and Maarten Ferguson. Rogier piloted his unorthodox U/G deck to a perfect 9-0 record over the three days of Nationals and deservingly beat Jelger Wiegersma in the finals, his Counterspells and Upheavals proving too much for Jelger's Wake deck. The national team is not as high profile as the one last year, Maaten and Ferguson are no Boeken and Cornelissen but Jelger has been singing Rogier's praises all weekend and Maarten has qualified for the Pro Tour before. Frank van de Hanenberg lost the third place playoff in a real nail biter, finally succumbing to a double mulligan in game five. Frank Karsten and Alexander Witt were hoping for a little more than a loss in the quarterfinals in this relatively inexperienced top 8 but they both lost to the eventual finalists. Matthijs van Wageningen and Tom van Ravensteijn were the real unknown factors in this top 8 and found themselves on the wrong side of the more experienced players in the single elimination rounds.
