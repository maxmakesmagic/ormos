The *Legendary Cube* is coming to *Magic Online* on November 18—check out the [announcement article](http://magic.wizards.com/en/MTGO/articles/archive/magic-online/announcing-legendary-cube-2015-08-05) if you missed it the first time around!

We'll be revealing some of the contents of the *Legendary Cube* this week in community interviews, so make sure to check out this week's episodes of [*Magic* the Amateuring](http://www.magictheamateuring.com/) and [The Command Zone](http://www.rocketjump.com/podcasts#thecommandzone) for a special cube preview and an interview with *Legendary Cube* lead developer Adam Prosak! The full Legendary Cube list will be revealed in an article by Adam Prosak next Monday, November 9.

This week, we're showing players how they'll be able to pit their army of legendary creatures against one another in epic confrontations. Announcing *Legendary Cube* events, running from November 18 through December 9!


Beginning after the downtime on Wednesday, November 18, players will be able to write the tale of their own legendary battles in two different Phantom Queue events: the [Swiss *Legendary Cube* Phantom Draft](#swiss) and the [Single-Elimination *Legendary Cube* Phantom Draft](#singleelimination). Both of these events will only be around until the Wednesday, December 9 downtime, so make sure you get a chance to try them out during the *Legendary Cube*'s inaugural run and win some of the new *Legendary Cube* Prize Packs while you're at it!


Because many of the *Legendary Cube* Prize Pack cards are from *Commander (2015 Edition)* and we're kicking off previews for that set this week, we'll be waiting to reveal the entirety of the *Legendary Cube* and *Legendary Cube* Prize Pack card lists until Adam Prosak's previously mentioned November 9 article. We can't unveil the full list now, but we still want to show off a few cards that will be lurking within those Prize Packs!

Remember, Prize Packs are made up of a randomized assortment of 149 cards in six-card boosters from *Commander (2015 Edition)*, *Commander (2014 Edition)*, *Commander (2013 Edition)*, *Magic: the Gathering Commander*, *Magic: the Gathering—Conspiracy*, *Planechase (2012 Edition)*, and *Commander's Arsenal*. There will be one rare or mythic rare in each pack, alongside five uncommons (with a chance that one of the uncommon cards will be replaced by a premium card of any rarity).

Still wondering how the *Legendary Cube* will play? Make sure to watch a special Streamer Showdown that's being held on November 12 at 1:00 p.m. and 6:00 p.m. Pacific (UTC-8)! Some of the greatest streamers on *Magic Online* will be getting the chance to draft the *Legendary Cube* live on Twitch a week before release, so tune in for an early look at *Legendary Cube* Draft strategy.
