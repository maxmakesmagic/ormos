What's more exciting than watching 24 of the 2016–17 season's very best *Magic* players and the two top teams compete for a grand total of $350,000 in one weekend?


Watching those players compete in brand new Standard and Booster Draft formats, of course. The *Magic: The Gathering* World Championship starts October 6, and the winner heads home with a **$100,000** first-place prize!


WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP BASICS
=========================


Here's the quick rundown on the 2017 *Magic: The Gathering* World Championship:


* The World Championship is a three-day tournament featuring 24 players who qualified either by being among the very best players in the season, or by . . . well, winning a Pro Tour. This event features the four Pro Tour Champions, the *Magic Online* Champion, the Standard Master, the Draft Master, and the top-ranked players from the 2016–17 season.
* The formats for Friday and Saturday are three rounds of Booster Draft—using three packs of *Ixalan*—and four rounds of Standard Constructed. All matches on Friday and Saturday are best two out of three games.
* The World Championship will also be the decider of the top team for the 2016–17 Pro Tour Team Series, as Musashi and Genesis face off in an *Ixalan* Team Sealed competition to see who wins the larger share of the $50,000 the two teams have claim to. This playoff happens on Sunday.
* The following sets are legal in Standard Constructed for this tournament: *Kaladesh*, *Aether Revolt*, *Amonkhet*, *Hour of Devastation*, and *Ixalan*.
* The following cards are currently banned in Standard Constructed, and cannot be used by players: [Felidar Guardian](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Felidar+Guardian), [Smuggler's Copter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Smuggler%27s+Copter), and [Aetherworks Marvel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aetherworks+Marvel).
* Unlike a Pro Tour, all players competing in the World Championship main event can play every round of Swiss. Once a player secures three wins, each subsequent win nets them 1 Pro Point in the 2017–18 season.
* The Top 4 players at the end of Day Two will advance to Sunday's playoff, featuring a traditional single-elimination bracket.
* The Team Series Championship starts off Sunday, and then the main event Top 4 will take place in the afternoon.
* All matches played during Sunday's main event are best-three-out-of-five, with the first two games featuring pre-sideboard action.
* The winner of the main event gets $100,000!
* The main event has a prize pool of $300,000, and the Team Series Championship has a prize pool of $50,000. In total, we're awarding $350,000 during this weekend!

As always, if you want to dive just a little bit deeper into this tournament, [Rich Hagon has you covered](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/organized-play/world-championship-preview-2017-10-03).


WHEN DOES COVERAGE START?
=========================


Live video coverage for the 2017 *Magic: The Gathering* World Championship starts each day (October 6, 7, and 8) at 6 a.m. PT/9 a.m. ET/1 p.m. UTC.


If you can't watch the broadcast live, don't worry! We'll be replaying the broadcast once each day concludes.


In addition to that, VODs (videos on demand) of each round and segment will be available on our Twitch page, with separate collections for both the matches as well as our deck techs and features, in case you just want to catch up on the rounds or features you may have missed.


THE COVERAGE TEAM
=================


Here's the crew you'll be able to hang out with this weekend while you're watching *Magic*'s most prestigious tournament live.


**Play-by-Play Commentators**: Marshall Sutcliffe, Riley Knight, and Tim Willoughby  
**Color Commentators**: Luis Scott-Vargas and Paul Cheon  
**News Desk**: Rich Hagon and Maria Bartholdi  
**Floor Reporter**: Brian David-Marshall  
**Feature Match Spotters**: Rashad Miller and Neil Rigby  
**Writer-Reporters**: Meghan Wolff and Frank Karsten  
**Content Managers/Editors**: Blake Rasmussen and Mike Rosenberg  
**Social Media**: Nate Price  
**Executive Producer**: Greg Collins


Needless to say, it's quite a roster. We're excited to have Riley back with Marshall and Tim in the play-by-play seat, joined by the one-two punch of Luis Scott-Vargas and Paul Cheon. Rich and Maria will be heading up the news desk, while Brian will be on the floor to bring you interviews and more. Meghan and Frank will be bringing you a combo of deeper dives into who the players are and some inciteful analysis via articles. Rashad and Neil manage the sidelines, Nate heads up social media, and my bosserino Greg runs the whole show.


Oh, and I guess there's Blake and me and in the background. Doing things. And stuff. Don't look behind the curtain, please.


WHERE ELSE CAN I EXPERIENCE THE COVERAGE?
=========================================


Round-by-round content, decklists, articles, pairings, results and standings, and all sorts of goodness will be located on the [World Championship coverage page](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/2017wc), so save that link and check back for regular updates!


In addition to our live video coverage on Twitch, Nico Nico will be hosting a Japanese-language stream of the Pro Tour.


WHEN WILL DECKLISTS BE PUBLISHED?
=================================


Worlds works differently than a Pro Tour. After the first round of Standard is completed, all 24 main event competitors will receive a set of decklists for everyone competing. This has two important implications:


* Coverage will get to flex their coverage-y muscles when talking about Standard, without fear of spoiling anything for the competitors
* You get decklists sooner!

So expect all Standard decklists from this event to go up on October 6 shortly after Round 4 concludes.


WHERE CAN I FIND OUT MORE?
