The Daily *Magic* Update is a roundup of everything *Magic* you should know on September 16, 2016. Today's Update is brought to you by the [full *Kaladesh* Card Image Gallery](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/card-image-gallery/kaladesh)!


What To Watch This Weekend
==========================


If you wanted to, you could watch *Magic* programming virtually all weekend long. Here are some highlights.


1. > 
> Kaladesh Pre-PreRelease is just 3 days away. Get hyped!! [#LRRKLD](https://twitter.com/hashtag/LRRKLD?src=hash) [#MTGKLD](https://twitter.com/hashtag/MTGKLD?src=hash) [pic.twitter.com/GuPTHYrPQE](https://t.co/GuPTHYrPQE)

It's now just two days away, and I'm certainly hyped—because I'll be there! Cloudblazer-ing all over the competition. Meghan and Maria from [Magic The Amateuring](http://www.magictheamateuring.com/) will be there, and so will Adam Styborski, writer and content manager extraordinaire, plus the LoadingReadyRun crew. The graphic tells you where to watch, but links are helpful too. So tune in Sunday at noon PT on [twitch.tv/loadingreadyrun](https://www.twitch.tv/loadingreadyrun).


1. [Extra Life](http://www.extra-life.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=donorDrive.team&teamID=29451)

Starting at 8 a.m. tomorrow (Saturday) PT on [twitch.tv/magic](https://www.twitch.tv/magic), a whole lot of people from Wizards of the Coast and the world of *Magic* will be hosting a 24-hour fundraising stream benefitting the [Seattle Children's Hospital](http://www.seattlechildrens.org/). You can see all of the events—or donate!—right here on [the *Magic: The Gathering* Extra Life fundraising page](http://www.extra-life.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=donorDrive.team&teamID=29451).


1. [StarCityGames Orlando Open Weekend](http://www.starcitygames.com/events/170916_orlando_fact_sheet.html)

With Standard set to rotate, Modern is the name of the game as the StarCityGames circuit descends on Orlando. Patrick Sullivan and Cedric Phillips are back in the booth starting at 10:30 a.m. ET on [twitch.tv/scglive](https://www.twitch.tv/scglive).


After Those, Read, Watch, or Listen to These
============================================


1. [Standard Replacements](http://www.starcitygames.com/article/33675_Standard-Replacements.html) | StarCityGames | Adrian Sullivan

*Magic Origins* and *Dragons of Tarkir* are rotating, but that doesn't mean there aren't substitutes sticking around for some of Standard's staples. Sullivan goes over what switcheroos you can make and still keep on churning along.


1. [Voltaic Brawler and Building Energy Aggro](http://www.toplevelpodcast.com/voltaic-brawler/) | Top Level Podcast | Patrick Chapin and Mike Flores

Chapin and Flores go deep on energy and spend quite a bit off time enamored by Voltaic Brawler, a two-drop they virtually guarantee will see serious play. The brewing has begun!


1. [Vintage 101: Even more *Kaladesh* in Vintage!](https://www.mtggoldfish.com/articles/vintage-101-even-more-kaladesh-in-vintage) | MTGGoldfish | IslandSwamp

Mr. IslandSwamp reviews *Kaladesh* for Vintage playables—and finds a few that could wind their way into the oldest format around.


1. [Thoughtseize in Retrospect](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZFS1f2M5uQ) | The Magic Man Sam

The Magic Man Sam only comes out of hiding every once in a while to make awesome videos (his last one was 4 months ago). But when he does, he knocks them out of the park. This is another gem, as Sam takes a look at [Thoughtseize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtseize) over the years. His video production skills are on point, and this video is worth watching for that alone. But also because "Turn 1, [Thoughtseize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtseize) you" is truly one of the most terrifying phrases in the game.

What People are Talking About
=============================


1. The great Pro twitter debate of September 2016 continues…


> 
> This whole "pros are elitist" nonsense sure crumbles quickly when you see [@OwenTweetenwald](https://twitter.com/OwenTweetenwald) dining at [@Chilis](https://twitter.com/Chilis) every night.

So, if you follow any of the pro player community on Twitter, you probably came across a virtual linguistic brawl over perceived elitism among the pros. Though the conversation wasn't between amateur players and pros—it was between pros and pros. It was kind of like if Captain America: Civil War had been about *Magic*, been fought over Twitter, and involved zero superpowers. But at least they had the same lame ending where suddenly everyone was cool with everyone else.


At any rate, if you're confused by what all the hubbub was, this all stemmed from the conversation the previous day about what slots should be in the World Championship and who was "deserving." It was that last bit that got a few people riled up. It seems to have died down at this point, but I'm still waiting for the dramatic conclusion, where we find out Brad Nelson knew all along that Michael Majors was the one who killed Kiran Nalaar.

The picture is now complete! You'll have to read *Magic Story* over the next few weeks to get the complete story, but these five cards give you the lowdown on where we're heading on *Kaladesh*.

This was just really cool and worth sharing. You can tell when players take pride in their accomplishments, and this is an awfully cool commemorative piece for Rubin. Brian Braun-Duin showed off [his own memento](https://twitter.com/BraunDuinIt/status/776519924680306688) as well.


Deck of the Day
===============


1. [Mono Blue Prison](http://www.channelfireball.com/articles/10-reasons-for-playing-mono-blue-prison-in-september/)

Next week, we'll turn our attention to the new decks people start brewing with *Kaladesh*. But for today, I want to take one last longing look back at the most interesting deck to pop up this Standard season that attacked from an angle no one else did—and is now set to almost completely rotate.


Yes, I've featured this deck before, but I'm taking it to Friday Night *Magic* myself tonight. So if you play against me, feel free to pull up this article.


The deck is truly creatureless in the main, though it does feature a few in the sideboard. It aims to cycle quickly through its deck, bouncing creatures with [Engulf the Shore](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Engulf+the+Shore)s, all while scrying and scrying and scrying with [Jace's Sanctum](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace%27s+Sanctum), the true engine of the deck. [Day's Undoing](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Day%27s+Undoing) is key here, and is at its most broken in this deck, often serving to shuffle away cards recently returned with [Engulf the Shore](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Engulf+the+Shore)s. The win condition, eventually, is [Part the Waterveil](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Part+the+Waterveil) and/or [Rise from the Tides](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rise+from+the+Tides).


It really is a thing of beauty, and I'll be using tonight to take it for one last spin at a Standard FNM, a night I'm dubbing Almost Nostalgia Night.
