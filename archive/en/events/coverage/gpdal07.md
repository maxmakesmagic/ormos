Grand Prix Dallas 2007
----------------------


Hall of Famer Lone Star in Dallas!
==================================




February 24-25, 2007











![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gpdal07/champ.jpg)Nine years after winning his first Grand Prix and less than three months after being inducted into the Pro Tour Hall of Fame, Raphael Levy has won a second Grand Prix title, and boy did he have to work to do it. When the weekend started, there were 747 other players in Texas standing between Levy and his crown, but by the time Sunday afternoon rolled around, there were only 7, and they included U.S. National Champion Paul Cheon, Pro Tour-Hawaii winner Mark Herberholz, Pro Tour-Charleston Top 8 member John Pelcak, and 2005 Player of the Year Kenji Tsumura along with Jim Davis, Paul Nguyen, and Alex Ledbetter.


Levy's quarterfinal went smoothly, as he dispatched Heezy in two quick games, but the semis were an epic battle against Kenji Tsumura that had both players and the crowd gasping for air. Levy and his [Jotun Grunt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jotun+Grunt) s eventually overcame the Japanese master's Loam deck 2-1, putting Raph through to the finals. On the other side of the bracket, swiss leader John Pelcak squeaked past Alex Ledbetter's innovative Beat Stick deck 2-1, while the Dual of the Pauls finished quickly with Cheon defeating Nguyen 2-0. Cheon and Pelcak's match was nearly as good as the other semi, and ended with a huge roar from the crowd as Cheon carefully played around double Shrapnel Blast from Pelcak to win 2-1 as well. This set up a masterful final where both Cheon and Levy could have lost multiple times, but Levy and his angry animals managed to pull through and win it 2-1.


**Congratulations to Raphael Levy, the Grand Prix-Dallas 2007 champion!**
