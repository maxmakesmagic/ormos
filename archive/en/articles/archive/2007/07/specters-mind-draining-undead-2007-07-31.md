Specters have one of the most consistent relationships between their flavor and mechanics of all creature types in **Magic**.


Almost every Specter is a black flying creature with a "saboteur" ability (an ability that triggers when the creature gets through unblocked, or deals combat damage) that causes the opponent to discard. And almost every Specter is depicted as a brooding, hooded figure riding a flying mount, an undead creature whose frightening appearance and [Specter's Wail](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Specter%2527s%2BWail) causes the mind-draining discard effect.


*Onslaught's* [Silent Specter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Silent+Specter) is a classic Specter: hooded figure, flying mount. Compare with *Invasion's* [Blazing Specter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blazing+Specter) and *Legions'* [Hollow Specter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hollow+Specter).

[Abyssal Specter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Abyssal+Specter) in *Ice Age* was the earliest example of the flying mount convention for Specters. In **Magic**'s early years, that spectral flavor link was not yet established, so there are a few counterexamples to this pattern. [Tainted Specter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tainted+Specter) from *Mirage* is a flyer with a discard ability, but isn't depicted as a mounted figure. Same with [Entropic Specter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Entropic+Specter) from *Exodus*. *Mirage's* [Dread Specter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dread+Specter) is probably the strangest oddball of the bunchâ€”like honorary Specter [Mistform Ultimus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mistform+Ultimus), it isn't mounted, doesn't fly, and doesn't have a discard ability!

The original Specter, Alpha's [Hypnotic Specter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hypnotic+Specter), was reillustrated to bring it in line with the other recent Specters when it resurfaced in *Ninth Edition*. What was originally a ghostly knight is now firmly part of the Specter tradition, as a hooded figure riding a flying mount.
