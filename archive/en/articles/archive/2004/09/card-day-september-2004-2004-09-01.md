**Card of the Day - jeudi 30 septembre 2004**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Dawn's%20Reflection)#### Dawn's Reflection


 *Fifth Dawn* common. Called “Fertile Moss” in playtesting, this card was added late in *Fifth Dawn's* design to help facilitate casting the five-color themed cards of the set. 
 



**Card of the Day - mercredi 29 septembre 2004**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Burnt%20Offering)#### Burnt Offering


 *Ice Age* common. This was a reprint of Sacrifice from the original base set. But, thanks to *Ice Age's* theme of cooperating colors, Burnt Offering is strictly better than its predecessor. 
 



**Card of the Day - mardi 28 septembre 2004**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Goblin%20Clearcutter)#### Goblin Clearcutter


 *Legions* uncommon. Inspired by Orcish Lumberjack, this beefier version made a splash at Pro Tour Venice, where its massive acceleration was used to power out gigantic dragons. 
 



**Card of the Day - lundi 27 septembre 2004**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Orcish%20Lumberjack)#### Orcish Lumberjack


 *Ice Age* common. The awesome mana acceleration of this card was a prominent feature in the famous “Vice Age” deck that nearly got Henry Stern the World Champion title in 1995. 
 



**Card of the Day - vendredi 24 septembre 2004**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Kami%20of%20Old%20Stone)#### Kami of Old Stone


 *Champions of Kamigawa* uncommon. During playtesting, this card went by the self-explanatory nickname of “Big Butt”. 
 



**Card of the Day - jeudi 23 septembre 2004**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Isamaru,%20Hound%20of%20Konda)#### Isamaru, Hound of Konda


 *Champions of Kamigawa* rare. Mark Rosewater designed this card specifically to illustrate that “vanilla” legends could still be interesting. 
 



**Card of the Day - mercredi 22 septembre 2004**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Sachi,%20Daughter%20of%20Seshiro)#### Sachi, Daughter of Seshiro


 *Champions of Kamigawa* uncommon. *Champions* is the first set since *Homelands* to have uncommon legends. 
 



**Card of the Day - mardi 21 septembre 2004**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Boseiju,%20Who%20Shelters%20All)#### Boseiju, Who Shelters All


 *Champions of Kamigawa* rare. This set is the first to have cards where *how* you use your mana gives you an ability. 
 



**Card of the Day - lundi 20 septembre 2004**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Bushi%20Tenderfoot)#### Bushi Tenderfoot


 *Champions of Kamigawa* uncommon. When the final version of the flip cards was decided upon, this was the first one designed. 
 



**Card of the Day - vendredi 17 septembre 2004**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=1996%20World%20Champion)#### 1996 World Champion

 Special promotional card. The rarest card in **Magic**, only one of these was ever produced. Embedded in the 1996 World Champion's trophy and won by Tom Chanpheng of Australia, he reportedly was able to sell the trophy for $10,000+! 
 



**Card of the Day - jeudi 16 septembre 2004**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Thrull%20Champion)#### Thrull Champion


 *Fallen Empires* rare. This was the first champion to share a creature type with those it improved, as compared to cards like Goblin King and Zombie Master. 
 



**Card of the Day - mercredi 15 septembre 2004**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Opal%20Champion)#### Opal Champion


 *Urza's Legacy* common. Opal Champion is the only enchantment with “Champion” in its name. There is also just one artifact (Tower of Champions) and one sorcery (Champion's Victory). 
 



**Card of the Day - mardi 14 septembre 2004**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Elvish%20Champion)#### Elvish Champion


 *Invasion* rare. No rare card has had a shorter transition from an expansion to the core set. 
 



**Card of the Day - lundi 13 septembre 2004**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Talruum%20Champion)#### Talruum Champion


 *Visions* common. R&D liked the art for this card so much that they retroactively decided that it was depicting Tahngarth. 
 



**Card of the Day - vendredi 10 septembre 2004**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Tetsuo%20Umezawa)#### Tetsuo Umezawa


 *Legends* rare. Tetsuo is the first creature to be printed with a form of “non-enchantability” – but Tetravites were the actual first creatures to have a “non-enchantability” ability. 
 



**Card of the Day - jeudi 9 septembre 2004**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Plague%20Rats)#### Plague Rats

 Alpha common. This card was the inspiration for Relentless Rats, and Slivers, and the “Kindle” mechanic. 
 

**Card of the Day - mercredi 8 septembre 2004**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Ophidian)#### Ophidian


 *Weatherlight* common. This card was the beginning of the “saboteur” ability for drawing cards. Later this ability would shift to triggering on damage rather than whether the creature was blocked.
 



**Card of the Day - mardi 7 septembre 2004**



![](https://web.archive.org/web/20200114025343im_/https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Revenant)#### Revenant


 *Stronghold* rare. Perhaps the only non-*Unglued* card with flavor text that references the flavor text of another card from another block, this one is a nod to the card’s “lhurgoyf-ish” inspiration. 
 



**Card of the Day - lundi 6 septembre 2004**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Sword%20of%20the%20Chosen)#### Sword of the Chosen


 *Stronghold* rare. The sword of Selenia, Dark Angel (pictured in the art), this was the first legendary artifact printed. 
 



**Card of the Day - vendredi 3 septembre 2004**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Psychatog)#### Psychatog


 *Odyssey* uncommon. A central card in ’02 World Champion Carlos Romao’s deck, some consider Psychatog to be the most powerful creature ever printed. 
 



**Card of the Day - jeudi 2 septembre 2004**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Phyrexian%20Processor)#### Phyrexian Processor


 *Urza’s Saga* rare. Without a key mistake with this card against Jon Finkel in the finals of the 2000 Worlds event Bob Maher may have won the title instead. 
 



**Card of the Day - mercredi 1 septembre 2004**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Covetous%20Dragon)#### Covetous Dragon


 *Urza’s Destiny* rare. In ’99 Kai Budde defeated Mark Le Pine in what was likely the quickest Worlds finals ever, thanks in part to the power of this card in combination with very fast artifact mana.
