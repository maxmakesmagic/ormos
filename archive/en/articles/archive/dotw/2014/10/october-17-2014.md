Wizards of the Coast




October 17, 2014
 










Last weekend featured *Khans of Tarkir* played on the highest level of both Standard and Limited, as many of the game's best players traveled to beautiful Honolulu, Hawaii, to compete for the $40,000 1st-place prize and the title of [Pro Tour *Khans of Tarkir*](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/ptktk) champion. The Top 8 featured a wide spread of clans and archetypes, with No. 7 Ari Lax winning the trophy with his Abzan Midrange deck, defeating highlight players such as 6th-ranked Yuuya Watanabe and No. 3 Shaun McLaren on his way to claiming the title.


In the week leading up to the Pro Tour, many players were earning their airfare and invitations to Pro Tour *Fate Reforged*, taking place February 6–8, 2015. The format for this season is currently *Khans of Tarkir* Sealed Deck, with a Booster Draft Top 8. There's more coming up this weekend, [so be sure to find a PTQ near you](http://magic.wizards.com/en/protour/qualifierlist), and we hope to see you in Washington DC next February!
