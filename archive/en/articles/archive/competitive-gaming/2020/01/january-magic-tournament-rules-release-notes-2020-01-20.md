*Magic: The Gathering* Tournament Rules Updates
===============================================


Here are the *Magic: The Gathering* Tournament Rules update notes for the latest release (which can be found [here](http://wpn.wizards.com/en/document/magic-gathering-tournament-rules)), listed by the section number of the rules. To have more context, you should refer to the actual wording in the document itself.


Very few changes this time around, and all are "housekeeping" changes. The rules have been updated with *Theros Beyond Death* in various sections. We have also updated Premier Event program names throughout. Plus, the bans for Modern and Pioneer that happened in December and January have been added.


In addition to these updates to the *Magic* Tournament Rules, a few updates have been to the Infraction Procedure Guide. Toby Elliott has a full write-up on these changes [here](https://blogs.magicjudges.org/telliott).

That's all for this update! If you have questions about *Magic* Tournament Rules, I recommend the following resources:


***Magic: The Gathering*** **Tournament Rules** (viewable [here](http://wpn.wizards.com/document/magic-gathering-tournament-rules))


This is the main rules document that governs competitive tournament play. It defines:


* The fundamental parts of a tournament;
* The various roles and responsibilities of participants;
* The mechanics of a tournament;
* The violations that come with tournament play;
* The various formats for tournament play; and
* Sanctioning rules.

**Infraction Procedure Guide** (viewable [here](http://wpn.wizards.com/document/magic-infraction-procedure-guide))


This document provides the recommended penalties and procedures to handle rules violations.

I encourage anyone who is interested in tournament-level *Magic* to read these documents. They are the rules under which a tournament is run, so being familiar with these documents can help you to become a better player. In some cases, the *Magic* Tournament Rules supersede the *Magic* Game Rules, so knowing these rules can keep you from entering some awkward situations. You can also contact Wizards of the Coast Game Support. Information about how to do that can be found [here](https://wizards.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/2305/).
