| **1. Mac or PC** | I don't care as long as it has a working keyboard and spellchecker. |
| **2. Dog or Cat** | Dog. I had a cat once. I could tell by the way it looked at me that it wanted to kill me and take my kingdom for itself. |
| **3. Soft Candy or Hard Candy** | Watermelon. |
| **4. Cake or Pie** | I hate pie. Give me a can of frosting, and we can skip the superfluous cake part. It's just a staging ground for frosting. |
| **5. Super-talent or Jack of All Trades** | Jack of All Trades. No matter what you do, someone will be better at it. And deserve it more than you do. Whatever "it" is. |
