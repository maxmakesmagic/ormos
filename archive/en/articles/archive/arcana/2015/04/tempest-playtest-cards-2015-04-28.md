Hey everyone, I need to confess something. I totally stole this Arcana idea.



You see, this isn't the first time we've had a *Tempest*-style theme week. Back in 2002 we had actual *Tempest* Week, and it seemed a shame not to dig up some of the info we featured back then. To some, that may seem like copying. I just like to call it intellectual honesty.



Besides, it was a cool idea: playtest cards!



So here's the game. Here are four images of playtest cards from *Tempest*. Your job is to guess what *Tempest* card they actually became. Just hover over the playtest name or click on the image to see the card.
