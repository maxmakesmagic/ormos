Last Friday, *Journey into Nyx* Lead Designer Ethan Fleischer did an AMA (ask me anything) on Reddit. Trick showed a few questions in [last night's Arcana](http://www.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/arcana/1486). For tonight's Ask Wizards, we're going to show a few more. Enjoy!

 **Q: What classic Greek myths didn't make it into the block? —lansdellicious**


**A: Ethan Fleischer, lead designer for *Journey into Nyx*:**


A lot of the heroes (Jason, Achilles, Odysseus, etc.) didn't really fit.


 **Q: Mark Rosewater always talks about how meeting player expectations is perhaps the most important part of top-down design. However, with *Theros* block we don't have creature cards representing the three most famous Greek heroes, Odysseus, Achilles, and Heracles. Why was this decision made? —Talpostal** 


**A: Ethan Fleischer, lead designer for *Journey into Nyx*:** 


We designed top-down cards representing all of these characters, but they weren't fun enough, so they were cut or changed later in the process.


 **Q: How did you prepare for The Great Designer Search? And what was your favorite part of preparation for leading JOU? —Liam\_dota**  


**A: Ethan Fleischer, lead designer for *Journey into Nyx*:** 


There were three big things I did to prepare for GDS2.


1. I played a lot of Magic. I started playing with Alpha and played during most of the intervening sets. Shawn Main, a relative newbie, started with Revised. He got second place. Coincidence?
2. I read pretty much all of [Mark Rosewater's articles](http://www.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Archive.aspx?author=Mark%20Rosewater). These are great sources of game design lessons in general, and Magic design lessons in particular.
3. I did a lot of collaborative creative work in film and animation. I worked with a lot of people over the Internet during GDS2, and I had to know how to respond to feedback from people who know more about Magic design than I did.

My favorite part of preparing for leading JOU was being on the design teams for *Gatecrash*, *Theros*, *Born of the Gods*, and *Commander* (2013 Edition). That was fun!


 **Q: From one Ethan to another; when you go about making (and finishing up) a set, do you design it in a way where it complements the next coming set? Will there be any mechanics from THS, BNG, and JOU that'll be featured in Huey, or at least will complement them? —EthanHE**  


**A: Ethan Fleischer, lead designer for *Journey into Nyx*:** 


Hi Ethan!


We try to incorporate things into a block that will work well with the following block. For example, we put a few extra Minotaurs and Centaurs into *Return to Ravnica* block in case we wanted to do Centaur or Minotaur tribal themes in our mythology block that was coming up next.
