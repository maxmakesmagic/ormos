Usually, when an expansion set involves tokens that already exist in the block, we don't make new token cards for them. But *New Phyrexia* is different! Sure, there was a [Myr token in *Scars of Mirrodin*](/en/articles/archive/scars-mirrodin-tokens-2010-09-15). But that was a Mirran Myr. *New Phyrexia* brings something new to the party!

Ooh! Phyrexian-y! Hey, do you think any other standard creature types might show up in compleated form?

I guess so! But what about something more in theme for the block? Maybe something that gets created fairly often?

Perfect! But how about a token that *doesn't* already exist in the block? Could we get that taken care of?

Very nice.
