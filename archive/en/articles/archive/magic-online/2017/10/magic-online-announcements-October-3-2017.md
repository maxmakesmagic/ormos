***Ixalan*Sealed MOCS Monthly this Sunday, October 8**


A *Magic Online*Championship Series (MOCS) *Ixalan*Sealed Monthly Event is coming up on October 8! Players can enter the event with 35 Qualifier Points (QPs), and top finishers qualify for the last remaining Playoff Event on November 11.


Monthly and Playoff Events also award top players MOCS Leaderboard Points for the year. Top players on the [Leaderboard](https://magic.wizards.com/en/mtgo/leaderboard) at the end of the 2017 MOCS will qualify for the year-end Championship event.


The last two chances to use Qualifier Points for the 2017 series will be the MOCS Monthly event this weekend (on October 8) and on October 21. During the downtime on October 25, all QPs will be removed from players accounts, apart from any QPs earned after October 18 at 8 a.m. PT, which can be used for the 2018 *Magic Online* Championship Series events! For more information about this transition as well as the 2018 series, click [here](https://magic.wizards.com/en/content/2018-magic-online-championship-series).


We look forward to seeing you on October 8 for the second-to-last Monthly Event of the 2017 *Magic Online*Championship Series!

**New redemption process**


*Magic Online* will now process redemptions every Thursday morning between 2 a.m. and 3 a.m. PT. Redemptions will no longer be processed during downtimes.


If you want to redeem a set, make sure to purchase the appropriate redemption object from the *Magic Online* store before this time. To ensure your redemption order is processed, make sure each card in any sets you are trying to redeem is in your account, isn’t being used in league or tournament, and isn’t involved in an active trade when processing starts, or that entire redemption order will fail to process.


*Ixalan* redemptions will go on sale beginning October 25. *Magic Online*'s redemption schedule can be found [here](https://magic.wizards.com/en/gameinfo/products/magiconline/redemption).
