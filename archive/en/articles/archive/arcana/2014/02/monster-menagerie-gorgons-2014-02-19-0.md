Dreadful. 


  
  
Full of Dread. 


 That's how the ancient Greeks felt about gorgons. So much so that the name they gave them actually translates as "dreadful." In **Magic**, Gorgons are just as dreadful because they either have deathtouch or a very deathtouchy ability. 


![Infernal Medusa](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Infernal+Medusa)
  
 While in myth there were only three gorgons, sisters actually, **Magic** makes [Gorgon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&subtype=+%5B%22Gorgon%22%5D) a creature subtype, just like [Minotaur](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&subtype=+%5B%22Minotaur%22%5D) and [Cyclops](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&subtype=+%5B%22Cyclops%22%5D) (there are also multiple [Cerberuses](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&name=%7C%5B%22hound+of+Griselbrand%22%5D%7C%5Bcerberus%5D)). While we aren't limited to just three gorgons like the Greeks, we still have some pretty unique Gorgons.

And of course, the powerful planeswalking Gorgon:


![Vraska the Unseen](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Vraska+the+Unseen)
  
 On Theros, folks better keep their eyes down. Seems to me like there are gorgons everywhere! And there's something different about them; Theros gorgons have the lower body of a snake! That certainly would make it easier to tell them apart from your average *femme fatale*.

 Before you get upset, I didn't forget about the beautifully dangerous [Hythonia the Cruel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hythonia+the+Cruel)—I just wanted to make sure you knew this was available:

 This is all ancient history, though. What we really want to see is the new *Born of the Gods* Gorgon, right? Well, here she is. Don't be fooled by her pretty face, she is pretty powerful! 


![Archetype of Finality](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Archetype+of+Finality)
  
 This art is so beautiful! [Chris Rahn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&artist=%5B%22Chris+Rahn%22%5D) really nailed it! I’d show it to you bigger, but you can actually see it EXTRA huge [here](/en/articles/archive/wallpaper-week-archetype-finality-2014-02-19-0) because it’s today’s wallpaper!
