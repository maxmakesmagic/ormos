 Coming in first was Zoo with an overwhelming 92 decks. There was no denying the power of turn-one [Wild Nacatl](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Nacatl+)  as this turned out to be the go-to deck for most competitors. Many lists further improved on the [Bant Charm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bant+Charm+)  splashes from Pro Tour Philadelphia with the inclusion of the ever-popular [Snapcaster Mage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snapcaster+Mage). 


 Forty-nine players were convinced that [Splinter Twin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Splinter+Twin+)  was the deck to play. This two-card combo was hardly affected by the recent Modern bannings and we could see [Deceiver Exarch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deceiver+Exarch+)  and [Pestermite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pestermite+)  tokens in overwhelming numbers. Literally. 


 Affinity came in third with 29 players. Even without artifact lands, [Arcbound Ravager](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arcbound+Ravager+)  and [Cranial Plating](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cranial+Plating+)  were stealing games with the help of [Fling](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fling). 


Rounding out our top five were two...control decks? Teachings had 16 players and Gifts had 13 players. The recent bannings helped remove turn-three and turn-four wins in aggro and control decks. Would that be enough to allow a control deck to flourish?


This was only five of the 35 archetypes seen on Saturday. Modern was showing itself to be very wide open, even in these early stages of the format. Will a new deck emerge as the deck to beat? We would find out at day's end on Saturday.
