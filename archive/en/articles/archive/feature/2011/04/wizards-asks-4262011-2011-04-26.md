*What's your favorite card in the* [*full* New Phyrexia *Card Image Gallery*](http://www.wizards.com/magic/tcg/article.aspx?x=mtg/tcg/newphyrexia/spoiler)*, and why?*

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/mtgcom/authorpics/authorpic_daveguskin.jpg)**Dave Guskin:** Since I was on both the design and development teams for *New Phyrexia*, I had ample opportunity to get to know these cards as they evolved. Normally, I would hem and haw here a bit and select "many" of my favorites, but this is *New Phyrexia*—the weak crumble beneath the strong, and All Are One. Only one card in *New Phyrexia* is truly worthy of favorite status: Phyrexian Metamorph.

The Metamorph is the pinnacle of Phyrexianization. It combines so many wonderful bits of Phyrexia on a single card. If your opponent has something awesome, now you do too. For the small price of 2 life, you don't even need to be playing blue. The kinds of decks I build can basically all make use of the redundancy and versatility of the Metamorph. It's creatively perfect too. The Metamorph is the perfect synthesis of metal and flesh, since it retains its artifact-ness even when it copies a creature. Finally, the art has that terrifying *Terminator* feel to it—more than any other card in the set, I look at Phyrexian Metamorph and think "I do NOT want to be on the other side of the looking glass this time."

Okay, okay, I should also give some honorable mentions: Birthing Pod, because there's basically no limit to the number of decks for which it can serve as centerpiece; Elesh Norn, Grand Cenobite, because she's a totally awesome Praetor, which grew out of the "Elites" cycle that I designed; and Life's Finale, because nothing says Phyrexia like griefing your already reeling opponent.
