**What deck are you playing and why?**


Lands, I've been playing it for four years.


**What was your best card this weekend and why?**


[Glacial Chasm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glacial+Chasm), you can’t die if you play it right. [Drop of Honey](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Drop+of+Honey) is close second, thanks Matthew Patte


**What do you enjoy most about Legacy?**


Playing against so many different decks and seeing if you are prepared enough for anything.


**What would winning the Grand Prix mean to you?**


It would mean the most to me. I’ve been playing long enough, and all the support from my friends and family have kept me in the game. This one is for my mom and everyone who has supported me on the grind.

Just got Silver from this finish


**What deck are you playing and why?**


Sneak and Show. I don’t play Legacy at all, and it is pretty easy to play. You also win quickly but still interact with other combo decks.


**What was your best card this weekend and why?**


[Show and Tell](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Show+and+Tell). It’s the best card in the deck by a mile. If it resolves you can almost never lose. And my version is playing [Omniscience](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Omniscience) so you actually can’t lose if you resolve [Show and Tell](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Show+and+Tell).


**What do you enjoy most about Legacy?**


If you don’t die on the first few turns, then the games are very interactive and filled with meaningful decisions. There are lots of opportunities to outplay your opponent.


**What would winning the Grand Prix mean to you?**


A lot? It would make it hard to match my finish tomorrow at the Modern Grand Prix.

Grixis Delver. It’s powerful and disruptive.

[Deathrite Shaman](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deathrite+Shaman). The card does everything.


**What do you enjoy most about Legacy?**


I enjoy how much thought goes into each turn and how powerful the cards are.


**What would winning the Grand Prix mean to you?**


It would tie me with GP Portland winner Robert Santana for most Grand Prix wins on Team Top Deck Keep.

Grixis Delver, because Matt Dilks the “Slayer” said so. Thanks to Mark Dizon for lending me the deck and Dilks for the best 10-page match-up guide.


**What was your best card this weekend and why?**


[Deathrite Shaman](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deathrite+Shaman), it just feels so good to accelerate early and win in the late game.

Som many decisions, I think it really rewards play skill.

Everything.

**Previous Magic Accomplishments:**

**What deck are you playing and why?**


UR Delver. It’s good against fair decks and has game against fast combo.


**What was your best card this weekend and why?**


[Thunderous Wrath](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thunderous+Wrath). 5 damage for one red.


**What do you enjoy most about Legacy?**


It’s a ton of fun to play.


**What would winning the Grand Prix mean to you?**


Don’t know. Making Top 8 is already my best Magic achievement.

**Hometown:** Seattle


**Occupation:** software engineer


**Previous Magic Accomplishments:**


Top 8 at GP Orlando


4 other 12-2 finishes this year


**What deck are you playing and why?**


Temur Delver. All my spells are extremely cheap so I always have options. And [Nimble Mongoose](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nimble+Mongoose) is insanely good.


**What was your best card this weekend and why?**


[Nimble Mongoose](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nimble+Mongoose). No one is prepared to answer it, so I often won when my opponent had 2 or 3 removal spells in hand.


**What do you enjoy most about Legacy?**


The variety. Other than 4 Grixis Delver, I played against all different archetypes, all of which had really interesting games.


**What would winning the Grand Prix mean to you?**


It would be a great finish to my first year of actively traveling to GPs, and give me a chance to qualify for Gold in Kyoto at my first PT.
