 Ah yes, the build-around-me uncommon. After you play Limited *Magic* for a few years, you start to notice things like build-around-me uncommons. After your twentieth draft in a given format, the "normal" archetypes may start to lose their novelty, and you'll start looking around for something else to experiment with—a way to go deeper.



A build-around-me uncommon is a card that is not very good on its own but begs to have a deck built around it. This usually involves taking some risk both in the draft portion and the games themselves. The reward is the interesting part. Sometimes it's huge, allowing you to hit from an angle that the format isn't ready for. Other times, the risk doesn't pan out and you end up building around an effect that isn't worth it.



 One of my favorite build-around-me uncommons showed up in my favorite draft format ever—triple *Innistrad*:

*Innistrad* was a deep format and it took a while before my eye started wandering toward new strategies. Around my eightieth draft, I finally went all-in on [Burning Vengeance](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Burning+Vengeance). Flashback was a big mechanic in that set; it lets you play cards from your graveyard. So the key was to get a [Burning Vengeance](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Burning+Vengeance) and then take all the flashback cards you could get.




 You would even play some flashback cards you wouldn't normally consider playing. This is the "going deep" part of the equation. You're forced to think outside the box and venture into new territory. I used the knowledge I had with the [Burning Vengeance](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Burning+Vengeance) deck in Draft to turn a mediocre Sealed pool into a Day-Two Sealed pool at [Grand Prix Austin](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/eventcoverage/gpaus12/welcome) that year.




 Going deep has its rewards, but you do have to keep yourself from going *too* deep.




 This week, we have two new *Khans of Tarkir* previews for you, both of which fall under the category of build-around-me uncommon.
