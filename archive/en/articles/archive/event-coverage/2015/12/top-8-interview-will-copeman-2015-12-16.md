After 13 grueling rounds of Extended Will Copeman from Brisbane was one of the top 8 finalists in Sydney's Grand Prix. While waiting for the judge's announcement of the final standings, we caught up with Will. 



**Firstly, what was your record to come in the top 8?**  

I had 10 wins, 2 losses and a draw.



**How many byes did you have?**  

Two!



**What do you think about the bye system?**  

It gives too good of a resistance. Apart from that I don't mind it.



**What were your expectations coming into the Grand Prix?**  

I really didn't have any expectations. I'm really broke so I'd just like to win some money.



**Did you playtest much for this event?**  

For this GP I playtested much more than usual, plus I had finished my exams early and had time on my hands. 



**Why did you play Trade/Survival?**  

Having played Trade/ Survival for ages I know the deck pretty well. It doesn't have any bad matchups, except combo.



**So do you have any particular strategies against combo?**  

I don't know, get a God draw and hope they do a bad Demonic Consultation.



**What card should be banned from this format?**  

Force of Will! Because almost every deck plays four of them. It also makes Trix too good.



**What do you think about the Top 8?**  

I don't think I'm going to win. My next matchup is against Trix and there are a lot of combo decks in the Top 8.



**Lastly how does it feel to be Craig's Hong favorite pro-tour player?**  

I think I'm the only one he ever knows. But it's pretty cool.
