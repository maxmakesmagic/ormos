**Juan Carlos Adebo Diaz (RW Heroic) vs Sebastien Knoerr (Mono Black Aggro)**




 In Game 1, Knoerr had a great start with [Thoughtseize](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtseize) on turn one, [Pain Seer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pain+Seer) on turn two, and [Master of the Feast](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Master+of+the+Feast) on turn three. Abedo Diaz fought back by making lots of 1/1 tokens with [Launch the Fleet](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Launch+the+Fleet), but fell to the 5/5 flyer.




 In Game 2, Abedo Diaz boosted his army with [Phalanx Leader](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phalanx+Leader), while Knoerr was stuck on two lands. Knoerr quickly lost to an onslaught of 1/1s with lots of +1/+1 counters on them.




 In Game 3, Knoerr used discard spells to strip Abdedo Diaz of creatures, and then upped the pressure with [Tormented Hero](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tormented+Hero) and Mogis's Marauder. Stuck with lots of enchantments and pump spells in hand, Abedo Diaz was unable to find a creature in time to claw back into the game.

**Fabrizio Anteri (BUG) – Marcio Carvalho (RGW Midrange)**




 In Game 1, Anteri curved out reasonably with [Courser of Kruphix](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Courser+of+Kruphix); [Kiora, the Crashing Wave](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kiora%2C+the+Crashing+Wave); and [Prognostic Sphinx](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Prognostic+Sphinx), while Carvalho was stuck with 3 Elspeth, Sun's Champion and 2 [Brimaz, King of Oreskos](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brimaz%2C+King+of+Oreskos) in hand without a second white source in play.




 In Game 2, Carvalho had a quick start with [Sylvan Caryatid](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sylvan+Caryatid) on turn 2; [Xenagos, the Reveler](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Xenagos%2C+the+Reveler) on turn 3; and two [Fleecemane Lion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fleecemane+Lion) on turn 4. When he made both of them monstrous on turn 5, the game was over.




 In Game 3, there was an initial flurry of planeswalkers, creatures, and removal spells. After the dust settled, Anteri had [Prognostic Sphinx](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Prognostic+Sphinx), while Carvalho had Elspeth, Sun's Champion. As it turns out, when these cards go head-to-head, the flyer wins out, in no small part due to the ability to set up great draw steps turn after turn.

**Bradley Barclay (BUG) - Tamas Glied (RGW Midrange)**




 Game 1 was a long, drawn-out grindfest in which Glied's Elspeth, Sun's Champion played a crucial role: It first took down [Reaper of the Wilds](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reaper+of+the+Wilds), and then made tokens that eventually killed [Kiora, the Crashing Wave](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kiora%2C+the+Crashing+Wave). A couple turns later, an interesting situation arose. Glied had [Xenagos, the Reveler](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Xenagos%2C+the+Reveler); a bunch of 2/2 Satyr tokens; [Stormbreath Dragon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stormbreath+Dragon); and various other creatures in play. If he would activate the +1 ability on Xenagos, then he could get enough mana to make [Stormbreath Dragon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stormbreath+Dragon) monstrous and attack all-out for exactly enough damage. If he would activate the +0 ability on Xenagos, then the addition of the 2/2 token would not be sufficient to make his attack lethal. There was some confusion between the players as to whether Glied had activated the +0 ability or not, especially given that Glied had a Satyr token in hand. To resolve this situation, head judge Kevin Desprez was called in. After talking to both players, he ruled that merely having a token in hand doesn't imply a commitment to activating the +0 ability. Glied was allowed to activate the +1 ability and won right away.




 Game 2 was over more quickly. Basically, haste creatures and Elspeth, Sun's Champion match up well against [Kiora, the Crashing Wave](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kiora%2C+the+Crashing+Wave) and [Reaper of the Wilds](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reaper+of+the+Wilds).

**Valentin Mackl (RGW Midrange) - Nikolas Labahn (Mono Black Devotion)**




 In Game 1, Labahn used 3 [Thoughtseize](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtseize), 1 [Brain Maggot](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brain+Maggot), and 1 [Disciple of Phenax](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Disciple+of+Phenax) to completely strip Mackl off of any relevant spells. Eventually, Labahn locked up the game with [Herald of Torment](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Herald+of+Torment) and [Abhorrent Overlord](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Abhorrent+Overlord).




 In Game 2, Labahn once again had 2 [Thoughtseize](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtseize), but was unable to prevent Mackl from resolving an early [Xenagos, the Reveler](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Xenagos%2C+the+Reveler). A lot of Satyr tokens came out to party and handed Mackl the game.




 In Game 3, it was a removal slugfest on both sides, with multiple copies of [Silence the Believers](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Silence+the+Believers) and [Banishing Light](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Banishing+Light) killing creatures left and right. Yet, Mackl managed to stick [Xenagos, the Reveler](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Xenagos%2C+the+Reveler) and [Stormbreath Dragon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stormbreath+Dragon), and they eventually took him to victory.
