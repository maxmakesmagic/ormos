A game of **Magic** is a collection of stories waiting to happen -- and not just stories about game zones, card advantage and damage going on the stack. It's also about the flavor of the game: the imagery of dueling wizards duking it out on a mystic battlefield, which is evoked by the cards' names, art, flavor text, mechanics and rules. In honor of Equipment Week we again investigate the [flavor of equipment](/en/articles/archive/flavor-equipment-2004-02-18), this time focusing on the rich tradition of weaponry of the Kamigawa Block and all the top-down flavor it brings to your **Magic** games. 

* Certain notoriously flavorful **[Godo, Bandit Warlord](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Godo%252C%2BBandit%2BWarlord)** are never without their [Tenza, Godo's Maul](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Tenza%252C%2BGodo%2527s%2BMaul), or at least a handy battlefield-salvaged [General's Kabuto](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=General%2527s%2BKabuto) or a trusty, well-strung [Hankyu](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Hankyu).
* **[Neko-Te](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Neko-Te)** conjures the image of a [Higure, the Still Wind](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Higure%252C%2Bthe%2BStill%2BWind) wearing poisoned claws, his venom paralyzing any [Opal-Eye, Konda's Yojimbo](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Opal-Eye%252C%2BKonda%2527s%2BYojimbo) who stands in his way as he steals a set of ancestral [Oathkeeper, Takeno's Daisho](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Oathkeeper%252C%2BTakeno%2527s%2BDaisho).
* **[O-Naginata](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=O-Naginata)** is a hefty polearm with long reach -- suitable for doing battle even with [Yosei, the Morning Star](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Yosei%252C%2Bthe%2BMorning%2BStar) -- but with an iron blade so heavy that only a [Takenuma Bleeder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Takenuma%2BBleeder) can wield it.
* The **[Manriki-Gusari](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Manriki-Gusari)** is a chain weapon specially designed to break other weapons. Many an overconfident [Nezumi Cutthroat](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Nezumi%2BCutthroat) wielding a [Umezawa's Jitte](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Umezawa%2527s%2BJitte) has been brought down with a snap of the manriki, even without the interference of the [Yuki-Onna](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Yuki-Onna).
* The **[Konda's Banner](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Konda%2527s%2BBanner)** can [Nagao, Bound by Honor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Nagao%252C%2BBound%2Bby%2BHonor) of [Kitsune Blademaster](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Kitsune%2BBlademaster) who see it wave, or fuel the rage of one spirit and his [Sekki, Seasons' Guide](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Sekki%252C%2BSeasons%2527%2BGuide) in their battle for justice.
* **[Okiba-Gang Shinobi](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Okiba-Gang%2BShinobi)** are masters of flavor, pulling out every [Blinding Powder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Blinding%2BPowder) to make [Shuriken](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Shuriken) on [Traproot Kami](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Traproot%2BKami) while sneaking in to cause mayhem [Shuko](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Shuko).
