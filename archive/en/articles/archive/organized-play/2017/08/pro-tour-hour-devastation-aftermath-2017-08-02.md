I'm writing this at the venue for Pro Tour *Hour of Devastation*. We just crowned a Pro Tour Champion and witnessed some exhilarating *Magic* all weekend.


As the folks here on the coverage production team look ahead to the *Magic: The Gathering* World Championship—with its field of 24 players now confirmed—many of you may be looking ahead to this weekend. After all, that's because it'll be . . .


Game Day!
=========


Game Day for *Hour of Devastation* takes place this weekend, meaning it'll be your chance to take your Standard deck to your local participating game store to battle for bragging rights and some cool stuff.


Players who play in a Game Day event will receive a full-art [Abrade](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Abrade) promo card (while supplies last).

The Top 8 competitors at each Game Day get to up their full-art action with a copy of a the adorable [Adorned Pouncer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Adorned+Pouncer) promo. Eternal kitties, anyone?

Speaking of Standard tournaments this weekend . . .


GP Minneapolis
==============


While Ramunap Red incinerated the competition at Pro Tour *Hour of Devastation*, all eyes are on that deck going into Minneapolis. Will the metagame adjust to defeat the new red boss in town?


We'll be providing live video coverage from this event on [twitch.tv/magic](https://www.twitch.tv/magic) starting Saturday at 8 a.m. PT/11 a.m. ET/3 p.m. UTC, with Day Two of GP coverage beginning at 7 a.m. PT/10 a.m. ET/2 p.m. UTC.


Tune in to see how Standard evolves!
