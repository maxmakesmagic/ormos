If you read **magicthegathering.com** regularly, you've probably seen R&D playtest cards. Sometimes they're hastily scrawled-on blanks, with just enough information to remind Future Future League playtesters which card they're looking at:

Other times, they're the coded stickers used for Limited playtests, lovingly applied by R&D interns:

But those cards are for sets that haven't been printed yet. The developers who worked on the four *Planechase* decks were working mostly with existing cards. They used playtest stickers for the planes, on different cardstock to prevent confusion. They cobbled together the 60-card decks out of cards from the R&D vault, leftover playtest cards from recent sets, and brand new, FFL-style playtest cards.

Let's see ... That's two real cards (one of which is really old), a handmade playtest card, a real leftover from the recent *Alara Reborn* development process, and what could very well be an original *Onslaught* playtest sticker for [Akroma's Vengeance](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Akroma%27s+Vengeance)—except that it's on a *Time Spiral* card.

Developer Dave Guskin went above and beyond, not only writing out nearly complete text on his playtest cards—almost unheard of—but also furnishing them with illustrations:
