Vintage Super League is about to hit the halfway point in the regular season. After tonight’s show, players will have just four more weeks to try to maneuver their way into one of the Top 4 playoff spots. Even more importantly, everyone wants to stay out of last, as the 10th place finisher is not invited back to play season 3.

Last week’s finals rematch between Luis Scott-Vargas and Steve Menendian did not disappoint. Luis put on a clinic, demonstrating all three of Luck, Skill, and Victory. You can watch the match [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qBo_rA5PWY&index=4&list=PL3rP64NRtmbgLkm4Kfm8TSYpahn5qunJ5). You can also watch Luis and a rather shell-shocked Steve discuss the match immediately afterwards as they prepared to commentate the next match.

The big match tonight features our last two undefeated players: Chris Pikula and Eric Froehlich. At 4-0 these two are in great shape to make the Top 4, but nothing is secure and I’m sure whoever wins will feel even better at 5-0. Interestingly, both players chose to switch to decks based around [Mishra’s Workshop](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mishra%E2%80%99s+Workshop) for the middle set of games, though the details are fairly different. You can check out all of the new decklists [here](http://magic.wizards.com/en/MTGO/articles/archive/vintage-super-league-season-2-decklists). There is quite a bit of spice in there, including three different takes on what you can do with *Fate Reforged* card [Monastery Mentor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Monastery+Mentor).
