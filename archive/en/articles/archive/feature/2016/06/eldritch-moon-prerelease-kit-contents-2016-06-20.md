Blake is the content manager for DailyMTG.com, making him the one you should email if you have thoughts on the website, good or less good (or not good). He's a longtime coverage reporter and hasn't turned down a game of Magic in any format ever. 






Now that the [mysterious cause](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/feature/access-magic-eldritch-moon-episode-1-2016-06-20) of Innistrad's madness has been revealed, we can reveal a few other things. (Note of caution: I highly recommend watching that video before reading on.)


The Prerelease is still a few weeks away, but as we'll be talking about it repeatedly over the next few weeks, I thought I'd give you a sneak peek at what to expect when you sign up for an *Eldritch Moon* Prerelease.


First up, this is what your Prerelease pack will look like:

That spooky mood lines everything about *Eldritch Moon*. We may have solved the mystery, but that just means Emrakul's madness is in full effect. Horrors and terrors will abound.


There will also be dice.

But the coolest piece of all is the premium foil, double-faced Zombie tokens that look a bit like this:

Turn Over


Don't worry, each Prerelease kit also includes a premium foil rare or mythic rare from the set—it's a premium bonanza! But you have to wait. The drawback to a sneak peek is that you have to wait for the real thing. In this case, the wait ends July 16 with the *Eldritch Moon* Prerelease. Contact your [local store](http://locator.wizards.com/) to sign up.
