Coming in at first was Jund with 48 decks. [Bloodbraid Elf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodbraid+Elf) and [Putrid Leech](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Putrid+Leech) returned to the main stage after their dominance of the not-so-distant past Standard format.

Vivid lands and [Reflecting Pool](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reflecting+Pool) enabled control players to cram all the best answers together in Vivid Control decks. Forty-one players were able to assemble cards with mana requirements that ranged from [Runed Halo](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Runed+Halo) to [Cruel Ultimatum](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cruel+Ultimatum) with relative ease.

[Valakut, the Molten Pinnacle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Valakut%2C+the+Molten+Pinnacle) got a little boost from [Scapeshift](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scapeshift). This "one-card" combo became even more potent as 32 competitors combined [Valakut, the Molten Pinnacle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Valakut%252C%2Bthe%2BMolten%2BPinnacle) with [Prismatic Omen](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Prismatic+Omen). A turn-five [Scapeshift](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scapeshift) could easily deal up to 45 damage to an unprepared opponent.

[Bitterblossom](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bitterblossom) and [Cryptic Command](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cryptic+Command) were seen in the fourth-place archetype as 30 players sleeved up Faeries. [Mistbind Clique](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mistbind+Clique), [Spellstutter Sprite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spellstutter+Sprite) and the rest of the gang were terrorizing the skies while preventing opponents from resolving key spells.

The green-white ramp decks from the past were retooled to take advantage of Windswept Heights and Mosswart Bridge. The green-white Hideaway deck, piloted by 28 people, was regularly casting [Emrakul, the Aeons Torn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Emrakul%2C+the+Aeons+Torn) for a much lower cost than 15 mana.

Rounding out the top six decks was White Weenie. Twenty-one players decided on this breakout deck from Pro Tourâ€“Amsterdam.

This was only six of the 25 archetypes seen on Saturday. Extended was showing itself as a very wide open format. We would see next year if the upcoming Pro Tour Qualifier season would support this observation..
