 Won the two Grand Prix Trials I've competed in.
 



**What was your record in Sealed? What did you play? What was the hardest decision in your build?**
  
9-0. Abzan splashing Crater's Claws. There were no difficult decisions. The pool built itself. [Wingmate Roc](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wingmate+Roc) OP.
 



**What was your record in Draft 1? What did you play? What did you first-pick and why?**
  
2-1 (11-0 at one point!). I played five-color good stuff. First-picked [Flying Crane Technique](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flying+Crane+Technique) because it wins games.
 



**What was your record in Draft 2? What did you play? What did you first-pick and why?**
  
2-1. I played Abzan splashing red. I first-picked [Arc Lightning](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arc+Lightning) because it's versatile and cheap.
 



**Which *Khans of Tarkir* card has changed the most in your evaluation for Limited?** 
  
[Dragonscale Boon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragonscale+Boon). When it was spoiled I thought it wasn't that good, but I now know its power.




**What present would you most like to unwrap during your Top 8 draft?** 
  
Foil [Wingmate Roc](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wingmate+Roc).
