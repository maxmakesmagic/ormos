Goblins have a way of getting into trouble. It seems as if some of the little creeps got into the editing or typesetting files at some point, as there exist a couple of high-profile Goblin misprints.


***Starter 1999*:** Both [Mons's Goblin Raiders](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mons%27s+Goblin+Raiders) and [Goblin Hero](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Hero) -- notorious vanilla common creatures -- appeared in that particular Starter game as part of the pre-made decks. And both of them had gold expansion symbols, indicating that they were rare. Yeah, right, those guys *wish* they were rare.


***Anthologies* Box Set:** The Anthologies box set had quite a few errors, and two of them pertain to Goblins. The big one is the mana cost on [Mogg Raider](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mogg+Raider): ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227130159im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/red.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227130159im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/red.gif) instead of ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227130159im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/red.gif). As per the Oracle (and the *Tempest* version), ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227130159im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/red.gif) is correct and the card should be played as such. The minor error is the expansion symbol on the [Goblin Hero](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Hero). It has *The Dark*'s symbol, even though the art is from the *Fifth Edition* version. Either the art should have been the original Mark Tedin version, or the expansion symbol should have been removed.
