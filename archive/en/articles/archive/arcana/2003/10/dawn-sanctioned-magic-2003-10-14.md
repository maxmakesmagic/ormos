Some of the latest news in tournament-level **Magic**, as Daniel Stahl reported [last week](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/feature/181), is that MagicTheGathering.com will soon include a section for tournament-level **Magic** strategy and event coverage. Today we take a look at some of the *oldest* news in tournament history: **Magic**'s first sanctioned tournament.


The first **Magic: The Gathering** tournament sanctioned by the DCI took place at Gen Con 1993. Not many records of that tournament are still around, but we still have a play-by-play record of the last duel. In the following transcript, Rick Townsend, running a defensive green-white deck, faces off against Alex Parrish's aggressive red-black. (It's important to note that, as mentioned in a past [Magic Arcana](/en/articles/archive/alpha-oops-ii-2002-02-25), [Orcish Oriflamme](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Orcish+Oriflamme) was misprinted in Alpha with a mana cost of ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20211201201921im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless1.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227130159im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/red.gif).) 


Rick and Alex are tied in the finals, 1-1, and this duel would decide the winner of the first sanctioned tournament. (Transcription by Steve Bishop and Monty Ashley.)

It was a simpler time, wasn't it? Doesn't it make you want to wax nostalgic, dig out your Alpha cards and build an [Orcish Oriflamme](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Orcish+Oriflamme) deck? (Or perhaps you it makes you run screaming and go crack packs of *Mirrodin*.)
