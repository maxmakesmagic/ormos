Teeming hordes of new *Planar Chaos* slivers have evolved since their renaissance in *Time Spiral*. When a new sliver's card art is being commissioned, a lot of thought is put into matching the sliver's anatomy to its mechanic. This can be quite the task, considering the fact that sliver morphology is actually very consistent, and that there are now over 70 slivers in print!


Today you get a chance to play art director. The artists have sent in sketches of four slivers for *Planar Chaos*. Can you match them to their mechanic by the sketch art alone?
