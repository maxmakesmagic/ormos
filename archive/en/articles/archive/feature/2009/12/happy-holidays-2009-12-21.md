It's that time of year again—a time for family and feasting, for reflection and repose ... and for the only two weeks each year when the Daily MTG staff lets any of those things overshadow the all-consuming goal of bringing you exclusive **Magic** articles, activities, decks, announcements, and inside information every single weekday.


But back to that "reflection" thing for a moment. The site's various contributors have taken this chance to select some of our favorite features from the past year and repost them for your perusal. In the article slots, each column's current author (or, for feature articles, the site's editor) has selected two favorite articles and written some short commentary on the reasons for choosing them. The Magic Arcana slot will host some of the staff's favorite Arcanas from the past year (and don’t forget [these wallpapers](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/arcana/340) based on the four **Magic** holiday promo cards). Down in the Daily Deck and Card of the Day slots, where repeats are less compelling, you'll find a couple of fun holiday treats that will stay up while we’re gone. And over on [the **Magic Online** page](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=Magic/Digital/MagicOnline.aspx), automated event coverage will continue throughout the break.


Here in the Daily Activity slot, reruns don't make a whole lot of sense. So here's our suggested activity for today, and for every day during the break: Have a great holiday season, stay safe, and spend some time with the people (or cards) you love most!


We'll return on Monday, January 4 with all-new articles, including a word from Director of **Magic** R&D Aaron Forsythe about what's up with **Magic** as we head in to 2010. See you then!
