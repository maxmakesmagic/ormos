*Magic* 30 Virtual Experience
=============================


![](https://media.wizards.com/2022/images/daily/3v9gp8lksu6.jpg)


The *Magic* 30 celebration kicks off October 28, and *MTG Arena* has ways you can virtually join the festivities—including the Mixed-Up Premier Draft! Stay tuned—more details are coming soon.


This Weekend: Qualifier Play-In and Qualifier Weekend Events
============================================================


This weekend, you can fast-track into *Magic* competitive play through two events that can put you well on your way to the top!


First Stop: Best-of Three Qualifier Play-In
-------------------------------------------


![Qualifier Play-In October 14–15](https://media.wizards.com/2022/images/daily/48lt0iicq3i.jpg)


The Best-of-Three [Qualifier Play-In](https://www.magic.gg/events/qualifier-play-in) event starts this Friday, October 14, at 6 a.m. PT (13:00 UTC). Face off against players in Standard until Saturday, October 15, at 3 a.m. PT (10:00 UTC) to earn a place in the Qualifier Weekend.


Next Stop: Qualifier Weekend
----------------------------


![Qualifier Weekend October 15–16](https://media.wizards.com/2022/images/daily/o09wqvfuc92.jpg)


The [Qualifier Weekend](https://magic.gg/events/qualifier-weekend) event is two days of Standard Best-of-Three competition against some of the best *MTG Arena* players. Day One begins Saturday, October 15, at 6 a.m. PT (13:00 UTC)—right on the heels of the Qualifier Play-In. Seven wins gets you into the Day Two event that starts on Sunday, October 16, at 6 a.m. PT (13:00 UTC).


The entry window for both Day One (Saturday) and Day Two (Sunday) events in the Qualifier Weekend is just two hours on each day, from 6–8 a.m. (13:00–15:00 UTC), so don't be late!


Meathook Massacre Banned in Standard
====================================


[The Meathook Massacre](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=The+Meathook+Massacre) has been banned in Standard. This will take effect in *MTG Arena* tomorrow, October 13. For details on this and a look at other formats, including Pioneer, check out the [October 10, 2022, Banned and Restricted Announcement](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/news/october-10-2022-banned-and-restricted-announcement).


Collection Progress Tracking!
=============================


Have you seen the new collection progress tracker? Now you can track how many cards from each *MTG Arena* set you've collected!


![Collection tracker screen showing partial completion of Innistrad: Crimson Vow set in MTG Arena](https://media.wizards.com/2022/images/daily/collection_tracker.jpg)


You can find the tracker by selecting the **Profile** tab and looking under the Progression section. Select **Set Collection** to see your progress as you collect cards from each *MTG Arena* set.


A further improvement to collection tracking is coming tomorrow (Thursday, October 13) that will prevent uncraftable cards from *Ikoria: Lair of Behemoths* and other older sets from counting toward your collection progress.


High-Resolution Mobile App Card Art
===================================


No, your vision didn't suddenly get better—but the card art in the *MTG Arena* mobile app did! Now you can enjoy *Magic*'s amazing artwork on mobile devices even more thanks to higher resolution card images.


Rebalancing: Diviner of Fates
=============================


While we were satisfied with the metagame of the first Arena Championship, Diviner of Fates was a power outlier in the tournament. We are removing 2 toughness from Diviner of Fates to make it easier to attach through and remove with toughness-based removal such as [Cut Down](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cut+Down). and [Lightning Strike](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Strike).


We still believe Diviner of Fates will have a place in Esper decks, as it will still be just as effective at generating card advantage.
