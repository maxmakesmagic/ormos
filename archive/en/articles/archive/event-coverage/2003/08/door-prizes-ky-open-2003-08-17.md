Event sponsor Books and Music Exchange continued to show their love for the local Magic scene. Just about every tournament they deal at, you can count on more prizes being added to the tournament. Aside from tossing in an extra five hundred dollars, the store threw in the following door prizes. 

Sealed Box: Stephen Newell, Chris Waits and Dustin McKnight  
 Alpha Birds of Paradise: Derek Glenn  
 4 Blistering Firecat: Jason Mahoney  
 4 Birds of Paradise: Donald Mason  
 4 Dual Lands: Jacob Beal  
 4 Serendib Djinn: James Kimbell  
 4 Polluted Delta: Tony Pascasio  
 4 Bloodstained Mire: Ian Bourgeois  
 4 Windswept Heath: Daniel Alexander

Wizards of the Coast also showed their support of the Kentucky Magic community as well. They tossed in boxes of Scourge to increase the payout to the top sixteen and also graciously allowed coverage of the event on their website sideboard.com. Still that was not enough, and they tossed in a Box of Italian Legends as well. 

Every round, four random players got a pack, and at the end of the swiss, the bottom six players also received packs as well.
