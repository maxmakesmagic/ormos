Under the printed wording of [Frenetic Efreet](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Frenetic+Efreet) (from the *Mirage* expansion), it is possible to make a [Chance Encounter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chance+Encounter) deck that can win ten coin flips in no time. Just play the Efreet on turn three, then the Encounter on turn four and then activate the Efreet a few thousand times in response to one another. The Efreet would either phase out or die as a result of the first resolution, but you'd get to keep flipping coins. And you'd be sure to win ten flips out of thousands, satisfying [Chance Encounter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chance+Encounter)'s win condition.


But the alert people on the rules team stopped this little combo dead before it ever had a chance to work, issuing errata on [Frenetic Efreet](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Frenetic+Efreet). According to the [Oracle](http://archive.wizards.com/dci/main.asp?x=oracle) card reference, Frenetic should now read as follows:


Frenetic Efreet  
 {1}{U}{R}  
 Creature -- Efreet  
 2/1  
 Flying  
 {0}: If Frenetic Efreet is in play, flip a coin. If you win the flip, Frenetic Efreet phases out. If you lose the flip, sacrifice Frenetic Efreet.


Now if the Efreet isn't in play (and it won't be once a single flip resolves), you don't flip any more coins. So much for that killer combo!
