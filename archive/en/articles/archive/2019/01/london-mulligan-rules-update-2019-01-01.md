With the Core Set 2020 release, mulligan rules have been updated to the "London Mulligan" across digital and tabletop.


* Each time you take a mulligan, you draw seven cards.
* Once you decide which hand to keep, you must put a number of cards from your hand equal to the number of times you have mulliganed this game on the bottom of your library in the order of your choice.
* If you mulliganed once, you have to put one card back, etc.
