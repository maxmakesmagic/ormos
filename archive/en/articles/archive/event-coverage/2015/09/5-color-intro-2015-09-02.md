The second format played at this year's Invitational is a popular casual constructed format called '5-color'. Each deck consists of two hundred and fifty cards with a minimum of eighteen cards in each color. Players are allowed to use any Vintage-format (Type 1) legal card as well as any ante card. Like Type 1, 5-color has its own banned and restricted list. To see this list as well as the rules of this format, you should go to the 5-color homepage: [www.5-color.com](http://www.5-color.com).


Ante cards are allowed in 5-color as all games are played for ante. To reflect this fundamental element of the format, all Invitational matches in 5-color will be determined by the player that wins the largest dollar amount in ante.


All day today, the players have been scrambling to find the last few cards for their decks. While they have been successful in borrowing some of the more expensive cards (like Black Lotus and the five Moxen) many common cards, such as Lat-Nam's Legacy and Relearn, have eluded their grasp.
