Welcome back to this week's installment of From the Lab! I'm your ever-loyal host Noel deCordova, and today I'm going to be discussing three or four kooky deck ideas for the Johnnies all around the Internet. You know, kind of like I do every week. 


You may be aware of this, but *Shard of Alara* previews are heading into their final lap. I'm excited about the little bit of the set we've seen so far. I'm super psyched that cycling has returned, and playing [Titanic Ultimatum](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/sf/5) for the win may be my new goal in life. While [last week](/en/articles/archive/locked-orb-it-2008-09-17) I previewed Mindlock Orb, the library hoser extraordinaire, this week I again have no preview. I don't mind, though, with [today's preview](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/stf/5) over at Savor the Flavor being all kinds of awesome. Sharing window space with that sweet behemoth would be like sharing space in a clown car and frankly, I'm no clown. 


![Coldsnap](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/global/images/magic_expansion_coldsnap_expansionLogo_en.jpg)For all those kind folks who pay attention, [two weeks ago](/en/articles/archive/not-so-empty-window-2008-09-10) I built a [Riftmarked Knight](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Riftmarked+Knight) deck in an ode to *Time Spiral* block. That deck had cool interactions with suspend and time counters, which were the main themes of the whole block. For today, since I'm short of *Shards* material (for now) I'm going to write about three of *Coldsnap*'s hidden gems. The lost set, found in a suspiciously ice-cold, pale drawer (okay, a fridge), will be undergoing the rotation process soon, and I figured I'd give it a proper sendoff by building some decks with it. Instead of using the main themes of the set like last time, I think I'll pick a couple of interesting cards that get a lot more interesting-er with cards from the *Lorwyn* and *Shadowmoor* blocks.


### 'Baile Me Out


If I wanted someone to guard borders, I'd ask [Kinsbaile Borderguard](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kinsbaile+Borderguard). Not only does the Kithkin patrol provide good offense and defense, but it's a lot more Kinsbailian than the regular [Border Guard](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Border+Guard). That, and I'm drawn to the plucky short guys. What can I say? I know my own kind.


I've been sitting on a nifty combo with [Kinsbaile Borderguard](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kinsbaile+Borderguard) for a while. You see, when the Borderguard first came out, I noticed its lack of counter distinction. Any type of counter will work, not just +1/+1 counters. After some frantic Gatherer searching, I fell on [Temporal Distortion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Temporal+Distortion). Hourglass counters? Why not, I thought, and after saddling the Borderguard up with [Freed from the Real](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Freed+from+the+Real), I had a weird tap-counter-Kithkin deck.


Little did I know that *Shadowmoor* would provide some great tools for the Borderguard: -1/-1 counters, and [Fate Transfer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fate+Transfer). (*Coldsnap*'s coming, don't get your icicles in a bundle!) The former provides a way to send [Kinsbaile Borderguard](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kinsbaile+Borderguard) to your graveyard proactively, while the latter is a sick combo with anything that comes into play with counters of any sort. A great example of this is [Voracious Hatchling](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Voracious+Hatchling). When you [Fate Transfer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fate+Transfer) its -1/-1 counters to the Borderguard, you'll get a potential three new Kithkin tokens and a 6/6 lifelinking beastie.


Now to introduce *Coldsnap*'s contributions. From Subzero, Dominaria, here's [Woolly Razorback](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Woolly+Razorback)! Once all the ice counters have thawed from the mammoth, uh, mammoth, you're free to swing with it as you will. Speed up the process with [Fate Transfer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fate+Transfer) to beat for 7 as soon as possible. Otherwise it's just stuck blocking and beating Jay Leno in Most Extravagant Chin Contests. A particularly good find was [Ursine Fylgja](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ursine+Fylgja), which starts off with four transferable healing counters, and can regrow them later if needed.

| Kinsbaile Borderguard | Rimefeather Owl |

[Rimefeather Owl](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rimefeather+Owl) is another addition. Basically, it's the [Temporal Distortion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Temporal+Distortion) / [Freed from the Real](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Freed+from+the+Real) combo in one card. Pay ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161225105850im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless2.gif) to put an ice counter on [Kinsbaile Borderguard](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kinsbaile+Borderguard). Then do it again. When the Borderguard eventually kicks the icy bucket (death by frostbite) it'll create tons of little Kithkin, which are more fodder for ice counters, which makes [Rimefeather Owl](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rimefeather+Owl) even bigger. See how this all works?


[JÃ¶tun Owl Keeper](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=J%C3%B6tun+Owl+Keeper), possibly chasing after his prized feathered ward, makes it into the deck as well. The Owl Keeper is great here for many reasons. It creates age counters that can be [Fate Transfer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fate+Transfer)red to the Borderguard. It creates tokens (more on this later). And finally, it's a prime target for [Graceful Reprieve](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Graceful+Reprieve), which has been paired with [Kinsbaile Borderguard](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kinsbaile+Borderguard) from day one. 


[Leech Bonder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leech+Bonder) is a slower but more creature-like version of [Fate Transfer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fate+Transfer). To get it tapped, use the accelerating [Springleaf Drum](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Springleaf+Drum) or the versatile [Mothdust Changeling](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mothdust+Changeling). [Scarscale Ritual](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scarscale+Ritual) can do something similar early on for some card advantage. 


Since [Kinsbaile Borderguard](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kinsbaile+Borderguard) will probably be dying quite a bit in this deck, some recursion would be perfect. [Graceful Reprieve](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Graceful+Reprieve) is fine, but for something a bit more permanent, I went with [Order of Whiteclay](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Order+of+Whiteclay). The previously mentioned one-drops can tap down the Order, and the boys from Whiteclay can recur Owl Keepers, Borderguards, [Aven Riftwatcher](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aven+Riftwatcher)s, and [Vexing Sphinx](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vexing+Sphinx)es to your liking. The latter two are fine [Fate Transfer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fate+Transfer) targets. With the Sphinx, either take the counters off for quick beats, or put age counters on for mucho card-drawing.


I've been saying this for nearly every white or blue deck I've built since *Shadowmoor*, and it definitely holds true here: [Mirrorweave](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mirrorweave) is an excellent addition, since there are plenty of tokens to be created and some good targets for the mass cloning. [Woolly Razorback](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Woolly+Razorback) is one, since your other creatures probably don't have ice counters on them. The same principle goes for [Voracious Hatchling](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Voracious+Hatchling). Hey, even [Kinsbaile Borderguard](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kinsbaile+Borderguard) itself is a good target!

![](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Snow-Covered+Plains)

















  
As you've probably noticed, they were some cards I just couldn't find room for, notably the [Mothdust Changeling](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mothdust+Changeling) and [Scarscale Ritual](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scarscale+Ritual). For some reason, I really wanted to fit the latter in, as well as [Bloodied Ghost](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodied+Ghost). The Ghost can help defuse the [Voracious Hatchling](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Voracious+Hatchling) and is a ripe [Fate Transfer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fate+Transfer) target. Plus, it reminds me of Dr. Malcolm Crowe from *The Sixth Sense*. Add them if you want.


### Yo Ho Ho and a Bottle of Thrum


The following deck is much more than the thrum of its parts. What, didn't like that one? I'm marching to the beat of my own thrum here, buddy. Building up to a Th[rumbling Crescendo](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=rumbling+Crescendo). Not feeling these puns? Good, because truthfully I'm not either. We'll just separate from them like ripples on a blank shore.


Now that puns, references, and bad mockeries of *Urza's Saga* rares (seriously, if you thought that was bad, I spared you from [Rumbling Slum](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Rumbling%2BSlum)âgo ahead, look it up) are behind us, I'll get to [Thrumming Stone](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thrumming+Stone), the crazy artifact I've been hinting at this whole time. Apparently I'm amused by the word "thrum." Ha. Thrummmmmmm.


![Thrumming Stone](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Thrumming+Stone)How do *Lorwyn* and *Shadowmoor* blocks make [Thrumming Stone](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thrumming+Stone) better? Well, *Lorwyn* block in particular has lots of cards that deal with the top of your library. Clash and kinship are the mechanics in question here, and fortunately they mesh with ripple in a good way. Both mechanics act like scry, which can hopefully set you up if you have a matching card in hand.


Yeah, so this interaction isn't that exciting. I can tell by your lack of applesauceâer, applause. The biggest hitters here, though, are the Harbingers! 


No, you cannot pop all your respective [Flamekin Harbinger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flamekin+Harbinger)s into play at once. However, by playing a Harbinger, you can set up a ripple for a beefy creature in your hand in advance. This idea is so open-ended that you could build a viable Thrum / Harbinger deck for each *Lorwyn* tribe. I picked Elves and Faeries out from the other tribes because they're both powerful and fun to play with. 


I'm not going to use Faeries because they see enough of the limelight as it is. Here's how I'd go around building a rippling Faerie deck, though. Imagine flashing in [Faerie Harbinger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Faerie+Harbinger) and setting up a [Glen Elendra Liege](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glen+Elendra+Liege) on top. Next turn, you'd draw the Liege, ripple some [Ponder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ponder)s to check out the top of your library, then play the [Glen Elendra Liege](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glen+Elendra+Liege) with possible ripple copies. With all the pesky Faeries you're probably running, you'd probably be swinging for a lot that turn and next.


If you're sick of Faeries, consider building around Elves. Four [Elvish Harbinger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elvish+Harbinger)s can find many of your key elves and, if rippling, provide a crazy quick mana boost. [Gilt-Leaf Seer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gilt-Leaf+Seer) and [Farhaven Elf](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Farhaven+Elf) can stack your deck and suck lands out of your deck, respectively. [Devoted Druid](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Devoted+Druid) helps accelerate into [Thrumming Stone](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thrumming+Stone) along with the Harbingers. 


Two green reject rares from recent sets improve greatly when rippled. The first is [Talara's Battalion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Talara%27s+Battalion). Although you still need to play a green spell for the first one, rippling into numerous 4/3 tramplers for two mana always seems great. With all the mana in this deck, you should be able to cast the first green spell with no problems. [Manamorphose](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Manamorphose) helps out here, but that's also great to ripple. If you nail all four copies, you've got eight mana for tapping two lands. Take that, [Mana Seism](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Seism)!

| Elvish Harbinger | Gilt-Leaf Archdruid |

The other forgotten rare is [Gilt-Leaf Archdruid](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gilt-Leaf+Archdruid). If you haven't noticed, most of the Elves I mentioned two paragraphs ago are also Druids. Getting two or three Druids for the price of one greatly helps you activate the super land-grab ability, plus you'll be drawing a boatload of cards. [Treefolk Harbinger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treefolk+Harbinger) is another [Forest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest)-finding Druid, and the fun-to-ripple [Regal Force](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Regal+Force) should put you far ahead in cards and beatsticks.

### The Graveborn Identity


Apparently in Ice Ageâera Dominaria, random apostrophes in first names are popular among death-crazed orcs. To continue the trend, I now wish to be known as No'el deCordova for the rest of this article. As for the "being a death-crazed orc" part, it's nothing a little plastic surgery couldn't fix. Or not.


![Sek'Kuar, Deathkeeper](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Sek%27Kuar%2C+Deathkeeper)Sporting the same three colors as the Jund shard in *Shards of Alara*, [Sek'Kuar, Deathkeeper](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sek%27Kuar%2C+Deathkeeper) seems like an appropriate card to build around. Some of the main mechanics from *Lorwyn* and *Shadowmoor* help a Sek'Kuar deck function a lot better. For instance, persist creatues such as [Murderous Redcap](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Murderous+Redcap) and [Kitchen Finks](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kitchen+Finks). [Greater Gargadon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Greater+Gargadon) and [Nantuko Husk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nantuko+Husk) can sacrifice your creatures for various effects. With your dying creatures coming back immediately, you'll have another opportunity for another 3/1 Graveborn token. [Quillspike](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Quillspike) can eat all your -1/-1 counters, making your persist creatures virtually unkillable. 


Evoke is another cheap way of accumulating Graveborn tokens. Evoking a [Shriekmaw](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shriekmaw) can clear the path for a fresh 3/1 to attack freely. Applying to both evoke and persist guys is the forgotten [No Rest for the Wicked](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=No+Rest+for+the+Wicked). Sacrifice all of your spent persist creatures, make a bunch of 3/1 tokens, then sacrifice [No Rest for the Wicked](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=No+Rest+for+the+Wicked) to make more next turn. 


To accumulate the mana for an early Sek'Kuar, I chose another forgotten gem from *Tenth Edition*. [Joiner Adept](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Joiner+Adept) fixes your mana like it's her job (news flash: it is). [Fertilid](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fertilid), meanwhile, accelerates your mana by slowly killing itself, something the Deathkeeper greatly enjoys.

The Jund variations of the dual and fetch lands that Jacob Van Lunen [previewed two weeks ago](/en/articles/archive/building-budget/show-your-true-colors-2008-09-11) would fit in perfectly here, as would [Sprouting Thrinax](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/td/3). The latter seems tailor-made for this deck. When *Shards of Alara* is released, I'll be itching to test out the Thrinax, as well as all the Johnny-riffic cards in the set!


Until next week, have fun with *Coldsnap*!
