It was not an easy path for Ben Ge but he should be rejoicing in the knowledge that he was now qualified for the next Pro Tour in Portland. After dispatching fellow countryman Zhong Jian in the Boros Burn mirror, he hoped that his winning streak would continue



 However, a Japanese [Juggernaut](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Juggernaut) was in his way. Playing in his TWENTIETH Grand Prix Top 8, Watanabe would most certainly like to win this one, because a victory here would put him at 7 Grand Prix victories, tying him with German [Juggernaut](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Juggernaut) Kai Budde.




**Game One**




 Ge answered [Lifebane Zombie](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lifebane+Zombie) with [Searing Blood](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Searing+Blood), but didn't have [Chained to the Rocks](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chained+to+the+Rocks) for [Desecration Demon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Desecration+Demon). He was forced to ram [Chandra's Phoenix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chandra%27s+Phoenix) into it, before finishing of the 6/6 flyer with [Warleader's Helix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Warleader%27s+Helix).




 Now the he was relieved of pressure, Ge was able to slowly unleash an assortment of burn spells at the Japanese Player. [Magma Jet](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Magma+Jet) was first, followed by [Boros Charm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Boros+Charm), and then a second copy.




 Watanabe was down to one life in the blink of an eye and [Chandra's Phoenix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chandra%27s+Phoenix) threatened to end things there and then. Watanabe prayed for the best as he tried to win with [Pack Rat](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pack+Rat), killing [Chandra's Phoenix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chandra%27s+Phoenix) with [Hero's Downfall](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hero%27s+Downfall).




 A brief glimpse of hope shimmered in the distance for Watanabe, when he buffed his life total with [Gray Merchant of Asphodel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gray+Merchant+of+Asphodel), putting him a comfortable 6 life.




 Well, not for very long though. Ge was ready with [Searing Blood](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Searing+Blood) to kill one of the [Pack Rat](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pack+Rat)s and a third [Boros Charm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Boros+Charm) prompted Watanabe to reach for his sideboard.





*Triple [Boros Charm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Boros+Charm)s lead Ben Ge to victory.*
