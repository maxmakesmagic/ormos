S*cars of Mirrodin* [Game Day](http://www.wizards.com/magic/tcg/events.aspx?x=mtgcom/events/gameday-facts) is this weekend! Game Day is an exciting chance to show off your deck-building skills, win prizes, and immerse yourself in the story and flavor of a new set. Be sure to show up for your chance to win exciting extended-art cards from *Scars of Mirrodin* and preview cards from *Mirrodin Besieged*.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/boab/boab114_promoCards.jpg)*Extended-art cards from Scars of Mirrodin.*
Game Day events will be Standard Constructed. Every player receives an extended-art copy of [Memnite](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Memnite) just for playing in the event! If you're lucky enough to finish in the Top 8 then you will be the proud new owner of an extended-art [Tempered Steel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tempered+Steel)!

There's another twist, though. If you look carefully at the cards from *Scars of Mirrodin* you will find two distinctive watermarks: Phyrexian and Mirran. Game Day encourages players to choose a faction. To align your deck with a specific faction you need to play with at least ten cards with the chosen watermark and no cards bearing the mark of the opposing faction.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/boab/boab114_symbols.jpg)The top two players who chose to play Mirran inspired decks will receive a copy of Peace Strider, a preview card from *Mirrodin Besieged*. The top two players who chose to play Phyrexian inspired decks will receive a copy of Pierce Strider. Gatherer has recently been updated to include watermarks as a search criteria; finding the right card of a specific faction won't be difficult.


This week, in light of Game Day, I'd like to work on a deck of each faction.


### Mirran


I'll start with the Mirran cards. A quick [Gatherer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Default.aspx) search and I had [a massive list of cards](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?action=advanced&mark=+%5B%22Mirran%22%5D) that aligned themselves with the Mirran. One card, [Lux Cannon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lux+Cannon), has been begging for me to play with it for some time now. Game Day gives me the opportunity to build a deck around fun cards that I might not play with under normal circumstances.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/boab/boab114_trinket.jpg)[Lux Cannon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lux+Cannon) is a very powerful card once you get to start using it, but getting to that point can be pretty difficult. I put together a deck that's designed to grind out aggressive strategies and take advantage of control decks' streamlined approach to the control game.




|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| 
Lux Cannon
 | 
Trinket Mage
 |

[Trinket Mage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Trinket+Mage) is a personal favorite that I feel has a very high value in this type of strategy. It also happens to be Mirran. A card that gives us access to additional mana, a large threat, a removal spell, or a card that helps our [Lux Cannon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lux+Cannon) seems like a nice addition.


Lets take a minute and look at the trinkets this deck has access to. [Chimeric Mass](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chimeric+Mass) is an obvious inclusion in any deck that plays [Trinket Mage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Trinket+Mage). Having access to a reasonably costed creature is clearly worth the slot. [Brittle Effigy](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brittle+Effigy) is an excellent removal spell that can be cantrip-searched with the [Trinket Mage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Trinket+Mage). [Everflowing Chalice](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Everflowing+Chalice) can boost our mana from four to six and follows the [Trinket Mage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Trinket+Mage) very well on a curve. [Expedition Map](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Expedition+Map) lets us search for [Mystifying Maze](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mystifying+Maze), [Tectonic Edge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tectonic+Edge), and [Dread Statuary](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dread+Statuary).


The spiciest target has the ability to super charge the [Lux Cannon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lux+Cannon). [Voltaic Key](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Voltaic+Key) was once one of the most overpowered cards in the game of **Magic**. These days, a lack of [Thran Dynamo](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thran+Dynamo) and [Grim Monolith](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grim+Monolith) make [Voltaic Key](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Voltaic+Key) a lot less scary. Once you have a [Lux Cannon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lux+Cannon) on the battlefield, though, I can't seem to think of a card I'd rather search for with my [Trinket Mage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Trinket+Mage).



![Spell Pierce](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Spell+Pierce)

 

I overheard more than a few people in the know mention [Spell Pierce](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spell+Pierce) as a secret weapon last weekend at Grand Prix–Toronto. It makes a lot of sense. Opponents will have to work really hard to not be gotten by a [Spell Pierce](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spell+Pierce) these days.



![Mana Leak](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Mana+Leak)

 

[Mana Leak](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak) is a nice way to take the sting out of a third or fifth turn [Everflowing Chalice](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Everflowing+Chalice). It also keeps really strong synergies like [Oracle of Mul Daya](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oracle+of+Mul+Daya) / [Jace, the Mind Sculptor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace%2C+the+Mind+Sculptor) from ever being assembled.



![Volition Reins](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Volition+Reins)

 

[Volition Reins](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Volition+Reins) is another card I've been excited about putting into Constructed decks. Stealing planeswalkers is very strong. It's also very good against creature-based decks. I have been so impressed with control magic effects as of late that I decided to play with four copies of two different control magic effects.



![Lighthouse Chronologist](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Lighthouse+Chronologist)

 

[Lighthouse Chronologist](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lighthouse+Chronologist) is a card I've been wanting to play with for a long time. I try to include one or two copies in mono-blue decks I make because I like to experiment with potentially strong cards.


Here's the list:








#### Mirran!

![](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Tectonic+Edge)


















 

I played a game on **Magic Online** to make sure the Mirran deck had what it takes.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/boab/boab114_vat.jpg)I won the roll and kept [Island](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island), [Island](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island), [Tectonic Edge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tectonic+Edge), [Everflowing Chalice](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Everflowing+Chalice), [Lux Cannon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lux+Cannon), [Spell Pierce](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spell+Pierce), [Trinket Mage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Trinket+Mage). I played my [Island](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island) and passed the turn. My opponent cast [Duress](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress) and I decided to use my [Spell Pierce](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spell+Pierce). I drew another [Island](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island), played it, cast [Everflowing Chalice](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Everflowing+Chalice) for one and passed the turn. My opponent played another [Swamp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swamp) and passed the turn. I drew [Volition Reins](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Volition+Reins), played my land, cast [Lux Cannon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lux+Cannon), and passed the turn. My opponent cast a [Sign in Blood](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sign+in+Blood), cast another [Duress](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress)—taking my [Volition Reins](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Volition+Reins)—and passed the turn. I charged my Cannon during the end step. I drew a [Mystifying Maze](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mystifying+Maze), played it, cast [Trinket Mage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Trinket+Mage)—grabbing [Voltaic Key](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Voltaic+Key). I cast it, and passed the turn. My opponent cast a [Gatekeeper of Malakir](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gatekeeper+of+Malakir), I sacrificed the [Trinket Mage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Trinket+Mage). He or she passed the turn and I charged the [Lux Cannon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lux+Cannon) twice. I drew a [Mind Control](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mind+Control) and played my land. I cast the [Mind Control](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mind+Control) on his or her [Gatekeeper of Malakir](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gatekeeper+of+Malakir), and passed the turn. My opponent cast a [Mimic Vat](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mimic+Vat) and passed the turn.


I destroyed the Vat with the [Lux Cannon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lux+Cannon) and charged it once on his or her end step. I drew a [Lighthouse Chronologist](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lighthouse+Chronologist), cast it and leveled it three times, then passed the turn. My opponent cast another kicked [Gatekeeper of Malakir](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gatekeeper+of+Malakir) and I sacrificed the first Gatekeeper. I charged the [Lux Cannon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lux+Cannon) twice during his or her end step. I drew another [Lux Cannon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lux+Cannon), leveled my [Lighthouse Chronologist](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lighthouse+Chronologist) four times, and passed the turn.


My opponent played his or her sixth land and cast [Grave Titan](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grave+Titan), then passed the turn. I exiled the [Grave Titan](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grave+Titan) and put a charge counter on the Cannon. The triggered ability on the [Lighthouse Chronologist](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lighthouse+Chronologist) then gave me an extra turn. I drew a [Mana Leak](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak). I cast the other Cannon, charged both Cannons up to two counters, and took my next turn. I drew another [Trinket Mage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Trinket+Mage), cast it—finding [Chimeric Mass](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chimeric+Mass), and passed the turn. My opponent tried to cast another [Grave Titan](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grave+Titan), but I had a [Mana Leak](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak) waiting. I charged one Cannon to three and the other to four before taking my extra turn. I drew an [Island](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island), played it, cast [Chimeric Mass](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chimeric+Mass), leaving open one mana to activate my Voltaic key, charged my Cannons, and passed the turn. I took my next turn and drew another [Lighthouse Chronologist](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lighthouse+Chronologist), I attacked with the Mass and passed the turn. My opponent conceded.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/boab/boab114_footer1.jpg)The Mirran deck seemed to do very well against this new and popular [Mimic Vat](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mimic+Vat) archetype. Remember that [Mimic Vat](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mimic+Vat) is Mirran aligned; you can always build your faction deck around that!


### Phyrexia


My screen name when I was fourteen years old was PhyrexianJake. Phyrexia has always had one of the best flavors of any **Magic** culture. This time it includes something very near and dear to my heart ... poison.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/boab/boab114_ichorclaw.jpg)I've seen a number of ways that people have been trying to approach the poison issue in Constructed. I'm quite surprised by the unbelievable lack of focus with most lists. The first thing I thought of when I saw infect was pump spells. It's a shame [Colossal Might](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Colossal+Might) rotated out of Standard because I would have had a spicy one. I wanted to play as many two-drop infect creatures as I could in a mono-green deck.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/boab/boab114_3Cards1.jpg)[Necropede](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Necropede), [Ichorclaw Myr](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ichorclaw+Myr), and [Blight Mamba](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blight+Mamba) were all obvious inclusions. This is the type of deck where you need to mulligan any hand that doesn't have a two-drop infect creature. That may seem risky, but this is a suicide infect deck, what's riskier than that?


This deck feels like a really fun ride. Its best draws are actually very scary, it puts a lot of decks in very awkward spots. It may not be great against decks that establish an early board presence, but oftentimes all you need is a single creature to get through unblocked.


There are a lot of really well costed pump spells in the current Standard. [Primal Bellow](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Primal+Bellow) is especially powerful, oftentimes winning games out of nowhere in a deck like this. [Vines of Vastwood](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vines+of+Vastwood) is a good anti-[Doom Blade](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Doom+Blade) measure that can be used to spike a game. [Giant Growth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Giant+Growth) and [Groundswell](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Groundswell) are startlingly efficient at ending games on the third or fourth turn. The list may seem very basic and straightforward, but I really wanted to showcase the strength of poison with pump and virtually nothing else.

This is more a combo deck than an aggressive one. You're hoping to sneak a creature through without being blocked so you can play a bunch of pump spells and steal the game. An opponent may think they're safe when they're at five poison and you have no board presence, but [Putrefax](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Putrefax) can come out of nowhere and wrap up the victory.

I played a game on **Magic Online** to make sure the deck functioned well enough.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/boab/boab114_jace.jpg)I lost the roll, took a mulligan down to six, and kept [Ichorclaw Myr](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ichorclaw+Myr), [Forest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest), [Forest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest), [Giant Growth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Giant+Growth), [Groundswell](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Groundswell), [Necropede](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Necropede). My opponent played a [Celestial Colonnade](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Celestial+Colonnade) and passed the turn. I drew a [Teetering Peaks](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Teetering+Peaks), played my [Forest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest), and passed the turn back. My opponent played a [Plains](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plains) and passed the turn. I cast an [Ichorclaw Myr](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ichorclaw+Myr) and my opponent let it resolve. My opponent cast a [Jace Beleren](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace+Beleren) and passed the turn back to me. I drew another [Forest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest), played [Teetering Peaks](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Teetering+Peaks) giving my [Ichorclaw Myr](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ichorclaw+Myr) +2/+0, cast [Giant Growth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Giant+Growth) on [Ichorclaw Myr](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ichorclaw+Myr) giving it +3/+3, and cast [Groundswell](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Groundswell) on it to finally make it a 10/8. I attacked, and the game was over.


Yes, that just happened. The deck won on the third turn after taking a Paris down to six. This shows an incredible amount of raw power, but also highlights the deck's random nature.


I played some more games and was struck by the decks ability to win games on the third turn. It happened a frightening portion of the time. Unfortunately, I lost a lot of games to mulligans and it doesn't seem like there's much you can do about that.


This style of play seems very appropriate for a sympathizer of Phyrexia. If you enjoyed decks like All-In Red then this is certainly a deck for you.


I hope all of you find time to go to your local [Game Day](http://www.wizards.com/magic/tcg/events.aspx?x=mtgcom/events/gameday-facts). Wizards will be posting the top deck lists of each faction on **magicthegathering.com** and your name could be there! I encourage all my readers to go look at [Gatherer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Default.aspx) right now and start working on their own creations for each faction. These types of exercises can really sharpen one's deck-building skills.


Happy Brewing.
