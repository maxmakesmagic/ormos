 Stybs has played Magic the world over, writing and drafting as part of the event coverage team and slinging Commander everywhere his decks will fit. 






And then there were two.


William Aitken and his Merfolk had been swimming past every undefeated opponent he faced. Packed with "lord" creatures such as Merfolk Reejerey and [Lord of Atlantis](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lord+of+Atlantis), and backed up by [Æther Vial](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=%C3%86ther+Vial) and counterspells, the ability of blue's tribe to attack well had rewarded Aitken all weekend.


Across from him sat Andrew Calderon, the pilot of the other remaining undefeated deck: [Scapeshift](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scapeshift). While the exact builds can vary, Calderon's method used removal and counterspells to sculpt the course of the game before reshaping the battlefield for victory.


The right to remain undefeated with just two rounds left wasn't just positioning for a Top 8 run: Ensuring no more than two losses could come also meant the winner of the match qualified for Pro Tour *Journey into Nyx*, thanks to the oversized nature of Grand Prix Richmond.


To the victor go the spoils.


In the first game, Aitken hit a slow start after Calderon countered [Æther Vial](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=%C3%86ther+Vial) and a pair of lords that followed. While a solitary [Lord of Atlantis](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lord+of+Atlantis) kept attacking him Calderon had time to set up and meter his removal accordingly, including using [Snapcaster Mage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snapcaster+Mage) for a well-timed [Lightning Bolt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt) on [Mutavault](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mutavault) to keep Aitken light on mana and creatures. Despite using [Remand](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Remand) and [Electrolyze](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Electrolyze) multiple times, none of the cards seen had been [Scapeshift](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scapeshift).

*Calderon's removal and counterspells kept his opponent off his plan.* 
It took Peer Through the Depths to get the job done.


"Alright. Show me the Mountains," Aitken said.


Calderon counted out four from his library, then played the fifth from his hand. The balance of the 20 damage needed had already come from a [Sakura-Tribe Elder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sakura-Tribe+Elder) attacking for several turns. Both players chatted as they shuffled for the next game.


"That [Æther Vial](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=%C3%86ther+Vial) I drew late was really awkward. I just didn't have it early enough to matter," Aitken said.


"I was really happy I countered that the first time," Calderon admitted, referring to his first play of the game.


"Yeah, the whole time I'm drawing I was just thinking I could really use a [Cavern of Souls](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cavern+of+Souls)," Aitken said. Multiple [Remand](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Remand)s and [Cryptic Command](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cryptic+Command)s prevented Aitken from applying pressure earlier.


Pressure wasn't available for Aitken in the second game either. Though he led off with an [Æther Vial](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=%C3%86ther+Vial), Calderon had an immediate [Ancient Grudge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ancient+Grudge) to answer it. [Thassa, God of the Sea](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thassa%2C+God+of+the+Sea) helped smooth Aitken draw steps, but he spent turn after turn not casting Merfolk. Calderon played [Obstinate Baloth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Obstinate+Baloth), which nudged Aitken to play out [Lord of Atlantis](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lord+of+Atlantis) and [Master of Waves](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Master+of+Waves). [Volcanic Fallout](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Volcanic+Fallout) cleared away most of the battlefield, and Calderon's [Snapcaster Mage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snapcaster+Mage) was ready to flash it back for Aitken's second [Master of Waves](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Master+of+Waves).

*Aitken's Merfolk floundered against Calderon's [Obstinate Baloth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Obstinate+Baloth).* 
When Calderon went for [Scapeshift](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scapeshift) on the next turn Aitken used [Spell Pierce](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spell+Pierce) and [Swan Song](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swan+Song) to stop it, but it left Calderon with 6 power of offense for Aitken's 4 life. Sacrificing both his [Mutavault](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mutavault)s saved Aitken a turn, but ensuring [Obstinate Baloth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Obstinate+Baloth) died required a second [Swan Song](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swan+Song) to stop Calderon's [Cryptic Command](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cryptic+Command).


Two birds hung in the air as Aitken untapped with just 2 life.


"Let's scry!" Aitken said as he looked at his card before placing it on the bottom of his library. He draw his turn's with a flourish, then grimaced. "Augh... man."


His handed extended to Calderon.


"You didn't get a lot of combat steps," Calderon said. Aitken just shook his head.


[![](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Swan+Song)](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swan+Song)
"[Obstinate Baloth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Obstinate+Baloth). I like that. Scapeshift's tough for me. It might have been a mistake keeping that hand," Aitken said.


"Yeah, it seemed really slow."


"Three [Swan Song](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swan+Song)s just seemed strong..." Aitken started


"...but with all the Birds I could just burn you out from there. I was pretty set to go with that slow start." Calderon finished.


With his 13-0 record to his name there's one question many of us wanted the answer to: Why [Scapeshift](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scapeshift)?


"The deck I was planning on before the new banned list was a Domain deck. I did well with it in other tournaments, but when they banned [Deathrite Shaman](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deathrite+Shaman) I tried it without it and it didn't work. The deck I played most after that was [Scapeshift](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scapeshift). I'm very comfortable with it."


**Did you prepare a lot for Richmond?**


"I almost didn't make it but it worked out at the last minute. Thanks to **Magic Online** I've played against almost every deck. I know what people are going to try and do. I know what I'm doing with my deck. You have your bad much ups and I guess I'm lucky I didn't face any of my worst match ups: Hexproof Auras is really bad for me."


**What next? Will you try to play out the next two rounds?**


"I remember when LSV went undefeated at an old Extended tournament so I'd like to see if I can at least match it. I'm running very well; no point in messing with success. Of course, if I lose the next round I'll draw in. That's just being realistic."
