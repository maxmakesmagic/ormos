Olivier Ruel vs Guillaume Wafo-Tapa
-----------------------------------


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gpkra07/wafo-tapa_ruel.jpg) *Pro points as a gift between friends: Guillaume Wafo-Tapa and Olivier Ruel.*
The story of this match is extremely short: Olivier wants to pick up as many pro points as possible to maybe make level 5, and Guillaume Wafo-Tapa just wants to be a level 6 pro and doesn't care about the Player of the Year race. So Guillaume concedes, easy as pie.


As for the match between Amiel Tenenbaum and Robert Jacko, that match is only available in podcast form. Due to a sudden shortage of supplementary coverage writers, we were unable to staff all four tables. Sorry. The podcast is worth listening to, though...
