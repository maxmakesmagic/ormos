Hello and welcome back to the Lab. Summer has finally sent its warm rays scattering across the nation, filling my mind with a certain joy. My physical presence, on the other hand, doesn't respond to the sun that well. Just another difference between us. Yes, us. We're torn on what to accomplish this summer. My body wants to go to a food festival; I want to go to a music festival. My body wants to get back into tip-top shape; I want to spend hours indoors with ***Magic: The Gathering** Commander* (previews for which are next week!) and ***Magic** 2012*. My body wants a girlfriend; I... okay, we don't disagree on everything.

![](https://media.wizards.com/images/magic/daily/ftl/ftl145_noelFighting.jpg)  
I'd say I have a pretty open mind. Flexible, open to various ways of accomplishing problems and tackling open-ended situations. And that's my slightly egotistical interlude into today's pseudo-theme. (Curse you, non-theme weeks!) There are a couple cards from *New Phyrexia* that fit into various decks and strategies that I've been waiting to examine under some bright laboratory lights. Some of these decks have been assembled (both fully and partly) by some of the other open minds out there on the Internet.

Oh, and there's an extra special morsel waiting at this column's end. Don't skip ahead, though. As a wise man once screeched, "If you don't eat yer meat, you can't have any pudding. How can you have any pudding if you don't eat your meat?"

Hmm... music and food references in one sentence! Maybe my two halves are finally at peace.

The Karnivorous Karnival
Or liberated. It's all the same to Karn, one of the most anticipated planeswalker characters ever. Way, way back in the day, Karn showed up on his first **Magic** card as [Karn, Silver Golem](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Karn%2C+Silver+Golem), boasting a curious combat ability and a talent for artifice. Apart from that card, he's been strewn throughout [numerous artworks](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/magazine/article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/arcana/658) and [flavor texts](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?action=advancedamp;flavor=+%5Bkarn%5D+!%5Bkarnst%5D) over the years. I was elated when Karn was first hinted at, and then completely revealed, as part of the modern creative plan.

![](https://media.wizards.com/images/magic/daily/ftl/ftl145_karn.jpg)  
[Karn Liberated](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Karn+Liberated) is a testament to the sheer power of the silver golem. Being colorless, Karn is the first planeswalker that can slide into every deck, and he packs a punch. Exiling any problem permanent is a great weapon to have for any deck. Those three dynamic, rules-shattering words in his ultimate, however, will be Karn's new legacy: *Restart the game.* And not only that... but you get some previously exiled permanent cards out on the battlefield like quasi-Leylines.

[![](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Karn+Liberated)](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Karn+Liberated)  
This is flat-out bonkers. I've been a fan of such strategies before, mimicking the effect with [Sway of the Stars](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sway+of+the+Stars) (or, to a lesser extent, [Decree of Annihilation](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Decree+of+Annihilation)) while a [Greater Gargadon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Greater+Gargadon) was moments from fading into reality. [Karn Liberated](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Karn+Liberated) is basically both cards at once, being both the game changer and the method to cheat something(s) onto the battlefield.

What cards would one want on the first turn of a game? Let's go with cards that just straight-up win the game. Use Karn's +4 ability on yourself twice, bumping him to the magic 14. Meanwhile, you've exiled [Serra Avatar](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Serra+Avatar) and [Mayael's Aria](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mayael%27s+Aria). When you wipe the slate clean with Karn, you'll get those permanents and promptly win the game on the first upkeep, since [Serra Avatar](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Serra+Avatar) will be a 20-power creature.

Another hilarious one was summed up in an email to me by DailyMTG editor Kelly Digges like so: "Exile [Barren Glory](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Barren+Glory) (and no other non-Aura permanent cards) to get Karn up to 14. Restart the game. Mulligan to zero (!). Win." So to recap, winning with [Barren Glory](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Barren+Glory) is actually the *second*-funniest thing about that combo. The first is obviously mulliganing to zero on purpose.

![](https://media.wizards.com/images/magic/daily/ftl/ftl145_mulliganZero.jpg)  
Running four copies of [Karn Liberated](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Karn+Liberated) in the first place allows for another neat trick: exile another copy of him from your hand! When you restart, you wind up starting with another [Karn Liberated](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Karn+Liberated), which is pretty gross. If you target your opponent with the second +4 ability (exiling a Karn from your hand with the first one), you could slowly exile your opponent's entire library, one card at a time. Or win with his or her permanents. Either way, it's just another trick in Karn's bag.

Here's a [Karn Liberated](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Karn+Liberated) deck that seeks to win via any of the routes outlined above, especially the [Barren Glory](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Barren+Glory) one. I added blue as a primary color to filter through the deck, discarding useless [Mayael's Aria](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mayael%27s+Aria)s and such with cards like [Compulsive Research](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Compulsive+Research) and [Sift](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sift) (preferably [the *Stronghold* one](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=5223)!). [Tezzeret's Gambit](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tezzeret%27s+Gambit) is another card drawer that can proliferate Karn, or the storage counter lands (always nice to ramp into Karn). Overall there should be enough instants to exile along with [Barren Glory](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Barren+Glory) (since you need another nonland permanent). And as another instant win: [Blightsteel Colossus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blightsteel+Colossus). It had to be done.

There are tons of other builds for a [Karn Liberated](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Karn+Liberated) deck, I'm very aware. But that's the beauty of open-ended cards (or **Magic** in general really): any deck can come together around a card in its own unique way.

In Orbit
Another card that viciously shook me when I scanned it into my brain was [Torpor Orb](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Torpor+Orb). Cards like this (and the also-recent [Tajuru Preserver](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tajuru+Preserver)) basically see an effect and say, "...Nah. Not happening." Unlike the Preserver, though, [Torpor Orb](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Torpor+Orb) has a lot of proactive deckbuilding in its little corner of infinity. (Have I mentioned yet that **Magic** is a game of infinity almost by definition? I'm trying to meet a weekly quota.)

![](https://media.wizards.com/images/magic/daily/ftl/ftl145_torpor.jpg)  
A kind reader named Alex Churchill sent in a fun deck skeleton for [Torpor Orb](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Torpor+Orb) that featured, well, incredibly huge creatures at insane discounts. Of course, these creatures usually carry heavy drawbacks, but not with the Orb around! Perhaps the most famed of these creatures is [Phyrexian Dreadnought](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phyrexian+Dreadnought). Yeah, a 12/12 trampler for ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20211201201921im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless1.gif) seems okay.



|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  |  |

Other cards grow from the same vine. [Lord of Tresserhorn](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lord+of+Tresserhorn) becomes a 10/4 regenerator for four. [Eater of Days](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eater+of+Days) becomes a 9/8 flying trampler for four. The entire [Hunted clan](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?action=advancedamp;name=+%5Bhunted%5Damp;set=%7C%5B%22Ravnica:%20City%20of%20Guilds%22%5D) loses its familial drawback (giving hope even to [Hunted Horror](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hunted+Horror), which becomes a 7/7 trampler for a mere two mana). And there are plenty of others.

![](https://media.wizards.com/images/magic/daily/ftl/ftl145_5Cards1.jpg)  
As Alex also mentioned, "A few things to find the Orb might be a good plan too—[Enlightened Tutor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Enlightened+Tutor), for example. And some [Stifle](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stifle) and [Trickbind](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Trickbind) would let you cast some of these silly things even if you don't draw an Orb. I've cast [Eater of Days](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eater+of+Days) + [Stifle](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stifle) before, and it is rather fun."



|  |  |

|  |  |

That is certainly great thinking. So in case your Orb gets [Shatter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shatter)ed, go for the Stifling back-up plan.

Bad Omen
[Omen Machine](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Omen+Machine) is an intriguing take on such casual wonkies as [Possessed Portal](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Possessed+Portal) (the Machine's first ability, at any rate) and [Gate to the Æther](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gate+to+the+%C3%86ther) (its second ability, more or less). I was initially baffled on how to use it, when reader Kurtis S. sent me a really interesting deck based around it. Unlike the last two decks today, this one happens to be in Standard (and despite this, is pretty cool. Okay, I kid). Kurtis's email began with some background info on the deck; apparently his friend dubbed it the worst rare in the set, and Kurtis sprang into action like any dedicated Johnny would. He followed up with the deck, then the description. I'll loyally mimic that sequence here.

> Favorite Game Winner: With [Liliana Vess](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Liliana+Vess) on the field cast [Omen Machine](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Omen+Machine). Use Liliana's -2 ability and put [Emrakul](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Emrakul) on top of your deck. Pass the turn, and when you draw next you get to CAST [Emrakul](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Emrakul). Since you cast [Emrakul](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Emrakul) you get a second turn afterwards. Just to be really cruel, use Liliana's -2 ability again to pull [World at War](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=World+at+War) to the top of your deck and pass the turn.

Nothing screams scary like dropping 4 creatures on turn 1. I prefer [Ornithopter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ornithopter) over [Memnite](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Memnite) for the aerial defense vs. [Squadron Hawk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Squadron+Hawk)s personally but I'll leave it at 2 and 2 for game 1.

> Earliest Trouble Maker: [Platinum Angel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Platinum+Angel) + Swords. [Platinum Angel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Platinum+Angel) has always held a spot close to my heart. Now I can cast it as early as turn 3 thanks to [Geosurge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Geosurge). Another card to help [Geosurge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Geosurge) into place sooner is [Priest of Urabrask](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Priest+of+Urabrask). To make it easier to grab the land you need for [Geosurge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Geosurge) you can tap 1 [Swamp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swamp), 1 [Mountain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mountain), and 1 [Leaden Myr](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leaden+Myr) to cast [Priest of Urabrask](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Priest+of+Urabrask). Then all you need is one more [Mountain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mountain) untapped to use the extra 3 mana granted from Urabrask to cast [Geosurge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Geosurge). [Geosurge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Geosurge) produces 7 red mana which is the perfect amount for the lovely turn 3 [Platinum Angel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Platinum+Angel)!

Love this delightful red/black concoction. Also... quick thought. Does [Geosurge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Geosurge) have more red symbols on it than any other card?

Extra Special Morsel
[![](https://media.wizards.com/images/magic/daily/ftl/ftl145_horde.jpg)](http://www.hordeofnotions.com/)That's three decks, so normally I'd go, but I'll quickly plug something before I'm on my way. You see, I'm apparently a **Magic**al celebrity of sorts. Now I get to do cool celebrity things, like guest on podcasts. Head over to [Horde of Notions](http://www.hordeofnotions.com/), a fun podcast on which I was [recently featured](http://www.mtgcast.com/?p=9922), if you wish to hear my boring voice drone on about **Magic** for a bit!
