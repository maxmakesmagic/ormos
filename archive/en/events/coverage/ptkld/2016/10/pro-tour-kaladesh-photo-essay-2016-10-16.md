There's far more to every Pro Tour than what you see on camera. Some stories make it into the text coverage, and others are shared on social media. Here are even more, captured through the sights of Pro Tour photographer Craig Gibson throughout the weekend of Pro Tour *Kaladesh*.

*The Pro Tour leads to some of the world's most exciting destinations...*

*…but every competitor travels for just one reason.*

*Hundreds turned out to battle with* Kaladesh…

*The game's greatest can rise into the Pro Tour Hall of Fame…*

Kaladesh *loomed large over the wide Standard field…*

*…and players were excited to share their inventions.*

*Some players found beauty and drafted a Masterpiece…*


 


*![](https://media.wizards.com/2016/events/ptkld/a_10-Draft2.jpg)*


*…while others were content to simply draft masterpieces.*

*The battles were fierce as players worked through the rounds…*

*…and the judges kept issues at bay.*

*Back stage and at home the audiences were rapt…*


 


*![](https://media.wizards.com/2016/events/ptkld/a_14-Success.jpg)*


*…and the crowd cheered for their rising friends…*

*…and in the end, the greatest inventor won it all.*
