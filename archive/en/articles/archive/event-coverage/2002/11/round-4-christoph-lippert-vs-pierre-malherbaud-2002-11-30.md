Christoph Lippert from Germany has multiple GP top 8 appearances although he's been a little quiet of late. Two time French national champion Pierre Malherbaud has a very solid record on the Pro Tour and won GP Naples earlier this year. He's playing Suicide Black while Lippert is running a crazy three-color deck.

Malherbaud won the die roll and elected to go first. His first turn [Duress](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress) revealed Lippert was playing an unorthodox deck as he was shown two [Duress](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress), [Whipcorder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Whipcorder), [Parallax Wave](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Parallax+Wave) and [Vindicate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vindicate). [Duress](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress) took the [Vindicate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vindicate) and was followed by an [Unmask](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Unmask) taking the [Whipcorder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Whipcorder). Lippert's return [Duress](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress) missed as did the second. Malherbaud's hand was empty by turn 3 as [Dauthi Slayer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dauthi+Slayer) was followed by [Carnophage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Carnophage) and [Skittering Skirge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skittering+Skirge). Lippert dropped a fat Negator to give him a chance of racing only for Malherbaud to rip a [Diabolic Edict](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Diabolic+Edict) off the top to deal with it.

The next turn was a little comical. Lippert cast [Brainstorm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brainstorm) and then dropped a sac land to shuffle the cards back into his library. As Lippert picked up his deck Malherbaud pointed out that the land in the graveyard was a [Skycloud Expanse](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skycloud+Expanse) and not a [Flooded Strand](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flooded+Strand). An understandable mistake as the cards look very similar.

The situation was resolved with a warning to the German as the order of the library had not been changed. The game was allowed to continue and stuck on one life Lippert began to mount a comeback as the [Parallax Wave](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Parallax+Wave) sucked Malherbaud's attack force out of the game while a Negator started hitting back.

The Wave ran out but by which point Malherbaud was also desperately low on life. Lippert kept finding creatures to back up the Negator. Malherbaud got his creatures back but could only scoop as the Negator could trample through for lethal damage.

Lippert 1-0 Malherbaud

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gprei02/a969.jpg)Malherbaud started strong game 2 with [Duress](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress) and [Unmask](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Unmask) plucking a [Vindicate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vindicate) and [Meddling Mage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Meddling+Mage) out of Lippert's hand. He followed it with a [Slay](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Slay)er and then a [Nantuko Shade](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nantuko+Shade) while Lippert summoned a Negator to try and keep up.

[Cabal Therapy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cabal+Therapy) missed on [Parallax Wave](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Parallax+Wave) but it did reveal an [Exalted Angel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Exalted+Angel) in Lippert's hand, forcing Malherbaud to sac the [Slay](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Slay)er and flashback the Therapy to get rid of it. The other cards were two land and a [Brainstorm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brainstorm).

The [Brainstorm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brainstorm) proved amazing for the German as suddenly the board changed from Negator vs. [Nantuko Shade](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nantuko+Shade) to [Ramosian Sergeant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ramosian+Sergeant), [Spectral Lynx](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spectral+Lynx) and Negator vs. [Nantuko Shade](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nantuko+Shade). With no cards in hand Malherbaud was in real trouble. He drew a [Dauthi Horror](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dauthi+Horror), which wasn't enough. Lippert summoned another [Ramosian Sergeant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ramosian+Sergeant) and the Frenchman conceded knowing Lippert could start pulling [Whipcorder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Whipcorder)s from his deck, nullifying his attack while the Negator attacked unopposed.

**Final Result:** Christoph Lippert beat Pierre Malherbaud 2-0
