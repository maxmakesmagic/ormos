Another week, another set of decklists! We jump right in today with the Pro Tour Qualifier-Honolulu season which has started getting hot and heavy. Bant Aggro has burst its way onto the scene after some solid performances last week, but if this installment's lists prove anything, its that the format is as diverse as ever. Martyr Proc, Affinity, Wizards, Zoo, Elves, all manner of decks can be found riddled throughout the Top 8s. And of course, if you haven't figured out where your upcoming PTQ is going to be held, check out [the official PTQ schedule](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/TCG/Events.aspx?x=mtgcom/protour/honolulu09-qualifiers).


Then of course we have a host of **Magic Online** premier event Top 8s. A special Standard Vanguard premier sneaks in to give us a look at that unique format. And we've got a ton of Standard decklists. What's that? Looking for a few lists with *Conflux* cards as well? Then why not find out what the best and brightest deckbuilders in the world have brought to Pro Tour-Kyoto? Just [visit the live web coverage](/en/events/coverage/nassif-greater-power) starting Thursday night in the U.S. Pro Tour-Kyoto will be going on all weekend long.


Of course, with all those decklists and great coverage coming to you from Japan, you've got plenty to do, so get crackin'!
