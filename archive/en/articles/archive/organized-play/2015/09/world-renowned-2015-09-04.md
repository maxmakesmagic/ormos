World Renowned

Last weekend was big. Very big. Eldrazi big. Not only were a slew of *Battle for Zendikar* cards revealed, but we also crowned the 2015 *Magic: The Gathering* World Champion. Additionally, we hosted Grand Prix in South America and Europe last weekend, and just a week before that, the first round of 2015 World *Magic* Cup Qualifiers took place.


Needless to say, August was a busy month. September's not slowing down any, either!


2015 World Championship Results
===============================


Last weekend, the 2015 *Magic: The Gathering* World Championship took place at PAX Prime here in Seattle, Washington. In attendance were 24 of the world's very best players, including 20 of the players from that weekend's Top 25 Rankings, and unsurprisingly there was a lot of great *Magic* to watch.


Some of that great *Magic* took place in the finals, where Seth Manfield squared off against Owen Turtenwald in an Abzan Control final match. Manfield, who had mirrored the incredible run that Shota Yasooka had in 2012, went into the finals at 13-1, where he was taken to five games by Turtenwald's tight play.


The fifth and final game of the tournament was a close one, with the tides turning after one series of draws found Manfield a timely [Hero's Downfall](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hero%27s+Downfall) to dispatch [Ugin, the Spirit Dragon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ugin%2C+the+Spirit+Dragon). A crash of [Siege Rhino](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Siege+Rhino)s earned Seth Manfield the handshake, the trophy, $50,000, and the title of World Champion.


Seth Manfield's win lets him follow in his father's footsteps shortly after becoming a dad himself. His father, Edward Manfield, was a world champion bridge player, having earned top honors in a number of events as well as a place in the American Contract Bridge League Hall of Fame in 2003. Now, Seth has earned his favorite card game's greatest title, as well as a story and legacy he can pass on to his family like his father had done for his children.

Grand Prix Prague brought out 1,464 players from all over Europe (and elsewhere!) to compete in a two day Standard tournament in the Czech Republic.

Meanwhile, 799 players converged in Santiago, Chile for two days of *Magic Origins* Limited. After the dust settled, only two players remained: hometown hero Rodrigo López and Tomoharu Saito, the visiting team. While Saito had made quite a run in the tournament to take the trophy out of Chile, López managed to dispatch him in two games in the finals, keeping Santiago's Grand Prix trophy within its borders.
