**Do you have a favourite niche archetype in *Theros* draft?**

Robert Smith, GP Seattle 2012 Champ — *“Mono-red with 14 land and 3-4 [Dragon Mantle](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragon+Mantle)s. Play as many [Bronze Sable](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bronze+Sable)s and [Satyr Rambler](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Satyr+Rambler)s as you have to.“*

Owen Turtenwald, Trophy Hunter — *“I don't have one, I just always force Blue-Black.”*

Phil Samms, Canadian Icon — *“Black-Blue Tempo. Just not hyper-aggressive.”*

Jamie Parke, Worlds 2008 Finalist — *“Black-Green. It has the most powerful cards, but you need to draft to survive the early game.”*

William Jensen, Hall of Famer —  *“Does blue-black count as "niche"? If not, then no.”*

Alexander Hayne, Miracle Man —  *“Blue-Red Scrye. [Flamespeaker Adept](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flamespeaker+Adept) is so powerful. [Aqueous Form](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aqueous+Form) is the card you really want, but you have access to a lot of Scry effects with [Omenspeaker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Omenspeaker), [Titan's Strength](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Titan%27s+Strength), [Rage of Purphoros](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rage+of+Purphoros) and so on.”*
