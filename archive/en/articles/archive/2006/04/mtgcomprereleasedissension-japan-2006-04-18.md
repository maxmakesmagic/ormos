* English language packs will be provided to players who cannot read Japanese.

### Tournament Format


* All *Dissension* prerelease tournaments will be run using standard DCI Limited Sealed Deck rules.
* The format for all side events run at *Dissension* prerelease tournaments will be single-elimination DCI Limited Booster Draft.
* Some locations may offer Two-headed Giant team events. Check with your local tournament organizer for details.

### Tournament Registration


* All *Dissension* prerelease tournaments are open. No pre-registration is required. Registration time varies from location to location; see below for details.
* Some events will be run using the flight system. Registration will be open continuously until capacity at each site is filled; a new prerelease tournament will begin once 32 players have signed up.
