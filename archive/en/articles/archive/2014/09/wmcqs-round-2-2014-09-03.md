September 3, 2014
 










Last weekend was a busy one for many. *Khans of Tarkir* previews kicked off Saturday evening thanks to the *Magic* party at PAX Prime in Seattle, Washington, where party attendees were not only greeted by a giant dragon skull at the Showbox, but inside a slew of preview cards awaited them…along with the big reveal of [*Onslaught* fetch lands](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&type=+[%22Land%22]&text=+[search]+[your]+[library]&set=|[%22Onslaught%22]) returning in the new set.


Of course, while PAX had plenty of buzz around the new set, many players all over the world were invested in a different part of *Magic*. Last weekend also featured the second round of 2014 World *Magic* Cup Qualifiers, where thousands of players across 72 countries battled for one of those coveted slots on their countries' World *Magic* Cup team.


Looking Back
============


Starting off with the United States, 295 players showed up to try and earn one of the two remaining slots on Team USA's World *Magic* Cup team. While Pro Tour heavy-hitters such as Platinum Pro Ben Stark and Gold Pro Christian Calcano worked hard throughout the day to try and earn the spot, it was not to be for them.


The Top 8, however, did feature a few recognizable names, including Grand Prix Louisville 2013 semifinalist Andrew Baeckstrom.

In fact, it was Baeckstrom who was able to emerge triumphant with Mono-Blue Devotion at the end of the weekend, overcoming Matt Hoey's White-Black Midrange in two games. The match was clinched with the overwhelmingly powerful [Domestication](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Domestication), robbing Hoey of his [Nightveil Specter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nightveil+Specter) and sealing the deal.


You can catch the full replay of the United States WMCQ over on the [GGsLive Twitch.TV page](http://www.twitch.tv/ggslive/b/563792514).


Meanwhile, in Montreal, Canada, 204 players arrived to see who would be joining 11th-ranked player Shaun McLaren and David Goldfarb on the Canadian World *Magic* Cup team.


One of the players competing in this event was 18th-ranked player Alexander Hayne, who needed to arrive at the event site from his Grand Prix trip/vacation from Sydney, Australia. Flight delays left him scrabbling to arrive to the event venue in time. While he had two byes going into the event thanks to his Platinum status, Hayne was unable to arrive until the fourth round, meaning he suffered a match loss in Round 3.


Naturally, he made the Top 8. Like a master. Hayne played in the Top 8 alongside other recognizable faces, including Grand Prix Montreal 2014 Semifinalist Daniel Fournier.

Ultimately, it was Fournier who locked up his spot in the World *Magic* Cup last weekend with the increasingly popular Black-Green Midrange deck. The archetype combines [Pack Rat](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pack+Rat) and the slew of good cards from Black Devotion and White-Black Midrange with the powerhouse [Nissa, Worldwaker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nissa%2C+Worldwaker) and some black-green gold cards like [Abrupt Decay](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Abrupt+Decay) and [Golgari Charm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Golgari+Charm).


Interested in the decklist? We will be bringing you Fournier's list along with the rest of Top 8 decks from Canada's WMCQ on Friday as part of the Decks of the Week.


Meanwhile, outside of North America…

Team Sweden just keeps getting better. Love Janse, 2010 World Championship semifinalist, will be joining Hall of Famer Olle Rade and [Pro Tour *Gatecrash*](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/eventcoverage/ptgtc13/welcome) finalist Joel Larsson on a World *Magic* Cup team that is simply oozing with talent. After a heartbreaking 33rd-place finish outside of the Day One cut last year, it looks like Team Sweden is gearing up for some redemption in this year's big showdown.


The Philippines, which beat the United States two weeks ago as the most attended WMCQ, did it again this week, leading all 72 countries with 362 players. Congratulations to the winner, Philip Christopher Rama!


Looking Forward
===============


This weekend, *Magic 2015* will get its last big premier play hurrah at Grand Prix Salt Lake City. [ChannelFireball](http://twitch.tv/channelfireball) will be bringing you live video coverage of all the action, while Wizards of the Coast coverage reporters Marc Calderaro and Adam Styborski will be bringing you all the biggest stories from the tournament floor.


Looking beyond this weekend:



* The third and final round of 2014 World *Magic* Cup Qualifiers will take place September 13–14. You can find all the information about the 2014 WMCQs [on the event information page](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/2014-world-magic-cup-qualifier-information-2014-06-06).
* Our next round of Grand Prix will take place October 4–5 in Orlando and Shanghai. That window for booking your travel before cost increases may have closed, so if you're planning to go, look into airfare and hotel bookings now!
* After that, it's Pro Tour *Khans of Tarkir* time in Honolulu, October 10–12!
* Grand Prix Los Angeles is the weekend after the Pro Tour, with the main event taking place on October 18–19. Now is a good time to book your travel for that event if you're planning to fly in. Be sure to look into hotel options in the area as well, and plan accordingly.

That's it for this week of short and sweet WMCQ updates. Check back next week where we'll look at some of the key stories that developed out of Salt Lake City!
