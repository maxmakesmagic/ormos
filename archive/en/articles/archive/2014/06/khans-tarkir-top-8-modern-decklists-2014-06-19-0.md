Look through the events below for Top 8 Modern decklists. You can test each decklist thanks to our [Sample Hand Generator](http://www.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/feature/294). Just click on the card fan in the upper right of each decklist and you can see what your opening hand could be, along with mulligans and the first three cards you'd draw.
