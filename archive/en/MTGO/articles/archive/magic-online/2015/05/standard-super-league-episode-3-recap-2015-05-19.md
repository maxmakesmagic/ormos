This week was all about Jeskai on Standard Super League. Midrangey Jeskai deck have been around ever since Pro Tour *Khans of Tarkir* in Honolulu and two of them met in the finals as Josh Utter-Leyton used his somewhat more aggressive take on the archetype to defeat Gerry Thompson in a very close, very exciting Game 3. By making his second final, however, it’s actually Gerry who moves into the overall lead in the standings.

There was once again a ton of diversity on Standard Super League last week. Depending on whether you count Josh and Gerry’s decks as the same or different, there were seven or eight distinct decks played, and the count of different decks played through three weeks is now all the way up to 19 or 20! Personally, I see that the decks have more than a dozen card differences, so I’m calling it 20 even if those two have similar templates.


With a bit of a return toward normalcy in Week 3, and with players now on guard to at least respect the possibility of control decks, will we see the super spicy brews come out again this week? Tune in Tuesday at 6:00 p.m. Pacific Time (UTC-7) on [twitch.tv/magic](http://www.twitch.tv/magic) and we’ll find out together! Check [MTGO.com](http://magic.wizards.com/en/game-info/products/magic-online) at the same time to see the [decklists](http://magic.wizards.com/en/MTGO/standard-super-league-decklists) that players will be using in the upcoming episode.
