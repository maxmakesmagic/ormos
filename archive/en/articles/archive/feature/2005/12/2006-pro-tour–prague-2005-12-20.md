Largely undamaged during World War II, Prague fascinates travelers with its stunning cityscape. The capital city of the Czech Republic is stretched across the Vltava River, with the Prague Castle overlooking four different districts. Museums, theatres and churches can be found all across this beautiful city rich in artistic, musical, and scientific history.


Pro Tour-Prague is a *Ravnica* Booster Draft format event with a last-chance qualifier run the day before the event starts. The main event will be the first time you'll be able to see *Ravnica-Guildpact-Dissension*  drafting in action at the Pro level. But you don't have to be a Pro to enjoy the Pro Tour -- there will be wall-to-wall **Magic**  to play in [Side Events](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=protour/prague06/sideevents) all weekend with amazing prizes, and [plenty of other extra activities](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=protour/prague06/extra) to take part in even if you're not qualified.
