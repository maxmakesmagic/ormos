Renewal Rewards
===============


Adventure isn't the only thing awaiting in *Dominaria United* (DMU)! Standard rotation will also be arriving on September 1, and while *Zendikar Rising*, *Kaldheim*, *Strixhaven: School of Mages*, and *Dungeons & Dragons: Adventures in the Forgotten Realms* will continue to be playable in Historic formats, it's time for a new Standard meta to rise.


To kick things off, in addition to the Renewal Gift players will receive when they login after September 1, we'll also be adding additional rewards to the *Dominaria United* Set Mastery—no mastery pass required!


The Important Stuff
-------------------


Users must have created a *MTG Arena* account and logged into their account on or before September 1 to be eligible for rewards.


Individual card rewards (ICRs) are from current Standard sets as of September 1, 2022.


Limit one (1) activation per *MTG Arena* account.


Renewal Gift
------------


* 10x Rare or higher ICRs

Renewal Mastery Rewards
-----------------------


* Level 3: 2x DMU uncommon ICRs
* Level 7: 1x DMU pack and 1x DMU mythic rare ICR
* Level 9: 2x DMU uncommon ICRs
* Level 11: 2x DMU uncommon ICRs
* Level 13: 1x DMU pack and 1x DMU mythic rare ICR
* Level 17: 2x DMU uncommon ICRs
* Level 21: 2x DMU uncommon ICRs
* Level 27: 1x DMU pack and 1x DMU mythic rare ICR
* Level 31: Standard 2022 basic sleeve

Again, in order to be eligible to receive renewal rewards, you must have created and logged into your account before the release of *Dominaria United*!


How many levels are there in *Dominaria United* Set Mastery?
============================================================


The *Dominaria United* Set Mastery goes up to level 80. All players receive rewards through level 66, while players with the Mastery Pass will receive rewards up to level 80—and beyond!
