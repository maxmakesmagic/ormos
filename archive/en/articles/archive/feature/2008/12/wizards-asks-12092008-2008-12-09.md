*What's the biggest adventure you've ever had on your way to play **Magic**?*

![Mike Turian](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/mtgcom/authorpics/authorpic_miketurian.jpg)**Mike Turian:** Aaron Forsythe, Andrew Johnson and I decided to drive up to Worlds 2001 in Toronto. We drove Andrew's SUV the night before the event. It should have been about a six-hour drive.

As we approached Buffalo, Andrew was pulled over for speeding. The experience shook him up, so he asked me to drive. 

After I had taken over and had been driving for an hour or so, we reached Canada around midnight. We started across the Peace Bridge when all of a sudden I felt the SUV jerk and twist. I didn't have any control at first. But then with all my strength I managed to pull the SUV off to the side of the bridge. The tire had blown! All of a sudden our Worlds tournament was in jeopardy.

Unfortunately, the full spare had a nail in it from the last time he had tire troubles. Then the police showed up. Apparently, you aren't allowed to stop on the Peace Bridge. We explained our situation and were told that there was a hotel a mile and a half down at the next exit. So we started to walk.

Once we got to the hotel, being a AAA member, I called and they said a tow truck would show up shortly. They explained that the tow truck would take the SUV to any repair shop nearby. At 2 a.m. in Canada, we needed to find a repair place that would open for us. So I hit the phone book. I called every number in it, until a groggy voice answered. I explained our situation and he agreed to help us out.

After coordinating the tow truck and repair shop, I was exhausted but exhilarated at the same time. We would make it to Worlds after all! The experience motivated me the entire weekend; I felt that after the tire explosion that **Magic** would all come together. It did, and I made Top 8 playing Mono-Red in Standard and Secret Force in Extended.
