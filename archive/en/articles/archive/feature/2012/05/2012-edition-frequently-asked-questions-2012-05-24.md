An FAQ is a collection of clarifications and rulings involving the cards in a new **Magic: The Gathering** set. It's intended to make playing with these new cards more fun by clearing up the common misconceptions and confusion inevitably caused by new mechanics and interactions. As future sets are released, updates to the **Magic** rules may cause some of this information to become outdated. If you can't find the answer you're looking for here, please contact us at [www.wizards.com/customerservice](http://www.wizards.com/customerservice).

This FAQ has two sections, each of which serves a different purpose.

The first section ("General Notes") explains the mechanics and concepts in this release, including an overview of the Planechase variant and notes on returning keyword mechanics. Players familiar with Planechase may not need to read this section in its entirety.

The second section ("Card-Specific Notes") contains answers to the most important, most common, and most confusing questions players might ask about the new cards in this set, including the new traditional **Magic** cards, the new plane cards, and the phenomenon cards. Items in the "Card-Specific Notes" section include full card text for your reference. Not all cards in the set are listed.

### GENERAL NOTES

The *Planechase* (2012 Edition) release consists of four different game packs: "Chaos Reigns," "Night of the Ninja," "Primordial Hunger," and "Savage Auras." Each game pack contains a 60-card traditional **Magic** deck, a 10-card planar deck consisting of 8 plane cards and 2 phenomenon cards, and a six-sided planar die.

The planar die is a specialized six-sided die. One side features the planeswalker symbol {PW}. One side features the chaos symbol {C}. The other four sides are blank.

The *Planechase* (2012 Edition) release contains a total of 32 different plane cards and 8 different phenomenon cards. In addition, a promotional plane card (Stairs to Infinity) will be distributed at events in local stores (while supplies last); this card is not found in any game pack. Go to [www.wizards.com/locator](http://www.wizards.com/locator) to find an event or store near you.

There are also 21 new traditional **Magic** cards found in the *Planechase* (2012 Edition) release. Each game pack has six new cards by name, although some new cards may appear more than once in the game pack. These cards are legal for play in the Vintage and Legacy formats. They aren't legal for play in the Standard, Modern, or Extended formats.

The other traditional cards in the *Planechase* decks are legal for play in any format that already allows those cards. That is, appearing in this product doesn't change a card's legality in any format.

For more information on **Magic** formats, please visit [www.wizards.com/MagicFormats](http://www.wizards.com/MagicFormats). For information about the format legality of a specific card, please visit [http://gatherer.wizards.com](http://http://gatherer.wizards.com), search for the card, then check the "Legality" tab.

**Planechase**

Planechase is a casual variant in which plane cards and new phenomenon cards add additional abilities and excitement to the game. A Planechase game is best as a Free-for-All multiplayer game with 3-6 people, although it can be enjoyed as a two-player game as well. You win the game when all of your opponents have been eliminated!

Plane cards and phenomenon cards are oversized **Magic** cards that feature the "Planechase" back (as opposed to the "Deckmaster" back). Each plane card represents a place in the **Magic** Multiverse, and each phenomenon card represents a hazard one may encounter when traveling between them.

You can play with your planar deck right out of the box. If you choose to customize your planar deck, you'll need to follow these three rules:

* Your planar deck must have at least 10 cards in it, including plane cards and phenomenon cards.
* No more than two cards in your planar deck can be phenomenon cards.
* No two cards in your planar deck can have the same name.

*Planechase* (2009 Edition) plane cards and older promotional planes are compatible with this new release.

**Setup**

Each player will need a traditional deck (made of normal **Magic** cards), as well as a planar deck (made of plane cards and phenomenon cards). Each player should shuffle his or her traditional deck (as usual), as well as his or her planar deck. The game also needs one planar die. If each player has a Planechase game pack, you're good to go!

After you randomly decide who will go first, each player draws a hand of seven cards like normal. Players may take mulligans. In a multiplayer game, the first time a player takes a mulligan, he or she draws a new hand of seven cards rather than six cards. Subsequent hands decrease by one card as normal.

Once everyone has kept an opening hand, the player who will go first turns the top card of his or her planar deck face up. If it's a phenomenon card, that player should put it on the bottom of his or her planar deck and try again. (It will have no effect because the first turn hasn't started yet.) Once a plane card is turned face up, that's the starting plane. Any abilities that trigger "when you planeswalk to" that plane won't trigger. Then the first turn begins.

**Using Your Planar Deck**

Planar decks start the game in the command zone, a game zone used for objects that affect the game but aren't permanents. They remain there throughout the game. Nothing can destroy or otherwise affect them. Keep your planar deck in its own face-down pile. Planar decks are shuffled at the beginning of the game, then you can't look at or rearrange the cards in them (unless an effect allows you to do so).

At any given time, the game has one face-up plane whose abilities affect the game or one face-up phenomenon that's being encountered. If an ability of the plane or phenomenon says "you" on it, "you" refers to the player who's taking the current turn. The player who's taking the current turn is considered to be the controller of that face-up card, regardless of who owns it.

The controller of a face-up plane or phenomenon card is the player designated as the "planar controller." Normally, the planar controller is whoever the active player is. However, if the current planar controller would leave the game, instead the next player in turn order that wouldn't leave the game becomes the planar controller, then the old planar controller leaves the game. The new planar controller retains that designation until he or she leaves the game or a different player becomes the active player, whichever comes first.

If the planar controller leaves the game while the ability of a phenomenon is on the stack, the new planar controller will gain control of that ability.

* Control of the face-up plane will rotate around the table. If an ability of a plane refers to "you," it's referring to whoever the plane's controller is at the time, not to the player that started the game with that plane card in his or her deck. Many abilities of plane cards affect all players, while many others affect only the planar controller, so read each ability carefully.

During your turn, any time you could cast a sorcery, you may roll the planar die. You can do this multiple times in the same turn. To roll the die, you must pay an amount of mana equal to the number of times you've already rolled the die this turn. So the first roll is free, the second roll costs {1}, the third roll costs {2}, and so on. Rolling the planar die doesn't use the stack. It just happens. However, any abilities that trigger due to the roll's results do use the stack.

Rolling the planar die could have three results:   


* If you roll a blank face, nothing happens.
* If you roll the chaos symbol ({C}), the face-up plane card's chaos ability triggers; it's the ability that starts "Whenever you roll {C}." Players may cast instants and activate abilities before it resolves.
* If you roll the Planeswalker symbol ({PW}), the face-up planar card's unwritten "planeswalking ability" triggers: a plane card is treated as if its text box included "When you roll {PW}, put this card on the bottom of its owner's planar deck face down, then move the top card of your planar deck off that planar deck and turn it face up." Players may cast instants and activate abilities before the planeswalking ability resolves. When it resolves, the face-up plane card is put on the bottom of its owner's planar deck, then you turn the top card of your planar deck face up. What happens next depends on whether the card is a plane or a phenomenon.

**Planeswalking to a Plane**

After the game has started, any time a player turns the top card of his or her planar deck face up, that player has "planeswalked." This could be as the result of a "planeswalking ability," the result of encountering a phenomenon, or because the owner of the face-up plane card left the game. Effects that last until a player planeswalks end. Abilities that trigger whenever a player planeswalks trigger.

A plane card may have any number of static, triggered, and/or activated abilities. As long as a plane card is face up in the command zone, its static abilities affect the game, its triggered abilities may trigger, and its activated abilities may be activated.

Some abilities of plane cards refer to the plane a player planeswalks to or from. A plane card that's turned face up is the plane the player planeswalks to. A plane card that's turned face down, or that left the game, is the plane the player planeswalks away from.

Plane cards have no mana cost. They can't be cast as spells. They're all colorless.

**Encountering a Phenomenon**

Each phenomenon card has a triggered ability that triggers when you "encounter" it, meaning when you move that card off the planar deck and turn it face up. When such an ability triggers, it's put on the stack, then players may respond by casting spells and activating abilities.

To resolve the triggered ability of a phenomenon card, the player who encountered that phenomenon performs its instructions and then planeswalks. To planeswalk, the player puts the face-up phenomenon card on the bottom of its owner's planar deck face down, then moves the top card of his or her planar deck off that planar deck and turns it face up. Planeswalking after encountering a phenomenon works the same way as planeswalking by rolling the planar die.

If a face-up phenomenon card's "When you encounter" ability is neither on the stack nor waiting to be put on the stack (because it's been countered or otherwise left the stack without resolving), the planar controller planeswalks. This is a state-based action.

Phenomenon cards have no mana cost. They can't be cast as spells. They're all colorless.

**Additional Triggered Abilities**

Any abilities that trigger "when you planeswalk to" or "when you planeswalk away from" a plane are both put on the stack after you finish planeswalking. Similarly, abilities that trigger when you encounter a phenomenon are put on the stack after you finish planeswalking. If there are multiple such abilities, the planar controller determines the order in which they are put onto the stack. For example, say the game is on Norn's Dominion and you (the planar controller) planeswalk to Reality Shaping. The abilities of both those cards will be put on the stack in an order of your choice after you finish planeswalking to Reality Shaping. If you resolve Reality Shaping's ability first, you will planeswalk to the next card in the planar deck. If that card is a phenomenon, its encounter ability will trigger and resolve before the ability of Norn's Dominion ability. If it's a plane card, the game will be on that plane when Norn's Dominion's ability resolves.

**Leaving the Game**

Unlike in a two-player game, a multiplayer game continues after a player leaves the game (because that player lost the game or conceded).

* When a player leaves the game, all objects owned by that player leave the game. If that includes the face-up plane or phenomenon card, the planar controller turns the top card of his or her planar deck face up immediately.
* If that player controlled any abilities or copies of spells that were waiting to resolve, they cease to exist. If there's a "planeswalking ability" from the previous plane card on the stack, that ability ceases to exist. (If there's a {C} ability from the previous plane card or an ability from a phenomenon card on the stack, that ability will resolve as normal.)
* If that player controlled any permanents owned by another player, the effects that gave control of them to the player who left end. If that doesn't give control of them to a different player (perhaps because they entered the battlefield under the control of the player who left), they're exiled.
* If the player who left was taking his or her turn, that turn continues to its completion even though that player is now gone.

**Optional Rule: Single Planar Deck**

As an alternative option, a Planechase game may be played with just a single communal planar deck.

* The number of cards in a single planar deck must be at least forty or at least ten times the number of players in the game, whichever is smaller. The planar deck can't contain more phenomenon cards than twice the number of players in the game. Each card in the planar deck must have a different English name.
* In a Planechase game using the single planar deck option, the planar controller is considered to be the owner of all the plane cards. That means ownership of the planes changes each turn just like control does. That also means that no plane cards will leave the game when a player leaves the game.
* If any rule or ability refers to a player's planar deck, the communal planar deck is used.

**Returning Keyword: Cascade**

Cascade is a keyword that sometimes allows you to cast a bonus spell. Cascade originally appeared in the *Alara Reborn* set.

>  Artifact Creature -- Human Rogue   
>  2/2   
>  Cascade (When you cast this spell, exile cards from the top of your library until you exile a nonland card that costs less. You may cast it without paying its mana cost. Put the exiled cards on the bottom in a random order.)

The official rules for cascade are as follows:


> 
> 702.83. Cascade
> 
> 
> 702.83a Cascade is a triggered ability that functions only while the spell with cascade is on the stack. "Cascade" means "When you cast this spell, exile cards from the top of your library until you exile a nonland card whose converted mana cost is less than this spell's converted mana cost. You may cast that card without paying its mana cost. Then put all cards exiled this way that weren't cast on the bottom of your library in a random order."
> 
> 
> 702.83b If a spell has multiple instances of cascade, each triggers separately.
> 
> 
> 

* Cascade triggers when the spell is cast, not when it resolves.
* Here's the timing for cascade:   
 1) You cast a spell with cascade.   
 2) The cascade ability triggers and goes on the stack on top of the original spell.   
 3) The cascade ability resolves. If you find an applicable card that you'd like to cast, you do so.   
 4) The spell you cast as a result of the cascade ability resolves.   
 5) The original spell resolves.
* Most of cascade is mandatory. You must exile cards from the top of your library, even if you know that you won't exile anything you want to cast. Whether or not to cast the last card you exile is optional.
* The spell you cast as a result of the cascade ability resolves before the original spell. If you cast a creature spell with cascade and then cast an Aura as the result of the cascade ability, you can't enchant that creature with it because the creature spell hasn't resolved yet.
* Cascade won't trigger if you copy a spell with cascade on the stack (due to Twincast, for example). That's because you didn't cast the copy.
* Countering the original spell doesn't counter the cascade ability.
* Since cascade is a triggered ability, anything that interacts with a triggered ability (such as Stifle) will interact with cascade.
* All players can see the cards you exile as the cascade ability resolves.
* If you exile a split card this way, check if at least one half of that split card has a converted mana cost that's less than the converted mana cost of the spell with cascade. If so, you can cast either half of that split card.
* If you cast a card this way, you cast it as part of the resolution of the cascade ability. Timing restrictions based on the card's type (such as creature or sorcery) are ignored. Other restrictions (such as "Cast [this card] only before attackers are declared") are not.
* A spell cast as part of the resolution of cascade is cast from exile, not from your library.
* If you cast a card "without paying its mana cost," you can't pay any alternative costs, such as evoke or the alternative cost provided by the morph ability. If it has {X} in its mana cost, X must be 0. However, you can pay optional additional costs, such as kicker, and you must still pay mandatory additional costs, such as the one on Fling.
* If you cast a card this way, you're casting it as a spell. It can be countered. If you cast another card with cascade this way, the new spell's cascade ability will trigger, and you'll repeat the process for the new spell.
* After you cast an applicable card, you randomly rearrange the other cards exiled this way and put them on the bottom of your library. Neither you nor any other player sees the order of those cards.
* If you don't want to cast the applicable card you exile with the cascade ability, you don't have to. Include it with the other cards exiled this way when you randomly rearrange them and put them on the bottom of your library. The same is true for an applicable card that you can't cast (because there are no legal targets, for example).
* If you cast a spell with cascade and there are no nonland cards in your library with a converted mana cost that's less than that spell's converted mana cost, you'll exile your entire library. Then you'll randomly rearrange those cards and put them back as your library. Although you're essentially shuffling those cards, you're not technically doing so; abilities that trigger whenever you shuffle your library won't trigger.

**Returning Keyword: Devour**

Devour is a keyword that allows predators to grow in size by preying upon other creatures. Devour originally appeared in the *Shards of Alara* block.


> ![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/tcg/products/pc2/93qxau201h_en.jpg)Thorn-Thrash Viashino

>  Creature -- Viashino Warrior   
>  2/2   
>  Devour 2 (As this enters the battlefield, you may sacrifice any number of creatures. This creature enters the battlefield with twice that many +1/+1 counters on it.)   
> ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20220123123600im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/green.gif): Thorn-Thrash Viashino gains trample until end of turn. 

The official rules for devour are as follows:


> 
> 702.80. Devour
> 
> 
> 702.80a Devour is a static ability. "Devour N" means "As this object enters the battlefield, you may sacrifice any number of creatures. This permanent enters the battlefield with N +1/+1 counters on it for each creature sacrificed this way."
> 
> 
> 702.80b Some objects have abilities that refer to the number of creatures the permanent devoured. "It devoured" means "sacrificed as a result of its devour ability as it entered the battlefield."
> 
> 
> 

* Devour appears only on creature cards.
* A creature with devour can devour other creatures no matter how it enters the battlefield.
* You may choose to not sacrifice any creatures.
* If you cast a creature with devour as a spell, you choose how many and which creatures to devour as part of the resolution of that spell. (It can't be countered at this point.) The same is true of a spell or ability that lets you put a creature with devour onto the battlefield.
* You may sacrifice only creatures that are already on the battlefield. If a creature with devour and another creature are entering the battlefield under your control at the same time, the creature with devour can't devour that other creature. A creature with devour also can't devour itself.
* If multiple creatures with devour are entering the battlefield under your control at the same time, you may use each one's devour ability. A creature you already control can be devoured by only one of them, however. (In other words, you can't sacrifice the same creature to satisfy multiple devour abilities.) All creatures devoured this way are sacrificed at the same time.

****Returning Keyword: Ninjutsu****

The deadly Ninja practice the art of ninjutsu, appearing as from thin air to land a devastating attack. Ninjutsu originally appeared in the *Betrayers of Kamigawa* set.

>  Whenever Ninja of the Deep Hours deals combat damage to a player, you may draw a card. 

The official rules for ninjutsu are as follows:

702.47. Ninjutsu

702.47a Ninjutsu is an activated ability that functions only while the card with ninjutsu is in a player's hand. "Ninjutsu [cost]" means "[Cost], Reveal this card from your hand, Return an unblocked attacking creature you control to its owner's hand: Put this card onto the battlefield from your hand tapped and attacking."

702.47b The card with ninjutsu remains revealed from the time the ability is announced until the ability leaves the stack.

702.47c A ninjutsu ability may be activated only while a creature on the battlefield is unblocked (see rule 509.1h). The creature with ninjutsu is put onto the battlefield unblocked. It will be attacking the same player or planeswalker as the creature that was returned to its owner's hand.

* The ninjutsu ability can be activated during the declare blockers, combat damage, or end of combat steps if you have an unblocked attacking creature.
* Activating the ninjutsu ability during the declare blockers step allows the Ninja to deal combat damage. Using ninjutsu during the combat damage or end of combat steps will mean the unblocked attacking creature is dealing combat damage.
* The Ninja will be attacking the same player or planeswalker the original attacking creature was attacking. This is a rule specific to ninjutsu; in other cases, the controller of a creature put onto the battlefield attacking chooses which player or planeswalker it attacks.
* Although the Ninja is attacking, it was never declared as an attacking creature (for purposes of abilities that trigger whenever a creature attacks, for example).
* The Ninja should be revealed while announcing the ability, but it doesn't leave your hand until the ability resolves.

**Returning Keyword: Totem Armor**

Totem armor is a keyword found on Auras that can save the permanents they're enchanting from being destroyed. Totem armor originally appeared in the \_Rise of the Eldrazi\_ set.


> ![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/tcg/products/pc2/p2qzc69rer_en.jpg)Indrik Umbra   
> ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20160830042801im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless4.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20220123123600im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/green.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227125855im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/white.gif)  
>  Enchantment -- Aura   
>  Enchant creature   
>  Enchanted creature gets +4/+4 and has first strike, and all creatures able to block it do so.   
>  Totem armor (If enchanted creature would be destroyed, instead remove all damage from it and destroy this Aura.)

The official rules for totem armor are as follows:

702.86. Totem armor

702.86a Totem armor is a static ability that appears on some Auras. "Totem armor" means "If enchanted permanent would be destroyed, instead remove all damage marked on it and destroy this Aura."

702.86b Multiple instances of totem armor on the same permanent are redundant.

* Totem armor's effect is mandatory. If the enchanted permanent would be destroyed, you must remove all damage from it and destroy the Aura that has totem armor instead.
* Totem armor's effect is applied no matter why the enchanted permanent would be destroyed: because it's been dealt lethal damage, or because it's being affected by an effect that says to "destroy" it (such as Doom Blade). In either case, all damage is removed from the permanent and the Aura is destroyed instead.
* Totem armor has no effect if the enchanted permanent is put into a graveyard for any other reason, such as if it's sacrificed, if it's legendary and another legendary permanent with the same name is on the battlefield, or if its toughness is 0 or less.
* If a permanent you control is enchanted with multiple Auras that have totem armor, and the enchanted permanent would be destroyed, one of those Auras is destroyed instead -- but only one of them. You choose which one because you control the enchanted permanent.
* If a creature enchanted with an Aura that has totem armor is indestructible, lethal damage and effects that try to destroy it simply have no effect. Totem armor won't do anything because it won't have to.
* If a creature enchanted with an Aura that has totem armor would be destroyed by multiple state-based actions at the same time (because it's been dealt lethal damage and been dealt damage by a source with deathtouch, for example), the totem armor's effect will replace all of them and save the creature.
* If a spell or ability (such as Planar Cleansing) would destroy both an Aura with totem armor and the permanent it's enchanting at the same time, totem armor's effect will save the enchanted permanent from being destroyed. Instead, the spell or ability will destroy the Aura in two different ways at the same time, but the result is the same as destroying it once.
* Totem armor's effect is not regeneration. Specifically, if totem armor's effect is applied, the enchanted permanent does not become tapped and is not removed from combat as a result. Effects that say the enchanted permanent can't be regenerated (as Vendetta does) won't prevent totem armor's effect from being applied.
* Say you control a permanent enchanted with an Aura that has totem armor, and the enchanted permanent has gained a regeneration shield. The next time it would be destroyed, you choose whether to apply the regeneration effect or the totem armor effect. The other effect is unused and remains, in case the permanent would be destroyed again.
* Say you control a permanent enchanted with an Aura that has totem armor, and that Aura has gained a regeneration shield. The next time the enchanted permanent would be destroyed, the Aura would be destroyed instead -- but it regenerates, so nothing is destroyed at all. Alternately, if that Aura somehow becomes indestructible, the enchanted permanent is effectively indestructible as well.
* If a spell or ability says that it would "destroy" a permanent enchanted with an Aura that has totem armor, that spell or ability causes the Aura to be destroyed instead. (This matters for cards such as Karmic Justice.) Totem armor doesn't destroy the Aura; rather, it changes the effects of the spell or ability that would destroy the permanent the Aura is enchanting. On the other hand, if a spell or ability deals lethal damage to a creature enchanted with an Aura that has totem armor, the game rules regarding lethal damage cause the Aura to be destroyed, not that spell or ability.

### CARD-SPECIFIC NOTES

**Phenomenon Cards**


> ![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/tcg/products/pc2/jkg9ayc8q1_en.jpg)  
> Chaotic AEther   
>  Phenomenon   
>  When you encounter Chaotic AEther, each blank roll of the planar die is a {C} roll until a player planeswalks away from a plane. (Then planeswalk away from this phenomenon.)
> 
> 
> 

* While Chaotic AEther's effect applies, rolling any blank face of the planar die will cause chaos abilities to trigger.
* Planeswalking away from a phenomenon (as you do when resolving Chaotic AEther's ability) doesn't cause Chaotic AEther's effect to expire.


> ![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/tcg/products/pc2/x84bcb2w83_en.jpg)  
> Interplanar Tunnel   
>  Phenomenon   
>  When you encounter Interplanar Tunnel, reveal cards from the top of your planar deck until you reveal five plane cards. Put a plane card from among them on top of your planar deck, then put the rest of the revealed cards on the bottom in a random order. (Then planeswalk away from this phenomenon.)
> 
> 
> 

* The plane card you put on top of your planar deck is the one you'll planeswalk to after planeswalking away from Interplanar Tunnel.


> ![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/tcg/products/pc2/j80y286cwa_en.jpg)  
> Morphic Tide   
>  Phenomenon   
>  When you encounter Morphic Tide, each player shuffles all permanents he or she owns into his or her library, then reveals that many cards from the top of his or her library. Each player puts all artifact, creature, land, and planeswalker cards revealed this way onto the battlefield, then does the same for enchantment cards, then puts all cards revealed this way that weren't put onto the battlefield on the bottom of his or her library in any order. (Then planeswalk away from this phenomenon.)
> 
> 
> 

* This ability is very similar to that of Warp World, but note that planeswalkers are put onto the battlefield.
* Taking it slowly, here's what happens when Morphic Tide's ability resolves: 1) Each player counts the number of permanents he or she owns.   
 2) Each player shuffles those permanents into his or her library.   
 3) Each player reveals cards from the top of his or her library equal to the number that player counted.   
 4) Each player puts all artifact, creature, land, and planeswalker cards revealed this way onto the battlefield. All of these cards enter the battlefield at the same time.   
 5) Each player puts all enchantment cards revealed this way onto the battlefield. An Aura put onto the battlefield this way can enchant an artifact, creature, land, or planeswalker that was already put onto the battlefield, but can't enchant an enchantment that's being put onto the battlefield at the same time as it. If multiple players have Auras to put onto the battlefield, the player whose turn it is announces what his or her Auras will enchant, then each other player in turn order does the same, then all enchantments (both Auras and non-Auras) enter the battlefield at the same time.   
 6) Each player puts all of his or her other revealed cards (instants, sorceries, and Auras that can't enchant anything) on the bottom of his or her library in any order.
* Cards such as Sakashima's Student that can enter the battlefield as a copy of another permanent won't be able to enter the battlefield as a copy of a permanent that's entering the battlefield at the same time.
* After all permanents are put onto the battlefield and you planeswalk away from Morphic Tide, any abilities that triggered from those permanents entering the battlefield, from the previous generation of permanents leaving the battlefield, and from the new plane or phenomenon will be put onto the stack. You'll put all of your triggered abilities on the stack in any order, then each other player in turn order will do the same. (The last ability put on the stack will be the first one that resolves.)
* The permanents will enter the battlefield while Morphic Tide is face up. This means the game won't be on any plane when determining if any abilities trigger because those permanents entered the battlefield, for example. However, you'll planeswalk away from Morphic Tide before any such abilities are put on the stack. After you turn the next card of the planar deck face up, any abilities that triggered during the resolution of Morphic Tide (including any abilities that triggered because you encountered another phenomenon or planeswalked to the next plane) will be put on the stack. The planar controller will put his or her abilities on the stack in any order, followed by each other player in turn order. The last ability put on the stack will be the first one to resolve.
* Token permanents a player owns will count toward the number of cards that player reveals. They'll be shuffled into that player's library and subsequently cease to exist. A token's owner is the player under whose control it first entered the battlefield.


> ![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/tcg/products/pc2/aye2m5mvjh_en.jpg)  
> Reality Shaping   
>  Phenomenon   
>  When you encounter Reality Shaping, starting with you, each player may put a permanent card from his or her hand onto the battlefield. (Then planeswalk away from this phenomenon.)
> 
> 
> 

* First, you may put a permanent card onto the battlefield, then each other player in turn order may do the same. Cards such as Sakashima's Student that can enter the battlefield as a copy of another creature could copy a creature put onto the battlefield earlier in the resolution of the ability.
* Each player will know what permanent cards were put onto the battlefield earlier in the ability's resolution.
* This process is not repeated. Go around the table only once.
* After all permanents are put onto the battlefield and you planeswalk away from Reality Shaping, any abilities that triggered from those permanents entering the battlefield will be put onto the stack. You'll put all of your triggered abilities on the stack in any order, then each other player in turn order will do the same. (The last ability put on the stack will be the first one that resolves.)


> ![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/tcg/products/pc2/37pm7bjwg4_en.jpg)  
> Spatial Merging   
>  Phenomenon   
>  When you encounter Spatial Merging, reveal cards from the top of your planar deck until you reveal two plane cards. Simultaneously planeswalk to both of them. Put all other cards revealed this way on the bottom of your planar deck in any order.
> 
> 
> 

* Until a player planeswalks, the game will exist on both planes. The abilities of both plane cards can affect the game.
* If a player rolls {C}, both chaos abilities will trigger. The player may put those abilities on the stack in any order.
* The next time a player planeswalks, he or she planeswalks away from both planes. Their owner puts them on the bottom of his or her planar deck in an order of his or her choice. This order isn't revealed to other players.


> ![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/tcg/products/pc2/iq2f02fpgn_en.jpg)  
> Time Distortion   
>  Phenomenon   
>  When you encounter Time Distortion, reverse the game's turn order. (For example, if play had proceeded clockwise around the table, it now goes counterclockwise. Then planeswalk away from this phenomenon.)
> 
> 
> 

* This effect reverses the turn order established at the beginning of the game. While the order is reversed, anything that cares about this order (such as determining in what order choices are made) will use the new reversed order.
* If the game's turn order is reversed again, it will return to the default order used at the beginning of the game.

**Plane Cards**


> ![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/tcg/products/pc2/kpyyk46oku_en.jpg)  
> Akoum   
>  Plane -- Zendikar   
>  Players may cast enchantment cards as though they had flash.   
>  Whenever you roll {C}, destroy target creature that isn't enchanted.
> 
> 
> 

* A creature that's enchanted can't be chosen as the target of the chaos ability.
* If a creature that isn't enchanted is targeted by the chaos ability, but that creature is enchanted when that ability tries to resolve, the ability will be countered for having an illegal target.


> ![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/tcg/products/pc2/54lws2gj6o_en.jpg)  
> Aretopolis   
>  Plane -- Kephalai   
>  When you planeswalk to Aretopolis or at the beginning of your upkeep, put a scroll counter on Aretopolis, then you gain life equal to the number of scroll counters on it.   
>  When Aretopolis has ten or more scroll counters on it, planeswalk.   
>  Whenever you roll {C}, put a scroll counter on Aretopolis, then draw cards equal to the number of scroll counters on it.
> 
> 
> 

* For both abilities that count the number of scroll counters on Aretopolis, count all scroll counters on it, not just ones you put there.


> ![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/tcg/products/pc2/896l8oejua_en.jpg)  
> Astral Arena   
>  Plane -- Kolbahan   
>  No more than one creature can attack each combat.   
>  No more than one creature can block each combat.   
>  Whenever you roll {C}, Astral Arena deals 2 damage to each creature.
> 
> 
> 

* Astral Arena's abilities stop more than one creature from being declared as an attacker or as a blocker each combat. However, it doesn't affect creatures that are put onto the battlefield attacking or blocking.
* If a turn has multiple combat phases, either a different creature or the same one can attack or block in each of them.


> ![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/tcg/products/pc2/o4qb9nc5u5_en.jpg)  
> Bloodhill Bastion   
>  Plane -- Equilor   
>  Whenever a creature enters the battlefield, it gains double strike and haste until end of turn.   
>  Whenever you roll {C}, exile target nontoken creature you control, then return it to the battlefield under your control.
> 
> 
> 

* If a creature you've gained control of temporarily (because of Act of Treason, for example) is exiled and returns to the battlefield under your control, you will control that creature indefinitely.


> ![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/tcg/products/pc2/jaau04l4cz_en.jpg)  
> Edge of Malacol   
>  Plane -- Belenon   
>  If a creature you control would untap during your untap step, put two +1/+1 counters on it instead.   
>  Whenever you roll {C}, untap each creature you control.
> 
> 
> 

* While Edge of Malacol is face up, the normal turn-based action of untapping your creatures is replaced. Those creatures won't untap. Other tapped permanents you control will untap as normal.
* Other spells and abilities can untap creatures as normal. In that case, they'll just untap. You won't put any +1/+1 counters on them.
* If you untap a creature you control during another player's untap step (perhaps due to Seedborn Muse's ability), that creature will untap normally. You won't put any +1/+1 counters on it.


> ![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/tcg/products/pc2/4jynnjp4xz_en.jpg)  
> Furnace Layer   
>  Plane -- New Phyrexia   
>  When you planeswalk to Furnace Layer or at the beginning of your upkeep, select target player at random. That player discards a card. If that player discards a land card this way, he or she loses 3 life.   
>  Whenever you roll {C}, you may destroy target nonland permanent.
> 
> 
> 

* You can be selected as the target of the first ability, not just your opponents.
* If the target player has no cards in his or her hand when the ability resolves, nothing happens. That player won't lose any life.


> ![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/tcg/products/pc2/8ylydlg0yz_en.jpg)  
> Gavony   
>  Plane -- Innistrad   
>  All creatures have vigilance.   
>  Whenever you roll {C}, creatures you control are indestructible this turn.
> 
> 
> 

* The chaos ability doesn't lock in what it applies to when it resolves. Creatures that you gain control of later in the turn will be indestructible.
* If another player gains control of one of your creatures after the chaos ability resolves, that creature will no longer be indestructible. If it had lethal damage marked on it, it'll be destroyed the next time state-based actions are performed.


> ![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/tcg/products/pc2/1hptx2gw1c_en.jpg)  
> Glen Elendra   
>  Plane -- Lorwyn   
>  At end of combat, you may exchange control of target creature you control that dealt combat damage to a player this combat and target creature that player controls.   
>  Whenever you roll {C}, gain control of target creature you own.
> 
> 
> 

* If either target is no longer on the battlefield or is otherwise an illegal target when the chaos ability resolves, the exchange won't happen. No creatures will change controllers. If both targets are illegal, the ability will be countered.


> ![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/tcg/products/pc2/d82cvyphai_en.jpg)  
> Grand Ossuary   
>  Plane -- Ravnica   
>  Whenever a creature dies, its controller distributes a number of +1/+1 counters equal to its power among any number of target creatures he or she controls.   
>  Whenever you roll {C}, each player exiles all creatures he or she controls and puts X 1/1 green Saproling creature tokens onto the battlefield, where X is the total power of the creatures he or she exiled this way. Then planeswalk.
> 
> 
> 

* You choose the number of target creatures and declare how you are distributing the counters as you put the first ability on the stack. Each target must receive at least one +1/+1 counter.
* Any target that is illegal when the first ability resolves won't get any +1/+1 counters. Those counters are essentially lost; you won't get to put them on another creature.
* For the chaos ability, the total power of the creatures a player exiled is the total power of those creatures as they last existed on the battlefield, including any bonuses from +1/+1 counters, Auras, Equipment, and other applicable effects.


> ![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/tcg/products/pc2/1klu7o8una_en.jpg)  
> Grove of the Dreampods   
>  Plane -- Fabacin   
>  When you planeswalk to Grove of the Dreampods or at the beginning of your upkeep, reveal cards from the top of your library until you reveal a creature card. Put that card onto the battlefield and the rest on the bottom of your library in a random order.   
>  Whenever you roll {C}, return target creature card from your graveyard to the battlefield.
> 
> 
> 

* Both abilities are mandatory. You must put the creature card onto the battlefield, even if you don't want to.
* If you don't reveal any creature cards from your library, you'll put the cards from your library on the bottom of your library in a random order. Essentially, this will shuffle your library, although you are not shuffling it for purposes of effects that care about a player shuffling a library.


> ![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/tcg/products/pc2/3ns1mv62gs_en.jpg)  
> Hedron Fields of Agadeem   
>  Plane -- Zendikar   
>  Creatures with power 7 or greater can't attack or block.   
>  Whenever you roll {C}, put a 7/7 colorless Eldrazi creature token with annihilator 1 onto the battlefield. (Whenever it attacks, defending player sacrifices a permanent.)
> 
> 
> 

* A creature's power is checked when attackers or blockers are declared. Increasing the power of an attacking or blocking creature to 7 or greater won't remove that creature from combat.


> ![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/tcg/products/pc2/k1ezql7m4n_en.jpg)  
> Jund   
>  Plane -- Alara   
>  Whenever a player casts a black, red, or green creature spell, it gains devour 5. (As the creature enters the battlefield, its controller may sacrifice any number of creatures. The creature enters the battlefield with five times that many +1/+1 counters on it.)   
>  Whenever you roll {C}, put two 1/1 red Goblin creature tokens onto the battlefield.
> 
> 
> 

* Casting a multicolor spell will cause the first ability to trigger as long as that spell is black, red, or green. It can be other colors as well.
* If the creature spell already has devour, you may sacrifice creatures using either ability. Each creature you sacrifice counts for only one devour ability. Under most circumstances, you'll pick the devour ability that gives the greatest number of +1/+1 counters.


> ![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/tcg/products/pc2/98czx7j61z_en.jpg)  
> Kessig   
>  Plane -- Innistrad   
>  Prevent all combat damage that would be dealt by non-Werewolf creatures.   
>  Whenever you roll {C}, each creature you control gets +2/+2, gains trample, and becomes a Werewolf in addition to its other types until end of turn.
> 
> 
> 

* A "non-Werewolf creature" is a creature that doesn't have the Werewolf creature type. A creature with additional types, such as a Human Werewolf, is not a non-Werewolf creature.
* Creatures that you gain control of after the chaos ability resolves won't get any of that ability's bonuses.


> ![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/tcg/products/pc2/gcszz5kdkr_en.jpg)  
> Kharasha Foothills   
>  Plane -- Mongseng   
>  Whenever a creature you control attacks a player, for each other opponent, you may put a token that's a copy of that creature onto the battlefield tapped and attacking that opponent. Exile those tokens at the beginning of the next end step.   
>  Whenever you roll {C}, you may sacrifice any number of creatures. If you do, Kharasha Foothills deals that much damage to target creature.
> 
> 
> 

* The first ability doesn't trigger when a creature attacks a planeswalker, and the token copies can't be put onto the battlefield attacking a planeswalker.
* As each token is created, it checks the printed values of the creature it's copying, as well as any copy effects that have been applied to it.
* The copiable values of each token's characteristics are the same as the copiable values of the characteristics of the creature it's copying.
* You choose the target of the chaos ability as you put that ability on the stack. You don't sacrifice any creatures until that ability resolves.


> ![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/tcg/products/pc2/thcuk2hbiw_en.jpg)  
> Kilnspire District   
>  Plane -- Ravnica   
>  When you planeswalk to Kilnspire District or at the beginning of your precombat main phase, put a charge counter on Kilnspire District, then add {R} to your mana pool for each charge counter on it.   
>  Whenever you roll {C}, you may pay {X}. If you do, Kilnspire District deals X damage to target creature or player.
> 
> 
> 

* When you count the number of charge counters on Kilnspire District, count all charge counters on it, not just ones you put there.
* You choose the target of the chaos ability as you put that ability on the stack. When the ability resolves, you choose a value for X and decide whether to pay {X}. If you do decide to pay {X}, it's too late for any player to respond since the ability is already in the midst of resolving.


> ![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/tcg/products/pc2/v1twzuldqa_en.jpg)  
> Lair of the Ashen Idol   
>  Plane -- Azgol   
>  At the beginning of your upkeep, sacrifice a creature. If you can't, planeswalk.   
>  Whenever you roll {C}, any number of target players each put a 2/2 black Zombie creature token onto the battlefield.
> 
> 
> 

* If you control a creature when the first ability resolves, you must sacrifice it.
* You can choose to target zero players with the chaos ability.


> ![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/tcg/products/pc2/1ef1gmo0od_en.jpg)  
> Mount Keralia   
>  Plane -- Regatha   
>  At the beginning of your end step, put a pressure counter on Mount Keralia.   
>  When you planeswalk away from Mount Keralia, it deals damage equal to the number of pressure counters on it to each creature and each planeswalker.   
>  Whenever you roll {C}, prevent all damage that planes named Mount Keralia would deal this game to permanents you control.
> 
> 
> 

* If you roll {C}, Mount Keralia's damage-prevention effect will last for the rest of the game. It will apply to damage dealt by any plane named Mount Keralia, regardless of who owns that plane.


> ![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/tcg/products/pc2/um4917wswq_en.jpg)  
> Nephalia   
>  Plane -- Innistrad   
>  At the beginning of your end step, put the top seven cards of your library into your graveyard. Then return a card at random from your graveyard to your hand.   
>  Whenever you roll {C}, return target card from your graveyard to your hand.
> 
> 
> 

* Nephalia's first ability doesn't target any card, and players don't get priority to cast spells or activate abilities in between putting cards into your graveyard and choosing a card to return.


> ![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/tcg/products/pc2/74ldmujlak_en.jpg)  
> Norn's Dominion   
>  Plane -- New Phyrexia   
>  When you planeswalk away from Norn's Dominion, destroy each nonland permanent without a fate counter on it, then remove all fate counters from all permanents.   
>  Whenever you roll {C}, you may put a fate counter on target permanent.
> 
> 
> 

* Fate counters put on permanents in other ways (such as with Oblivion Stone) will cause those permanents to not be destroyed and will be removed when the chaos ability resolves.


> ![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/tcg/products/pc2/n30djv44kv_en.jpg)  
> Onakke Catacomb   
>  Plane -- Shandalar   
>  All creatures are black and have deathtouch.   
>  Whenever you roll {C}, creatures you control get +1/+0 and gain first strike until end of turn.
> 
> 
> 

* Creatures will be only black, not any other color. Creature cards in other zones are not affected.
* Creatures that you gain control of after the chaos ability resolves won't get any of that ability's bonuses.


> ![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/tcg/products/pc2/pkkkbzxy4g_en.jpg)  
> Prahv   
>  Plane -- Ravnica   
>  If you cast a spell this turn, you can't attack with creatures.   
>  If you attacked with creatures this turn, you can't cast spells.   
>  Whenever you roll {C}, you gain life equal to the number of cards in your hand.
> 
> 
> 

* Prahv only cares about the turn-based action of declaring attackers. If an effect allows you to put a creature onto the battlefield attacking, you can cast spells later that turn.


> ![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/tcg/products/pc2/wh9hqj2ilg_en.jpg)  
> Quicksilver Sea   
>  Plane -- Mirrodin   
>  When you planeswalk to Quicksilver Sea or at the beginning of your upkeep, scry 4. (To scry 4, look at the top four cards of your library, then put any number of them on the bottom of your library and the rest on top in any order.)   
>  Whenever you roll {C}, reveal the top card of your library. You may play it without paying its mana cost.
> 
> 
> 

* You play the card (meaning it play it if it's a land card or cast it if it's a nonland card) as part of the resolution of the chaos ability. Timing restrictions based on the card's type are ignored. Other restrictions, such as "Cast [this card] only during combat," are not.
* If you reveal a land card when resolving the chaos ability, you may play it only if you haven't played a land yet that turn.
* If you cast a card without paying its mana cost, you can't pay any alternative costs, such as evoke or the alternative cost provided by the morph ability. If it has {X} in its mana cost, X must be 0. However, you can pay optional additional costs, such as kicker, and you must still pay mandatory additional costs, such as the one on Fling.

> Selesnya Loft Gardens   
>  Plane -- Ravnica   
>  If an effect would put one or more tokens onto the battlefield, it puts twice that many of those tokens onto the battlefield instead.   
>  If an effect would place one or more counters on a permanent, it places twice that many of those counters on that permanent instead.   
>  Whenever you roll {C}, until end of turn, whenever you tap a land for mana, add one mana to your mana pool of any type that land produced.
> 
> 
> 

* Effects that place a counter on a permanent include that permanent entering the battlefield. For example, a creature that normally enters the battlefield with one or more +1/+1 counters will enter with twice that many +1/+1 counters on it. A planeswalker will enter the battlefield with twice its starting loyalty counters.
* Adding loyalty counters to a planeswalker in order to activate a loyalty ability isn't an effect, so those counters are not doubled.
* Any -1/-1 counters that are placed on a creature because of wither or infect are also not doubled.
* The chaos ability is cumulative. For example, if you roll {C} twice in a turn, tapping a land for mana will cause two mana abilities to trigger.

> Stensia   
>  Plane -- Innistrad   
>  Whenever a creature deals damage to one or more players for the first time in a turn, put a +1/+1 counter on it.   
>  Whenever you roll {C}, each creature you control gains "{T}: This creature deals 1 damage to target player" until end of turn.
> 
> 
> 

* Each creature can have only one +1/+1 counter put on it this way per turn.
* Unlike the Vampires in the \_Innistrad\_ block, Stensia's ability triggers whenever a creature deals any damage, not just combat damage.


> ![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/tcg/products/pc2/uqbfnpsyvy_en.jpg)  
> Talon Gates   
>  Plane -- Dominaria   
>  Any time you could cast a sorcery, you may exile a nonland card from your hand with X time counters on it, where X is its converted mana cost. If the exiled card doesn't have suspend, it gains suspend. (At the beginning of its owner's upkeep, he or she removes a time counter. When the last is removed, the player casts it without paying its mana cost. If it's a creature, it has haste.)   
>  Whenever you roll {C}, remove two time counters from each suspended card you own.
> 
> 
> 

* Exiling a nonland card from your hand this way is a special action. It doesn't use the stack and doesn't count as casting a spell or activating an ability. Players can't respond to this action, although they can respond when you cast the spell after the last time counter is removed.
* The first ability may be used any number of times.
* Even after the game leaves Talon Gates, each of the suspended cards will continue to have suspend; the owners of those cards will continue to remove a time counter from each during their upkeeps.
* The official rules for suspend are as follows:



> 702.60. Suspend
>

> 702.60a Suspend is a keyword that represents three abilities. The first is a static ability that functions while the card with suspend is in a player's hand. The second and third are triggered abilities that function in the exile zone. "Suspend N--[cost]" means "If you could begin to cast this card by putting it onto the stack from your hand, you may pay [cost] and exile it with N time counters on it. This action doesn't use the stack," and "At the beginning of your upkeep, if this card is suspended, remove a time counter from it," and "When the last time counter is removed from this card, if it's exiled, play it without paying its mana cost if able. If you can't, it remains exiled. If you cast a creature spell this way, it gains haste until you lose control of the spell or the permanent it becomes."

> 702.86a Rebound appears on some instants and sorceries. It represents a static ability that functions while the spell is on the stack and may create a delayed triggered ability.

>  Players play with the top card of their libraries revealed.   
>  You may play the top card of any player's library.   
>  Whenever you roll {C}, each player puts the top card of his or her library into his or her graveyard.
> 
> 
> 

* You can only play the top cards of players' libraries when you are the planar controller. Generally, this means as long as it's your turn. When another player begins his or her turn, that player becomes the planar controller and can play the top card of players' libraries. You won't be able to until you again become the planar controller.
* You may play the top card of any player's library, including your own. This effect doesn't change when you can play any of these cards (meaning play it if it's a land card or cast it if it's a nonland card). You can still cast creature spells only on your turn during your main phase and so on.
* If the top card of a player's library is a land card, you may play it only if you haven't played a land yet that turn.
* As soon as you finish playing the card on top of a player's library, the next card in that library becomes revealed.
* If a player draws multiple cards at once, he or she reveals each one before drawing it.   
 \* Other players won't be able to play the top card of their libraries unless another effect allows it. If you and another player can play the top card of that player's library (because of some other effect), you'll be able to in most cases. This is because you have priority first at the beginning of each phase and step and after each spell or ability resolves. Once you play that card, it immediately moves from that library to the appropriate zone (the battlefield if it's a land card or the stack if it's a nonland card). The other player can't respond by playing that card.

* Notably, if Dreampod Druid leaves the battlefield while its ability is on the stack, that ability will use Dreampod Druid's last known information to determine whether or not it was enchanted. If it was enchanted when it left the battlefield, the ability will resolve and create a Saproling.

* Indrik Umbra does not give any creature the ability to block the enchanted creature. It just forces those creatures which are already able to block that creature to do so.
* If, during a player's declare blockers step, a creature is tapped or it's affected by a spell or ability that says it can't block, then it doesn't block. If there's a cost associated with having a creature block, its controller isn't forced to pay that cost. The creature doesn't have to block.

It doesn't copy whether that creature is tapped or untapped, whether it has any counters on it or any Auras and Equipment attached to it, or any non-copy effects that have changed its power, toughness, types, color, or so on.
* If the chosen creature has ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20160829100442im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/x.gif) in its mana cost, X is zero.
* If the chosen creature is copying something else (for example, if the chosen creature is another Sakashima's Student), then your Sakashima's Student enters the battlefield as whatever the chosen creature copied.
* If the chosen creature is a token, Sakashima's Student copies the original characteristics of that token as stated by the effect that put the token onto the battlefield. Sakashima's Student is not a token.
* Any enters-the-battlefield abilities of the copied creature will trigger when Sakashima's Student enters the battlefield. Any "as [this creature] enters the battlefield" or "[this creature] enters the battlefield with" abilities of the chosen creature (like devour) will also work.
* If Sakashima's Student somehow enters the battlefield at the same time as another creature, Sakashima's Student can't become a copy of that creature. You may only choose a creature that's already on the battlefield.
* You can choose not to copy anything. In that case, Sakashima's Student enters the battlefield as a 0/0 creature, and is probably put into the graveyard immediately.

* If you cast a permanent spell this way, it will enter the battlefield under your control when it resolves. If you cast an instant or sorcery spell this way, that card will be put into its owner's graveyard when it resolves.
* The nonland card you cast via the triggered ability is cast as part of the resolution of that ability. Timing restrictions based on the card's type are ignored. Other restrictions, such as "Cast [this card] only during an opponent's turn," are not.
* If you cast a card without paying its mana cost, you can't pay any alternative costs, such as evoke or the alternative cost provided by the morph ability.

However, you can pay optional additional costs, such as kicker, and you must still pay mandatory additional costs, such as the one on Fling.
