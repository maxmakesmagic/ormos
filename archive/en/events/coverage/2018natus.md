Day 2 Coverage



It was a weekend that comes only once a year – US Nationals, when players compete for the title of National Champion and a spot on the US World Magic Cup Team. On Saturday, 739 players arrived at the Greater Columbus Convention Center, ready and eager to play for their chance at the title of US National Champion.


After thirteen rounds of Swiss, including two drafts and seven rounds of Standard, eight players moved on to the Top 8 of US Nationals. They were Matthew Nickolai, Chris Andersen, Kevin Jones, Joe Bernal, Dylan Brown, Owen Turtenwald, Justin Andrus, and Brent Clawson.


The finals came down to Justin Andrus, a 29-year-old financial analyst from Saint Louis, and Dylan Brown, a 25-year-old server from Port Huron, Michigan. Both had called upon The Scarab God many times throughout the course of the weekend, and would again in the finals. Brown was piloting Blue-Black Midrange, while Andrus brought his own take on Esper Control that included deviations like three copies of Yahenni’s Expertise and a full four copies of Doomfall.


Brown took game one, taxing Andrus’s answers with card draw and threats. Andrus took game two with the help of two copies of The Eldest Reborn.It was another grueling game three, as players landed threat after threat, only to see those threats answered. It was Dylan Brown who finally found enough creatures to push through Andrus’s removal and take the game.


Congratulations to Dylan Brown, the US National Champion!
