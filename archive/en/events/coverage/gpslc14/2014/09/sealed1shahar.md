2013 World Champion Shahar Shenhar knows his way around the top tables, which means he's played more than his share of Limited matches at the highest levels of the game. With several Grand Prix victories and high finishes at the Pro Tour and beyond, Shenhar is one of the emerging elite: As one of the youngest professional players in the game, his career is on a trajectory for long-term success.





*Shahar Shenhar is the 2013 World Champion, multiple Grand Prix title winner, and among the strongest players in the game today.*
