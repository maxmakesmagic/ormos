While today's main event is of course a Sealed Grand Prix, I still decided to quickly talk to the vendors and ask them what was selling well so we might be able to get a glimpse of tomorrow's Constructed events.

*ThMick and Mike from **Magic** Madhouse.*

"People buy nice shiny cards and some stuff where I really wonder why they are buying it. It's somewhat typical for Limited events; they buy a few Commander cards, they buy a few foils and that's mostly it."

*This customer seemed to prove what Mick was saying.*

"The only cards that also tend to show up in Constructed events that are selling well are the new red cards (the new Boros deck). It's a budget deck and that's why it's very popular for a lot of players that haven't been involved with the game for that long."



"We are able to buy a lot of cards, which also makes this worthwhile. Especially after the first few rounds when people start dropping and they then want to get rid of the rares from their Sealed Decks."

*Olli from JK Entertainment filled us in.*

"Business is not going as strong as it used to in Barcelona. Then again, it seems to be picking up just now, with more people dropping from the main event. We sell a lot of Fetch Lands and Temples, but other than that, it's very hard to come up with a clear direction and say 'this and that' is a trend.



"Fortunately for us, we also have a couple of Legacy cards and those tend to sell well."

*Tinus from MTG Madness was busy buying cards.*

"Mostly, we're selling alterations and foil cards this weekend. And we do a lot of buying cards as well, which is all very typical for a Limited event. So nothing out of the ordinary here.

*Nicolas and Sami from Cartapapa were having a good time.*

**I asked Nicolas whether business at Cartapapa was going a little slower than usual as well and this is what he told me:**



"I think we have one of the largest collections here featuring cards for all formats so it's really easy for people to find the cards they need.


"We also brought plenty of commons which is why we attract a lot of regular customers that are familiar with our great variety. So no, for us, business hasn't been going too slow, my business partner Sami and I are quite happy with our sales so far."

*The staff of Game Keeper Online wouldn't mind buying a few more cards.*

"We sold a lot of [Shock](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shock) Lands this weekend. Other than that, nothing is standing out too much. We haven't been offered a lot of cards unlike the other vendors (from what I heard), but we would definitely like to. Although we also don't mind selling, of course."



So there you have it! Even when it's a Sealed event, it pays out to visit the booths of the various vendors since you're bound to find something you can use to make your collection even more stunning. And if that doesn't sound too appealing, you can still get rid of some of the cards you will not be using in the upcoming events and sell them there.
