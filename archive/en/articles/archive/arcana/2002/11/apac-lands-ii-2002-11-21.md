A few years ago, we gave away promotional basic lands to people in the Asia-Pacific region as a promotion. There were fifteen such lands, each depicting a scene from various countries in the region in an attempt to connect players from that part of the world to the **Magic** universe.

The lands were grouped in packs of five. Below are the contents of the second of the three available packages. Yesterday's [Arcana](/en/articles/archive/apac-lands-i-2002-11-20) looked at the first group.

The Plains represents Australia, the Island depicts Japan, the Swamp is also of Japan, the Mountain shows Taiwan, and the Forest is from China.
