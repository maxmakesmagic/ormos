Welcome to our latest look at the *Magic* Top 25 Pro Rankings. Modern was the format this past weekend, and close to 3,000 players sleeved up their 75s in pursuit of glory, cold hard cash, and Pro Points. Charlotte was the venue, and many of the world's best were in action. Let's see how they fared.



The first five positions remain unaltered. That leaves Eric Froehlich a couple of points ahead of Sam Black, with the Asia-Pacific pair of Yuuya Watanabe and Lee Shi Tian at No. 3 and No. 4, respectively, and former Player of the Year Owen Turtenwald at No. 5. Our new No. 6 is Paul Rietzl, who simultaneously had a terrific, and rough, weekend of *Magic*. Terrific because he went 13-2. Rough because that wasn't quite enough for a Top 8 slot. Tenth place was still enough to see him rise three in the rankings. The other biggest mover in the Top 25 was Brad Nelson. Widely regarded as one the absolute finest Standard players anywhere, he showcased his all-'round Constructed talent with another solid finish in Charlotte, his 12-3 record good enough for 23rd place, and a place in our top 10 at No. 10.



Four more of our Top 25 made it to Day Two in Charlotte. Alexander Hayne came up a fraction short of yet another Top 8, finishing seventeenth. He's now at No. 21. William Jensen has been seen in Europe recently in pursuit of Pro Points, and his 27th-place finish in Charlotte sees him up one in the rankings at No. 15. Josh Utter-Leyton continues his upward trend, with 43rd place taking him from No. 14 to No. 12 this week. Finally, there's Seth Manfield, who remains at No. 8 following his 48th-place finish in Charlotte.



There's just time to tell you about our new entry this week, Steve Rubin. He went 12-3 in Charlotte, bringing him onto the chart at No. 23. As a result, Christian Calcano finds himself back on the trapdoor, at No. 25, and Reid Duke leaves the table—something that seemed unthinkable this time last year.



Next up, there's a double-header of Grand Prix goodness, featuring the continuing story of Modern in [Copenhagen, Denmark](http://magic.wizards.com/en/content/fact-sheet-grand-prix-copenhagen-2015), while [Providence, Rhode Island](http://magic.wizards.com/en/content/fact-sheet-grand-prix-providence-2015), plays host to Standard. As always, you can follow every twist and turn in the Top 25 right here, so join us again next week.
