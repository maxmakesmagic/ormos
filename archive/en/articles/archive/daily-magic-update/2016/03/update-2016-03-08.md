The March 8, 2016 Update
========================



 Posted in **Daily Magic Update**
 on March 8, 2016

The Daily *Magic* Update is a roundup of everything *Magic* you should know on March 8, 2016. Today's Update is brought to you by [International Women's Day](#womensday)!


Today's Must
============


1. [Modern Snapshot](http://www.gatheringmagic.com/nickvigabool-030816-modern-snapshot/) | Gathering Magic | Nick Vigabool

Better take a picture, because this may be the last time we see high-level Modern look like this. And Nick Vigabool did! Take a picture, that is. Graphics, actually, showing the top decks, colors, top cards, and more. Modern is in an interesting place, and we'll all be watching to see how—and if—it shifts.


This is also where I add in my normal caveat that I don't know anything about any changes to the banned and restricted list yet, so don't read anything into my comments. The announcement is April 4, but if you want to do some guessing, the best fuel for any fire is [this interview with Aaron Forsythe at Grand Prix Detroit](http://www.twitch.tv/magic/v/52730586) (the interview starts at roughly the 8:22:30 mark).


After That, Read, Watch, Or Listen to These
===========================================


1. [Fat Stacks—Archangel Avacyn](http://magic.tcgplayer.com/db/article.asp?ID=13156&writer=Cassidy+Silver&articledate=3-8-2016) | TCGPlayer | Cassidy Silver

Archangel Avacyn was revealed about two days ago—time to start brewing! Cassidy Silver is already there, creating a flash-driven Archangel Avacyn Commander deck. For the Commander-obsessed (that'd be me), it's never too early to start looking at the latest legends to lead the charge.


And for more Commander action, CMDR Decks has a [Kalitas deck today](http://www.gatheringmagic.com/cmdrdecks-030816-kalitas-traitor-of-ghet/) on Gathering Magic, and all Kalitas wants to do is give you a hug.


1. [Modern Monday—Bant Company](http://www.numotgaming.com/modern-monday-bant-company/) | Numot Gaming | Frank Lepore

Modern Monday, a popular feature by Frank Lepore, is back and now found on Numot Gaming, the website created recently by Kenji "NumotTheNummy" Egashira. The website as a whole is still getting its internet legs under it, but I know a lot of fans will be happy to see Modern Mondays return, where Frank plays Modern decks—some more mainstream than others—and shows off videos of his games while discussing the archetype and strategy.


1. [The Reveal over Innistrad](https://empeopled.com/p/84339) | Corbin Hosler

Corbin Hosler, one of our coverage writers and a DailyMTG contributor, writes for, well, not us to talk about the experience of the *Shadows* *over Innistrad* launch, including a touch of controversy.


What to Watch Tonight
=====================


1. [Vintage Super League Semifinals](http://vintagesuperleague.com/)

Get your hot, hot Vintage action right here as Luis Scott-Vargas battles Eric Froehlich in a best-three-out-of-five matches (featuring three different decks from each player). I watched last week when the VSL had this same structure, and it was really interesting, even though I play very little Vintage. Worth watching if you enjoy seeing swingy, hard-fought games from some of the best players in the world.


The whole thing starts tonight at 6 p.m. PT (9 p.m. ET) on [twitch.tv/magic](http://www.twitch.tv/magic).


What People Are Talking About
=============================


1. [[SOI] Buy-a-Box Promo is Elusive Tormentor; also Intro Pack images posted](https://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/49etx6/soi_buyabox_promo_is_elusive_tormentor_also_intro/)

So I'm going to do something once that I will likely not do again (never say never)—confirm a leak.


Why this leak?


Because we did it (accidentally). Oops.


Basically, we hit a button too soon. But I thought it was a good opportunity for a short aside about how we handle leaks (even ours!) and why we typically don't do what I'm doing right now—respond to them.


There are a lot of rumors out there. Fake cards, near misses, completely fabricated lists of cards, the works. And there are just too many to respond to each of them individually—especially during preview season. And we can't debunk incorrect rumors while staying silent on correct rumors without tacitly confirming the correct ones. And sometimes people just guess well.


So why don't we then immediately switch the preview plan around to get the right information out there? Sometimes we do. But usually we don't. In some cases, it's momentum or timing. The Intro Pack rares, for example, are part of an article about all of the promos of *Shadows over Innistrad* (coming Monday!), but there are contingencies on that article that you'll see once Monday rolls around, and those contingencies create a fun experience for *Magic* fans. So it stays.


Plus, guessing card abilities from half-covered text is kind of fun for a lot of you.


So there you have it, your first, and possibly last, rumor confirmation on the Daily *Magic* Update. Happy speculating, and look for the Intro Pack rares, in full form, on Monday.

Two things of note in this tweet and others like it.


1. This weekend is [Grand Prix Washington, D.C.,](http://gpdc.starcitygames.com/) and it's going to be huge. Players seem to love Team Sealed, and they're responding by registering by the thousands. There's a party in our nation's capital, and everyone is invited. Because even if you can't play in the main event, well...
2. D.C. has turned into something of an artist-palooza. There will be [tons of artists there](http://gpdc.starcitygames.com/guests.php), including the "Artist Guest of Honor," Terese Nielsen who, thanks to her revamped [Force of Will](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Force+of+Will) art coming in [*Eternal Masters*](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/news/announcing-eternal-masters-2016-02-15), is [so hot right now](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAxJECJJG6w).

Community Spotlight
===================


1. [The Joy of Cubing](http://joyofcubing.blogspot.com/)

Love Cube? Then find some joy right here! Week in and week out, this podcasts covers the ins and outs, the ups and downs, and the sleeve fingers you get from sleeving up hundreds of cards to create and maintain your own cube. You can catch all of their podcasts at the link above, and you can follow them on Twitter [@joyofcubing](https://twitter.com/joyofcubing).


Deck of the Day
===============


1. [Prowess before prowess was prowess](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/mtgo-standings/pauper-constructed-league-2016-03-07)

Blue-Red Prowess decks have started to gain a following, both in Modern and Standard, as hard-hitting, virtual combo decks that can do a ton of damage out of nowhere.


Pssht. Pauper has been there and done that. For a while.


[Temur Battle Rage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Temur+Battle+Rage) is the latest addition to the deck (if you can call last year "latest"), and it's a big boon to a deck trying to pump [Kiln Fiend](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kiln+Fiend) and [Nivix Cyclops](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nivix+Cyclops) to the sky. Fast, brutal, and efficient, Ordon77 took it to 5-0 in Pauper League, probably on the back of more than a few 10/2 double striking [Kiln Fiend](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kiln+Fiend)s.








#### Ordon77's Blue-Red Prowess—5-0 Pauper League
