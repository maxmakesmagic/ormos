 Tung Yi Cheng is probably best known in *Magic* for drawing a [Bonfire of the Damned](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bonfire+of+the+Damned) against Team USA at the World *Magic* Cup two years ago. We even included an animated .gif of it in the coverage yesterday, but posting it a second time might be unnecessarily cruel to Brian Kibler, so we'll leave it be, for now.



Cheng came into the second draft at 10-2 and needing at least two wins and a draw to make top 8.


Pick 1, pack 1, he was faced with the following:



* Feral Incarnation
* Forge Devil
* Gravedigger
* Spirit Bonds
* Triplicate Spirits
