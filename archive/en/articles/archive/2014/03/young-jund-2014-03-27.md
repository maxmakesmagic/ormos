Jund is noticeably lacking the [Thragtusk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thragtusk)s and [Huntmaster of the Fells](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Huntmaster+of+the+Fells) it used to have. One option is to go the "Boss Jund" route with cards like [Sylvan Caryatid](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sylvan+Caryatid) and either [Stormbreath Dragon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stormbreath+Dragon) or [Desecration Demon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Desecration+Demon). However, another option is to play more of a beatdown-oriented game centered on incremental damage.



![Young Pyromancer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Young%20Pyromancer&options=)

Strangledangles used the latter option with [Burning-Tree Emissary](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Burning-Tree+Emissary), [Young Pyromancer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Young+Pyromancer), [Deathrite Shaman](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deathrite+Shaman), and [Scavenging Ooze](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scavenging+Ooze) at the core. Filling out your removal-heavy deck with [Burning-Tree Emissary](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Burning-Tree+Emissary) isn't necessarily going to impress anyone by itself, but that damage starts to add up, especially if you have something like [Young Pyromancer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Young+Pyromancer) or [Xenagos, the Reveler](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Xenagos%2C+the+Reveler) cranking out tokens. [Deathrite Shaman](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deathrite+Shaman), [Rakdos's Return](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rakdos%27s+Return), and burn spells also do a pretty good job of closing the game once you've dealt some initial damage.


Unlike previous Jund Midrange decks, this deck isn't necessarily looking at playing a long game. Its removal spells are simply meant to keep your opponent off balance long enough for you to get those last few points of damage in. It's a relatively rare type of strategy, but it's not all that different from Mono-Black Devotion. You should check it out!
