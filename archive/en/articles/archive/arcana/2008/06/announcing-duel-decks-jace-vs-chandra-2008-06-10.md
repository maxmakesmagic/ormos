Jace Beleren, prodigy of mental magic torn between good and evil.

Chandra Nalaar, sharp-witted pyromancer with a smoldering chip on her shoulder.

Both carry with them a vast arsenal of devastating spells. Neither ever accepts defeat.

Chance has pitted one against the other, but you will determine their destiny.

*Duel Decks: Jace vs Chandra* contains two ready-to-play 60-card decks.

The decks showcase some of the best control and burn cards from throughout **Magic**'s 15-year history. Jace vs. Chandra has eight rare cards, and six cards with newly commissioned artwork, including foil alternate-art versions of Jace Beleren and Chandra Nalaar. All cards are black-bordered and tournament-legal.
