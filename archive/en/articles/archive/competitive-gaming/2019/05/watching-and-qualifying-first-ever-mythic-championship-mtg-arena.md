*Editor's Note: We have updated this article with adjusted prize payouts and new invite information following the announcement of sixteen additional discretionary slots that will be used to invite a broader representation of the* Magic *competitive community. For more on this, read the article from Elaine Chase [here](https://www.mtgesports.com/news/mpl-adds-janne-savjz-mikkonen-and-jessica-estephan). We have also updated details for the Mythic Championship Qualifier Weekend on MTG Arena.*


The first-*ever* Mythic Championship on *Magic: The Gathering Arena* takes place June 21–23, and you can watch all the action—or qualify yourself.


This monumental $750,000 event will feature 32 of the best players in the world from the *Magic* Pro League competing against 36 challengers, sixteen of whom will qualify through *MTG Arena* play. First prize is $100,000, and all invited players will earn at least $7,500 just for qualifying.





| Place | Prize |
| --- | --- |
| 1st | $100,000 |
| 2nd | $50,000 |
| 3rd | $40,000 |
| 4th | $20,000 |
| 5th–16th | $12,500 |
| 17th–68th | $7,500 |


The event itself, Mythic Championship III, will feature best-of-three matches in Standard played on *MTG Arena* and broadcast live on [twitch.tv/magic](https://www.twitch.tv/magic). Sean "Day9" Plott will host the event, with the rest of the broadcast team being announced soon.


Players will be matched in seven rounds of play on Friday, before a double-elimination Top 16 on Saturday determines the final four who will move on to Sunday. That epic Sunday showdown will then feature a double-elimination Top 4 throwdown for $100,000.


36 of the slots are locked—32 members of the *Magic* Pro League plus previous Mythic Championship winners Andrew Elenbogen, Allen Wu, Ben Hull, and Gregory Orange. Additionally, we'll be [adding sixteen discretionary slots](https://www.mtgesports.com/news/mpl-adds-janne-savjz-mikkonen-and-jessica-estephan) that will be used to invite a broader representation of the *Magic* competitive community to high-level play. We know that the pool of talent is broad, and we think it should be represented in a concrete way to the viewers and fans of competitive *Magic*.


The final sixteen *MTG Arena* slots? Those are up to you.


How to Qualify
==============


The Top 16 players at the end of the Mythic Championship Qualifier Weekend May 25–26 on *MTG Arena* will qualify for Mythic Championship III. That sounds simple enough, but let's break it down:


* The Top 1,000 mythic-ranked players in either Constructed or Limited on *MTG Arena* from March and April qualify for the Mythic Championship Qualifier Weekend May 25–26.
* Day One of the MCQW will feature an in-client queue where players play until they reach eight wins or two losses. The format for Day One is Traditional Constructed (best-of-three Standard). The Top 128 players will make Day Two and will be contacted by email with details.
* Day Two will be run as a direct-challenge tournament and will be seven rounds of Swiss play in best-of-three Traditional Constructed. Players will qualify automatically at 5-0 or at 5-1 after Rounds 5 and 6. The remainder of the sixteen players will qualify based on their record and tiebreakers.

Day Two will be run utilizing direct challenge, and more details will be available to those who qualify.


It's just that easy. Well, it's just that simple. There's nothing easy about climbing over thousands of other *MTG Arena* ringers to claim one of sixteen spots in a $750,000 tournament watched live by hundreds of thousands of fans on [twitch.tv/magic](https://www.twitch.tv/magic). For specific details see below.


One way or another, we'll see you there.
