 Stybs has played Magic the world over, writing and drafting as part of the event coverage team and slinging Commander everywhere his decks will fit. 






 David Foster, in his second Grand Prix attended, had already surpassed the expectations most players bring to the event. With his invitation to Grand Prix Dragons of Tarkir already earned, Foster's goal was now two matches away: A trophy-earned as champion of Grand Prix Baltimore. His thoroughly Abzan deck was built for long games and hard-fought wins.



Harry Bradford, while carring a bit more experience at big events, was also in his first Grand Prix Top 8. The prospect of earning a seat – and win – at the final match of the event was a driving excitement for him. Having assembled a strictly blue-green deck in the Top 8 draft, his evasive creatures had soared to victory in the quarterfinals.



 Could Foster's Anafenza still be the Foremost against a flying army?




**The Games**




[Heir of the Wilds](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Heir+of+the+Wilds) was the early play was Foster, though Bradford matched it with [Temur Charger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Temur+Charger). [Alpine Grizzly](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Alpine+Grizzly) upped the stairway of climbing creature power, and they volleyed back and forth with adding creatures and attacking, unafraid of the mounting damage.



"What's blocking?" Bradford asked as he fell to 9 life.
