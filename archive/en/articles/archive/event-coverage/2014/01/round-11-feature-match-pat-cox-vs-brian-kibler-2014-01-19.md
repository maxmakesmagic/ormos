Neither Hall of Famer Brian Kibler nor Pat Cox were enthusiastic about their chances of winning any matches with their decks from the first *Theros* Booster Draft of the day.


**The Decks**


Pat Cox fell into a trap in the first pack of his draft, taking [Daxos of Meletis](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Daxos+of+Meletis) and being unable to get out of those colors. "By the end of Pack One I thought I should be green," Cox said. "But then, in Pack Two I opened [Celestial Archon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Celestial+Archon), and trapped myself again."


Kibler's draft did not go well either, as he was forced to cobble together a playable blue-white deck out of the cards available to him. "Pack One was relatively weak overall," Kibler noted.


**The Games**


Cox led with [Omenspeaker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Omenspeaker), leaving one card on top. It was joined by [Opaline Unicorn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Opaline+Unicorn) after an attack for one on the next turn. [Pheres-Band Centaurs](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pheres-Band+Centaurs) came on the fourth turn, a little early thanks to the Unicorn. Kibler's response was his first play of the game: [Coastline Chimera](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Coastline+Chimera).


The Centaurs got an upgrade thanks to a bestowed [Leafcrown Dryad](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leafcrown+Dryad), dropping Kibler to 14. Kibler passed with five mana up on the next turn, signaling a slew of potential tricks. Cox, wary of losing his Centaurs to a [Divine Verdict](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Divine+Verdict), sent only his [Omenspeaker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Omenspeaker) and [Opaline Unicorn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Opaline+Unicorn), cracking in for a point when Kibler blocked one of them. [Traveler's Amulet](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Traveler%27s+Amulet) to find a Plains was his only follow-up after that, and Kibler aimed a [Voyage's End](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Voyage%27s+End) at the Centaurs. [Anvilwrought Raptor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Anvilwrought+Raptor) entered the battlefield for Kibler on the next turn, giving him a reasonable blocker against Cox's now very small creatures.

Cox sent in the team anyway, and when Kibler went for a block on [Leafcrown Dryad](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leafcrown+Dryad) with [Anvilwrought Raptor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Anvilwrought+Raptor), Cox had [Triton Tactics](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Triton+Tactics) to keep his team around. [Battlewise Valor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Battlewise+Valor) from Kibler was aimed at his [Anvilwrought Raptor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Anvilwrought+Raptor), keeping it around. The [Pheres-Band Centaurs](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pheres-Band+Centaurs) came down post combat, and was bestowed with [Nylea's Emissary](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nylea%27s+Emissary) before an attack on the next turn, trumping Kibler's freshly cast [Leonin Snarecaster](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leonin+Snarecaster). This prompted [Divine Verdict](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Divine+Verdict) from Kibler, once again leaving Cox with only smaller creatures.



[Aqueous Form](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aqueous+Form) came down on the Snarecaster after that, as Kibler began his not-so-fast ten turn clock. As Cox received his beatdowns, two damage at a time, he couldn't help but say it. "Our decks are so bad," he muttered, inciting a laugh from Kibler who agreed.


A bestowed [Nimbus Naiad](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nimbus+Naiad) on [Anvilwrought Raptor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Anvilwrought+Raptor) earned a [Griptide](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Griptide) from Cox. Attacks from Cox's creatures on the next turn left his [Nylea's Emissary](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nylea%27s+Emissary) dead, Kibler's [Nimbus Naiad](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nimbus+Naiad) destroyed, and a post-combat [Setessan Griffin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Setessan+Griffin) from Cox post-combat looked to secure the game for him.


Kibler, who drew his [Anvilwrought Raptor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Anvilwrought+Raptor) yet again, was helpless to the onslaught of Cox's army, ultimately succumbing to the likes of [Omenspeaker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Omenspeaker) beatings et all.


"Play or draw?" Cox asked. "I think I'll go second," Kibler said. "I've no idea if that's right," Cox said. "Me neither," Kibler responded.

Cox had a much better creature early in the second game, with [Daxos of Meletis](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Daxos+of+Meletis) coming down following his second-turn [Omenspeaker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Omenspeaker). [Soldier of the Pantheon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soldier+of+the+Pantheon) on the third turn to block Daxos earned a slump in the seat from Cox, who attacked in with Daxos and [Omenspeaker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Omenspeaker) on the fourth turn. When the Soldier blocked Daxos, [Divine Verdict](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Divine+Verdict) took the one-mana creature out. Unfortunately for Cox, when you and your opponent's decks are full of small creatures, Daxos becomes a lot easier to block, as Kibler proved with the 2/1 [Anvilwrought Raptor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Anvilwrought+Raptor).



An attack with four open mana caused Kibler to halt on blocking with his freshly played [Anvilwrought Raptor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Anvilwrought+Raptor). Cox got in for 4 damage, and Daxos exiled and netted Cox a free [Chosen by Heliod](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chosen+by+Heliod), which he promptly cast on his Daxos. No plays from Kibler halted Daxos's attacks, Cox wary of losing his legendary creature. He instead attacked for 1 with [Omenspeaker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Omenspeaker) and cast [Coastline Chimera](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Coastline+Chimera). It was joined by Pheras-Band Centaurs after attacks on the next turn. Kibler, who was stuck on four lands for too long, ultimately had to play out his [Nimbus Naiad](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nimbus+Naiad) in the face of the 3/7.


Eventually, Kibler got to enough mana to cast [Benthic Giant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Benthic+Giant), but by that point, Cox's board had five creatures. Attacks left Cox trading off cards with Kibler, but the Hall of Famer's life was sitting at 7, and he was down against a massive board. While Kibler was able to suit up his [Benthic Giant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Benthic+Giant) with nimbus Naiad to give him a blocker in the air, it was not enough, and the Hall of Famer offered the handshake a few turns later.
