Thanks to the cut for Day Two, the metagame for Pro Tour *Battle for Zendikar* advanced to its second step. This is what remains:

| Temur Dragons | 1 | 0.43% |
| Temur Landfall | 1 | 0.43% |
| TOTAL | 230 | 100.00% |

Like before, the full breakdown was a bit unwieldy. Let's take a broader look across the major archetypes:




| Archetype | Count | % Field |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Red Aggro (All Types) | 46 | 20.00% |
| Jeskai (All Types) | 45 | 19.57% |
| Megamorph (All Types) | 39 | 16.96% |
| Esper (All Types) | 31 | 13.48% |
| Four/Five-Color (All Types) | 18 | 7.83% |
| Abzan (All Types) | 16 | 6.96% |
| All Other Archetypes | 35 | 15.22% |
| TOTAL | 230 | 100.00% |

The results at a glance are in line with what we'd expect with a tournament cut at a record of 4-4: Everything has been more or less halved in count. Jeskai and aggressive red decks still take the top two slots, followed by Megamorph, Esper, Abzan and Four- and Five-Color conglomerates.


Nothing changed except, well, everything changed. Here's the high level summary for just players that started Day Two with a record of 6-2 (18 points):




| Archetype | Count | % Field |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Jeskai (All Types) | 13 | 26.53% |
| Red Aggro (All Types) | 11 | 22.45% |
| Abzan (All Types) | 8 | 16.33% |
| Megamorph (All Types) | 6 | 12.24% |
| Esper (All Types) | 6 | 12.24% |
| Blue-Black Aristocrats | 1 | 2.04% |
| Four-Color Control | 1 | 2.04% |
| Four-Color Dragons | 1 | 2.04% |
| Red-Black Aggro | 1 | 2.04% |
| Temur Dragons | 1 | 2.04% |
| TOTAL | 49 | 100.00% |

This informs the possibilities a little more. Gone are the amalgams of super colorful creations. Here, decisions by some of the top players and teams are clearer, as more of them elected for Jeskai and aggressive red decks than other options.


However, the rate the archetypes advanced to Day Two is interesting as well:




| Archetype | Day One Total | Day Two Total | Advancement |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Jeskai (All Types) | 69 | 45 | 65.20% |
| Red Aggro (All Types) | 67 | 46 | 68.70% |
| Megamorph (All Types) | 66 | 39 | 59.10% |
| Esper (All Types) | 44 | 31 | 70.50% |
| Abzan (All Types) | 34 | 17 | 50.00% |
| Four/Five-Color (All Types) | 30 | 18 | 60.00% |
| Aristocrats (All Types) | 12 | 8 | 66.70% |
| All Other Archetypes | 45 | 26 | 57.80% |
| TOTAL | 367 | 230 | 62.70% |

With an overall advancement rate of about 63%, the winners and losers of deck decisions began to appear. Abzan was unpopular among many of the top teams, but still had an appreciable showing for Day One. However, the players those chose it advanced at a dramatically lower rate than Esper, a similarly popular option coming in.


After Esper, aggressive red decks had the best advancement rate among players, even if it dipped slightly among those at 6-2 to start Day Two. One of the more interesting stories is the Aristocrats deck built on [Nantuko Husk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nantuko+Husk), [Zulaport Cutthroat](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Zulaport+Cutthroat), and others that harkens back to the Falkenrath Arisocrats deck of *Gatecrash* era Standard. While it's overall advancement rate for Day Two looks in line, one team of eight played the blue-black version of the deck and featured six players that returned for Sunday.


While the Day Two *Battle for Zendikar* Draft rounds decided *who* played Standard to round out the day, what looked likely to rise up for Top 8 began to take shape.
