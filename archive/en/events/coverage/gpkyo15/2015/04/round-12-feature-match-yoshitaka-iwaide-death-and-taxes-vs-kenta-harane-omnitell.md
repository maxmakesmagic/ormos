It's lonely at the top, they all say.


Kenta Harane remains the lone undefeated player in the entire tournament. Piloting OmniTell, he was able to steamroll through the competition to rise to the top. Cheating out [Omniscience](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Omniscience) and Emrakul, the Aeons Torn with [Show and Tell](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Show+and+Tell) makes the combo deck one of the most unfair in the format. [Cheatyface](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cheatyface) would be so proud!


He was paired down to Yoshitaka Iwaide, who is at a 10-1 record .


On the other end of the spectrum, Death & Taxes was possibly one of the most fair decks in the format. Like a typical white weenie deck, it doesn't have particularly powerful cards. Yet, it is resilient enough to stand up against the rest of the format with its disruptive threats. [Mother of Runes](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mother+of+Runes) is great in the creature and control matchups, as is the entire [Stoneforge Mystic](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stoneforge+Mystic) package. [Phyrexian Revoker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phyrexian+Revoker), [Thalia, Guardian of Thraben](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thalia%2C+Guardian+of+Thraben), [Ethersworn Canonist](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ethersworn+Canonist) and [Karakas](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Karakas) attempt to keep the combo decks in check .


At least, that is what Iwaide hoped to do against Harane.


Game One
========


Iwaide won the die roll and opened with [Mother of Runes](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mother+of+Runes). Under normal circumstances it would be a nuisance, but not to Harane. The OmniTell player has little intention of interacting with the board, preferring to race towards their combo.


Iwaide's next creature was rather annoying and it resolved unmolested via [Cavern of Souls](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cavern+of+Souls). [Thalia, Guardian of Thraben](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thalia%2C+Guardian+of+Thraben), in conjunction with [Rishadan Port](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rishadan+Port), threatened to tie down Harane's mana as much as possible. The effect was felt immediately, as Harane practically spent his entire third turn to cast a single Preordain.

However, Harane managed to find [Ancient Tomb](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ancient+Tomb) and tapped out resolve [Show and Tell](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Show+and+Tell). [Omniscience](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Omniscience) and a relatively underwhelming [Flickerwisp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flickerwisp) entered the battlefield. Despite all his spells now being free to cast, Harane was unable to win immediately. He had to wait for his next untap step in order to pay the “mana tithe”.


Another attack brought him down to just four life but the additional turn was all he needed. Using [Cunning Wish](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cunning+Wish) to fetch [Wipe Away](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wipe+Away), Harane managed to get rid of the opposing Thalia, allowing him to [Dig Through Time](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dig+Through+Time). He eventually found [Cunning Wish](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cunning+Wish) for Eladamri's Call, and in turn Emrakul, the Aeons Torn for the win.

**Yoshitaka Iwaide 0 – Kenta Harane 1**



Game Two
========


The dynamic duo of [Mother of Runes](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mother+of+Runes) and [Thalia, Guardian of Thraben](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thalia%2C+Guardian+of+Thraben) were Iwaide's first creatures and they were soon joined by [Stoneforge Mystic](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stoneforge+Mystic). Harane shrugged them off and simply used [Pyroclasm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyroclasm) to clear the board.

Yoshitaka tried to jam up all future cantrips with [Chalice of the Void](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chalice+of+the+Void) set to one, but it was a futile attempt. Harane had the perfect combination of [Show and Tell](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Show+and+Tell), [Omniscience](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Omniscience) and Cunning Wish.


[Cunning Wish](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cunning+Wish) fetched [Firemind's Foresight](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Firemind%27s+Foresight) from the sideboard granting Yoshitaka [Brainstorm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brainstorm), [Release the Ants](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Release+the+Ants) and a second [Cunning Wish](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cunning+Wish). The second [Cunning Wish](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cunning+Wish) provided Harane with [Wipe Away](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wipe+Away) for [Chalice of the Void](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chalice+of+the+Void) .


Now that [Chalice of the Void](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chalice+of+the+Void) was out of the way, it allowed Harane to use [Brainstorm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brainstorm) to put [Omniscience](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Omniscience) on top of his deck, which in turn enabled him to cast [Release the Ants](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Release+the+Ants) enough times for Iwaide to extend the hand .
