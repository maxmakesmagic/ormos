### Artur Villela


**Age:** 32  
**Hometown:** Juiz de Fora, Brazil   
**Occupation:** Gamer  
  

**Previous *Magic* Accomplishments:** 
  
Conceded in the finals of a Grand Prix to a friend.
 



**What was your record in Sealed? What did you play? What was the hardest decision in your build?**
  
7-2, played Sultai splashing white-red. I had to decide whether I wanted to play the best spells I had or a mediocre three-color deck.
 



**What was your record in Draft 1? What did you play? What did you first-pick and why?**
  
3-0. Played Sultai morph.
 



**What was your record in Draft 2? What did you play? What did you first-pick and why?**
  
3-0. Played white-green. First picked [Herald of Anafenza](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Herald+of+Anafenza). The card is pretty good. It seemed like an obvious choice.
 



**Which *Khans of Tarkir* card exceeded your expectations in Limited, and why?** 
  
[Incremental Growth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Incremental+Growth). I was pretty sure it was going to be good. I had no idea it could be as good as it was for me.




**Tuesdays or Thursdays, and why?** 
  
Tuesday. It's usually more quiet and peaceful than Thursdays.

**Occupation:** Operations Research; occasional Nightlight Promotions  
  

**Previous *Magic* Accomplishments:** 
  
Winner, Grand Prix Tampa 2002. Built some black-green deck that's 50-50 vs. everything that people are still playing 15 years later.
 



**What was your record in Sealed? What did you play? What was the hardest decision in your build?**
  
8-1, Mardu. Sided out all but three red cards every round to tighten up the mana.
 



**What was your record in Draft 1? What did you play? What did you first-pick and why?**
  
3-0, Blue-Black with sixteen lands (all basic) and fliers. Took [Mardu Ascendancy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mardu+Ascendancy) from a weak pack, then abandoned it when blue kept coming.
 



**What was your record in Draft 2? What did you play? What did you first-pick and why?**
  
2-1. Jeskai. First pick [Mantis Rider](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mantis+Rider): Swings races like few other cards can. [Clear](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Clear)ly the best card. It was one of only two blue cards in my fourty to ensure consistency.
 



**Which *Khans of Tarkir* card exceeded your expectations in Limited, and why?** 
  
[Rakshasa's Secret](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rakshasa%27s+Secret). [Mind Rot](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mind+Rot) was always good. [Mind Rot](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mind+Rot) plus [Black Lotus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Black+Lotus) (in a delve deck) equals broken.




**Tuesdays or Thursdays, and why?**

**Previous *Magic* Accomplishments:** 
  
Top 8 Grand Prix Vancouver 2014,Top 16 Grand Prix Providence 2013,and a bunch of GP min cashes.
 



**What was your record in Sealed? What did you play? What was the hardest decision in your build?**
  
8-1, played Abzan splashing [Butcher of the Horde](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Butcher+of+the+Horde) and [Riverwheel Aerialists](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Riverwheel+Aerialists). Hardest decision was choosing the ternary color (green vs blue).
 



**What was your record in Draft 1? What did you play? What did you first-pick and why?**
  
2-1, played 21 creature BGuw. I first-picked [Ainok Bond-Kin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ainok+Bond-Kin), because it was monocolored and also happened to be the best card in the pack.
 



**What was your record in Draft 2? What did you play? What did you first-pick and why?**
  
3-0. Played Sultai control. I first-picked [Murderous Cut](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Murderous+Cut)...once again because it was monoclored and the best card.
 



**Which *Khans of Tarkir* card exceeded your expectations in Limited, and why?** 
  
It's a tie between [Shambling Attendants](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shambling+Attendants) and [Dazzling Ramparts](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dazzling+Ramparts). Both looked overcosted to me, but the toughness is extremely impressive on both.
 



**Tuesdays or Thursdays, and why?** 
  
Thursday has more letters, and more is always better.

### Pierre-Christophe Mondon


**Age:** 30  
**Hometown:** Columbus, Ohio   
**Occupation:** Prop  
  

**Previous *Magic* Accomplishments:** 
  
Lost PT Portland.
 



**What was your record in Sealed? What did you play? What was the hardest decision in your build?**
  
7-2. Played Mardu. Toughest decision was whether or not to drop and draft upon seeing my pool.
 



**What was your record in Draft 1? What did you play? What did you first-pick and why?**
  
3-0, Mardu, [Butcher of the Horde](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Butcher+of+the+Horde), because I thought it would be nice.
 



**What was your record in Draft 2? What did you play? What did you first-pick and why?**
  
3-0, Abzan, [Ainok Bond-Kin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ainok+Bond-Kin). Picked it because it turns out you can tap it to put a counter on it, thus giving it first strike. In addition, if you put counters on other creatures, they get first strike too. Go figure.
 



**Which *Khans of Tarkir* card exceeded your expectations in Limited, and why?** 
  
[Rotting Mastodon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rotting+Mastodon).

8-1, Abzan splash [Icefeather Aven](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Icefeather+Aven). The hardest decision? Question: Should I splash a red morph? Answer: Nope.
 



**What was your record in Draft 1? What did you play? What did you first-pick and why?**
  
3-0. Sultai, splash [Anafenza, the Foremost](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Anafenza%2C+the+Foremost). P1P1 was Anafenza, because I enjoy branching off from black/green.
 



**What was your record in Draft 2? What did you play? What did you first-pick and why?**
  
2-1. 5-color morphs. P1P1 [Pine Walker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pine+Walker) â€“ That guy is a house.

**Hometown:** Providence, RI   
**Occupation:** Pro MTG player and writer at tcgplayer.com  
  

**Previous *Magic* Accomplishments:** 
  
Top 8 GP Santiago, Top 8 PT *Gatecrash*




**What was your record in Sealed? What did you play? What was the hardest decision in your build?**
  
8-1, Sultai. Mostly UB, splashed G. Hardest decision was should I play straight 3 color with bad mana, or not?
 



**What was your record in Draft 1? What did you play? What did you first-pick and why?**
  
3-0, Abzan, GW splashing black. [Abzan Charm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Abzan+Charm) was my first pick. It was a cear first pick, the pack wasn't that good, and it's a card worth committing to three colors for.
 



**What was your record in Draft 2? What did you play? What did you first-pick and why?**
  
2-0-1, Abzan, BW splash G. [Feat of Resistance](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Feat+of+Resistance) was my first pick. It's a good start to the white Outlast deck.
 



**Which *Khans of Tarkir* card exceeded your expectations in Limited, and why?** 
  
[Rush of Battle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rush+of+Battle). It looks bad because it's a Sorcery and expensive, but it's awesome, can be built around, and it wins games.
