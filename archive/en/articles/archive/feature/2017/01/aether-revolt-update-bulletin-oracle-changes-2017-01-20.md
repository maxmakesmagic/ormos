Oracle Changes
==============


**Goblin Test Pilot (Functional)**


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Goblin+Test+Pilot)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Test+Pilot)
With the release of *Kaladesh*, we made the decision not to give the Pilot creature type to every creature shown at the helm of various vessels in their art. However, we do have a policy that a creature with a supported "job class" creature type in its name should officially have that job as one of its creature types. [Goblin Test Pilot](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Test+Pilot) now has lucrative employment as the only Goblin Pilot Wizard in the whole Multiverse.


**Gilder Bairn (Non-Functional)**


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Gilder+Bairn)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gilder+Bairn)
[Deepglow Skate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deepglow+Skate) and [Vorel of the Hull Clade](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vorel+of+the+Hull+Clade) got some pretty cool new text in *Commander (2016 Edition)*. [Gilder Bairn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gilder+Bairn) gets to tag along for the ride in its adorable frog costume and decorate its buddies with those glowing whatsits.


*Old rules text:*


{2}{(g/u)}, {Q}: For each counter on target permanent, put another of those counters on that permanent. *({Q} is the untap symbol.)*


*New rules text:*


{2}{(g/u)}, {Q}: Double the number of each kind of counter on target permanent. *({Q} is the untap symbol.)*


**Cascade Reminder Text (Non-Functional)**


Cascade's original reminder text in *Alara Reborn* left out "your library" when telling you to put the cards on the bottom. It's obvious from context, right? We're not putting those cards on the bottom of the stack or the bottom of your hand or on your bottom. When some of the cascade cards were reprinted in *Commander (2016 Edition)*, that decision was revisited and the reminder text was given more words for clarity.


*Old rules text:*


Cascade *(When you cast this spell, exile cards from the top of your library until you exile a nonland card that costs less. You may cast it without paying its mana cost. Put the exiled cards on the bottom in a random order.)*


*New rules text:*


Cascade *(When you cast this spell, exile cards from the top of your library until you exile a nonland card that costs less. You may cast it without paying its mana cost. Put the exiled cards on the bottom of your library in a random order.)*


**Liege of the Hollows (Non-Functional)**


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Liege+of+the+Hollows)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Liege+of+the+Hollows)
[Liege of the Hollows](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Liege+of+the+Hollows) was feeling rather cryptic. Do players get Squirrels for only the mana they individually paid, or for the total amount paid? [Liege of the Hollows](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Liege+of+the+Hollows) is a Spirit and not a Sphinx, so we made it stop asking its nutty riddle. Now it's unambiguous: You get Squirrels for the mana you paid.


*Old rules text:*


When [Liege of the Hollows](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Liege+of+the+Hollows) dies, each player may pay any amount of mana. Then each player who paid mana this way creates that many 1/1 green Squirrel creature tokens.


*New rules text:*


When [Liege of the Hollows](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Liege+of+the+Hollows) dies, each player may pay any amount of mana. Then each player creates a number of 1/1 green Squirrel creature tokens equal to the amount of mana he or she paid this way.


**Wheel and Deal (Non-Functional)**


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Wheel+and+Deal)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wheel+and+Deal)
The pluralization on [Wheel and Deal](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wheel+and+Deal) didn't quite match other cards that had "any number of target players each" do something. We discarded all the text after "Any number of target players each" and drew seven new words.


*Old rules text:*


Any number of target opponents each discards his or her hand, then draws seven cards.  

Draw a card.


*New rules text:*


Any number of target opponents each discard their hands, then draw seven cards.  

Draw a card.


**Omniscience and Tamiyo, Field Researcher (Non-Functional)**


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Omniscience)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Omniscience) [![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Tamiyo%2C+Field+Researcher)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tamiyo%2C+Field+Researcher)
These two cards are the grand finale of the string of errata to uniformize our use of "spells" and "cards" throughout Oracle. Now we have a unifying templating rule: When we want an effect to allow you to play or cast something you couldn't normally play or cast, we use "card." When we want an effect to modify how you may play or cast something when you could already do so, we use "spell" or "land."


Tamiyo and [Omniscience](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Omniscience) almost escaped—if you change "hand" to "graveyard," it would have to say "may cast nonland cards from your graveyard." In the end, the new templating rule won out over linguistic parallelism.  

Between [Omniscience](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Omniscience) and [Wheel and Deal](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wheel+and+Deal), this Oracle meeting was a grammatical delight.


*[Omniscience](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Omniscience)'s old rules text:*


You may cast nonland cards from your hand without paying their mana costs.


*[Omniscience](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Omniscience)'s new rules text:*


You may cast spells from your hand without paying their mana costs.


*[Tamiyo, Field Researcher](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tamiyo%2C+Field+Researcher)'s old rules text:*


+1: Choose up to two target creatures. Until your next turn, whenever either of those creatures deals combat damage, you draw a card.  

-2: Tap up to two target nonland permanents. They don't untap during their controller's next untap step.  

-7: Draw three cards. You get an emblem with "You may cast nonland cards from your hand without paying their mana costs."


*[Tamiyo, Field Researcher](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tamiyo%2C+Field+Researcher)'s new rules text:*


+1: Choose up to two target creatures. Until your next turn, whenever either of those creatures deals combat damage, you draw a card.  

-2: Tap up to two target nonland permanents. They don't untap during their controller's next untap step.  

-7: Draw three cards. You get an emblem with "You may cast spells from your hand without paying their mana costs."


**Confound, Hydromorph Guardian, and Hydromorph Gull (Non-Functional)**


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Confound)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Confound) [![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Hydromorph+Guardian)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hydromorph+Guardian) [![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Hydromorph+Gull)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hydromorph+Gull)
These three cards counter a spell that targets a creature or a creature you control. To be helpful, they noted that this spell could target one of those creatures, but it could also target more of them. We've since moved away from that and just say "that targets a...," but these three hadn't been brought in line yet.


*[Confound](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Confound)'s old rules text:*


Counter target spell that targets one or more creatures.  

Draw a card.


*[Confound](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Confound)'s new rules text:*


Counter target spell that targets a creature.  

Draw a card.


*[Hydromorph Guardian](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hydromorph+Guardian)'s old rules text:*


{U}, Sacrifice [Hydromorph Guardian](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hydromorph+Guardian): Counter target spell that targets one or more creatures you control.


*[Hydromorph Guardian](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hydromorph+Guardian)'s new rules text:*


{U}, Sacrifice [Hydromorph Guardian](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hydromorph+Guardian): Counter target spell that targets a creature you control.


*[Hydromorph Gull](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hydromorph+Gull)'s old rules text:*


Flying  

{U}, Sacrifice [Hydromorph Gull](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hydromorph+Gull): Counter target spell that targets one or more creatures you control.


*[Hydromorph Gull](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hydromorph+Gull)'s new rules text:*
