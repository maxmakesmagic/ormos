**The Players**



Grand Prix Chicago marks the first GP Top 8 for both Tyler Blum of Calgary and Steve Rubin of Pittsburg. Both players have had their past successes. Blum was a 2005 Canadian National Team member and Rubin a two-time Pro Tour Qualifier, both looking to win their first ever Grand Prix Top 8 match. 



**The Decks**




 The players took their seats packing two different versions of the format staple, Black Devotion. Blum with straight Black, while Rubin opted for the variant splashing green for [Abrupt Decay](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Abrupt+Decay) and multiple sideboard cards. The Decays are capable of removing the incredibly powerful [Underworld Connections](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Underworld+Connections) that can take over this mirror match. While this might give a slight edge to Rubin, the edge was only a small one at best.




**The Games**




 After both players kept, Blum started out his first two turns Thoughtseizing an [Underworld Connections](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Underworld+Connections) and a [Bile Blight](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bile+Blight) putting Rubin in an early hole. A few turns later, with a [Desecration Demon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Desecration+Demon) and [Mutavault](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mutavault) on board, Blum attacked Rubin down to 8 before resolving a [Pack Rat](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pack+Rat). Blum's [Desecration Demon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Desecration+Demon) hit the bin thanks to a removal spell, but with no more cards in hand and no creatures in play, Rubin had his back against the wall. A [Desecration Demon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Desecration+Demon) of his own a few turns later finally gave him a way to at least try and play defense.
