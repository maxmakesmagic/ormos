Before we begin, I need you to take a little test. It shouldn’t take too long and I promise it won’t hurt. 

### The Test

This poll has been removed. Thanks for voting.

  
  
*Hello! This test has stopped working at some point, possibly because it was written using the website technology as it stood in 2002. Sorry about that! Of course, taking it properly required a certain amount of familiarity with the cards listed, so it probably wouldn't be that informative now anyway.*

*To skip the test and go on to the article (which is one of Mark Rosewater's best), [click here](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/magazine/article.aspx?x=mtgcom/daily/mr11b)!*
