Each guild on the plane of Ravnica has its own unique symbol. In addition to the [Ravnica Minisite](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=magic/ravnica/home), you can also see the guild symbols printed lightly in the background of the text box, and of course on the four artifact [signets](http://gatherer.wizards.com/?first=1&last=100&term=signet&Field_Name=on&Field_Rules=on&Field_Type=on&setfilter=RavnicaBlock&colorfilter=All&typefilter=A&output=summary&sort=name&x=27&y=30) (see right).


The guild symbols also show up, sometimes subtly, in the art of *Ravnica: City of Guilds* cards. Below, check out these examples of signets buried in art.
