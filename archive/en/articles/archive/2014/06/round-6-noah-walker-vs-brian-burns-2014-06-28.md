Brian Burns was surprised to hear his name called over the PA for a feature match, and even more nervous as he began to shuffle up for his first game under the lights.


"Are you a pro?" He asked his opponent, Noah Walker, as they rolled to determine turn order. "I've never had a feature match before."


"Definitely not," Walker replied. "I just beat Shahar (Shenhar, the world's 14th-ranked player) last round."


That's the beauty of the king of the hill. It gives any player a chance to stay under the camera (or the figurative pen), so long as they keep winning. Walker took the title by knocking off Shenhar; would he retain it or would Burns take his turn atop the throne?



**Game 1**




[Mogis, God of Slaughter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mogis%2C+God+of+Slaughter) may not have made an impact on Standard yet, but the god proved in the first game just how powerful he is if left unchecked. And in Sealed Deck, indestructible gods that can win the game without ever turning into a creature are pretty difficult to check.



Both players kept their opening seven cards, but neither had much aggression. An early creature from Burns met a removal spell from Walker, and nothing else happened until Mogis hit the board on turn four.



 All Walker could do was shake his head as both players began to draw running lands. A [Gild](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gild) took out a creature and finally an [Eater of Hope](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eater+of+Hope) hit the board for Walker, but by then Mogis had done his dirty work, bringing the king of the hill to two life. A [Magma Jet](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Magma+Jet) to the face later, and it was off to Game 2.




**Burns 1 — Walker 0**




**Game 2**




 Walker continued to shake his head as he was forced to mulligan to five cards in the second game and he failed to find a third land and merely activated his [Returned Phalanx](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Returned+Phalanx) to attack for three.




 Burns, on the other hand, began to fill his board with imposing creatures. First came [Master of the Feast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Master+of+the+Feast), followed by an [Archetype of Aggression](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Archetype+of+Aggression) and an [Arena](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arena) Champion. That put Walker on the back foot as Master quickly halved his life total over two turns.




 But the drawback on [Master of the Feast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Master+of+the+Feast) is always relevant, and soon it began to fill Walker's hand. Having drawn two extra cards from the Master and finding land, Walker finally unlocked the cards in his hand. A [Gild](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gild) removed the flier, a [Gray Merchant of Asphodel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gray+Merchant+of+Asphodel) buoyed his life total, and with the help of the Gold token Walker's [Eater of Hope](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eater+of+Hope) was enough to earn an unlikely concession from Burns as he watched the game slip away.




**Burns 1 — Walker 1**






*Burns' [Mogis, God of Slaughter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mogis%2C+God+of+Slaughter) proved how powerful it can be without ever even threatening to attack.*
