Lunch: A Gathering for Magic
============================



 Posted in [Serious Fun](/en/articles/columns/serious-fun-archive)
 on December 19, 2011 









*I have several loves in my life: my wife, my jobs, my family, my friends. Both **Magic** and food can be added to the list as well. Discovering a friendly face around the workplace who also wanted to get gaming over lunch was a turning point for me. I've had some great times with Craig, and we've continued to find Winchester the perfect pace of game for us.*

*If you're short on extra seats, or only have a few booster packs to work with, Winchester Draft is one way to get things going!*

*Innistrad* Travels to Winchester
While there isn't a sexy draft viewer to see how Craig and I took turns picking, we did take notes and pictures throughout the draft. If you wanted to see an entire Winchester event in detail this is the place.

A quick caveat before going forward: we draft because we find the process, and resulting games, fun. If you don't enjoy the type of deep thoughts judo that Craig and I do, *that's okay*. Sometimes we just want to get down to gaming as fast as possible, and other times we really get into discussions about what pile to pick.

What's important is that you're having fun playing **Magic** however you're choosing to play. We just enjoy playing when we're choosing too.

Pick 1
![](https://media.wizards.com/images/magic/daily/sf/sf164_pile01.jpg)  
While a small, evasive creature is appealing, and howling at the moon feels awesome, a piece of powerful Equipment feels good and promises pain.

Pick 2

Pick 3
![](https://media.wizards.com/images/magic/daily/sf/sf164_pile03.jpg)  
I like removal spells, and I like red creatures. I like them better together. While the Vampire is a bit trickier to handle later on, [Dead Weight](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dead+Weight) would almost certainly end up being anything but.

Pick 4
![](https://media.wizards.com/images/magic/daily/sf/sf164_pile04.jpg)  
As Craig shared in his notes to me: "Woo hoo!" Craig is a big fan of blue and green, so getting [Moon Heron](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Moon+Heron) and [Prey Upon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Prey+Upon) in the pack pick is exciting for him.

Pick 5
![](https://media.wizards.com/images/magic/daily/sf/sf164_pile05.jpg)  
Picking up another red creature, black removal spell, and two tricky green spells feels awesome. [Moonmist](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Moonmist) is the universal Human-transformer, and would open up some Werewolf shenanigans if it happens. Since there are only six transforming creatures in a Winchester, and not all of them are Human, it wasn't something I was counting on completely.

Pick 6
![](https://media.wizards.com/images/magic/daily/sf/sf164_pile06.jpg)  
Craig and I discussed the options here, but we both settled on the big flying mythic rare as a fine beatstick to pick up. Craig looked further and decided that a flashback deck may work. Keeping your eyes open to possibilities is something Craig and I have definitely used to maximize how much joy a certain strategy brings!

Pick 7
![](https://media.wizards.com/images/magic/daily/sf/sf164_pile07.jpg)  
Another Werewolf, with a [Moonmist](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Moonmist) to boot, made jumping onto the Werewolf-bandwagon easier. I like it when a plan begins to fall into place!

Pick 8
![](https://media.wizards.com/images/magic/daily/sf/sf164_pile08.jpg)  
Craig looks over the piles before settling on the option of tricks and removal. Knowing that he's a fan of green means that I can count on seeing [Spidery Grasp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spidery+Grasp) in his deck later on.

Pick 9
![](https://media.wizards.com/images/magic/daily/sf/sf164_pile09.jpg)  
This pick was a bit strange for me, and I wanted the [Darkthicket Wolf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Darkthicket+Wolf), [Bramblecrush](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bramblecrush), and [Wooden Stake](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wooden+Stake), as well as [Abattoir Ghoul](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Abattoir+Ghoul). I settled for [Hollowhenge Scavenger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hollowhenge+Scavenger) and another Werewolf, but it may not have been the strongest option available. But that's part of what makes Draft exciting: the *unknown* coming ahead!

Pick 10
![](https://media.wizards.com/images/magic/daily/sf/sf164_pile10.jpg)  
Craig decided to go in on black and white together, and wanted to see if the [Memory's Journey](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Memory%27s+Journey) would float back around to him.

Pick 11
![](https://media.wizards.com/images/magic/daily/sf/sf164_pile11.jpg)  
I recall this pick as being no-contest. Sometimes, just a quick pile of playable cards sets things apart!

Pick 12
![](https://media.wizards.com/images/magic/daily/sf/sf164_pile12.jpg)  
Easy-to-cast creatures with bonus abilities—first strike and evasion—are great to keep picking up. Craig, however, felt he was still very short on creatures.

Pick 13
![](https://media.wizards.com/images/magic/daily/sf/sf164_pile13.jpg)  
While I was excited to see another Werewolf to join my pack, Craig was excited to begin predicting with accuracy what pile I would pick up. Even with three colors in play for both of our decks, narrowing do what your opponent is after can help you gain more of the things you want or take something powerful your opponent will grab.

Pick 14
![](https://media.wizards.com/images/magic/daily/sf/sf164_pile14.jpg)  
Milling and more removal are two things Craig doesn't mind having more of that this point.

Pick 15
![](https://media.wizards.com/images/magic/daily/sf/sf164_pile15.jpg)  
This was a tough choice for me as I knew how awesome (and flavorful) [Manor Gargoyle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Manor+Gargoyle) is, but a more aggressive creature, combat trick, and mana fixing all looked promising as well. (This pick turned out fairly uninteresting, as the Gargoyle never came up in games!)

Pick 16
![](https://media.wizards.com/images/magic/daily/sf/sf164_pile16.jpg)  
There is no hesitation from Craig as he scoops up the pile with the second mythic rare of the draft. Sweet.

Pick 17
![](https://media.wizards.com/images/magic/daily/sf/sf164_pile17.jpg)  
I wanted another creature, and I liked the trample-biting [Feral Ridgewolf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Feral+Ridgewolf) more than other options.

Pick 18
![](https://media.wizards.com/images/magic/daily/sf/sf164_pile18.jpg)  
Craig lights up on seeing [Burning Vengeance](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Burning+Vengeance), and it's clear that he's on a flashback-empowered plan.

Pick 19
![](https://media.wizards.com/images/magic/daily/sf/sf164_pile19.jpg)  
I wanted to try out [Inquisitor's Flail](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inquisitor%27s+Flail) in a deck, and this one came attached to big creatures that I might want to play anyway. Hurray!

Pick 20
![](https://media.wizards.com/images/magic/daily/sf/sf164_pile20.jpg)  
I was holding my breath when the final creatures with transform landed in the same pile together. With two copies of [Moonmist](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Moonmist) I was sure to play one. Fortunately for me, Craig grabbed more milling and a [Boneyard Wurm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Boneyard+Wurm) to work with it.

The Last Picks
![](https://media.wizards.com/images/magic/daily/sf/sf164_pile21.jpg)  
Craig is surprised by my choice and, in hindsight, I am too. Two on-color removal spells alongside a recursion spell could have sold me. Instead Craig got that pile and I got peace of mind playing [Moonmist](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Moonmist).

Summary
![](https://media.wizards.com/images/magic/daily/sf/sf164_land.jpg)  
Drafting is always an interesting experience, and playing with the latest set always makes it trickier. My three-color deck's mana would be a little shakier than usual, but I've gotten use to strange mana in Winchester.

Craig was a little less happy with his deck, and after working the colors over a few times he settled into a deck without [Plains](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plains). I found that very curious, but the shrug and grin from Craig told me that something was definitely up.

Now, [back to the other action](/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/sf/164#1)!
