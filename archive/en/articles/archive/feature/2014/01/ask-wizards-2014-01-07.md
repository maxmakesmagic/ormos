**Q: : I was checking out the art on the [Moxes for Magic Online](http://www.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/arcana/1387) and noticed they are all placed in different planes. [Mox Sapphire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mox+Sapphire) and Zendikar were easy enough to recognize and the [Mox Pearl](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mox+Pearl) looked like it was on Ravnica. What are the other locations? â€”Adam D.** 


**A: Mike McArtor, copy editor, DailyMTG:** 


A keen eye, Adam! Your question gave me an excuse to delve into our Multiverse database (always a joy, let me tell you!) to fully answer it. Here is the relevant part of each art description handed off to [Volkan Baga](http://gatherer.wizards.com/pages/search/default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&artist=%5B%22volkan+baga%22%5D):


### [Mox Pearl](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mox+Pearl):


...an iconic artifact of good, re-imagined to fit in the Ravnica setting.

### [Mox Sapphire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mox+Sapphire):


...please imply that it's set on Zendikar.

### [Mox Jet](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mox+Jet):


...an iconic artifact of evil, re-imagined to fit in the *Time Spiral* setting.

### [Mox Ruby](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mox+Ruby):


...an iconic artifact of passion and power, re-imagined to fit in the *Lorwyn* setting.

### [Mox Emerald](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mox+Emerald):


...set in Naya, the shard of Alara...
