| "Farmville" | 2 |
| BUG Control | 2 |

| UR Delver | 2 |


BUG Delver leads the way, and that's not the only [Delver](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Delver) deck out there. Including the Blue-White-Red Stoneblade/Delver hybrid as well as RUG Delver and Blue-Red Delver, they account for almost a quarter of the field. Similarly, the various versions of Stoneblade make up more than 16% of the metagame. Miracles, though in second place in the above table, can claim only half of that.
