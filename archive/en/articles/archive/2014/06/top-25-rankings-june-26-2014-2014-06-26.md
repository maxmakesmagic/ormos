The clock continues to tick down toward Pro Tour *Magic 2015*, and there are now only four Grand Prix standing between here and the grand finale to the season. Talking of standing, let's take a look at the latest moves in the *Magic* Top 25 Pro Rankings. [Grand Prix Chicago](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/gpchi14) made for plenty of churn in our list, with Chicago Top 8 man Jared Boettcher the big winner, climbing seven places to No. 15. It's hard to say that he's *actually* certain to be Rookie of the Year, but it will take a mighty effort for anyone to catch him. In any case, his incredibly impressive season continued in Chicago, a season measured by the fact that Hall of Famer Ben Stark and World Champion Shahar Shenhar are the next two in the rankings firing line for the rookie.


Other positive shifts in Chicago came for Yuuya Watanabe (up two to No. 11) and Jacob Wilson (up one, and into the Top 20), plus Nam Sung Wook continued his climb up the rankings, spurred by his standout performance at  [Pro Tour *Journey into Nyx*](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/ptjou14). He enters at No. 24, meaning Brazil's Willy Edel falls out of our best of the best table.


At the head of affairs, Reid Duke maintains the lead he created at the Pro Tour in Atlanta, with Jérémy Dezani of France his only close rival, currently. For the chasing pack, a Grand Prix win this weekend would do wonders for their Player of the Year chances, and there are two chances to do so. In Europe, it's the turn of Italy to host *Theros* Block Limited action in Milan, while the same format sees action in North America at Grand Prix Washington D.C.


Join us next week, as the countdown to Pro Tour *Magic 2015* continues, here on the *Magic* Top 25 Pro Rankings.
