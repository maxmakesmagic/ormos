As you might expect, there will be tokens in *Mirrodin Besieged*. And sure enough, token cards will appear in packs. Well, some packs, anyway. The ones that don't have Rules Tip cards. Look, the point is that if you open a *Mirrodin Besieged* pack, you could be faced with this happy little face:

Okay, so what does that tell us about the set? Presumably that there are Thopters in it. Or at any rate, Thopter *creators*. Let's see the next one!

Ah! This is a fascinating specimen. Incapable of surviving on its own, the Germ token is normally seen in the company of a [living weapon](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/tcg/article.aspx?x=mtg/tcg/mirrodinbesieged/mechanics#3) equipment. Next!

Yikes! This thing is scary! Well, maybe not if you just saw it on its own like this. But it's ordinarily seen right after a Phyrexian Rebirth has cleansed the battlefield of impurities. By which we mean "creatures."

Phyrexian Rebirth appeared on the [*Mirrodin Besieged* Visual Spoiler](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/tcg/article.aspx?x=mtg/tcg/mirrodinbesieged/spoiler) today. That thing is *full* of fascinating cards! Anyway, let's move on.

Right. Sure. A 2/2 Zombie. That makes sense. But surely we have a token sitting around that could let us close with a sense of mystery and anticipation? Something to suggest an unknown card?

That'll do nicely.
