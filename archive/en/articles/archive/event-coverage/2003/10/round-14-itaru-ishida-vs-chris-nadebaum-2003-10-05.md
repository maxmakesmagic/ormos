The winner of this match can hopefully make top 8, the loser will be hoping for a top 16. Itaru is playing a mostly mono black deck with some red in it. He managed to get himself a 6th pick [Promise of Power](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Promise+of+Power) and a [Mindslaver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mindslaver).

Chris has a White/Blue deck with a lot of creatures as well as an [Isochron Scepter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Isochron+Scepter) with instants like [Raise the Alarm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Raise+the+Alarm), [Awe Strike](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Awe+Strike), [Razor Barrier](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Razor+Barrier) and [Annul](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Annul).

Chris played Itaru in the previous draft and Lost 1-2, and is now looking to even the score.

### Game 1

Chris lead off with creatures, a [Auriok Transfixer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Auriok+Transfixer) and a [Auriok Bladewarden](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Auriok+Bladewarden).

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gpsyd03/641.jpg)Itaru's first play was on turn three with a [Krark-Clan Grunt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Krark-Clan+Grunt). Itaru then played a 0/1 [Nim Shrieker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nim+Shrieker) and attacked for two. Chris could only attack, with a [Raise the Alarm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Raise+the+Alarm) and two [Razor Barriers](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Razor+Barriers) in hand.

Itaru gave the shrieker some power by playing a [Steel Wall](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Steel+Wall) and a [Cathodion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cathodion), Chris traded his [Raise the Alarm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Raise+the+Alarm) for the grunt.

Itaru had another shrieker, and played out 2 more artifacts. Chris drew nothing to deal with the one toughness flyers and went to his sideboard for game 2.

Itaru leads 1-0 

### Game 2

(Chris brought in a Nuriok Hoversail and 2 Nuriok Familiars.)

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gpsyd03/648.jpg)Chris started off aggressively and started to attack on turn 3 with his raise the alarm tokens and played out a [Soldier Replica](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soldier+Replica). Itaru played a [Wizard Replica](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wizard+Replica) which got bounced with an [AEther Spellbomb](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=AEther+Spellbomb). Itaru replayed it on his next turn. Chris played a bargain priced [Somber Hoverguard](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Somber+Hoverguard), for only 5 mana. Itaru had a [Frogmite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Frogmite) which was only two mana and a Grunt.

Itaru's next turn was a [Promise of Power](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Promise+of+Power) for a 5/5 flying Demon. Itaru attacked with it and Chis traded his [Soldier Replica](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soldier+Replica) and his Hoverguard for the Demon. 

Chris laid some creatures that looked like they would be able to get through Itaru's army, a [Goblin War Wagon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+War+Wagon) and a [Soldier Replica](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soldier+Replica). Itaru brought down the bomb of a [Mindslaver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mindslaver), using it to attack himself with everything, sacrificing the soldier to kill the wagon. Blocking the tokens to clear all of Chris's creatures and using a [Razor Barrier](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Razor+Barrier) on a land to empty Chris's hand.

Chris Shook Itaru's hand and wished him luck in the Top 8.

Itaru Ishida Defeated Chris Nadebaum 2-0
