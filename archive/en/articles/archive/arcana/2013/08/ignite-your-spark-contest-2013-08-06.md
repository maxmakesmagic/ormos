A little over a month ago we launched the [Ignite Your Spark Contest](http://www.wizards.com/magic/magazine/article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/feature/253d), which challenges fans to submit a photo of themselves auditioning to become the Planeswalker of their choice. The grand-prize winner will receive a trip to the PAX of his or her choice in 2014 and select a WPN store of his or her choice to win a pizza party. The contest isn't over yet (entries close September 5), but we have some pretty awesome submissions so far. We'd like to take a moment to share some of the great entries to help inspire you when you enter your own image.
