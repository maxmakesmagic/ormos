**What's been the best-performing card in your sideboard?**

***Cedric Philips:**  [Keranos, God of Storms](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Keranos%2C+God+of+Storms). Backbreaking against Blue-White-Red. Plus you can Chord or Pod for it.* 


![](https://media.wizards.com/2014/events/gpbos14/Jeremy_DezaniQQ.jpg)
***Jeremy Dezani:**  [Aven Mindcensor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aven+Mindcensor). Made my opponent miss on a Pod activation, then he missed twice more by forgetting about it and cracking fetchlands.* 









![](https://media.wizards.com/2014/events/gpbos14/Samuelle_EstrattiQQ.jpg)
***Samuele Estratti:**  [Squelch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Squelch). I'm playing Tron, and it's been great to protect against hate, as well as being good against [Scapeshift](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scapeshift).* 


![](https://media.wizards.com/2014/events/gpbos14/Denniz_RachidQQ.jpg)
***Denniz Rachid**: I don't think my face-up Emrakul fooled too many people, so probably [Nature's Claim](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nature%27s+Claim).* 











![](https://media.wizards.com/2014/events/gpbos14/Nathan_HolidayQQ.jpg)
***Nathan Holiday:**  [Thrun, the Last Troll](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thrun%2C+the+Last+Troll). My opponent was holding up mana with [Mana Leak](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak), [Remand](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Remand) and [Restoration Angel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Restoration+Angel)s, and Thrun just beat him.* 


![](https://media.wizards.com/2014/events/gpbos14/Guillaume_Wafo-TapaQQ.jpg)
***Guillaume Wafo-Tapa:**  Probably [Teferi, Mage of Zhalfir](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Teferi%2C+Mage+of+Zhalfir). Against blue decks he's game over.*
