Congratulations to the 16 invitees to the 9th annual **Magic** Invitational!


Set to run May 17-20 at the Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) in Los Angeles, the **Magic** Invitational will award not one but two original cards to be created by the competitors. Thanks to the more than 15,000 votes cast in the expanded balloting.


Due to conflicts with school, Masashi Oiso is unable to attend. Replacing him in the field will be Masashiro Kuroda, the second-place finisher from the APAC balloting.
