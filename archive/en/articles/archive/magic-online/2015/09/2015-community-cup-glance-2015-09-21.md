Chosen from amongst the most devoted *Magic* fans out there, the Community Team faced off against the dastardly Wizards Team in the 2015 Community Cup on September 19 and 20. Across those two days of fierce competition each team's resourcefulness and *Magic* skill were pushed to the limit in a gauntlet of *Magic* challenges.

*Magic Online* Legacy Cube Stipulation Draft
============================================


In Stipulation Draft, players are confounded by deck-building restrictions that force a style of play that the mage-in-question might not have considered before. With restrictions like "Horrible Marksman" that prohibit the drafting of cards that can target, and "Spellbound," which only allows non-creature spells, it can fundamentally alter your usual playstyle.
