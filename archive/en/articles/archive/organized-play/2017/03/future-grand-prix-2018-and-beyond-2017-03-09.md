We are excited to share with you some news about the future of Grand Prix.


As our goal is to increase the consistency and quality of the player experience at Grand Prix events globally, last year we invited various companies to submit proposals on delivering high-quality Grand Prix in various regions across the world.


The outcome of this process is that, starting in 2018, ChannelFireball Events (CFBE) will be Wizards of the Coast's exclusive global partner to run all Grand Prix. CFBE is a company newly formed by ChannelFireball and Siteline Productions. [ChannelFireball](http://store.channelfireball.com/landing) probably doesn't need much of an introduction—they have provided *Magic* content, hosted successful Grand Prix, and brought their own brand of event coverage to *Magic* streaming.


Siteline Productions, meanwhile, has been more involved in *Magic* than you might realize. They have been a long-standing partner with Wizards for producing conventions—such as PAX West—and events including the Pro Tour. If you've ever tuned into a Pro Tour and enjoyed the slick graphics, the studio setup, or the ambiance of the feature match area—that's Siteline Productions.

CFBE will be bringing their combined expertise in event production, tournament management, and promotion to be the exclusive organizer of all Grand Prix around the world.


Our goal is to make our Grand Prix Events exciting, memorable experiences for our fans around the globe while continuing to grow the program. Grand Prix are our largest gatherings for players and gamers who want to experience and enjoy *Magic* in all of its forms—from competitive players seeking to earn prizes and Pro Points and to qualify for the Pro Tour through the main event, all the way to players who come for the fun, friendship, and side events. We know CFBE can deliver on that experience for players everywhere.


We plan to post all details about 2018's Grand Prix, including a complete schedule and formats, this summer. We look forward to sharing more with you in a few months!
