This week the first sketch vote results are in along with the winner for the equipment card vs. card vote, we finish up the final round of basic land art voting, we've got a new card vs. card vote we think will raise many eyebrows, and even more. All set?


Like the Week 3 vote, this card vs. card clash wasn't close.

### Card Vote #5


Despite how it may seem to some, when putting together a set every slot is important. That said, some choices are more high-profile than others. With that in mind, we're pretty sure the one we've got planned for you this week is pretty spicy.

*Comments from Matt Place*



> 
> This week instead of arguing why the card I'm defending is better than Aaron's dumb card for Standard, I'm going to take a different perspective that may not be important to the enfranchised player but is very important for the game of **Magic** as a whole.
> 
> 
> [Kird Ape](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kird+Ape) fills a unique roll in the base set. It shows off in a simple way “multicolor”. Since we do not include gold cards in the base set it is nice to have a card that can show new players a “gold” card without actually being gold. I know that for me multicolor is one of the most exciting mechanics in **Magic**. I started playing just before *Legends* came out. My friends and I were blown away when we got our hands on the first gold cards. We traded for as many gold cards as we could get. In hindsight it should have been [Mana Drain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Drain) and [Mirror Universe](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mirror+Universe) we were collecting, but we chose to collect [Kasimir the Lone Wolf](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kasimir+the+Lone+Wolf) instead. Oops!

> 
> Back to my point, I believe multicolor can be eye-popping for the new player and an important purpose of the base set is to not only be easy for a new player to understand but also to excite them about the game. Having a “multicolor” card like [Kird Ape](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kird+Ape) can help make their introduction to **Magic** that much more fun.

*Comments from Aaron Forsythe*



> 
> Oftentimes good cards get labeled "too good" by players and by R&D because of the company they keep. It's quite difficult to extricate a card from its environment and judge it solely on its own merits, but that's exactly what we get to do when choosing cards for a Core Set. The reprinting of [Hypnotic Specter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hypnotic+Specter) in *Ninth Edition* is a great example of separating an old card from its previous environment: Hyppie was considered "too good to print," but all previous experience with the card was tainted by other cards like [Dark Ritual](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dark+Ritual) and [Hymn to Tourach](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hymn+to+Tourach). Without those cards around, Hyppie has been merely good and not a problem at all.
> 
> 
> [Mogg Fanatic](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mogg+Fanatic) is another such card. People here in R&D have called him the best one-mana creature ever, and even nominated him (pre-[Psychatog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psychatog)) as the best creature of all time. But the Fanatic always went hand-in-hand in every format it was legal with true powerhouses [Jackal Pup](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jackal+Pup) and [Cursed Scroll](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cursed+Scroll) (except when the Scroll was banned in Block Constructed); on top of that, [Fireblast](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fireblast) and [Ball Lightning](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ball+Lightning) were also legal in Standard for most of [Mogg Fanatic](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mogg+Fanatic)'s initial lifespan. How good is the Fanatic on its own, without all those other cards? Still quite good, I'd guess, but nowhere near unprintable. Don't hold him responsible for the sins of other more ridiculous cards. Give Fanatic a chance... [Kird Ape](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kird+Ape) already had his!

For this one, it was "Sketch A" by Mike Sutfin that took the honors in what turned out to be a very close vote.
