**Have your initial impressions of Theros Sealed changed since the set was released, or have they remained the same?**

No. 25 Ranked Player Jon Stern —  *“The biggest thing that has changed is that I value the bounce spells a lot higher. I don't like the aggressive cards in this format.”*

Grand Prix Portland Finalist Joe Demestrio —  *“I didn't realize how important it was to fight a big monster. You need to have spot removal.”*

Two-Time Grand Prix Champion Seth Manfield —  *“What I thought at the start of the format was basically the same. It's just that I've learned more about how the one and two mana creatures just don't impact the board much in Sealed. I still think green is the best color in Sealed.”*

No. 12 Ranked Player Owen Turtenwald —  *“I actually thought it was quite fast, but it's the opposite. It's a slow format, and monstrosity is the best mechanic.”*

No. 12 Ranked Player Alexander Hayne —  *“Not too much, no. I initially thought the format was about big creatures, and it's still about big creatures.”*

No. 3 Ranked Player Reid Duke —  *“I've been impressed by how diverse the format can be. There's such a wide range of ways the games can play out; they can be long or short, grindy or explosive. Whatever my initial impression was on the format was proven to be too narrow.*
