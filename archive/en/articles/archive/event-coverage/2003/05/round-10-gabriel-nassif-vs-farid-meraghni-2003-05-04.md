With three rounds of swiss left these two Pro Tour fixtures have to go 2-1 to make the top eight, or perhaps even a win and two draws. The matchup should certainly favor Farid's [Opposition](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Opposition) deck over Gabriel's Tog deck.

### Game 1

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/natfra03/a939.jpg)Both players had to take a mulligan, but Farid's six card draw was rather good in any case. He summoned a first turn Bird of Paradise, then put [Squirrel Nest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Squirrel+Nest)s on [Forest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest)s on both turns two and three. Gabriel [Smother](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Smother)ed the Bird and played a [Psychatog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psychatog).

He then Cabal Therapied away a [Counterspell](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterspell) and a [Cunning Wish](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cunning+Wish). With two [Squirrel Nest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Squirrel+Nest)s he was able to build an offensive force and chump-block the Tog each turn. Gabriel drew a handful of countermagic, and nothing that could deal with [Squirrel Nest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Squirrel+Nest). Farid had also [Quiet Speculation](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Quiet+Speculation)ed for more Cabal Therapies, and flashed them back with [Squirrel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Squirrel)s.

In a way the [Cabal Therapy](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cabal+Therapy) actually helped Gabriel, as it meant that there weren't enough squirrels to kill him before he got nine lands in play. Gabriel would actually have won with an [Upheaval](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Upheaval), but he couldn't find on in time even with the [Compulsion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Compulsion). Farid repeatedly cast [Cabal Therapy](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cabal+Therapy) for irrelevant cards, but Gabriel wasn't able to take advantage.

### Game 2

Once again Farid sideboarded oddly. He again took out one of his Cabal Therapies, and all of his [Opposition](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Opposition)s. The general consensus after the match was that Therapy was much better than the [Envelop](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Envelop) he had brought in.

Gabriel played [Compulsion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Compulsion) on turn 2 and [Duress](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress)ed Farid's [Squirrel Nest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Squirrel+Nest) on his third turn. He tapped out for [Concentrate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Concentrate) which gave Farid chance to drop [Phantom Centaur](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phantom+Centaur). Meraghni also Cabal Therapied Gabriel for [Innocent Blood](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Innocent+Blood), but this missed as Nassif only had more card drawing.

![Zombie Infestation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Zombie+Infestation)Nassif played a second [Concentrate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Concentrate) and [Zombie Infestation](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Zombie+Infestation), which wasn't the most useful card in the situation. His next draw step was much more helpful – [Hibernation](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hibernation). This gave him enough time to build up to seven lands, at which point he cast [Upheaval](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Upheaval) and [Zombie Infestation](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Zombie+Infestation), then discarded six cards to make three 2/2 Zombies. Farid asked if he had any [Counterspell](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterspell)s and conceded when he was shown two [Circular Logic](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Circular+Logic)s.Farid Meraghni 1 – Gabriel Nassif 1

### Game 3

Farid wisely decided to take out his [Smother](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Smother)s and bring [Opposition](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Opposition) back in for the deciding game.

Gabriel played a [Duress](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress) on turn one, showing that Farid had two [Squirrel Nest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Squirrel+Nest). With only a [Swamp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swamp) in play, this meant that he would only be able to counter the second Nest with a [Force Spike](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Force+Spike). Farid made this impossible as well by drawing a Llanowar Elf.

Nassif's [Psychatog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psychatog) which held off Farid's attacks for a while. Unfortunately though, Gabriel was stuck with only three lands in play, as Farid built up a force of two Elephants and a bunch of [Squirrel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Squirrel)s. Desperate to find more lands as the only way out of the position was to cast [Upheaval](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Upheaval), Gabriel Compulsed during his main phase, allowing Meraghni to resolve [Opposition](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Opposition) and ending the game.

**Final Result:** Farid Meraghni 2 – Gabriel Nassif 1
