The Daily *Magic* Update is a roundup of everything *Magic* you should know on April 28, 2017. Today's Update is brought to you by *Amonkhet*! It's finally, officially, totally, and readily here and in stores near you!


What to Watch This Weekend
==========================


1. [StarCityGames.com Atlanta Open Weekend](http://www.starcitygames.com/events/290417_atlanta_fact_sheet.html) | [twitch.tv/scgtour](https://www.twitch.tv/scgtour)

A new set, a new format, a new banning—there's a lot to watch for this weekend in Atlanta as Cedric Phillips and Patrick Sullivan host a weekend of new Standard. The results of this weekend will do a lot to level-set the format ahead of the Pro Tour, so check out what people have cooked up starting at 10:30 a.m. ET/7:30 a.m. PT/12:30 p.m. UTC.


Today's Must
============


1. [Best *Amonkhet* Cards for Standard](https://www.mtggoldfish.com/articles/best-amonkhet-cards-for-standard?src=wizards) | MTGGoldfish | SaffronOlive and Chaz

*Amonkhet* releases today! Like, you can go pick some up, like, right now. Right now, right now. While we're celebrating [Draft Weekend](http://magic.wizards.com/en/event-types/draft-weekend), definitely keep an eye out for these cards that might spice up your next Standard deck.


After That, Read, Watch, or Listen to These
===========================================


1. Continuing Constructed Reviews

The two most comprehensive Constructed reviews continue today, as one concludes and the other is just getting revved up.


On Gathering Magic, [Ali Aintrazi wraps up his Constructed review](http://www.gatheringmagic.com/aliaintrazi-04282017-amonkhet-constructed-set-review-green-and-everything-else/) with green, artifacts, multicolor, and lands. Meanwhile, over on ChannelFireball, [Luis Scott-Vargas has moved to blue](https://www.channelfireball.com/articles/amonkhet-constructed-set-review-blue/), the color of kings and the only color in today's [Deck of the Day](#10). Foreshadowing!


1. [Anointed Procession Makes the Next Infinite Combo](http://www.toplevelpodcast.com/anointed-procession/) | Top Level Podcast | Mike Flores and Patrick Chapin

Flores and Chapin point out that [Anointed Procession](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Anointed+Procession), like my beloved [Panharmonicon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Panharmonicon), goes infinite with [Eldrazi Displacer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eldrazi+Displacer) and [Drowner of Hope](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Drowner+of+Hope). They spend some time talking about the rest of Standard, too, but I'm going to focus on them trying to replace my beloved [Panharmonicon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Panharmonicon) with something that doesn't even work with [Cloudblazer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloudblazer). And if it doesn't work with [Cloudblazer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloudblazer), then what's even the point?


1. [Felidar Guardian Banned: PV Reacts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mG09c35fDiA) | ChannelFireball | Paulo Vitor Damo da Rosa

Paulo Vitor Damo da Rosa takes us inside his head (and inside his room) and gives his usual, measured response in this short video where he weighs both sides of the [Felidar Guardian](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Felidar+Guardian) issue.


I'm going to keep today's reactions to the news to a minimum, but there are also reactions from [The Mana Source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSu1Jf-rarU) and [Strictly Better MTG](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYdC9EVQcLw) that you could check out if you're so inclined.

1. [Sperling's Sick of It: *Amonket* Video Edition](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hleFdlF6VNM) | ChannelFireball | Matt Sperling

Continuing on with the ChannelFireball-sponsored vlog content and the peeks into the living spaces of our pros, Matt Sperling has moved his popular Sick of It article to video form. If you were a fan of the article series, see how the video content stacks up.

1. [Some Initial Thoughts on Some *Amonkhet* Cards](http://www.mtgmintcard.com/articles/writers/chapman-sim/some-initial-thoughts-on-some-amonkhet-cards) | MTGMintCard | Chapman Sim

Chapman Sim has started working toward the Pro Tour, and shares his initial thoughts on a slew of *Amonkhet* cards, casting doubt on some that have been hyped and hyping some that have had doubt cast on them.


What People Are Talking About
=============================


1. > 
> Ticket booked. Team found. First draft concluded victoriously. Getting pumped. Don't call it a comeback.

> 
>  — Zvi Mowshowitz (@TheZvi) [April 28, 2017](https://twitter.com/TheZvi/status/857905276460183552)

Zvi Mowshowitz, for those who are not familiar, is a Hall of Famer and possibly one of the greatest deck builders of all time. So it's pretty awesome to see him come ba—er, return to the Pro Tour.


1. [Art and (a lot of) process for Sacred Excavation](https://imgur.com/gallery/sDOm4)

Noah Bradley is the people's artist. When a new set comes out, he's more than happy to share his art and process for new cards, often on Reddit or other social mediums. Today's edition is [Sacred Excavation](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sacred+Excavation), and he shares his extensive process on [Imgur](https://imgur.com/gallery/sDOm4) and [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/68255y/art_and_a_lot_of_process_for_sacred_excavation/).


Deck of the Day
===============


1. [Draw-Go](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/mtgo-standings/competitive-standard-constructed-league-2017-04-27)

This is not a joke. This is not a test. This is not a cheeky reference. This is a real, 5-0 Standard Competitive League deck from *Magic Online* user Nasty that is fully capable of playing the draw-go game we thought we left behind some time ago.


Thanks to the power of [Engulf the Shore](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Engulf+the+Shore) and [Torrential Gearhulk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Torrential+Gearhulk), this deck is actually capable of playing almost its entire game at instant speed. And thanks to the reintroduction of [Essence Scatter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Essence+Scatter), the deck can actually play a whopping *sixteen* counterspells—four each of [Censor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Censor), [Essence Scatter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Essence+Scatter), [Disallow](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Disallow), and the new and funky [Commit // Memory](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Commit+%2F%2F+Memory). From there, [Glimmer of Genius](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glimmer+of+Genius) and [Pull from Tomorrow](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pull+from+Tomorrow) refill the hand.


[Commit // Memory](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Commit+%2F%2F+Memory) is actually a key piece of this plan, as it's an instant-speed way to actually remove permanents from the board. It also has a powerful interaction with [Torrential Gearhulk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Torrential+Gearhulk), in that you can flash in the Gearhulk to actually play the Memory half to refill your hand full of, well, let's face it, probably more counterspells. But it also lets you keep grabbing more [Engulf the Shore](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Engulf+the+Shore), [Pull from Tomorrow](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pull+from+Tomorrow), and [Glimmer of Genius](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glimmer+of+Genius).


Also worth noting? The deck gets to play the full eight cycling lands to avoid flooding because, and this is key, they count as Islands for [Engulf the Shore](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Engulf+the+Shore).


The only sorcery-speed spells in the deck are a pair of [Confiscation Coup](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Confiscation+Coup)—aka, the deck's best way to deal with artifacts—and a single [Ulamog, the Ceaseless Hunger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ulamog%2C+the+Ceaseless+Hunger) to finish out the game should [Torrential Gearhulk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Torrential+Gearhulk) prove not to be enough.


Oh, and that sideboard? Twelve *more* counterspells, each a touch more conditional.


With this deck, the most terrifying thing you can do is say "draw," pause, play a land, look your opponent square in the eye and say "go."
