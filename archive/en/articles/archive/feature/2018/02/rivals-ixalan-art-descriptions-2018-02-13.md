Ixalan is a land of hidden wonders, dangerous wildlife, and swashbuckling adventure, and the art in the set brings this world to life on every card.


So let's take a closer look at some of that art in larger-than-card size, along with the descriptions that led to the creation of each piece.


**Dire Fleet Daredevil**

**Setting**: Ixalan  
**Color**: Red creature  
**Location**: A plaza within the golden city where a golden pedestal displays a toaster-sized glowing jade totem  
**Action**: Show a female pirate rogue swinging in on a rope/vine and grabbing the glowing totem off the pedestal (see above). This is an exhilarating moment and she's loving it.  
**Focus**: The rogue pirate  
**Mood**: Dramatic swashbuckler

**Hunt the Weak**

**Setting**: Ixalan  
**Color**: Green spell  
**Location**: A jungle-like area of the golden city  
**Action**: We're looking out from inside the mouth of a massive T-rex–like dinosaur. Through the razor-sharp teeth, we see the dinosaur's prey: a goblin pirate. The goblin is dashing away, looking back over his shoulder in terror as he desperately clutches his hat that's falling off.  
**Focus**: The goblin through the dinosaur's teeth  
**Mood**: The hunt is on!

**See Red**

**Setting**: Ixalan  
**Color**: Red spell  
**Location**: Any spot in the golden city; maybe a brightly-lit treasure chamber  
**Action**: This is a malady that inflicts someone who steals a cursed treasure. Show a goblin who has been cursed with the "evil eye." Maybe he's hanging upside-down, leering at us with one crazed, feral-looking, blood shot, red-irised eye. He slashes wildly at us with his sword while cradling the treasure he stole—a skull with one glowing ruby eye that matches his cursed eyeball.  
**Focus**: The rabid goblin  
**Mood**: MINE! Heeheehahaheehee MINE!
