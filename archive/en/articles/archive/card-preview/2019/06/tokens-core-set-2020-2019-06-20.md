The tokens and emblems you'll find inside *Core Set 2020* look a little different from tokens of the past—they're all full art!


If you haven't seen the cards that create these ten tokens (and two emblems), head over to the [Card Image Gallery](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/card-image-gallery/core-set-2020) and check them out for yourself.


Now, without further ado, the full-art tokens (and emblems) of *Core Set 2020*!
