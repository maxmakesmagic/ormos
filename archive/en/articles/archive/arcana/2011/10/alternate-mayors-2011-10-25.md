Alternate art provides a chance to see how different artists tackle the same subject. And in the case of [Mayor of Avabruck](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mayor+of+Avabruck) and [Howlpack Alpha](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Howlpack+Alpha), the double-faced alternate art *Innistrad* prerelease card provides that choice *twice*.


### Mayor of Avabruck



> Location: A well-furnished sitting room
> 
> 
> Action: Show a man in his 40s who is the mayor of a village. He's bent over a wooden desk in a well-furnished room with shelves of books and a roaring fire in the fireplace. Behind him is a large windowâ€”at least six feet tall. The mayor is studying a hand-drawn map that is spread out on his desk. He looks pensive and thoughtful.
> 
> 
> Focus: The mayor 
> 
> 
> Mood: This map is the key to a problem I must solve!

### Howlpack Alpha



> 
> Color: Green creature
> 
> 
> Location: The same room as on the Mayor of Avabruck.
> 
> 
> Action: Show a werewolf crashing through a large window. This is the "mayor" from Mayor of Avabruck transformed into a werewolf. The camera is outside looking at the werewolf as it leaps through the window, the glass shattering all around him as he crashes into the night. If possible, show the full moon in the sky. 
> 
> 
> Focus: The werewolf
> 
> 
> Mood: I hear the howls of my pack!

Now, the next question is obvious: what would the card look like if we flip-flopped the faces, so Ryan Pancoast's [Mayor of Avabruck](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mayor+of+Avabruck) had Svetlin Velinov's [Howlpack Alpha](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Howlpack+Alpha)? Well, thanks to the magic of technology, we can create a compelling simulation. Observe!
