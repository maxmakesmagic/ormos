| *Cool combo or forbidden cheese?* |

It is an inevitable part of every **Magic** player’s evolution.


The novice sees the veteran play a [Circle of Protection: Black](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Circle+of+Protection%3A+Black), and chuckles since he’s playing with (quite green) squirrels. Then the novice sees the veteran play a [Disciple of Grace](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Disciple+of+Grace), and wonders why this guy is so bent on stopping black opponents.


Then the novice sees the veteran drop a [Pestilence](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pestilence), and the picture slides into focus. Cards that seemed situational and/or marginal now look more playable; the newer player’s universe expands. Neurons fire, mysteries are laid bare, the ultimate meaning of life reaches up and gently whispers itself in the novice’s ear. (All this after he dies that game, of course.)


From that point on, the player swears never to let a situational card go completely unexplored. He looks up articles that talk about “breaking symmetry” and “forging combos.” He mimics some, bends others, discovers still others on his own: [Darkest Hour](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Darkest+Hour) and [Absolute Grace](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Absolute+Grace); [Sway of Illusion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sway+of+Illusion) and [Wash Out](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wash+Out); [Blanket of Night](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blanket+of+Night) and [Angry Mob](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Angry+Mob). The creativity ebbs and flows. Sometimes the pairings are cheesy ([Circle of Protection: Red](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Circle+of+Protection%3A+Red) with [Acidic Soil](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Acidic+Soil)); sometimes they are clever and intricate ([Squallmonger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Squallmonger) and/or [Overabundance](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Overabundance) with [Sphere of Duty](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sphere+of+Duty)). In any case, the evolution has begun, and the player is better for it.


That evolution depends a great deal on cards that focus on colors. That's not always the case – the same deck that uses [Squallmonger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Squallmonger) and [Overabundance](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Overabundance) can get by just as well on [Urza's Armor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Urza%27s+Armor) – but in the end, color is too prominent a feature of **Magic**. We have to abuse it, at some point.


With black making a stronger appearance than ever in *Torment*, it would seem to be the season to pay attention to color, and little else. Everyone plays black…and so then everyone who wants to beat black finds their [Whirling Dervish](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Whirling+Dervish)es…and if green then gets too good, everyone dusts off their [Cerulean Wyvern](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cerulean+Wyvern)s (okay, perhaps not *everyone*, but I kinda like the way she navigates [Hurricane](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hurricane)s!)…and then after that, everyone starts looking up how many copies of [Parch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Parch) they kept from *Urza's* block days.


These tiny metagame touches look nice. But what happens when someone drops the pliers and brings a sledgehammer?


### THE HOSER OF THE PARTY


I’m not a careful tracker of card prices, but I’m betting that the price of [Karma](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Karma) is going up slightly in most stores. If *Judgment* were to end up being, say, the “red set,” how long before the casual crowd starts racing for beat-up copies of [Conversion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Conversion)?


The problem with these cards – and I would drop [Dystopia](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dystopia), [Anarchy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Anarchy), and a dozen or so more into the same pot – is that they hit too randomly, and too hard, in multiplayer games. **Magic** is already a game of chance, and there are multiple dimensions a careful deckbuilder has to consider:


* do I have a fairly decent Plan A to win?
* do I have a Plan B in case that doesn’t work?
* is my mana reasonable, in color and amount?
* what do I do about enchantments, or artifacts?
* what do I do about countermagic, or spot removal?
* what do I do about board sweeping effects?

What major color hosers do is add yet another question: “What do I do if someone’s playing [Boil](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Boil)?” Well, essentially, you just roll over and die. Or you can put in a whole new bunch of cards to deal with that problem, and stretch your deck to the point where it’s not distinctive, or particularly fun to play – it’s just a bunch of answers against problems that may or may not be there.


Whether people articulate this reason like this or not, the fact is that most groups hate color hosers. In the group I play with, they are not officially banned (for reasons I’ll explore below) – but like combinations that “go off” for an indescribably high amount of mana, they are frowned upon. I recommend any group do the same; gentle but firm disapproval by peers is typically sufficient to get the job done.


Of course, once you’ve set the rule down straight…it’s time to break it.


### TIMES AND PLACES FOR THE HOSE-DOWN


It’s a shame to have so many incredibly effective cards, and no way to play them at all. Here are some suggestions for ways to get around your group’s (and, I hope, your own) dislike of color hosers. The common element of all of these suggestions? Disabling the “randomness” of the hoser.


**Suggestion #1: A Color War Format.** This is the most obvious example of how to let loose with the [Pyroblast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyroblast)s and [Hydroblast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hydroblast)s. Get a group of five people, have each choose a color in advance, allow only cards of that color in each deck, sit like the dots are sitting on the back of a Magic card, and go for it. Assign points for killing off enemy colors, or just go chaos-crazy.


Expect white to do very, very well in this format. It has a natural advantage since all pro-white creatures can still be destroyed with a [Wrath of God](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wrath+of+God); and it can disenchant opposing hosers while its enemies (red and black) have no way to stop, say, [Light of Day](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Light+of+Day).


You can also set up a six-pointed star, throwing in artifacts. Face white opposite black, red opposite blue, and green opposite artifacts. That’s about as balanced as you can make it; though white still has its natural advantage. (If you face red opposite white to get the benefit of [Anarchy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Anarchy), and want to keep enemies polar, you have to position either blue or black against artifacts. One is a natural ally; the other has absolutely no artifact removal.)


**Suggestion #2: Modest Aggression.** A great deal can be done in a “protection” deck without resorting to the big bombs. If the protection is spread out over more than one color, it’s harder for your opponents to feel like they stumbled into an unwinnable situation. A deck with [Llanowar Knight](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Llanowar+Knight), for example, can end its mana curve with a [Sabertooth Nishoba](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sabertooth+Nishoba).


No one can begrudge the efficiency of a [Paladin en-Vec](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Paladin+en-Vec) or [Yavimaya Barbarian](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Yavimaya+Barbarian). And [Voice of All](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Voice+of+All), far from being an “unfair” hoser, requires a great deal of strategy to call correctly. Don’t let this article put you off from assembling a well-equipped army. (A fairly crude but rather reliable rule of thumb will have you allowing just about any creature, but thinking twice about non-creature cards.)


**Suggestion #3: Symmetric Shenanigans.** Work hard to make the color-bound rule apply to everyone, and you’re bound to get an interesting effect. The classic example here is [Light of Day](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Light+of+Day) and [Darkest Hour](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Darkest+Hour), to kibosh the combat phase. You can’t attack, they can’t attack, no one can attack. That’s fair, right?


Then you win the day by doing something creative – using a [Tidal Visionary](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tidal+Visionary) to make one of your creatures white, or finding an alternate path such as milling or burning. The guy playing black doesn’t feel cheated when he loses, since everyone had to operate under the same rules. (That is to say, *your* rules.)


**Suggestion #4: Self-Battering.** This is really a variant of the last suggestion, since you’re starting off in the very color that you’re targeting, and must do something to save yourself. [Last week](/en/articles/archive/serious-fun/rules-engagement-2002-02-12), I talked about the Tribes format and how [Llawan, Cephalid Empress](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Llawan%2C+Cephalid+Empress) may not be allowed under some color-hoser rules. I let her cross the line, since she’s blue and designed to hose blue decks.


Beyond blue color-changing spells, though, where can you really take this? Well, if an [Anarchy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Anarchy) that you cast puts a bunch of your white creatures into the graveyard, and you have a [Pandemonium](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pandemonium) and a [Lifeline](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lifeline) in play, that can be a path to victory in itself. (Ideally, you’d think to have an [Ivory Mask](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ivory+Mask) out, as well.)


You may have noticed that this option, like a couple of the others, takes a lot of different cards working together, in often fragile combinations. In essence, when you play color hosers respectfully, you give up some of your deck’s own efficiency and sturdiness to maintain harmony in your play group.


Is that an acceptable trade? I, for one, do not think so. That’s why I tend to avoid them altogether.


### FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION: SLIMMER HOSE




|  |
| --- |
| *Hurt the opponents without hurting their feelings.* |

The path I try to take more often is a different kind of hoser: the strategy hoser. Each color depends on one or more mechanics. If you attack the color, any color with a similar mechanic slips under your radar. But attack the mechanic, and you can cross over multiple colors.


[Aegis of Honor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aegis+of+Honor) is a good example. It is not a Circle of Protection. But it functions a great deal like one against instants and sorceries. In addition to all of the red damage it can deflect, it can also stop [Drain Life](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Drain+Life), [Hurricane](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hurricane), and (stretching for blue here) [Mind Bomb](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mind+Bomb). It is a non-creature damage dam, and no color may pass… and no bias is shown.


Want another good example? [Equal Treatment](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Equal+Treatment), just released in *Torment*. This card is the ultimate in anti-[Overrun](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Overrun) tech. It’s just a horrible thing to have happen to stompy decks, an Insta-Matic Stairmaster for fat green. But of course, it also works against [Urza's Rage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Urza%27s+Rage), [Death Grasp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Death+Grasp), and an army of pumped-out slivers.


Beyond white, there are endless cards – [Ensnaring Bridge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ensnaring+Bridge), [Furnace of Rath](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Furnace+of+Rath), [Misdirection](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Misdirection), [Aether Flash](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aether+Flash), all of the madness cards – that do an excellent job of countering a specific color’s strategy in multiplayer (respectively: green fat, blue slowdown, red burn, white weenie, and black discard), but stop so much more besides. (Again, respectively: combat, stalling, targeting, small creatures, and [Gurzigost](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gurzigost)s that don’t respect the thrilling synergy of [Acceptable Losses](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Acceptable+Losses) and [Fiery Temper](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fiery+Temper)).


These are the hosers I recommend to you. They are efficient; they are effective; and they are guaranteed to stifle dying opponents’ claims of “color-tainted” wins.


Down below, for readers’ amusement: a deck that uses [Furnace of Rath](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Furnace+of+Rath) and absolutely no red burn at all. (I considered [Captain's Maneuver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Captain%27s+Maneuver), but any red damage at all felt like breaking the rules.) There are plenty of hosers in this deck; but none are exclusive to white’s traditional enemies, black and red. In fact, I probably gave too much attention to green; but that’s the color I’m facing most nowadays. The point of this deck is to show how much space you can give yourself, while still targeting colors that seem to be dominant in your group. Other ideas of “subtle hosers,” or other impressions on this topic, are welcome at seriousfun@wizards.com; this issue may be worth revisiting down the road.
