When you first looked at *Dragon's Maze*'s [Thrashing Mossdog](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thrashing+Mossdog) you might have just seen some gruesome Golgari pet. But if you look at the art closer you might realize this isn't just a household pet - even for the Golgari.


Color: Green creature (Golgari guild)  

Location: Golgari turf.  

Action: Show us a "mossdog" except this one is covered in long, snaking vines. Show it emerging from a cave mouth. The cave is actually an ancient crack that has opened up in the foundation of a massive ruined building. Vines from the back of the mossdog are reaching all around it like some kind of octopus. Perhaps one of the vines has snagged a large bird and is bringing it to its mouth to devour. Feel free to evolve the physiology of the creature but keep it recognizable as a mossdog.  

Focus: The large mossdog.

There are two other Mossdogs in **Magic**. Each mossdog comes from a different set and though they are most well known on Ravnica, the first wasn't even from this plane!
