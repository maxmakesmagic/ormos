 Are you ready for the Community Cup this weekend? Eight members of the *Magic* Community will come and battle our fearsome Wizards team across a [wide range of events](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/feature/community-cup-approacheth-2015-09-14) for fame, bragging rights, and [sweet prizes for all *Magic Online* players](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/magic-online/magic-online-announcements-september-8-2015-2015-09-08#item5) ! Be sure to tune into our [Twitch channel](http://www.twitch.tv/magic) to catch the action!




 You've [met our eight intrepid Community team reps before](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/feature/2015-community-cup-2015-08-12), but I had the privilege of sitting down and asking them a few more questions about who they are, what they do, and just how badly they plan to crush the Wizards team.



Check out their answers to many incredibly deep, poignant, and important questions below!

**Name:** Maria Bartholdi




**Favorite *Magic* card:**  [Exava, Rakdos Blood Witch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Exava%2C+Rakdos+Blood+Witch)




**Cutest *Magic* card:** [Gnarlid Pack](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gnarlid+Pack)




**Creepiest *Magic* card:** [Gainsay](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gainsay)




**How did you get started playing *Magic*?**  Meghan and I had a regular game night and someone decided to teach us *Magic.* We instantly fell in love. Then, we were like, "Let's make a podcast!" The rest is history.




**Which color(s) in *Magic* are you?** Rakdos all the way!




**If you could be any existing Planeswalker, you'd be:** Liliana. She rocks that corset *and* reanimates the dead? Yes, please.




**If you were a legendary creature, you'd be:** [Gleemax](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gleemax)




**Favorite format:** Draft




**Day job:** TV Producer




***Magic***
 **job/project:** 
[Magic the Amateuring podcast!](http://www.magictheamateuring.com/)




**What was your reaction when you were selected for the Community team?** Meghan and I looked at each other and screamed in joy for five minutes straight. That is literally what happened.




**Who are you most excited to beat on the Wizards team?** Worth Wollpert, duh.




**If you could design a *Magic* set, what would you base it around?** It would be an '80s pop band-themed set revolving around Huey Lewis & the News.




**Any last words/trash talk you wanna get in?** Wizards of the Coast? More like Wizards Who Lose the Most!

**Name:** Anthony "Wedge" D'Aconto




**Favorite *Magic* card:**  [Ixidor, Reality Sculptor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ixidor%2C+Reality+Sculptor). He created Akroma; that's awesome!




**Cutest *Magic* card:**  [Infernal Spawn of Evil](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Infernal+Spawn+of+Evil). That scarf though. Adorable.




**Creepiest *Magic* card:**  [The Fallen](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=The+Fallen). It haunts my dreams.




**How did you get started playing *Magic*?**  A friend introduced me to the game in elementary school. It was described as a card game version of chess. I always enjoy a challenge, so I began playing casually during lunch and recess when I was ten. A few years later, I started going to my local card shop. I went there every weekend for years. I grew up with that community. Never looked back.




**Which color(s) in *Magic* are you?** Azorius, easily. The guild just gets it. Blue strives for omniscience and white strives for peace. A world with no conflict where I can learn whatever I want? Sign me up. Of course, some . . . troublemakers will have to sacrifice themselves for the good of the whole. Looking at you, Gruul Clans. Take one for the team.




**If you could be any existing Planeswalker, you'd be:** [Karn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Karn+Liberated). He wants peace for all and hates conflict. It actively pains him to see anything suffer. I sympathize. I don't do conflict very well. Karn and I are pretty similar that way.




**If you were a legendary creature, you'd be:** [Angus Mackenzie](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Angus+Mackenzie)! No reason to be anyone else. Look at those horns. No-brainer.




**Favorite format:** Specifically, triple *Innistrad* Draft. In general, if I get to open packs and play with cards, I'm happy. Limited for life!




**Day job**: Full-time YouTube Content Creator




***Magic*** **job/project:** I host a *Magic* YouTube channel. We cover spoilers, tournament reviews, the lore and history of the game, and a lot more. [Check it out](https://www.youtube.com/user/TheManaSource)! If you want to exchange internet hugs with me, you can do so on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/TheManaSource). I also [stream *Magic Online* on Twitch](http://www.twitch.tv/themanasource) . It's a rip-roaring good time!




**What was your reaction when you were selected for the Community team?** Surprised. Honored. Overwhelmed. The list goes on. As I write this, it's still pretty surreal to me. I've been a diehard fan of *Magic* for most of my life. Calling it a dream would be an understatement. I had to re-read the email at least ten times before I believed it. There are no words that properly describe how I feel about being selected.




**Who are you most excited to beat on the Wizards team?** Robert Schuster. He seems like such a nice guy. I want to wipe that smile right off his face!




**If you could design a *Magic* set, what would you base it around?**  Muraganda, because dinosaurs.




**Any last words/trash talk you wanna get in?** A wise Planeswalker once said, "There is no greater folly than standing against me." That Planeswalker was Nicol Bolas, and I'm sure he was talking about this exact moment. Bring it, Wizards. BRING IT!

**Name:** Kenji "NumotTheNummy" Egashira




**Favorite *Magic* card:**  [Sliver Queen](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sliver+Queen)




**Cutest *Magic* card:** [Spore Frog](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spore+Frog)




**Creepiest *Magic* card:**  [Treacherous Urge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treacherous+Urge). Seriously, look at the art.




**How did you get started playing *Magic*?**  I was introduced by my cousin at the age of ten.




**Which color(s) in *Magic* are you?**  Boros or Rakdos—So I guess Mardu?




**If you could be any existing Planeswalker, you'd be:** Lately? Definitely Garruk. *\*flexes\**




**If you were a legendary creature, you'd be:** I mean, [Numot, the Devastator](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Numot%2C+the+Devastator), clearly.




**Favorite format:** *Invasion* block Draft!




**Day job:** Soulless servant to thousands of *Magic* players (otherwise known as a Twitch streamer)




***Magic***
 **job/project:**
[Twitch.tv/numotthenummy](http://www.twitch.tv/numotthenummy)




**What was your reaction when you were selected for the Community team?** Genuine surprise! It is an honor to be brought back to stomp on Wizards for a second time.




**Who are you most excited to beat on the Wizards team?** Worth. Always and forever, Worth. Wait, these were wedding vows, right?




**If you could design a *Magic* set, what would you base it around?**  All right, all right, hear me out. I would design a *Magic* set that took place on Dominaria. There, this random dude named Urza would be getting into mischief with an entity called Yawgmoth and then . . . oh, please just bring back *Invasion* block!




**Any last words/trash talk you wanna get in?** I suppose I didn't demoralize WotC enough the first time; now they want more?

![](https://media.wizards.com/2015/images/daily/FEAT20150812CommCup_Joel.jpg)



**Name:** Joel Isak Love Larsson




**Favorite** ***Magic*** **card**: [Teferi, Mage of Zhalfir](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Teferi%2C+Mage+of+Zhalfir). Why? It lets you play *Magic* in an enhanced way while setting your opponent back to the Stone Age. It also has flash and is a blue creature! What's not to love!?




**Cutest *Magic* card** : [Scute Mob](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scute+Mob). It looks undeniably cute at first, but oh how wrong you are if you just let it be cute unchecked.




**Creepiest *Magic* card:**  [Macabre Waltz](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Macabre+Waltz). Those guys sure know how to tango.




**How did you get started playing *Magic*?**  I started playing *Magic* back when *Saviors of Kamigawa* was released in 2005. My best friend at the time started playing and told me to begin, and I didn't need much convincing. I was hooked far quicker than I had been by any other game before!




**Which color(s) in *Magic* are you?**  Simic for sure. Evolution and intelligence at its peak!




**If you could be any existing Planeswalker, you'd be**: Jace. I feel the flow of the game while reading my opponent, thus finding the path to victory.




**If you were a legendary creature, you'd be**: [Rakdos, Lord of Riots](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rakdos%2C+Lord+of+Riots), because his hair is *literally* on fire!




**Favorite format**: One-on-One Commander with French bannings, or Draft. I passionately love them both.




**Day job**: Professional Tourist, aka full-time *Magic* Pro.




***Magic*** **job/project:** I write articles on [MTGMintCard.com](http://www.mtgmintcard.com/articles/writers/joel-larsson), and my stream will once more be reborn at [twitch.tv/joellarsson](http://www.twitch.tv/joellarsson). I'll keep you guys updated!




**What was your reaction when you were selected for the Community team?** I remember that I was in Berlin with my girlfriend, Sandra, right after Pro Tour *Magic* *Origins*. It was amazing and if you ask her, she will tell you how thrilled I was. It will be such an honor to be there as a representative of the community, and I will have lots of fun. Hopefully I won't disappoint you guys!




**Who are you most excited to beat on the Wizards team?** Probably Melissa DeTora, since I know her the best! I'm 1-0 against her so far since PAX, so I will have to maintain my streak!




**If you could design a *Magic* set, what would you base it around?** Oh, this is a very hard question. The first thing that comes to mind is going back to my Nordic roots with something from the Viking era combined with some Norse mythology—similar to what we saw on the plane of Kamigawa, but for Vikings!




**Any last words/trash talk you wanna get in?** Wizards team, you have NO idea who you've agreed to face as your opponent. Bring it!

![](https://media.wizards.com/2015/images/daily/FEAT20150812CommCup_Gabe.jpg)



**Name:** Gabe Reale




**Favorite *Magic* card:**  [Lightning Bolt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt), preferably to the dome




**Cutest *Magic* card:**  Probably [Bouncing Beebles](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bouncing+Beebles)




**Creepiest *Magic* card:**  [Bump in the Night](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bump+in+the+Night) (especially when someone mails you many, many copies of it)




**How did you get started playing *Magic*?**  My cousin introduced me to the game. I was six and he was thirteen, and I obviously thought he was the coolest person ever (still do). *Visions* had just been released, and I saw his cards so I asked if he would teach me.




**Which color(s) in *Magic* are you?**  Red, Boros, or Mardu—four colors is unreasonable.




**If you could be any existing Planeswalker, you'd be:** [Sorin, Solemn Visitor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sorin%2C+Solemn+Visitor). I'm frequently compared to a vampire, both in stream schedule and complexion. The Bat tokens are just a plus (well, I guess a minus, technically).




**If you were a legendary creature, you'd be:** [Gabriel Angelfire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gabriel+Angelfire) is my player card in Brooklyn, so I guess him. Summon Legend indeed—just look at that facial expression.




**Favorite format:** Draft, specifically *Lorwyn*/*Lorwyn*/*Morningtide* Draft




**Day job:** Law school student




***Magic*** **job/project:** I stream Limited (and some Constructed) in the wee hours of US East Coast time. If you're up at 11:30 p.m.–3 a.m. Eastern, you can find me at [twitch.tv/SGDoc](http://twitch.tv/SGDoc). I tweet [@MtgoDoc](http://www.twitter.com/MtgoDoc) when I'm about to go live.




**What was your reaction when you were selected for the Community team?** I was stoked, to say the least. I've been trying to provide the community with quality content through my stream, but now I get a concrete opportunity to bring home a win and a bunch of sweet lands for people on *Magic Online*.




**Who are you most excited to beat on the Wizards team?** Worth and Turian and Melissa. They're the spikiest players on this year's team, from what I understand.




**If you could design a *Magic* set, what would you base it around?** A celestial rift where color identities would change constantly. Break the pie. Smash the state. Save the universe. (Please, guys, I want a red counterspell—no, not Izzet. RED.)




**Any last words/trash talk you wanna get in?** Is there a mercy rule? Like if we're up by more than 80 points, does the Wizards team still have to play? I want to maximize the embarrassment.

![](https://media.wizards.com/2015/images/daily/FEAT2015917CommCup_Meghan.jpg)



**Name:** Meghan Wolff




**Favorite *Magic* card:**  [Treasure Cruise](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treasure+Cruise). Thank you, WotC, for giving me the opportunity to know what it's like to cast [Ancestral Recall](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ancestral+Recall).




**Cutest *Magic* card:** [Gnarlid Pack](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gnarlid+Pack)




**Creepiest *Magic* card:** Transgress the Mind




![](https://media.wizards.com/2015/bfz_8asdifk2Sk2cs/en_a1pUnBAQA5.png)



**How did you get started playing *Magic*?** A friend suggested playing it during a game night. A few weeks later, we were playing *Magic* during a Thanksgiving potluck and starting a podcast, so there you have it.




**Which color(s) in *Magic* are you?** Just straight blue. Blue! It goes great with every color! That's also how I decide what to wear in the morning.




**If you could be any existing Planeswalker, you'd be:** Chandra. I'm not saying I'm an arsonist, I'm just saying that if emotions could set things on fire I wouldn't have a place to live.




**If you were a legendary creature, you'd be:** Eh, any decent Sphinx.




**Favorite format:** Draft




**Day job:** Publicity Coordinator for a children's book publisher




***Magic* job/project:** [Magic the Amateuring](http://www.magictheamateuring.com/) and writing stuff (such as [here](http://www.starcitygames.com/article/31023_Women-In-Magic-the-Gathering.html) and [here](http://www.themeadery.org/articles/mtgo-and-tiers-of-responsibility/))!

**Who are you most excited to beat on the Wizards team?** Worth.




**If you could design a *Magic* set, what would you base it around?** Waffle tribal

![](https://media.wizards.com/2015/images/daily/FEAT20150812CommCup_Jimmy.jpg)



**Name:** Jimmy Wong




**Favorite *Magic* Card** : [Greater Gargadon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Greater+Gargadon)




**Cutest *Magic* Card** : [Dragon Whelp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragon+Whelp)




**Creepiest *Magic* Card** : [Ad Nauseam](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ad+Nauseam)




**How did you get started playing *Magic*?**  I was introduced to *Magic* in second grade by some classmates who were playing on the pavement outside of my school. The first deck I built consisted of basic Mountains, [Lightning Bolt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt)s, [Incinerate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Incinerate)s, and [Fireball](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fireball)s. You might say a love for red was born that day.




**Which color(s) are you in *Magic*?** I'm torn between Grixis and Temur. I'm definitely Izzet. Whether the third color is black or green probably depends on which day of the week it is.




**If you were an existing planeswalker, you'd be most like**: [Ral Zarek](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ral+Zarek)




**If you were a legendary creature, you'd be**: Is [Snapcaster Mage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snapcaster+Mage) a legendary creature? Really!? Okay, fine. I'm [Norin the Wary](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Norin+the+Wary).




**Favorite format**: Commander, followed closely by Limited




**Day Job**: Actor, musician, and online content creator




**Magic job/project**: The Command Zone podcast, your weekly source for all things Commander. Hosts Josh Lee Kwai ([@JoshLeeKwai](http://www.twitter.com/joshleekwai)) and Jimmy ([@jfwong](http://www.twitter.com/jfwong)) bring you all aspects of gameplay and strategy from table politics, budget builds, deck doctoring, building, and more! You can find us at [our website](http://www.rocketjump.com/TheCommandZone) and on Twitter [@commandcast](http://www.twitter.com/commandcast).




**What was your reaction when you were selected for the Community team?** Stunned and honored. I am so incredibly grateful and excited to represent the community, in more ways than one!




**Who are you most excited to beat on the Wizards team?** I met Melissa DeTora at PAX, and I guess the Wizards team motto is "no class whatsoever" this year (I kid!). The trash talk was real. I'm looking forward to crushing some former Pro Tour competitors with janky combos this weekend. Honorary shout-out to Worth Wollpert himself. We've never met, but I still find myself irrationally blaming him anytime something doesn't go my way. I can't help it!




**If you could design a *Magic* set, what would you base it around?**  My dreams already came true with *Theros* block, but I'd love to see another block/set that entirely deals with the idea of the Underworld and afterlife. What happens when our planeswalkers and creatures pass on from this life to the next? How does each color play into it?




**Any last words/trash talk you wanna get in?** Look, trash talking aside, we all know that the community isn't going to be drowning in sorrow anytime soon. I'm looking forward to a great weekend with inevitable results.

 Join us this weekend on Twitch as we witness the epic showdown between the Community and Wizards teams! Will the Community team triumph and secure eternal bragging rights, along with some sweet full-art basic lands for all *Magic Online* players? Or will the Wizards team prevail and dish out some [Drown in Sorrow](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Drown+in+Sorrow)s? Will Joel Larsson's hair remain as impeccable as always?
