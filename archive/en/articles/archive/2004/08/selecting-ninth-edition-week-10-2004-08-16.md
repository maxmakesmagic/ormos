Welcome to the 10th week of [Selecting Ninth Edition](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/selecting9e/home)! Last week's card vs. card vote was one of the closest this year. (The other two hotly contested votes so far were [Blinding Angel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blinding+Angel) vs. [Dawn Elemental](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dawn+Elemental) and [Yawgmoth Demon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Yawgmoth+Demon) vs. [Havoc Demon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Havoc+Demon).) So which rare red card will you be recurring from your graveyards come 2005?

### Card Vote #10


This week's card vs. card vote is the duel of the discard spells. Blackmail costs one less mana but gives the opponent some more say in what you see, if they have more than three cards that is. Addle removes any say from the opponent but places a decision with you instead: which color to name? Choose correctly and you're in business. Choose wrong and you just overpaid for a bad Glasses of Urza effect.


Neither card has made it to the core set so far, so it's up to you which one gets that first show at fame and glory!
