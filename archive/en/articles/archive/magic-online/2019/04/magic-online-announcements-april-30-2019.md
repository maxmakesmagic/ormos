Build Notes
-----------


General | Spectating a game when a player casts a planeswalker no longer causes the game to reset.


General | The "London Mulligan" has been turned off. We have now returned to the "Vancouver Mulligan," that is, shuffle your hand back into your library, draw a hand of one less card, keep or repeat until no player takes a mulligan, then, beginning with the starting player and proceeding in turn order, any player whose opening hand has fewer cards than their starting hand size may scry 1.


General | The proliferate prompt box text has been corrected to mention that it will add a counter of every type.


Standard | [Hatchery Spider](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hatchery+Spider) now correctly hatches green permanents from your library again.
