With *Scars of Mirrodin*, there is finally a zero-cost 1/1 in **Magic**. And it's been a long time coming. Come with us now as we take a look at the rich history of ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20210707095534im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless0.gif)!

There are also cards [Shifting Wall](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shifting+Wall) and [Phyrexian Marauder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phyrexian+Marauder), which could technically cost zero mana but go straight to the graveyard. They don't count. And neither do creatures with alternate ways of getting onto the battlefield, like [Allosaurus Rider](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Allosaurus+Rider) or [Spirit of the Night](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spirit+of+the+Night). Or [Cheatyface](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cheatyface). Looks, let's just do this, okay? Any creatures that aren't here were skipped on purpose.

### *Antiquities*

The first free creature was the humble [Ornithopter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ornithopter), which made its appearance in 1994's *Antiquities*:

![Ornithopter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=ornithopter)  
[Ornithopter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ornithopter) went through a number of different looks, but we [already covered that](/en/articles/archive/ornithopters-2010-05-06). The important thing today is that ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20210707095534im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless0.gif) could get you a 0/2 flyer.

### *Legends*

*Legends* introduced the first non-artifact creatures that cost zero mana. And there were three of them! In exchange for not being artifacts, they lost a point of toughness and the ability to fly. Frankly, even for ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20210707095534im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless0.gif), the Kobolds aren't a very good deal.

| Crimson Kobolds | Crookshank Kobolds |

![Kobolds of Kher Keep](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Kobolds+of+Kher+Keep)  
These days, it's unlikely that we'd print three functionally identical creatures in a single set, even if one of them did get a bonus from [Rohgahh of Kher Keep](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rohgahh+of+Kher+Keep). It's also worth noting that all the card names are plural, which means that even when you get a bunch of Kobolds in one place, they still don't add up to enough to get above zero power.

### *Alliances*

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/arcana/584_shieldsphere.jpg)[Shield Sphere](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Shield%2BSphere) | Art by [Alan Rabinowitz](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&artist=%5B%22Alan+Rabinowitz%22%5D)

![Shield Sphere](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Shield+Sphere)  
[Shield Sphere](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shield+Sphere) is larger than [Ornithopter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ornithopter), but it also exchanges the ability to fly with the inability to attack.

### *Visions*

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/arcana/584_phyrexianwalker.jpg)[Phyrexian Walker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Phyrexian%2BWalker) | Art by [Bryan Talbot](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&artist=%5B%22Bryan+Talbot%22%5D)

![Phyrexian Walker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Phyrexian+Walker)  
With [Phyrexian Walker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phyrexian+Walker), we got closer to the [Ornithopter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ornithopter) of old. Unlike [Shield Sphere](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shield+Sphere), it's able to attack. If that seems like a good idea.

### *Future Sight*

Does [Dryad Arbor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dryad+Arbor) count? It doesn't have a mana cost of ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20210707095534im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless0.gif), although it certainly costs zero mana to play. Just in case, here it is. 

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/arcana/584_dryadarbor.jpg)[Dryad Arbor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Dryad%2BArbor) | Art by [Eric Fortune](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&artist=%5B%22Eric+Fortune%22%5D)

![Dryad Arbor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Dryad+Arbor)  
Hey, it's the first time you could get a 1/1 for no mana! But it still comes with strings attached, since it takes up a land drop. Still, [Dryad Arbor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dryad+Arbor) didn't seem to break anything when it came out, so the stage was set (a few years later) for...

### *Scars of Mirrodin*

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/arcana/584_memnite.jpg)[Memnite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Memnite) | Art by [Svetlin Velinov](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&artist=%5B%22Svetlin+Velinov%22%5D)

![Memnite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Memnite)  
Hooray! [Memnite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Memnite) at last!
