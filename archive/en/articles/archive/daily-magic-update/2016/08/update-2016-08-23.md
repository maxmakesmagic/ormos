The August 23, 2016 update
==========================



 Posted in **Daily Magic Update**

Blake is the content manager for DailyMTG.com, making him the one you should email if you have thoughts on the website, good or less good (or not good). He's a longtime coverage reporter and hasn't turned down a game of Magic in any format ever. 






The Daily *Magic* Update is a roundup of everything *Magic* you should know on August 23, 2016. Today's Update is brought to you by [Extra Life, the gamer's charity event for children](#item1).


Something Good, for Goodness' Sake
==================================


1. [Extra Life](http://www.extra-life.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=donordrive.team&teamID=29451)

Just about every year, Wizards of the Coast helps raise money with Extra Life, a charity event that benefits the Children's Miracle Network. That's a lot of words to say that it's for the kids.


This year, the *Dungeons & Dragons* 24-hour stream will start on Friday, September 16. That's interesting and good and all (especially since the *Magic* team has a friendly competition with them over who raises the most money), but here, right now, today, I'm going to tell you about the *Magic* Extra Life event starting September 17 at 8 a.m. PT.


The event is a 24-hour stream that will be hosted on [twitch.tv/magic](https://www.twitch.tv/magic) for all of those 24 hours. All donations that come from this event will directly benefit the Seattle Children's Hospital.


How can you donate? Glad you asked.


During those 24 hours, we'll be running a number of events for your viewing pleasure, including:


* A *D&D Innistrad* session run by James Wyatt himself.
* A Sealed event where donations from *Magic* fans will help determine which booster packs our players open. This might even include *Kaladesh*!
* Commander. Interested members of their community will be able to visit the *Magic* team Extra Life page and make donations to dictate which Commanders our players select.
* A paper cube draft of the *Magic Online* *Legendary Cube*. Viewers will be able to donate and select a stipulation for our players.
* *Conspiracy: Take the Crown* draft. Viewers will be able to help determine who takes the crown.
* Community Constructed (see below).

For this last event we're looking for help from the Community! We'd like anyone who is interested to let us know via Facebook, Tumblr, Twitter, or Reddit what kind of fun Constructed event they want to see.


In addition to the above, we'll also be showing interviews with *Magic* celebrities. Anyone will be able to donate before the event to write in questions that they want to ask. And this is a panel worth asking questions of—Richard Garfield, Mark Rosewater, Melissa Li, Ian Duke, and Kelly Digges.


If you want to ask a question, [head here](http://www.extra-life.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=donorDrive.participant&participantID=215322) and make a donation. The suggested donation per question is $25. But we'll take most anything—we're friendly like that.


We also want to encourage anyone interested in having their playgroup or local game store create their own Extra Life team to help raise money to do so by signing up at [extra-life.org](http://www.extra-life.org/) and then associating with our team page.


We'll also be giving away a *lot* of awesome prizes to viewers and people who donate, so certainly watch for that.


All of this is happening September 17–18 on [twitch.tv/magic](http://twitch.tv/magic).


Today's Must
============


1. [The Creation of Kaya, *Magic: The Gathering*'s First Black Woman Planeswalker](https://thenerdsofcolor.org/2016/08/16/the-creation-of-kaya-magic-the-gatherings-first-black-woman-planeswalker/) | Nerds of Color | Monique Jones

Jones, the consultant who was instrumental in crafting Kaya's character, discusses the process and the work behind bringing Kaya to life.


After That, Read, Watch, or Listen to These
===========================================


1. [Announcing the "You Make the Cube" Contest](http://magic.wizards.com/en/MTGO/articles/archive/magic-online/announcing-you-make-cube-contest-2016-08-24) | Wizards of the Coast | Robert Schuster

Yes, you read that correctly—we're letting *you* create and pick the next *Magic Online* cube. True story! Read on to find out how.


1. Quiet Speculation card reviews | Chaz V

Chaz V has started cranking out reviews of individual cards from *Conspiracy: Take the Crown* in handfuls each day. He's currently running through the mythic rares. This sort of reminds me of when Wedge at The Mana Source does his manic "must talk about all the previews" eighteen videos a day sort of thing. Only in text. Start with the [article on Sanctum Prelate](http://www.quietspeculation.com/spoilers/cn2-spoiler-sanctum-prelate-m/), and branch out from there.


1. [Em-Rock-ul in Modern](http://www.channelfireball.com/articles/em-rock-ul-in-modern/) | Gathering Magic | Matt Sperling

Matt Sperling just can't quit. *Magic* or brewing. Here, he attempts to port six-mana [Emrakul, the Promised End](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Emrakul%2C+the+Promised+End)s to *Modern*. Viable? Or madness?


1. [It's a Pauper Conspiracy](http://www.gatheringmagic.com/alexullman-08232016-its-a-pauper-conspiracy/) | Gathering Magic | Alex Ullman

Will "you become the monarch" change Pauper as we know it? Are Palace Sentinels and Thorn of the Black Rose new defining cards of the Pauper metagame? Is being the monarch something that can spawn new deck archetypes? How much Pauper could a Pauper player Pauper if a Pauper player could Pauper Pauper? Where did I park my car? What is this spot? (Some of) these questions answered inside!


Community Spotlight
===================


1. [Hareruya English](http://www.hareruyamtg.com/article/en/)

Did you know Hareruya, the well-known Japanese store and pro team sponsor, has English-language content? As the team has expanded its team roster outside the APAC/Japan area, it has increased its English offerings from players like Martin Müller, Petr Sochůrek, and [Pro Tour *Eldritch Moon*](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/ptemn) Champion Lukas Blohon. Right now that content consists of one article from each of them, but certainly watch for more coming up.


What People Are Talking About
=============================

Quinn, one of our writers on DailyMTG, starts talking about Kaya and then, as you read further into the thread, goes very, very deep. Good read, though. It's meatier than many articles, done 140 characters at a time.

There's still quite a bit of a residual excitement over the *Conspiracy: Take the Crown* drafts that took place at seven game stores all around the world over the weekend. This tweet happens to also have [a video from PleasantKenobi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_9qVK7dCIY&ab_channel=PleasantKenobi) showing off some of the fun of the weekend. It's like two items in one!


Deck of the Day
===============


1. [Death's Shadow Delirium](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/mtgo-standings/competitive-modern-constructed-league-2016-08-22)

After Brad Nelson's success with [Death's Shadow](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Death%27s+Shadow) Aggro at the StarCityGames.com Invitational last weekend, I certainly expected the deck to pop up more, but I didn't expect this. Several players—not just DrJimmyLove—have added [Gnarlwood Dryad](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gnarlwood+Dryad) to their [Death's Shadow](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Death%27s+Shadow) decks as sort of extra [Wild Nacatl](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Nacatl)s. But DrJimmyLove has taken it a step further and gone full-on delirium with four copies of [Traverse the Ulvenwald](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Traverse+the+Ulvenwald) plus some clever ways to use it.


First, this deck can achieve delirium as early as the first turn, and it's not even that hard. Fetch lands, [Street Wraith](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Street+Wraith), [Gitaxian Probe](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gitaxian+Probe), and [Mishra's Bauble](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mishra%27s+Bauble) all dump into the graveyard early and often, and [Mutagenic Growth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mutagenic+Growth) and [Manamorphose](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Manamorphose) can get there for free shortly thereafter. Turning on delirium is a cinch.


So then what do you do with it in this deck? Level one is probably searching up the deck's namesake, [Death's Shadow](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Death%27s+Shadow). It's the biggest and most effective creature in the deck, and playing eight virtual copies—even if four of those copies do cost an extra mana—with [Traverse the Ulvenwald](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Traverse+the+Ulvenwald) increases the consistency of an already consistent deck.


But level two is searching up one of the two creatures with abilities that make [Death's Shadow](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Death%27s+Shadow) better. [Ghor-Clan Rampager](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ghor-Clan+Rampager) gives it trample when [Temur Battle Rage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Temur+Battle+Rage) can't be found, and [Inner-Flame Acolyte](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inner-Flame+Acolyte) can grant haste when you just can't wait a turn for [Death's Shadow](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Death%27s+Shadow) to attack. And, you'll note, both can help turn on delirium in a pinch.


The deck does give up on the [Become Immense](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Become+Immense) plan to pack in the delirium package, but delve and delirium don't exactly play well together. It's a tradeoff, to be sure, but a defensible one.
