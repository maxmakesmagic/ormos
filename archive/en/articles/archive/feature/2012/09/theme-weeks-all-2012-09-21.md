Hello from the editor's chair! It's like the captain's chair but more comfy and more prone to poor posture.


I floated the idea earlier this week that I was thinking about sharing the theme week schedule for DailyMTG.com, with the intent of allowing our awesome community to participate in the fun. Up until now, theme weeks have largely been kept secret until they hit DailyMTG.com and you read your first articles on the theme.


In truth, there isn't any real reason it has to be this way. So, with that in mind, we are going to have a bit of an experiment.


Here is the schedule for theme weeks through the end of 2012. If you write for another site, podcast, or blog, or post on forums, please feel free to take this and make use of it for your own content. Keep in mind that these are more guidelines than hard-and-fast rules for content. Even here on DailyMTG.com we run articles that don't follow the week's theme, and other sites should feel free to follow suit.


I'm really eager to see how the community takes to a coordinated theme effort, and I look forward to reading, listening, and seeing what you all come up with!
