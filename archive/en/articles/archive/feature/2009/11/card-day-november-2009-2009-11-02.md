![Steamflogger Boss](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Steamflogger+Boss)**[Steamflogger Boss](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Steamflogger+Boss)** – *Future Sight* rare. If you're like most people, you probably haven't spent much time looking at the art of [Steamflogger Boss](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Steamflogger+Boss). And that means you've missed something really cool hidden in the art! [This arcana](/en/articles/archive/rigger-xs-and-rigger-os-2007-05-03) has the scoop.
 ![Holy Day](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Holy+Day)**[Holy Day](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Holy+Day)** – *Legends* common. The *Legends* flavor text for [Holy Day](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Holy+Day) is from *Silex Scintillans*, a collection of seventeenth-century religious poems. The specific poem is "The Night," which is how it's credited in *Eighth* and *Ninth Edition*.
 ![Feast of the Unicorn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Feast+of+the+Unicorn)**[Feast of the Unicorn](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Feast+of+the+Unicorn)** – *Classic Sixth Edition* common. Doesn't "[Feast of the Unicorn](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Feast+of+the+Unicorn)" sound pleasant and tranquil? A flock of unicorns, all standing around placidly eating grass or something? Unfortunately for unicorn-lovers, this turns out to be a feast *of unicorn* instead.
 ![Windbrisk Raptor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Windbrisk+Raptor)**[Windbrisk Raptor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Windbrisk+Raptor)** – *Shadowmoor* rare. The [Windbrisk Raptor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Windbrisk+Raptor) was concepted as a roc, a giant bird that swoops down on its prey. If you look carefully, you can see a horse by one of its talons. That's a large bird!
 ![Muraganda Petroglyphs](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Muraganda+Petroglyphs)**[Muraganda Petroglyphs](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Muraganda+Petroglyphs)** – *Future Sight* rare. A petroglyph, as you are no doubt aware, is a carving or line drawing on rock, especially one made by prehistoric people. What does this tell us about the mysterious land of Muraganda? Not much, really. But we do get to see Muraganda itself in the *Planechase* card [Feeding Grounds](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Feeding+Grounds).
 ![Winds of Rath](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Winds+of+Rath)**[Winds of Rath](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Winds+of+Rath)** – *Tempest* rare. Pro Tour–Los Angeles 1998 was *Tempest* Constructed, which meant that the only "wrath effect" in the format was [Winds of Rath](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Winds+of+Rath). This goes a long way toward explaining why the key card in David Price's tournament-winning deck was [Giant Strength](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Giant+Strength)!
 ![Mirrodin's Core](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Mirrodin%27s+Core)**[Mirrodin's Core](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mirrodin%27s+Core)** – The art of [Mirrodin's Core](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mirrodin%27s+Core) shows the mycosynth core of the plane of Mirrodin. The core of Mirrodin is also depicted on other cards such as [Mycosynth Lattice](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mycosynth+Lattice), [Mycosynth Golem](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mycosynth+Golem), and the *Planechase* plane [Panopticon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Panopticon). In the storyline, the plane's core was a sight seen by very few, the hidden lair of the plane's mad warden, [Memnarch](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Memnarch).
 ![Reki, the History of Kamigawa](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Reki%2C+the+History+of+Kamigawa)**[Reki, the History of Kamigawa](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reki%2C+the+History+of+Kamigawa)** – *Saviors of Kamigawa* rare. No, his name isn't a typo. [Reki, the History of Kamigawa](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Reki%252C%2Bthe%2BHistory%2Bof%2BKamigawa) isn't a *historian* of Kamigawa—he is the History itself! The history of the kami war was tattooed on his body and transcribed after his death, implying that all of [the flavor text attributed to the "History of Kamigawa"](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&flavor=+%5B%22history+of+kamigawa%22%5D) originated in one of [Reki, the History of Kamigawa](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Reki%252C%2Bthe%2BHistory%2Bof%2BKamigawa)'s tattoos.
 ![Wildfire Emissary](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Wildfire+Emissary)**[Wildfire Emissary](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wildfire+Emissary)** – *Time Spiral* "timeshifted." It looks unassuming, but [Wildfire Emissary](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wildfire+Emissary) was a creature to be reckoned with, dodging both [Swords to Plowshares](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swords+to+Plowshares) and [Lightning Bolt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt). It even made it to the Finals of the 1997 World Championships in the hands of Janosch Kuehn. The freshly timeshifted [Wildfire Emissary](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wildfire+Emissary) appeared in [another World Championships](/en/events/coverage/mihara-dutch-crowned-world-champions) Top 8 nearly a decade later, making it to the Semifinals in Nick Lovett's red-white aggro deck.
 ![Who/What/When/Where/Why](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Who%2FWhat%2FWhen%2FWhere%2FWhy)**[Who/What/When/Where/Why](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Who%2FWhat%2FWhen%2FWhere%2FWhy)** – *Unhinged* rare. Mark Rosewater knew he'd want to do a card like this in *Unhinged*, but was momentarily stopped by the fact that a card made up of two doubly-split cards would be only four colors, while **Magic** prefers groups of five. The solution? One more level of splits!
 ![That Which Was Taken](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=That+Which+Was+Taken)**[That Which Was Taken](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=That+Which+Was+Taken)** – *Betrayers of Kamigawa* rare. [That Which Was Taken](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=That+Which+Was+Taken) represents the kami child of [O-Kagachi](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=O-Kagachi), the theft of which began the mortals' war with the kami. It's very important to the story.
 ![When Fluffy Bunnies Attack](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=When+Fluffy+Bunnies+Attack)**[When Fluffy Bunnies Attack](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=When+Fluffy+Bunnies+Attack)** – *Unhinged* common. Some cards have a clear, unambiguous link between their flavor and their mechanics. Others have a more tenuous connection. Then there are cards like [When Fluffy Bunnies Attack](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=When+Fluffy+Bunnies+Attack), where the lack of a connection is turned into a virtue!
 ![Journey to Nowhere](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Journey+to+Nowhere)**[Journey to Nowhere](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Journey+to+Nowhere)** – *Zendikar* common. If you look through the hole in the middle of the art of [Journey to Nowhere](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Journey+to+Nowhere), you can see the place that the target of the spell was presumably sent. It actually looks like a more relaxing place to live than the spooky forest in the foreground. In fact, it's kind of reminiscent of Warren Mahy's [Island](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Island) for *Lorwyn*!
 ![Yomiji, Who Bars the Way](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Yomiji%2C+Who+Bars+the+Way)**[Yomiji, Who Bars the Way](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Yomiji%2C+Who+Bars+the+Way)** – *Betrayers of Kamigawa* rare. The place that Yomiji is barring the way to is "the afterlife," or in game terms, "the graveyard". Yomiji prevents legends from dying, bringing them back to fight another day. Presumably, Yomiji can't be bothered with saving cannon fodder.
 ![Adventurers' Guildhouse](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Adventurers%27+Guildhouse)**[Adventurers' Guildhouse](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Adventurers%27+Guildhouse)** – *Legends* uncommon. One of the more obscure rules changes that came in with ***Magic** 2010* was the alteration to the meaning of "bands with other". This means that adventurers who hang out at the guildhouse are now slightly more likely to be able to get some use out of it.
 ![Land Aid '04](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Land+Aid+%2704)**[Land Aid '04](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Land+Aid+%2704)** – *Unhinged* common. The reference is to "Band Aid" (1984) and the series of "Farm Aid" benefit concerts. Whoever that is on stage is probably not an [Elvish Impersonator](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elvish+Impersonator), though, since he's not wearing one of those cool jumpsuits.
 ![Root-Kin Ally](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Root-Kin+Ally)**[Root-Kin Ally](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Root-Kin+Ally)** – *Ravnica: City of Guilds* uncommon. The only "Ally" from before *Zendikar* is the mighty [Root-Kin Ally](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Root-Kin+Ally) from *Ravnica*. As you can see, it has a fairly direct implementation of the idea that it gets bigger from having a bigger army around it.
 ![Balshan Collaborator](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Balshan+Collaborator)**[Balshan Collaborator](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Balshan+Collaborator)** – *Torment* uncommon. *Torment* was so heavily black-centric that even non-black cards joined in the fun. [Balshan Collaborator](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Balshan+Collaborator) and [Pardic Collaborator](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pardic+Collaborator) stayed blue and red respectively, but got their +1/+1 abilities from aligning with the more powerful color.
 ![Kabira Evangel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Kabira+Evangel)**[Kabira Evangel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kabira+Evangel)** – *Zendikar* rare. An "evangel" is not a kind of angel, which is why [Kabira Evangel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kabira+Evangel) doesn't have wings. It's actually another word for "evangelist", which is why the character is a cleric who appears to be reading to his allies.
