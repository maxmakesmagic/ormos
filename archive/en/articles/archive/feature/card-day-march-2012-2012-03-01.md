![45273](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&multiverseid=45273)**[Confiscate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Confiscate)** – *Eighth Edition* common. Core set cards, like the *Eighth Edition* version of [Confiscate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Confiscate), sometimes have flavor text from the real world. This one was picked by the website's readers in [Selecting *Eighth Edition*](/en/articles/archive/selecting-eighth-edition-wrapup-2002-11-25). One of the other options was Charles Dickens, which would have worked better for this week's Card of the Day theme.
 ![1681](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&multiverseid=1681)**[Rohgahh of Kher Keep](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rohgahh+of+Kher+Keep)** – *Legends* rare. During playtesting, [Rohgahh of Kher Keep](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rohgahh+of+Kher+Keep) was named "Ur-aah-ah of Kher Keep," and then "Uriah of Kher Keep." It was changed late in the process because it reminded people too much of "Uriah Heep."
 ![Artful Dodge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Artful+Dodge)**[Artful Dodge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Artful+Dodge)** – *Dark Ascension* common. Wondering what kind of creature is depicted on [Artful Dodge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Artful+Dodge)? It's a mystery! When you're walking down a street in Innistrad, sometimes you see something out of the corner of your eye that might be an escaped lab experiment or might be a mutant alligator. And before you get a good look at it, it's gone. Watch out!
 ![Bleak Coven Vampires](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Bleak+Coven+Vampires)**[Bleak Coven Vampires](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bleak+Coven+Vampires)** – *Scars of Mirrodin* common. Although vampires on Mirrodin (the plane that's now New Phyrexia) have slightly pointed teeth, the way they normally drink blood is by stabbing their victims with the elongated metallic spines on their fingers. [Bleak Coven Vampires](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bleak+Coven+Vampires) gives a great look at them.
 ![6060](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&multiverseid=6060)**[Curiosity](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Curiosity)** – *Exodus* uncommon. In the art for the *Exodus* version of [Curiosity](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=6060), [Mirri, Cat Warrior](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mirri%2C+Cat+Warrior) is following [Crovax the Cursed](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crovax+the+Cursed), who has just killed [Selenia](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Selenia). She's about to attack him and die in the ensuing fight. But the *Planar Chaos* card [Keen Sense](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Keen+Sense) shows an alternate reality, in which [Mirri the Cursed](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mirri+the+Cursed) attacks [Crovax, Ascendant Hero](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crovax%2C+Ascendant+Hero).
 ![70](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&multiverseid=70)**[Lord of the Pit](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lord+of+the+Pit)** – *Limited Edition Alpha* rare. [Lord of the Pit](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=70) was the largest creature with flying until [Devouring Strossus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Devouring+Strossus) was printed in *Invasion*. And a bigger Demon wouldn't get printed until [Kuro, Pitlord](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=82423) in *Champions of Kamigawa*!
 ![89092](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&multiverseid=89092)**[Szadek, Lord of Secrets](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Szadek%2C+Lord+of+Secrets)** – *Ravnica: City of Guilds* rare. The obvious way to use [Szadek, Lord of Secrets](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Szadek%2C+Lord+of+Secrets) involves milling. But the +1/+1 counters can also be put to use through cards like [Spike Rogue](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spike+Rogue) and [Arcbound Fiend](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arcbound+Fiend), if you're determined to make things more complicated.
 ![3224](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&multiverseid=3224)**[Lord of Tresserhorn](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lord+of+Tresserhorn)** – *Alliances* rare. [Lord of Tresserhorn](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lord+of+Tresserhorn) was known during playtesting as "Good Buddy." Why? Because he's a 10/4, and because some of the playtest group still remembered old CB radio slang! In fact, the card was changed from a 9/4 to enable the silly nickname!
 ![Chaos Lord](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Chaos+Lord)**[Chaos Lord](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chaos+Lord)** – *Ice Age* rare. [Chaos Lord](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chaos+Lord) is one of those cards that's simple conceptually (it changes sides a lot and attacks whoever's in its way) but complicated to put in "rules language." At one point, it had Haste but lost it the turn it entered the battlefield. These days, it can attack "as though it had Haste," but not on its first turn.
 ![Sorin, Lord of Innistrad](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Sorin%2C+Lord+of+Innistrad)**[Sorin, Lord of Innistrad](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sorin%2C+Lord+of+Innistrad)** – *Dark Ascension* mythic rare. With the printing of the white-black [Sorin, Lord of Innistrad](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sorin%2C+Lord+of+Innistrad), Sorin becomes the fifth Planeswalker to have two cards with different colors. His first version was the all-black [Sorin Markov](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sorin+Markov). The others are Ajani ([Ajani Goldmane](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ajani+Goldmane)/[Ajani Vengeant](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ajani+Vengeant)), Garruk ([Garruk Wildspeaker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Garruk+Wildspeaker)/[Garruk, the Veil-Cursed](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Garruk%2C+the+Veil-Cursed)), Sarkhan ([Sarkhan Vol](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sarkhan+Vol)/[Sarkhan the Mad](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sarkhan+the+Mad)), and Tezzeret ([Tezzeret the Seeker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tezzeret+the+Seeker)/[Tezzeret, Agent of Bolas](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tezzeret%2C+Agent+of+Bolas)).
 ![Last Kiss](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Last+Kiss)**[Last Kiss](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Last+Kiss)** – *Rise of the Eldrazi* common. [Last Kiss](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Last+Kiss) is functionally identical to [Douse in Gloom](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Douse+in+Gloom) (from *Guildpact*, which is also very similar to [Vicious Hunger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=21317) (first seen in *Nemesis*). Since *Rise of the Eldrazi*, this effect has shown up again as [Sorin's Thirst](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sorin%27s+Thirst), this time as an Instant costing only ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227195556im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/black.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227195556im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/black.gif).
 ![Crabapple Cohort](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Crabapple+Cohort)**[Crabapple Cohort](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crabapple+Cohort)** – *Shadowmoor* common. According to the flavor text, [Crabapple Cohort](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crabapple+Cohort) is trying to get revenge on the women who plucked its apples for pies. At seven apples per pie and seven pies per woman, that's 343 apples! You can also read it as being one apple per pie, but that's not much of a pie.
 ![Dwarven Miner](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Dwarven+Miner)**[Dwarven Miner](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dwarven+Miner)** – *Mirage* uncommon. The flavor text for [Dwarven Miner](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dwarven+Miner) is thirteen words long. [Here](/en/articles/archive/making-magic/thirty-two-short-columns-about-dwarves-2005-11-21), Mark Rosewater shares 600 words about writing it.
 ![Lost in the Woods](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Lost+in+the+Woods)**[Lost in the Woods](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lost+in+the+Woods)** – *Dark Ascension* rare. There's a tactic in *Dark Ascension-Innistrad* draft where you sideboard into a [Lost in the Woods](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lost+in+the+Woods) and a lot of [Forest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest)s to ride out the win. That's interesting, but is it as interesting as the fact that the people in the art are [upside down](/en/articles/archive/extremely-lost-2012-02-27)?
 ![Mirror Mirror](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Mirror+Mirror)**[Mirror Mirror](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mirror+Mirror)** – *Unglued* rare. Although there's a lot of text on [Mirror Mirror](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mirror+Mirror), the effect is pretty simple: the players change seats and finish the game with each other's decks. Bad news if you were playing [Blacker Lotus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blacker+Lotus)!
 ![Nevermore](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Nevermore)**[Nevermore](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nevermore)** – *Innistrad* rare. The effect seen on [Nevermore](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nevermore) has previously been seen on [Meddling Mage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Meddling+Mage) and, of course, [Look at Me, I'm the DCI](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Look+at+Me%2C+I%27m+the+DCI).
 ![Razor Pendulum](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Razor+Pendulum)**[Razor Pendulum](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Razor+Pendulum)** – *Mirage* rare. According to its flavor text, the [Razor Pendulum](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Razor+Pendulum) was constructed by [Telim'Tor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Telim%27Tor). Here's something interesting about [Telim'Tor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Telim%27Tor): his name comes from anagramming a Wizards of the Coast employee whose nickname was "Mr. Toilet."
 ![4451](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&multiverseid=4451)**[Buried Alive](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Buried+Alive)** – *Weatherlight* uncommon. Although cards like [Animate Dead](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=48) had been around since the beginning of **Magic**, the idea of the graveyard mattering didn't really get investigated until *Weatherlight*. [Buried Alive](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Buried+Alive) turned [Ashen Ghoul](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=2438) from a gimmick into a powerhouse.
 ![Deathmask Nezumi](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Deathmask+Nezumi)**[Deathmask Nezumi](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deathmask+Nezumi)** – *Saviors of Kamigawa* common. Nezumi is pronounced "nay-ZOO-mee," and in Kamigawa, it's short for "nezumi-bito," meaning "ratfolk." The nezumi mostly stayed out of the war between the humans and the spirits, preferring to stay by themselves in Takenuma Swamp.
 ![Black Cat](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Black+Cat)**[Black Cat](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Black+Cat)** – *Dark Ascension* common. [Black Cat](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Black+Cat) is both a Cat and a Zombie. The marble table it's sitting on is actually the corner of a coffin! Or possibly a sarcophagus! 
 ![Decree of Justice](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Decree+of+Justice)**[Decree of Justice](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Decree+of+Justice)** – *Scourge* rare. One of the few cards that can produce Angel tokens (like [Angelic Favor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Angelic+Favor)), [Decree of Justice](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Decree+of+Justice) is also remarkable for its ability to produce two different types of creature tokens. 
 ![Arrest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Arrest)**[Arrest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arrest)** – *Scars of Mirrodin* common. The *Scars of Mirrodin* version of [Arrest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arrest) sets the scene in Bladehold, a Mirran city. You can learn more about Bladehold in the reports of Ria of Bladehold on [the Mirrodin site](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=magic/mirrodin/#blogs), which chronicled the Mirran-Phyrexian war.
