**Q:** What surprises you the most about the **Magic** community as a whole?


--Matt P.


**A:** From **Mark Rosewater**, **Magic** Head Designer


I am constantly surprised by how giving the **Magic** community is as a community. There is a genuine sense of good will and a desire to help one another. In many ways the **Magic** community acts more like a family than a series of acquaintances with a common interest. I am very proud to be part of the **Magic** community.

**Q:** "What was the idea behind the [spellbombs](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=spellbombs) and how do they work in the story?"


--Levi Campbell, Sterling Colorado


**A:** From **Brady Dommermuth**, **Magic** creative director: 


Levi, spellbombs are sort of Mirrodin's version of potions, except instead of drinking them, you break them to release the spell energy magically sealed inside. (Mirrodin tends to do things a little differently than most planes.)
