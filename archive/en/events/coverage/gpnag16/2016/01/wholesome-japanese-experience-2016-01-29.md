Attending a Grand Prix is one of the best experiences a *Magic* player can have. These open tournaments are for anyone, whether you're a well-seasoned Pro, a dedicated grinder or a relatively new player. Aside from competing for prizes and fame, it's also a wholesome way to spend some quality time with family and friends amidst well-natured competition.


Ever since the conception of the Grand Prix circuit, attendance has ballooned exponentially through the years. Despite the proliferation and expansion of Organized Play, players all over the world are constantly clamoring for more events than before. Two decades ago, you'll be hard-pressed to find an event that can even attain attendances that you can consider “a few hundred”. Today, and especially in Japan, over 2000 is hardly jaw-dropping.

*Grand Prix Nagoya 2016*


What are the challenges faced in running a 2600-player tournament such as today's Grand Prix Nagoya? Part of our job is to ensure that you have the best possible experience as possible, and we'd like to showcase snippets of unrivaled Japanese hospitality. Perhaps this will tempt you to get booked for Grand Prix Tokyo (Standard), Grand Prix Kyoto (Team Limited) and Grand Prix Chiba (Legacy)!

*Port Messe at Nagoya Port*


Since 1973, Port Messe at Nagoya Port has remained one of the largest international trade fair and exhibition locations in central Japan. They've got large event halls that collectively provide 3.5 hectares of exhibition space, approximately the size of four and a half football fields. It's no wonder that Big *Magic* chose this venue for this wildly-anticipated event! It's also a convenient Metro ride away, making the commute easy and convenient!

*One guidebook is all you need for the weekend.*


Nearly 3000 souls crammed in one massive hall sounds overwhelming, but trust me. It really isn't. The tournament organizers took the liberty of producing a guidebook for all Grand Prix goers this weekend. Inside this convenient publication, you'll find maps of the floor plans, event schedules, activities and a full list of vendors alongside other useful information. You'll never need to ask where the bathrooms are.

*Your Grand Prix Pack*


All competitors at Nagoya this weekend were presented with a cloth drawstring bag, containing the pictured bunch of goodies. Aside from the above-mentioned guidebook, it also comes with everything you need to have a great tournament. This includes 4 *Oath of the Gatewatch* boosters and 2 *Battle for Zendikar* boosters which you need to construct your killer Sealed Deck, a deck box to contain the power, a pack of sleeves, a score-pad, and even a pen and some dice. Also, nobody's about to forget the most cherished prize of all, the Promo [Stoneforge Mystic](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stoneforge+Mystic) promised to every Grand Prix participant in 2016!

*Feeling peckish?*


Your mind is never hungry at a Grand Prix, and neither should your stomachs be. Chances are you're bound to get hungry or thirsty at some point. Head outside for some sustenance, where the food carts and vending machines are! Grab a handcrafted beverage, a traditional bento set, or some street snacks unique to Japan! Eat well, play well, be well!

If you catch a break in between, head over to the Guest Artist corner to get your favorite cards autographed, or buy some of your favorite artwork on exquisite prints. This weekend, two artists are in attendance. Steve Argyle's best works include [Liliana of the Veil](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Liliana+of+the+Veil), [Deathrite Shaman](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deathrite+Shaman), [Monastery Swiftspear](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Monastery+Swiftspear) and the World *Magic* Cup Qualifier Promotional [Thalia, Guardian of Thraben](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thalia%2C+Guardian+of+Thraben).

To ensure that everything flows orderly, a huge ensemble of crew, judges and staff are at your service. You can be sure that there's always someone at hand to uphold the integrity of the game, as well as attend to your queries. To keep them going, we slyly ply them sugary treats!


So, when are you coming to a Japanese Grand Prix?
