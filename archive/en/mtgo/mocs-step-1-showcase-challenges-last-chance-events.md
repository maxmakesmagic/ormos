Showcase Challenges & Last Chance Events
----------------------------------------


Players looking to prove their mettle against the best players in *Magic Online* will want to use their QPs to enter *Magic Online* Champions Showcase (MOCS) events. MOCS is a set of linked tournaments designed to highlight the game's best players each season, culminating in the Champions Showcase and its prize pool of $70,000 and an invitation to an upcoming Championship on *MTG Arena*.
