We've had Event Decks for a few years now, so you could be forgiven for losing track of some of them. You *could* be, that is, unless you read this Arcana, which will catch you back up through February 2013.


Each Event Deck is Standard-legal when it's released, and it's designed to be competitive at [Friday Night **Magic**](http://www.wizards.com/Magic/TCG/Events.aspx?x=events/magic/fnm). This means that the decks pull cards from the entire Standard environment as it stood when the deck was released.

Well! That was informative! Since we're on the subject of Event Decks, we should also mention that starting with *Dragon's Maze*, there will be only one Event Deck per set, not two. Which means it's going to take a pretty long time before we can construct a full 32-deck bracket to see which one's the most powerful!
