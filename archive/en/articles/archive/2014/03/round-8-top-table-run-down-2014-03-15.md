We're just getting underway with Round 8 as I write this, and before we move into our bubble-matches for Round 9, this feels like a good time to give you a glimpse at what the top tables are playing. Below is the metagame breakdown of the Top 10 tables here at Grand Prix Buenos Aires:


  


|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Mono-Blue Devotion: |  5 |
| Esper Control: |  4 |
| U/w Devotion: |  2 |
| Selesnya Aggro: |  2 |
| Jund Monsters: |  1 |
| Red Devotion: |  1 |
| Bant Control (w/ Kiora): |  1 |
| B/R Control: |  1 |
| U/B Control: |  1 |
| Boros Burn: |  1 |
| W/U Control: |  1 |

  

 From this small snippet into the top tables of the day going into Round 8, it is Mono-Blue Devotion that stands above the rest, with five players out of the twenty who are battling in the Top 10 tables representing [Thassa, God of the Sea](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thassa%2C+God+of+the+Sea) and her minions.




 However, that number actually extends a bit into what is tied for the third most played archetype: Blue-white Devotion, a deck that is primarily the same Blue Devotion deck as the others but with a touch of white for cards like [Detention Sphere](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Detention+Sphere) and [Ephara, God of the Polis](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ephara%2C+God+of+the+Polis).




 Esper reigns in at the second most represented deck at the top tables, with many players happily putting scry lands into play tapped and winning the game off of big planeswalkers and even bigger numbers for the X in [Sphinx's Revelation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sphinx%27s+Revelation)'s mana cost.




 The deck tied with Blue-white Devotion for the third most represented in the Top 10 tables is Selesnya Aggro, both of which have similar shells and picked up some extra mana fixing thanks to [Temple of Plenty](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Temple+of+Plenty).




 After that, the top tables break down into a variety of one-of sights, including a Bant Control list rocking [Kiora, the Crashing Wave](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kiora%2C+the+Crashing+Wave) and a Black-Red Control list that bares resemblance to some of the lists we saw in the video coverage during Pro Tour *Theros*.



Check back soon for a round-up of the key bubble-matches being played here in Round 9, as well as a run-down from Nate Price on our King-of-the-Hill Feature Matches, which began in Round 4 and has continued throughout the day.
