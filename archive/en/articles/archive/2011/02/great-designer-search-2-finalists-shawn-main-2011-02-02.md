### Comments


After challenge 4, I wanted to work on blight designs that stood on their own while simultaneously building a deck to take advantage of their inherent synergy. I started with MaRo's suggestion for a creature that blighted both on entering the battlefield and dying. I made it a small flier so it wouldn't be held back in perpetual defense and was less likely to create three-for-one scenarios. From there I looked at cards that would blight multiple times, such as on attack triggers (Void Dragon), on damage (Blightthorn Vines), or at high cost (Nether Beacon). The complexity and potential for card advantage skewed these cards toward uncommon and rare, so I'm happy that Impending Doom works as a common, providing slow inevitable destruction on its own, while triggering other blight effects and being sped along by them. From there I looked at cards that could function as blight + connected effect (like Blight Delirium from challenge 4). This led to Agonizing Fate, Unweave the World, and Blightsky Elemental.


Around this core, there are cards to capitalize on death ([Deathgreeter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deathgreeter), Savage Victory, Purveyor of Corruption) and some that make it difficult for doomed creatures to chump block ([Predator's Strike](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Predator%27s+Strike), Shadowsplit Axe). Finally, the deck has cards that fit its strategy of creeping inevitability (Worldedge Sentinel, [Fog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fog)) as well as the death triggers prevalent in Wodotha.


And, as this will be posted publicly, I want to thank everyone who took the time to design, comment, and playtest for GDS2. I'm very humbled.
