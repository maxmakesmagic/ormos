Two of the most beloved *Magic* sets continue this year as *Core Set 2020* and *Commander (2019 Edition)* return once again!


*Core Set 2020* brings resonant characters, core *Magic* gameplay, and a few new twists along the way. *Core Set 2020* releases July 12 everywhere in all languages in which *Magic* is sold. Watch for previews starting in mid-to-late June.

Not too long after *Core Set 2020* brings us home, *Commander (2019 Edition)* comes back to shake things up! This year, we'll be releasing four decks in English, Japanese, French, Italian, German, Spanish, Portuguese, and Russian!


*Commander (2019 Edition)* will be available in stores everywhere August 23. Watch for previews in early August!
