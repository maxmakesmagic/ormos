![Feedback](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Feedback)Everyone has pet cards that they shouldn't play but for some reason keep being attracted to. In the early days, one of those cards was [Feedback](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Feedback). (A greasy card, I know.) I'm not sure why I like it so much (perhaps it was my love of [bleeder](/en/articles/archive/making-magic/free-association-2004-02-05-2) decks), but I put it into way more decks than I should. Don't be surprised if this card shows up again some day. Most likely in black though, as we've moved the [bleeder](/en/articles/archive/making-magic/free-association-2004-02-05-2) cards into black.
