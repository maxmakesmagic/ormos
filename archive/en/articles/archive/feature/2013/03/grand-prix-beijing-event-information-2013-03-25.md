![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/promo/grandprix_2013.jpg)*Get your promo card by playing in the Grand Prix (while supplies last).* Welcome to Beijing, the capital of People's Republic of China. Beijing is the political, cultural, educational center of China and is a major hub for international communication. With a long history of more than 3,000 years as a city and more than 850 years as the capital, Beijing is regarded as one of the "Four Great Ancient Capitals of China." Thousands of years of urban development and near a millennia of imperial cultural influence over the city has materialized in the form of six World Cultural Sites and other numerous representations, both architectural and cultural, that you can find spreading across the entire ancient city. Countless places of interests, such as the Great Wall and the Forbidden City, will certainly be your perfect complement to a grand **Magic** event. 



**Magic**-wise, Beijing is also one of the most important places for China. Beijing was among the first cities **Magic** got introduced into China and this early adaptation in turn nurtures a number of high-level **Magic** players and even Chinese National Champions. Furthermore, Beijing is the hometown to all the team members who claimed China's first World Team Championship at Rome in 2009. 


 Eight years ago, Beijing became the first Mainland China city to host a **Magic** Grand Prix event. Eight years later, let's gather in Beijing once more to witness the birth of a new legend. Once again, welcome to Beijing! 


  

 *The **Magic: The Gathering**  Grand Prix tournament series is a great reason to step up your game, catch up with old friends, meet some new ones, and play **Magic**. Grand Prix tournaments are world-wide open events that allow all **Magic** players to participate and experience the thrill of a large-scale competition over three days. In addition to cash prizes, a high Planeswalker Points multiplier, and exclusive foil promo cards for participants, the Grand Prix features a host of other activities, including side events and artist signings. Side-event tournaments begin Friday, with the Grand Prix main event running Saturday and Sunday. Find out more about the Grand Prix [tournament schedule here](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/TCG/Events.aspx?x=grandprix/welcome#2013).*

* For the first game of each match in the Top 8, the player that finished higher in the Swiss rounds chooses either to play first or to play second.
