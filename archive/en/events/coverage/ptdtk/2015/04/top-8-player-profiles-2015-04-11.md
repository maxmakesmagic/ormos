Blue-Black Control. It looks insane against midrange decks.


**What decks did you draft? What did you think of each deck?**


"Black-Green Rares." The deck was insane and I went 2-1. Then, red-green splashing Dromoka. The deck was really solid.

Make a dream come true.

Thomas Hendriks
===============


![](https://media.wizards.com/2015/events/ptdtk/hendricks_ptdtk.jpg)


**Age:** 22


**Hometown:** Leiden, the Netherlands


**Limited Record:** 5-1


**Constructed Record:** 7-2-1


**Favorite Dragon:** Ojutai…not Atarka, of course


**Previous Magic accomplishments:**


Played the World *Magic* Cup twice and made it to the Top 16 last year. Top 8 at Grand Prix Antwerp 2013.


**Who did you prepare with?** 


"Frank Karsten and the Karstens" a.k.a. Cabin Crew.


**What Constructed deck are you playing and why?** 


Red-Green Devotion. To beat mono-red and all the Abzan Midrange decks. (Where are all the mono-red decks?)


**What Standard deck, other than any you’re playing, impressed you the most this weekend?**


The mono-red deck of our team, but not in a good way. Having good players with a ~40% win percentage is pretty impressive.


**What decks did you draft? What did you think of each deck?**


Blue-black, which was pretty good but lost horribly to [Merciless Executioner](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Merciless+Executioner) and [Swift Warkite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swift+Warkite) to go 2-1. Then, "Red/Green Elks" with three [Stampeding Elk Herd](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stampeding+Elk+Herd)s because they are so damn good. 3-0.


**What would winning the Pro Tour mean to you?** 


An even better ending to what looked to become a horrible Pro Tour. Also, my best *Magic* performance of course!

Blue-Black Control; I think Blue-Black Control has been the best archetype since Pro Tour *Khans of Tarkir*, and my version was the best I could find.


**What Standard deck, other than any you’re playing, impressed you the most this weekend?**


Mono-Red Aggro (no Atarka's Command).


**What decks did you draft? What did you think of each deck?**


First, an aggressive white-black deck with a splash of blue, then Red-White Aggro. The first deck was good, the second was incredible.


**What would winning the Pro Tour mean to you?** 


The culmination of 22 years of living *Magic*.

The Abzan deck with Atarka. Man, that card is sweet.


**What decks did you draft? What did you think of each deck?**


First, a terrible blue-black deck. I hoped to go 2-1, should have gone 3-0. Then a very good red-green for an easy 3-0.

A spot at the World Championship. And eternal fame of course.
