Alchemy Launches Tomorrow!
==========================


Alchemy launches tomorrow, December 9! This is a new format in *MTG Arena*, much like Standard or Historic. It introduces new digital-only cards, legal in Alchemy and Historic, and Alchemy packs that become available about a month after each *Magic* set released in *MTG Arena*.


Alchemy rotates every year, following the pattern of Standard. It has Play and Ranked support, and it is available in both Best-of-One and Best-of-Three matches.


You can find answers to all your Alchemy questions by visiting these two resources:


* [Introducing Alchemy: A New Way to Play *MTG Arena*](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/magic-digital/introducing-alchemy-new-way-play-mtg-arena-2021-12-02)
* [State of the Game – Alchemy](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/magic-digital/mtg-arena-state-game-alchemy-2021-12-02)

Welcome to Alchemy Event
========================


Try out the new Alchemy format, have fun, and earn *Alchemy: Innistrad* packs—no entry required! The Welcome to Alchemy event Kicks off tomorrow, December 9, and runs through December 17, and you get three *Alchemy: Innistrad* packs just for joining.


When you notch five wins—losses don't matter in this event—you'll earn three more *Alchemy: Innistrad* packs plus 2,000 XP!


*Alchemy: Innistrad* Packs in the Store Tomorrow
================================================


Beginning tomorrow, you can pick up *Alchemy: Innistrad* packs in the *MTG Arena* Store:


* 1 pack for 1,000 gold
* 15 packs for 3,000 gems

These packs are duplicate protected. If you already have four copies of each *Alchemy: Innistrad* card of the rarity you open (either rare or mythic rare), you'll receive a card of the same rarity from *Innistrad: Crimson Vow* instead—or gems if you’ve collected all cards of that rarity. (Find complete details on *Alchemy Innistrad* duplicate protection in the [State of the Game article](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/magic-digital/mtg-arena-state-game-alchemy-2021-12-02).)


Grab the Alchemist Bundle
=========================


Here's a chance to start building your Alchemy collection. The Alchemist Bundle will be available in the Store on Thursday, December 9, and is a one-time purchase that includes 20 packs of *Alchemy: Innistrad* for either 15,000 gold or 3,000 gems.

New Play Blade Arrives
======================


There's a refreshed play blade coming to *MTG Arena* that will make finding events and replaying your last game mode a breeze!

Jay Parker reveals updates—including Alchemy info—coming to *MTG Arena* in his latest [State of the Game article](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/magic-digital/mtg-arena-state-game-alchemy-2021-12-02). Check it out!


Historic Brawl Bans
===================


With the Alchemy game update, the following cards will be banned in Historic Brawl:


* [Agent of Treachery](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Agent+of+Treachery)
* [Field of the Dead](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Field+of+the+Dead)
* [Ugin, the Spirit Dragon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ugin%2C+the+Spirit+Dragon)

These cards have been overly prevalent in main decks, and each one either exploits or pushes against one of the primary elements of the format: gameplay focusing on a single important permanent, Singleton deck building, or color restrictions.


Although rebalancing is now a tool at our disposal, we intend to preserve the spirit of any rebalanced card. For these three cards in Historic Brawl, this still presents a problem, as rebalancing would likely either result in an unsatisfying card or be ineffective at addressing the issue. In cases such as this, bans are still warranted.
