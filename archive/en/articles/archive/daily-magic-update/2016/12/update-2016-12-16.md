The Daily *Magic* Update is a roundup of everything *Magic* you should know on December 16, 2016. Today's Update is brought to you by the holidays, which are here!


What does that mean for DailyMTG? Well, it means we're entering our Best of 2016 time for the next two weeks, where we'll be sharing some of the best articles we've posted from 2016. Then we'll return with regular content starting January 2, 2017, with *Aether Revolt* previews!


Thank you for a wonderful 2016 and we'll see you in 2017!


What to Watch This Weekend
==========================


1. StarCityGames.com Players' Championship

An entire year's worth of StarCityGames.com events comes to a close with the Players' Championship! This invite-only tournament features sixteen players who earned their spots over the past year. Players will battle through Legacy, Modern, and Standard over two days. Coverage begins at 10 a.m. ET/7 a.m. PT on [twitch.tv/scglive](https://www.twitch.tv/scglive).


But Read This Before You Watch That
===================================


1. [2016 Players' Championship Preview!](http://www.starcitygames.com/article/34220_2016-Playersrsquo-Championship-Preview-.html) | StarCityGames.com | Nick Miller

If you are planning to watch the SCG Players' Championship this weekend, check out this article first. Not only does it introduce you to the sixteen competitors, it also serves as a kind of 2016 retrospective in *Magic*, as it covers the decks the players used to compete throughout the year. A touch of nostalgia coupled with a preview of the weekend's viewing is a recipe for something you should check out.


Today's Must
============


1. [Hidden Limited Puzzles](http://www.mtgmintcard.com/articles/writers/lee-shi-tian/hidden-limited-puzzles) | MTGMintCard | Lee Shi Tian

Last week, Pierre Dagen's article about *Magic* as a series of puzzles kicked up a lot of discussion and garnered a lot of (justified) praise. This week, Lee Shi Tian puts those ideas into practice and looks at Limited as a series of puzzles waiting to be solved.


After Those, Read, Watch, or Listen to These
============================================


1. [Seahawks player huge fan of *Magic: The Gathering*](http://www.king5.com/news/local/seahawks-player-huge-fan-of-magic-the-gathering/370672555) | King 5 News | Alex Rozier

Every day I do a Google search for *Magic*-related news, and for the past month or so, the top results have still been old stories about Seahawks player Cassius Marsh's cards being stolen. So when I saw another story about Marsh, I initially dismissed it as an old one. But this story hasn't gone away. This was from last night's news.


Watch the video as well, if for no other reason than to hear a reporter say, "So is this anything like *Battleship*?"


The report also plugs the charity event Marsh is hosting alongside Mox Boarding House on December 30 in Bellevue, WA, benefitting Big Brothers Big Sisters. If you're in the Seattle area, it seems like a good event to go check out if for no reason than the chance to be in the background of a local TV news spot.


1. [Controversy! Combos and Concessions](http://collected.company/2016/12/15/controversy-combos-and-concessions-137/) | The Command Zone | Jimmy Wong and Josh Lee Kwai

You wouldn't think a mostly casual format would kick up much controversy, but if you've ever played a single game of Commander basically ever, you know that isn't even close to the case. Conceding in response to something targeting you or when a stolen permanent is a key part in an opponent's plan? Or how about when you bring that combo deck to the table and everyone just groans? Turn-two [Leovold, Emissary of Trest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leovold%2C+Emissary+of+Trest), turn-three [Day's Undoing](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Day%27s+Undoing)?


Actually, that last one is kind of awesome. Suck it, everyone who isn't me.


1. [Limited Time Only 48: Drafting with a Plan](http://www.constructedcriticism.com/podcasts/limited-time-only-48-drafting-with-a-plan/) | Constructed Criticism | Spencer Howland and Danny Cathro

For a Constructed-centric podcast, they sure do Limited podcasts pretty often. 48 times, to be exact. They get a pass this time because they talk *Vintage Cube*, which I both love and am terrible at. They talk about drafting with a plan in mind and also run through a bunch of second picks in the *Vintage Cube*. Because the *Vintage Cube* is great.


1. ["The Return of Dan and Nels" A *Magic: The Gathering* Video Podcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=boYiYBMlVTc) | Magic the Amateuring | Maria Bartholdi and ~~Meghan Wolff~~ Dan and Nels

You're not going to get any strategy content in this one. You won't get serious discussions of hot topics. But what you will get is nearly an hour of funny, *Magic*-related talk as Dan and Nels, barely *Magic* players, sub in for Meghan and get quizzed on a metric ton of cards they don't know. The show is light and fun and just what the weekend calls for if you're not focused on winning a StarCityGames.com Players' Championship.

1. [LSV's Play: Red-Black Aggro Mirror](http://www.channelfireball.com/articles/lsvs-play-red-black-aggro-mirror/) | ChannelFireball | Luis Scott-Vargas

I can't be the only one who much prefers reading the solutions to these puzzles than taking the puzzles themselves. Sure, I can solve a puzzle given enough time, but what I really want to see is how someone else thought about it. What were the factors that led to their decision? Did I miss something? That's what makes these "solutions" to the puzzle of *Magic* so enticing for me. And, I'm guessing, for some of you, too.

I'm not invited back because [Panharmonicon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Panharmonicon) is still in the environment...


That's not true, but what is true is that this is the very same day the full set is revealed, meaning this is about as Pre-Pre as you get!


Deck of the Day

1. Panharmonicombo

Why? Because it's my Christmas present to myself. This list went undefeated at a Standard Showdown, the last of which are tomorrow. Go forth and spread good beats.


Happy Holidays!
