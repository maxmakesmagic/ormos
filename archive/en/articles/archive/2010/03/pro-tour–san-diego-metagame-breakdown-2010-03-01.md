San Diego has long been known as a locale with pristine weather conditions, breathtaking sunsets, and easy access to Mexico. On the penultimate weekend of February 2010 it became the site of one of the most dominant performances the game of **Magic** has ever seen.


Luis Scott-Vargas, LSV to his fans, put on a display that, while he came up short in the Semifinals, will be one of the things this Pro Tour is remembered for. In much the same way Josh Hamilton's 2008 MLB Home Run Derby display was the highlight of the event, the other things going on at PT–San Diego took a back seat to Mr. ChannelFireball's 17-0 start to the tournament. Sadly, at least for legend's sake, Luis was a little too New England Patriot and not enough Miami Dolphin, falling two match wins shy of the title.


The Finals, played out by two (previously) lesser-known characters, featured two different takes on a virtually unknown archetype: Jund. Well, unknown only if you aren't actually a **Magic** player. I'll go out on a ledge here and say that, since you're reading this article about **Magic**, on a website about **Magic**, that you are in fact a **Magic** player. And since you sling spells, you are probably no stranger to "[Savage Lands](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Savage+Lands), go."


Jund was expected to be the most played deck, as it has been for months now. Some expectations aren't lived up to. *The Matrix Reloaded*, Y2K, and Segways all fell extremely short of their hype and now stand as footnotes to history. Jund, however is LeBron James—worth every bit of the propaganda. As Bill Stark and Rashad Miller shared with us already [here](/en/articles/archive/event-coverage/pro-tour%E2%80%93san-diego-archetype-breakdown-2010-02-19), Jund was easily the best represented deck. Jund was played by more people than the next three decks combined.


It is actually quite interesting how the remaining three-quarters of the field was built. Excluding Jund, we saw a pretty balanced field. Imagine for a moment that Jund wasn't there. Those 112 people all went surfing. Assuming that, this would be your revised metagame:




|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Archetype | Total |
| White Weenie | 13.58% |
| Vampires | 10.93% |
| Bant | 9.93% |
| All-American Control | 8.61% |
| Zoo / Boss Naya | 7.28% |
| Mono-Red | 6.62% |
| White-Blue Control | 6.29% |
| Junk | 5.96% |
| Cruel Control | 4.64% |
| Eldrazi Green | 2.98% |
| Turbo-Fog | 2.65% |
| Boros | 2.65% |
| Summoning Trap | 2.32% |
| Green-Red Valakut | 1.66% |
| Tokens | 1.66% |
| Naya Ramp | 1.66% |
| Time Sieve | 1.66% |
| Open the Vaults | 1.66% |
| Runeflare Trap | 1.32% |
| Polymorph | 0.99% |
| Esper Control | 0.99% |
| Unearth | 0.99% |
| Warp World | 0.66% |
| Red-Green Aggro | 0.66% |
| Crabs | 0.33% |
| Naya | 0.33% |
| Jung | 0.33% |
| Green-Blue Control | 0.33% |
| Green-White Ramp | 0.33% |

When's the last time you saw a metagame with no deck breaking 15% of the field? Yeah, me either. Imagine a world with no Jund. It's easy if you try. But it is still just imagining. In reality, Jund was nearly 27% of the field. And it performed well too.


As always, mirror-matches have been removed and disclaimers about different builds, different play skill, mixed formats and small samples apply.

For a new twist, I included game win rates. I'm not entirely certain what they might tell us, but if we have the data, mise well use it, right? So what can we see here? Boss Naya jumps out as the clear favorite, posting an excellent record over a significant number of matches. White Weenie also put up some very strong numbers. Junk and Mono-Red were both very pretty solid.


And then there's Jund, the fifth-best deck of those that had one hundred or more matches. In one way, it is a let-down. A deck that is so popular should really win more than 51% of its matches, right? Why else would more than one in four people play it?


In another way it is impressive. Sustaining an above-average record over such a massive number of matches is not something to sneeze at. Bear in mind that this deck, since it was played by so many people, very likely had some of the less-skilled gamers piloting it. It didn't have the luxury of Boss Naya, which had major names for about half of its pilots. Jund went out there with what had to be a very mixed bag of seasoned pros and newcomers, people who tested and people who did not, at its helm, and it was still able to win more than half of its matches.


After Jund, there is a barely-over-50-percent performance by Bant decks and a subpar showing from Vampires and All-American Control. Here's the table again, removing those that didn't have one hundred or more matches:




|  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Archetype | Match Win % | Total Matches | Game Win % | Total Games |
| Zoo / Boss Naya | 60.58% | 137 | 56.94% | 353 |
| White Weenie | 58.04% | 255 | 55.33% | 638 |
| Junk | 53.23% | 124 | 52.26% | 310 |
| Mono-Red | 52.34% | 128 | 51.70% | 323 |
| Jund | 51.45% | 550 | 50.65% | 1384 |
| Bant | 50.79% | 189 | 49.68% | 467 |
| Vampires | 48.15% | 189 | 47.99% | 473 |
| All-American Control | 44.79% | 163 | 46.08% | 408 |


 

These are the ones we're going to focus on. So far, I haven't seen anything to indicate something is fishy with the games. The biggest oddity I see is that White Weenie had about 3% better game win percentage than Junk, but that translated to almost 5% more matches. That leads me to believe that more Game 3s were needed, which probably indicates that White Weenie decks had strong sideboard plans. We'll take a closer look at that when we get into the deck breakouts. Speaking of, here's Boss Naya:

You really have to love the commitment there. You know Jund is going to be the most popular deck. I mean you absolutely know it. You know your deck is a dog to Jund. But you also know that, hey, I bash literally everything else. So if I'm slightly less than a coin flip a quarter of the time and the rest of the time I'm pushing 70%, I think I'll do just fine. Sure enough, the strategy earned top honors. Of course, LSV might say that the strategy failed after his Semifinals loss to, drumroll please: Jund.

White Weenie, on the other hand, went a different route. If you can't beat 'em, beat 'em. A win rate of 63% against a deck that is 27% of the field is a pretty good start to winning a tournament. After that there is a bit of a mix versus the other top decks that brought the overall performance down a bit. It's fascinating to look at the different approaches these decks took against the metagame. White Weenie solved Jund, more or less, but did it at the expense of the field, whereas Boss Naya solved the field at the expense of Jund.

As we discussed before, Jund did well. That sounds like an understatement for a deck that occupied both seats in the finals, but really that's what it did. I think Pro Tours are a lot like Major League Baseball in that you can build a deck (or team) to succeed in the Swiss (regular season), but the Top 8 (playoffs) are far less in your control. The small sample size of elimination rounds (the sample size is 1, after all) leads to much higher variance. You can build your deck to mulligan less frequently or to be less impacted when it does mulligan. You can build your deck to perform well in the early game. You can design your deck with redundancies to ensure consistency. All of these things will help reduce variance over the course of a long tournament. But they will not eliminate it, and if it strikes in the Finals, so be it. The best deck may not win. That's part of the fun of it all, isn't it?


Sometimes we'll see the best deck or player win. But a lot of the time we will not. No offense to Jund here—it has been dominant for quite a while now—but in this case I simply do not think it was the best deck for the tournament.


All of that aside, some of you might be wondering how the differing variants of Jund did. Well, the clearest delineation was between the decks that played [Putrid Leech](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Putrid+Leech) and the ones that did not. Decks with the Leech were a full 5% better than those without against the field. Against other Jund decks, the No-Leech builds were even worse, dropping 63.5% of the matches. I suppose the lesson there is that two mana 4/4s are good.


The remaining decks don't have a whole lot of information in them, because the breakouts give us far too few matches to examine. I'm posting their results here and encourage you to read them at your leisure, but I'll spare you the not-much-to-talk-about speech a couple of times.

And the Gold went to Germany.


Pro Tour–San Diego was exciting to follow—between all the tweets, the text coverage, and of course the webcast I feel like I was basically there. Strangely I also feel jetlagged. Luis Scott-Vargas was the story of the event, and his deck was the best one there. In the end, Boss Naya doesn't have the novelty-sized check, though, and isn't that what this is all about anyway?


A final note that I want to make here is the importance of sideboards. Sideboarding is so often overlooked in playtesting that it is criminal. In this tournament, there were 2,391 Game 1s and 3,628 games after that. That's 52% more games played with sideboard than those played without. Something to think about the next time you're playtesting.
