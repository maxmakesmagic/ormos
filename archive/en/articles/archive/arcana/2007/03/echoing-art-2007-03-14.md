The *Darksteel* cycle of “echoing” spells each affect all permanents that share a name with their target. The “echoing” title, in this case, doesn’t relate to the *mechanic* echo (of Timbermare fame), but instead to a figurative repetition of the spell’s effect.

Greg Staples illustrated each of these spells, and each depicts beams of colored light falling down on its multiple targets. Perhaps you’ve felt similar beams of light emptying your board of Saprolings or blowing up all your Ancient Dens…

Note how the two in the background have red-glowing eyes, indicating that the spell hasn’t eradicated their afflictions yet.
