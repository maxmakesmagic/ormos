When Stanislav Cifka burst onto the Professional **Magic** scene with a win at Pro Tour *Return to Ravnica*, it was a relative surprise, especially considering he had to dispatch Yuuya Watanabe to do so.


Well, let's clarify that. It was surprising if you didn't happen to be a Czech **Magic** player. Perhaps the only thing that surprised the Czech players in attendance was how well Cifka managed the Limited rounds of the tournament.


"It has become a game for us to watch Stan's draft viewers and try to guess what he's going to pick," Czech superstar Martin Juza has joked. "We are not often right."


Still, you can't argue with results. A top-ranked chess player, Cifka took his Pro Tour down with his favorite deck, one that played incredibly well to his highly analytical nature: Eggs. Piloting the deck with expert skill, Cifka made it look easy as he deftly wove his way through seemingly impossible situations time and again throughout the tournament.


Approaching **Magic** the same way he did chess, Cifka puts in time and effort, often upwards of forty hours a week playing the game. It is this devotion and dedication to being a professional that has allowed Cifka to attain his success, and his participation with the other members of the Czech and Slovakian teams has certainly helped them in this past year as well.
