**Name:** Christian Calcano




**Age:** 26




**Hometown:** New York City, New York




**Previous Magic Accomplishments:** Four Grand Prix Top 8s (1 win)






**What did you play in Sealed, and why? What was your record?**


Black/White splashing Red and Green. Red for [Arc Lightning](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arc+Lightning), [Mardu Charm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mardu+Charm), and a rare dragon. Green for [Abzan Charm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Abzan+Charm). Had five dual lands to support the splashes. Also had [Mastery of the Unseen](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mastery+of+the+Unseen) and [Master of Pearls](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Master+of+Pearls). 8-1






**What did you play during your drafts, and why? What were your records?**


Red/White Aggro (3-0) and Green/White (2-1). Red/White Aggro is my favorite archetype and the cards were there. Second draft I opened [Warden of the First Tree](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Warden+of+the+First+Tree) and two [High Sentinels of Arashin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=High+Sentinels+of+Arashin).






**What was the best play you saw all weekend?**


I didn't see this, but one player told me his opponent cast [Villainous Wealth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Villainous+Wealth) for six hitting [Ponyback Brigade](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ponyback+Brigade) and three other creatures with three or less power. He untapped and cast [Mob Rule](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mob+Rule) for a lethal attack.






**What are you looking forward to most in *Dragons of Tarkir*, and why?**


Ojutai's Command because #value.

**Previous Magic Accomplishments:** 3 Pro Tour Top 8, 7 Grand Prix wins, 2 Player of the Year titles, 2007 Rookie of the year.






**What did you play in Sealed, and why? What was your record?**


Five color with all my rares. 7-2






**What did you play during your drafts, and why? What were your records?**


Jeskai 3-0 with four rares. Sultai 3-0 with zero rares >\_<






**What was the best play you saw all weekend?**


Too many rares!

**Name:** Ross Merriam




**Age:** 26




**Hometown:** Middletown, Connecticutt




**Previous Magic Accomplishments:** Over ten SCG Open Top 8s, 13-2 GP NJ 2014






**What did you play in Sealed, and why? What was your record?**


8-1 with Green/White splashing Blue and Black. My bombs were [Mastery of the Unseen](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mastery+of+the+Unseen) and Dromoka so I built around them. I sideboarded into Green/Blue splashing White and Black several times and it was likely a better build because of Cancel and [Disdainful Stroke](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Disdainful+Stroke)'s strength against other bombs.






**What did you play during your drafts, and why? What were your records?**


3-0 with Green/Blue splashing White. I opened Dromoka and Blue was open in pack one. Green was open in pack two. 2-1 with Green/Red Aggro. I took Red cards like an idiot. Never take Red cards.






**What was the best play you saw all weekend?**


Most exciting play was in round 9 when I had to block the right one of two morphs with no information at all. I won the coin flip and here I am.






**What are you looking forward to most in *Dragons of Tarkir*, and why?**


Hopefully finding a tempo deck to break the midrange monotony of Standard.

Black/Red splashing White. It was my only playable configuration and I had to play two copies of [Mardu Runemark](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mardu+Runemark). 8-1.






**What did you play during your drafts, and why? What were your records?**


Everything but Red in both drafts. [Abzan Ascendancy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Abzan+Ascendancy) in both drafts. 6-0

**What did you play during your drafts, and why? What were your records?**


Black/White Control. Green/Black Ugin. Black has a strong common pool in Fate Reforged. I have had success playing slower control decks in draft.

I got to turn six Ugin. That was fun. Otherwise, everyone was a nice person that played well.

**What did you play in Sealed, and why? What was your record?**


Mardu Aggro, I'm usually a two color kind of guy, but my pool had [Archfiend of Depravity](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Archfiend+of+Depravity) so exceptions were made.

Red/White Aggro. It's all I know. 6-0






**What was the best play you saw all weekend?**


“[Act of Treason](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Act+of+Treason) targeting [Hooded Hydra](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hooded+Hydra), five you, [Collateral Damage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Collateral+Damage), make five 1/1s, Go.”

Red cards!
