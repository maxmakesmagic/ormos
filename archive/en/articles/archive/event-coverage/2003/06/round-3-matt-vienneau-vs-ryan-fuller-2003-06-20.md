![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/natcan03/a977.jpg)According to Ryan Fuller, this is all part of his plan. Currently sitting at 0-2, he's going to be using his record so far as a springboard to the Top 8. The former Masters Champion has been working off his ring rust with a lot of practice on Magic Online, so his winlessness has to be coming as a surprise. Fighting him for the chance to dodge the 0-3 table is two-time Grand Prix Champion Matt Vienneau. As you'd expect, the sparks started flying the moment these two characters sat down across from each other.

### Game 1

A few pointed remarks about Fuller's shuffling technique and they were off. Fuller started things with [Basking Rootwalla](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Basking+Rootwalla). Vienneau [Duress](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress)ed away [Circular Logic](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Circular+Logic), seeing [Mongrel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mongrel), Looter, and another Rootwalla. He played out the [Mongrel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mongrel) only to see it [Smother](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Smother)ed. It enabled the other Rootwalla before it died. 

However, Fuller didn't have a lot to do but hit for four and then four again when Vienneau put up [Rotlung Reanimator](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rotlung+Reanimator), since he was short on mana. Vienneau added Withered Wretch and finally Fuller was able to bust out [Merfolk Looter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Merfolk+Looter). Now Vienneau was on the offensive with Rotlung and adding [Cabal Archon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cabal+Archon) to his squad. Fuller still needed to find a fourth land. He Looted away [Deep Analysis](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deep+Analysis) and flashed it back, but still nothing.

Again Vienneau charged with the Rotlung, this time trading it for both Rootwallas. He dropped [Cabal Coffers](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cabal+Coffers) and [Smother](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Smother)ed the Looter, preparing to savage Fuller's graveyard with his Wretch. However, Fuller had a nearly full hand, and Vienneau's offense was waning. [Aquamoeba](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aquamoeba) and [City of Brass](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=City+of+Brass) showed up for Fuller, and when the zombie token and Archon hit the red-zone he ambushed them with a [Basking Rootwalla](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Basking+Rootwalla), discarding a useless card to keep his [Aquamoeba](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aquamoeba) in play. All Vienneau had was another Wretch. They stared at each other, playing out lands, but then Fuller broke the silence with [Upheaval](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Upheaval). He replayed his island and madnessed his Rootwalla back into play.

The always-sketchy Vienneau tried to pass the turn back to Fuller with an eleven-card hand. He caught his "error" immediately, earning a chuckle from Fuller. Fuller hit and added [Aquamoeba](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aquamoeba). Vienneau replayed his Wretch. Fuller pitched [Wonder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wonder) and swung for six, leaving Vienneau at two. All he could muster was the other Wretch.

Fuller 1 – Vienneau 0

### Game 2

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/natcan03/a981.jpg)Fuller started the second game with a [Careful Study](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Careful+Study) pitching [City of Brass](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=City+of+Brass) and [Wonder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wonder), then tried [Wild Mongrel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Mongrel), hoping Vienneau was short on removal. Vienneau [Smother](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Smother)ed at end of turn, then untapped and dropped an [Engineered Plague](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Engineered+Plague) on Merfolk. Fuller Studied again, losing [Unsummon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Unsummon) and another City, but had no play.

Vienneau started the beats with [Rotlung Reanimator](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rotlung+Reanimator), but Fuller showed him who the boss was with [Phantom Centaur](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phantom+Centaur). Not willing to be outdone, Vienneau busted out [Visara the Dreadful](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Visara+the+Dreadful). Fuller had [Stupefying Touch](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stupefying+Touch) to render it merely a giant beater, and hit for five. Vienneau returned fire and then showed [Ensnaring Bridge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ensnaring+Bridge).

 "Admit it, you took out the [Disenchant](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Disenchant)s, you have no way to win." – Matt Vienneau

Meanwhile a dejected Pete Radonjic came to see who would be joining him at the 0-3 table. 

"He's got these guys here to help him with the Vancouver Stall!" – Matt Vienneau

"At least I get to play Vienneau at the 0-3 table. That'll make the $500 plane ticket worth it." – Pete Radonjic

Fuller tried to wrest himself out of Vienneau's trap. He [Upheaval](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Upheaval)ed, and rescued his Rootwalla from [Smother](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Smother) with [Unsummon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Unsummon), letting him play island and discard his Rootwalla. He played an [Aquamoeba](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aquamoeba) on the following turn but Vienneau had the [Smother](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Smother). He hit for three, and then the [Engineered Plague](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Engineered+Plague) on Lizards cleared the board.

Fuller sat on his four mana, unwilling to risk Vienneau resolving the Bridge again. Vienneau played a [Rotlung Reanimator](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rotlung+Reanimator), and then a [Withered Wretch](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Withered+Wretch). Fuller had a [Stupefying Touch](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stupefying+Touch), but still lost his [Wonder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wonder). A turn later he played out his Centaur with three mana open. Rather than risk the Bridge, Vienneau showed him a second [Withered Wretch](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Withered+Wretch), ready to negate any potential [Circular Logic](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Circular+Logic)s. 

With no way to avoid being Bridge, Fuller dropped [Mongrel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mongrel) and [Wonder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wonder), tapping all but one. Vienneau Wretched away his graveyard and then played the Bridge and [Mutilate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mutilate)d away the board. Fuller decided to scoop it and head for Game 3.

Fuller 1 – Vienneau 1

### Game 3

With just thirteen minutes left in the round, Fuller had to mulligan to six. He started strong with Rootwalla and [Mongrel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mongrel), but Vienneau had [Smother](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Smother) ready, and Fuller could only hit for three with his 'Walla. On four land he had no play, and again on five, while Vienneau rolled with [Withered Wretch](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Withered+Wretch) and [Chainer's Edict](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chainer%27s+Edict), and then [Rotlung Reanimator](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rotlung+Reanimator).

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/natcan03/a980.jpg)Fuller finally found some action with [Merfolk Looter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Merfolk+Looter), but Vienneau had drawn another [Smother](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Smother). When he finally did hit a [Phantom Centaur](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phantom+Centaur), [Mutilate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mutilate) was on hand to get rid of it and leave Vienneau with tokens. [Unsummon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Unsummon) took care of one, but Fuller was at four. He needed to spend two [Logic](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Logic)s to keep a [Cabal Archon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cabal+Archon) off the board.

Fuller tried to cling to life with [Wild Mongrel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Mongrel). [Engineered Plague](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Engineered+Plague) for Hounds shrunk it, as Vienneau shrugged off a [Circular Logic](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Circular+Logic). Of course, he forgot about the pump effect that discarding it had, so he threw away his zombie by attacking. Fuller drew a [Compost](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Compost) and kept hope alive. Vienneau continued to play out men, but Fuller was matching pace, just barely. It helped that Vienneau had forgotten about the [Chainer's Edict](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chainer%27s+Edict) in his graveyard that would let him push through for the win.

Eventually Vienneau chose to [Mutilate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mutilate), giving Fuller three cards but leaving him with two Zombies and then [Nantuko Shade](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nantuko+Shade). Still Fuller held on. A freshly-drawn [Chainer's Edict](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chainer%27s+Edict) wised Vienneau up to the contents of his graveyard, and two turns later the game was his, defeating Fuller in his now legendary style.

**Final Result:** Matt Vienneau defeats Ryan Fuller 2-1
