Treasure Chest Update
---------------------


We have heard your feedback regarding card availability, particularly for cards that are only available via Treasure Chests. To help improve card availability for cards not found in boosters, a new category within the Treasure Chest has been created: TC-Only.


Also, the *Magic Online* team has delivered on several dozen [cards from *Commander Legends: Battle for Baldur's Gate*](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/magic-online/dominaria-united-magic-online-edition-2022-08-30#talkcommander), including all Pauper cards with take the initiative, as well as a part of the group of Backgrounds and legends that can choose them. Furthermore, some important cards for Legacy and Commander from both this set (looking at you [Kenku Artificer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kenku+Artificer) and [Minsc & Boo, Timeless Heroes](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Minsc+%26+Boo%2C+Timeless+Heroes)) and previous Commander sets (hello, [Maddening Hex](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Maddening+Hex)) are joining the game.


For more details on the changes to Treasure Chests, [check the *Dominaria United* article](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/magic-online/dominaria-united-magic-online-edition-2022-08-30#treasure).
