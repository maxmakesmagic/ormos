 Anthony Lee, an Australian, was the lone wonder from down under who had already locked up his return ticket for tomorrow. "I ignored everything my teammates were saying, and it worked out. I'm 5-2 and they're all 3-4," said Anthony Lee as he sat down for his first feature match.



Doing so was particularly impressive considering this was just his second Pro Tour, one he qualified for by winning an Australian PTQ. Lee was pretty happy to already be well outpacing his 202nd place finish at Pro Tour Nagoya in 2011. 


He was also ahead of the pace set by his opponent this round, Pro Tour veteran Andrejs Prost.


"You're doing better than I did. I did not win a match in my first two," Prost said of his first Pro Tours. This one happens to be his twelfth. 





*Anthony Lee's second Pro Tour saw him in a good position going into the Day Two. His opponent, Andrejs Prost, emphasized that before they began their match.*
