Hello and welcome back to the Lab. This week marks the last bit of spoilers in regards to *Avacyn Restored*. At this point, [the entire set is available to scan](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/tcg/article.aspx?x=mtg/tcg/avacynrestored/cig#), and this weekend's Prerelease events should signal a bevy of miracles and soulbonded creatures. I know I'm a little excited to see what's inside the real-world [Helvault](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Helvault). Will Avacyn and Griselbrand be lurking inside? I bet Wizards figured out how to awaken them from their ink-and-cardboard prisons. (Or at least digitally reincarnate them. That's a thing now.)

Anyway, while the time for previews has ended, I still have plenty to say about last week's delectable Johnny nugget, Infinite Reflection. Readers sounded off in my inbox like almost never before. Clearly the card excited you all, and I thusly offer my second-ever [mailbag column](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/ftl/127) focused explicitly on a single card. (Last time I opened the floodgates for the wacky [Knowledge Pool](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Knowledge+Pool).)
