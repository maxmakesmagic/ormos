*Kaladesh Remastered*
=====================


Energy. Vehicles. *Thopters*! On November 12, airships will race, automaton constructs will battle, genius minds will face-off, and elegant design will reign supreme as *Kaladesh* and *Aether Revolt* return to *MTG Arena* in *Kaladesh Remastered.*


Tools of the Trade
------------------


The plane of Kaladesh is a living work of art. Life-giving aether infuses the natural world, sculpting the earth and waterways and drawing trees and plants into delicate twisting patterns, while clockwork automotons walk the streets and whirling thopters flit over the markets.
