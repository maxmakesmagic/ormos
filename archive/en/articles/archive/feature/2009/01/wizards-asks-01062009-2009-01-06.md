*What **Magic** color or colors best describe your personality, and why?*

![Kenneth Nagle](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/mtgcom/authorpics/authorpic_kennethnagle.jpg)**Kenneth Nagle:**

Everyone tells me I'm green to the core. I believe that not everyone is created equal (genetically) and that natural selection is at work everywhere, from who survives to procreate to effervescent champagne bubbles. I like to imagine that the universe sees all the intelligent life in it as bacteria from its point of view. The universe is simply waiting to be conquered by the first intelligent life protozoan that doesn't burn itself out (machines appear to be the best candidate; perhaps Google is just biding its time).

Then again, I got a master's in computer science by doing more than my fair share of programmatically blue logical thinking. Ten years of trumpet is mostly red, where passion and art fit best.

Let's just go with green, with hints of blue and red to help me along the way.
