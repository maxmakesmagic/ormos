**Announcement Date**: May 19, 2021

**MTG Arena effective date**: May 20, 2021

While [Thassa's Oracle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thassa%27s+Oracle) is a powerful card that has created combo decks across multiple formats, until recently, it wasn't a force to be reckoned with in Historic. However, with the recent printing of [Tainted Pact](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tainted+Pact) and the fine-tuning of that archetype, we've seen the rise of the two-card combo in Historic to the point that half the field for the past League Weekend utilized the combo.


Due to the power of the two-card combination, and because we expect that [Thassa's Oracle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thassa%27s+Oracle) is likely to cause problems down the road as Historic continues to add new cards, [Thassa's Oracle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thassa%27s+Oracle) is banned in Historic.


The change will go into effect tomorrow, May 20, 2021.
