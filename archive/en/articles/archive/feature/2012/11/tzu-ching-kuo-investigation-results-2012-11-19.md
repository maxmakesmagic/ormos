After investigating an incident during Round 3 of Pro Tour *Return to Ravnica* involving Tzu-Ching Kuo, Wizards of the Coast has determined that no action will be taken. 

While this incident could be interpreted in different ways, in incidents where intent are in question we do not wish to replace a live judge's ruling with one from an offsite committee which is based solely on a video. 

Furthermore, we remind all competitors that if they feel that an incorrect ruling has been issued during an event, they should appeal to the Head Judge.
