It has been a quiet week in the **Magic** Top 25 Pro Rankings, but to make up for it we're bringing you not twenty-five but twenty-*six* players! Not even the Wizards supercomputers can put a pin between two new entries this week, meaning that both Kentaro Yamamoto and William Jensen get to share the No. 25 spot for the next seven days. Yamamoto gained a sizeable haul from his Top 8 appearance at [Pro Tour *Theros*](/en/events/coverage/ptthr13) in Dublin, while Jensen has five Grand Prix Top 8s in the last year, including a winner's trophy at [Grand Prix Oakland 2013](/en/events/coverage/he%E2%80%99s-back-jensen-shows-mastery-oakland), and most recently a 3rd-place finish at the team GP in Barcelona, alongside No. 2 Reid Duke and No. 3 Owen Turtenwald. 

 Those two have only Frenchman Jérémy Dezani ahead of them in the rankings, with the only change in the Top 10 this week being Sam Black nudging ahead of Tom Martell at No. 5. Given that there was a Canadian Grand Prix this past weekend in Montreal, regular readers might have anticipated a big weekend from the likes of Jacob Wilson, Alexander Hayne, and new [Pro Tour Champion Shaun McLaren](/en/events/coverage/ptbngs14). However, only Hayne was in attendance, and although he cashed the event in 49th place, that single Pro Point wasn't enough to push him into the Top 10. 

 That No. 10 spot remains in the hands of Willy Edel, who was one of the star attractions at [Grand Prix Buenos Aires](/en/events/coverage/monlevade-monstrous-buenos-aires) in Argentina. Although he made it into Day Two, Edel couldn't push on to a points finish, and it was another of Brazil's finest—Paulo Vitor Damo da Rosa—who took the spotlight as the rounds ticked by. Eventually falling in the semifinals, it was a reminder that PV remains among the best players ever to sleeve up a deck. 

This week sees another double helping of Grand Prix goodness. Cincinnati picks up the Standard baton from Buenos Aires, while Vienna takes the Limited torch from Montreal. We can expect to see plenty of our Top 25 in action, so join us again next week for the latest in the MTG Top 25 Pro Rankings.
