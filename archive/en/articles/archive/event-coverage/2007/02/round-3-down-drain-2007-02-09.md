This match-up pitted Makihito Mihara's 2-0 blue-white deck against André Coimbra's absurdly powerful 2-0 monoblack deck splashing one [Mountain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mountain) and a [Terramorphic Expanse](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Terramorphic+Expanse) for [Strangling Soot](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Strangling+Soot) flashback. 

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/ptgen07/R3_Mihara.jpg)*Makihito Mihara packs a blue-white deck, widely considered one of the best decks before Planar Chaos…*Coimbra got to play first for the match opener and took complete control right from the start. Using every single mana turn after turn, he led with [Mindstab](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mindstab) (suspended), [Rathi Trapper](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rathi+Trapper), [Urborg Syphon-Mage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Urborg+Syphon-Mage), [Brain Gorgers](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brain+Gorgers). From here Coimbra switched to madness mode, firing off Syphon-Mage shots off with [Psychotic Episode](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psychotic+Episode), another [Brain Gorgers](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brain+Gorgers), and finally a [Nightshade Assassin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nightshade+Assassin) with no black cards left in hand. Meanwhile Mihara did what he could, suspending an Ephemeron and getting out a morph and [Mangara of Corondor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mangara+of+Corondor) before the [Mindstab](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mindstab) wiped out a hand of [Island](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island), D'Avenent Archer, and [Wipe Away](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wipe+Away). That left him with [Stuffy Doll](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stuffy+Doll) in hand after the [Mindstab](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mindstab) but short one mana to cast it, which meant the [Psychotic Episode](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psychotic+Episode) nailed the doll before it could ever enter play. On his heels the whole time, Mihara couldn't keep up, and his remaining creatures began perishing to kill spells turn after turn as he quickly crumpled under the *Onslaught*. Three Syphon-Mage drains fired over the next three turns to end the quick, brutal game.

### Game 2

Looking for revenge, Mihara was disheartened by a mulligan but looked much more interested once Coimbra mulliganned his hand down to five cards. This time it was all Mihara, leading with Deepwalker (suspended), Looter *il*-Kor, [Serendib Sorcerer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Serendib+Sorcerer), and [Icatian Crier](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Icatian+Crier). Not helped by the mulligan any, Coimbra got stuck at three mana, having only summoned a [Rathi Trapper](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rathi+Trapper). Falling further behind once the Deepwalker was in play, Coimbra finally found another creature in Trespasser *il*-Vec, but it fell to a [Sunlance](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sunlance), joined in the dumper by the Trapper, which died to another [Sunlance](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sunlance). Finally finding land #4, Coimbra went for a desperation [Tendrils of Corruption](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tendrils+of+Corruption) to start clearing the board and gain some badly needed life. Unfortunately for him, the final card in Mihara's hand turned out to be a devastating [Mana Tithe](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Tithe).

### Game 3

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/ptgen07/R3_Coimbra.jpg)*…while André Coimbra hits hard with an unusual (and powerful) mono-black deck.*This time it was Coimbra on the play and Mihara with a mulligan. Coimbra had a smooth start with [Rathi Trapper](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rathi+Trapper), Trespasser, Syphon-Mage, and a [Tendrils of Corruption](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tendrils+of+Corruption) on a morph that turned out to be an [Aquamorph Entity](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aquamorph+Entity). Falling behind and having only a Looter in play, Mihara managed to get his Stuff Doll out, only to lose it to a very painful [Enslave](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Enslave). Mihara asked another question in [Castle Raptors](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Castle+Raptors), but Coimbra again had a big answer, this time in the form of a huge Tendrils for 7. An [Ivory Giant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ivory+Giant) came into play from suspend-land but got tapped down by the Trapper when it arrived, while the Syphon-Mage continued its grim business. A turn later it was Coimbra 31, Mihara 6 before the [Ivory Giant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ivory+Giant) came over for a feeble-looking 3. As if things weren't bad enough, Coimbra added a [Triskelavus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Triskelavus) to the board, drawing a chuckle from both Mihara *and* the audience. Drawing one last card and dead on the table, Mihara was out of options and conceded as soon as the [Triskelavus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Triskelavus) started firing next turn.
