Brewing with Fate Reforged
==========================

Jacob Van Lunen began playing Magic in 1995. He has participated in organized play at every level of competition and was a member of the winning team at Pro Tour San Diego in 2007, thanks to an innovative draft strategy. As a writer, Van Lunen has had more than three hundred Magic strategy pieces published 





Welcome back to Perilous Research! We're just a few days away from the [*Fate Reforged* Prerelease](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/feature/fate-reforged-prerelease-primer-2015-01-12). *Fate Reforged* promises to drastically change the Standard landscape with powerful cards like [Brutal Hordechief](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brutal+Hordechief) and seemingly indispensable removal spells like [Wild Slash](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Slash). Today, we'll be doing our best to brew up some new strategies for Standard with *Fate Reforged*!



It's the best time to brew! Right before the Prerelease, no one has any idea what's going to be good in the new Standard. Sure, there's some confidence that decks like Abzan will still be awesome, but the new batch of cards unlocks a huge range of exciting strategies. Deck building is one of the most interesting parts about *Magic*; it's what keeps us awake at night and makes us daydream on our commutes. There's no better time for building new decks than right before the Prerelease when everyone is on the same footing.



Red Devotion
============



The first card I'd like to focus on is my preview card from [last week](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/perilous-research/stalking-sands-2015-01-08), [Mardu Scout](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mardu+Scout). We've already spoken at length about this card's strengths, but we haven't yet had the chance to discuss the tremendous boost in power that red strategies in Standard will enjoy with the introduction of *Fate Reforged*.



Red Devotion strategies will, once again, be able to make big plays with [Purphoros, God of the Forge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Purphoros%2C+God+of+the+Forge) and [Fanatic of Mogis](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fanatic+of+Mogis). Cards like [Flamewake Phoenix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flamewake+Phoenix) and [Mardu Scout](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mardu+Scout) contribute beautifully to our devotion count while also just being tremendously powerful on their own. Let's see what a Red Devotion deck might look like in a post-*Fate Reforged* Standard.



[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Mardu+Scout)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mardu+Scout)



[Mardu Scout](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mardu+Scout) seems like it has to be a four-of. The card gives us 3 power and two devotion for two mana while also letting us play around board-sweeping effects and other forms of sorcery-speed removal. In the late game, we can use the dash mechanic to methodically turn our [Purphoros, God of the Forge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Purphoros%2C+God+of+the+Forge) into a creature on our turn while allowing it to remain an enchantment on our opponent's turn, hence playing around cards like [Chained to the Rocks](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chained+to+the+Rocks). We'll also get a Purphoros trigger each time we make this play. Seems like it's all kinds of awesome.



[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Goblin+Rabblemaster)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Rabblemaster)



[Goblin Rabblemaster](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Rabblemaster) is, along with [Courser of Kruphix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Courser+of+Kruphix), one of the strongest *Magic* cards in Standard when looking at things in a vacuum. We'll definitely be playing four copies here.



[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Flamewake+Phoenix)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flamewake+Phoenix)



[Flamewake Phoenix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flamewake+Phoenix) is incredibly exciting. It requires our deck to go a bit larger than some of the hyper-aggressive red strategies that were successful in the previous season, but the changes we'll be making to our deck are probably a significant upgrade. Now we just need some burn spells and some creatures with 4 or more power.



[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Ashcloud+Phoenix)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ashcloud+Phoenix)



[Ashcloud Phoenix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ashcloud+Phoenix) is perfect here. The card gives us devotion and a mana sink for our [Nykthos, Shrine to Nyx](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nykthos%2C+Shrine+to+Nyx), and it's an efficiently costed 4-power creature to go with our Flamewake Phoenix. It's also worth noting that [Ashcloud Phoenix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ashcloud+Phoenix) matches up very well against [Ugin, the Spirit Dragon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ugin%2C+the+Spirit+Dragon). In matchups where the opponent has access to Ugin, if we're applying pressure and have other options in terms of which threats to play on a given turn, then we should try to have a face-up Phoenix on the table on the turn Ugin would be making an appearance.



[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Fanatic+of+Mogis)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fanatic+of+Mogis)



Meanwhile, [Fanatic of Mogis](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fanatic+of+Mogis) seems like it was made to be played alongside [Flamewake Phoenix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flamewake+Phoenix). The card comes down and does 3 to 5 damage to the opponent before providing a ton of power to the board. On stalled boards, [Fanatic of Mogis](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fanatic+of+Mogis) will often come down with some very large triggers.




[Purphoros, God of the Forge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Purphoros%2C+God+of+the+Forge) seems like it's still going to be a chore to turn into a creature. It's a powerful enough card that we'll definitely try at least one to start. This number could go up or down depending on how the deck plays. We may end up wanting to cut some spells for more bodies so we can play more of the God to which we're devoted.



[Stormbreath Dragon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stormbreath+Dragon) is awesome against the Abzan decks that seem to be doing so well in the current Standard. It's also quite strong against heroic strategies if those continue to be popular. We're going to want four copies of this. It's a great mana sink for our [Nykthos, Shrine to Nyx](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nykthos%2C+Shrine+to+Nyx); it applies quick pressure; and it matches up well against the deck that's likely to be one of our most common opponents in the new Standard.



[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Purphoros%2C+God+of+the+Forge)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Purphoros%2C+God+of+the+Forge) [![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Stormbreath+Dragon)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stormbreath+Dragon)[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Wild+Slash)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Slash)


Then we'll need some reach to finish off our opponent or deal with threats, and [Crater's Claws](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crater%27s+Claws) is practically made for this deck. We're going to have [Nykthos, Shrine to Nyx](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nykthos%2C+Shrine+to+Nyx); tons of lands; and tons of creatures with 4 or more power. Seems like a slam dunk.

Mardu Tokens
============



The next card I'd like to focus on is Brutal Hordechief. This is, without any doubt, my favorite card from the new set. I just want to cast [Hordeling Outburst](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hordeling+Outburst) on my third turn and [Brutal Hordechief](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brutal+Hordechief) on my fourth turn. Is that too much to ask? I don't think it is. It's only two cards. Heck! I'd even settle for [Goblin Rabblemaster](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Rabblemaster) on the third turn. Let's see what a Mardu Tokens strategy might look like for *Fate Reforged* Standard!



[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Brutal+Hordechief)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brutal+Hordechief)



We'll want to be playing a lot of red sources of mana so we can cast [Hordeling Outburst](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hordeling+Outburst) and [Stoke the Flames](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stoke+the+Flames). This probably means we can include some number of [Chained to the Rocks](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chained+to+the+Rocks) in this version of the tokens deck. I think [Chained to the Rocks](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chained+to+the+Rocks) is one of the better removal options in the current Standard. The card has been adopted as a team player by a lot of strategies over the last few weeks and, unless haste creatures become a major factor, I fully expect its popularity to continue to rise.



[Soulfire Grand Master](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soulfire+Grand+Master) is another great upgrade for a deck like this. We'll have lifelinking [Stoke the Flames](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stoke+the+Flames) and [Lightning Strike](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Strike) and we'll even get to make some very awesome plays by using the convoke on [Stoke the Flames](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stoke+the+Flames) with the activation on this guy. This is the type of two-mana creature that demands a removal spell and that opens the door for [Goblin Rabblemaster](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Rabblemaster) to do some fine work in the paint.



[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Chained+to+the+Rocks)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chained+to+the+Rocks) [![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Soulfire+Grand+Master)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soulfire+Grand+Master)



[Crackling Doom](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crackling+Doom) is still one of the best removal spells in the format. The card usually beats [Nissa, Worldwaker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nissa%2C+Worldwaker) and also takes care of whatever exciting four- or five-drop the opponent might have for us.



[Kolaghan, the Storm's Fury](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kolaghan%2C+the+Storm%27s+Fury) is another card I'm really excited about trying. This card in conjunction with [Hordeling Outburst](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hordeling+Outburst) and [Goblin Rabblemaster](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Rabblemaster) seems very strong. It's also a great way for a deck like this to play around board-sweeping effects.



[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Crackling+Doom)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crackling+Doom) [![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Kolaghan%2C+the+Storm%27s+Fury)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kolaghan%2C+the+Storm%27s+Fury)



Finally, [Sorin, Solemn Visitor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sorin%2C+Solemn+Visitor) is exactly what we're looking for to round out our four-mana cards. It makes tokens that contribute to our deck's overall function and, if we've already got a token army, it gives them a nice bonus while presenting the potential threat of its ultimate—which will likely just win the game against most opponents.



Here's what I expect a Mardu Tokens deck to look like in *Fate Reforged* Standard.

We've already made two awesome new decks and we've barely scratched the surface of all the powerful cards available in *Fate Reforged*! What do you plan on playing in *Fate Reforged* Standard?



The *Fate Reforged* Prerelease is this weekend! Don't miss your opportunity to be among the first to play with the new set. Most stores have limited space and these events tend to be wildly popular. Remember to call ahead and preregister if [your store](http://locator.wizards.com/) allows to guarantee your spot in the action!



Knowledge is power!
