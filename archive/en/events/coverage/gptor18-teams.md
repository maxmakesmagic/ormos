Day 2 Coverage



On Sunday, fifty of the initial 389 teams that entered GP Toronto returned to the Enercare Centre to finish what they started – namely, trouncing the competition on their way to the Top 4. Six more rounds of Swiss still stood between any team and the Top 4, and it was a perfect storm of Standard, Modern, and Legacy in the event hall.


At the end of those six rounds on Day 2, the four teams that would fight on for the GP Toronto trophy were Morgan McLaughlin, Chris Harabas, and Lucas Siow, Jennifer Crotts, Tyler Blum, and Robert Smith, Oliver Tiu, Oliver Tomajko, and Noah Walker, and Brad Nelson, Seth Manfield, and Brian Braun-Duin.


Local players Morgan McLaughlin, Chris Harabas, and Lucas Siow started the tournament strong, finishing as the only undefeated team on Day 1. The three have been playing together a while, and often referred to themselves as “Team Lucas’s Basement,” after a group chat they have with other locals and Magic tournament practice in, one would assume, Lucas’s basement.


Though they picked up a few losses on Day 2, they never stopped leading the standings. In the Top 4, their task was a daunting one. First, they had to defeat Tiu/Tomajko/Walker, then Nelson/Manfield/Braun-Duin.Not to be stopped, McLaughlin, Harabas, and Siow defended their Day 1 start and their hometown of Toronto (and Lucas's basement).


Congratulations to Morgan McLaughlin, Chris Harabas, and Lucas Siow!

### Round 12 Feature Match: Brad Nelson vs. Paulo Vitor Damo Da Rosa (Standard)


by Corey Burkhart




 Deep into day two at Grand Prix Toronto, we found two of the best teams in the field with their sights set on the top four. On one side sat Brad Nelson, Seth Manfield, and Brian Braun Duin, on the...](/en/events/coverage/gptor18-teams/round-12-feature-match-brad-nelson-vs-paulo-vitor-damo-da-rosa)





Day 1 Coverage



Three hundred eighty-nine teams gathered in Toronto's Enercare Centre on this grey Saturday to play Team Trios Constructed. While it rained outside, inside it was a storm of Standard, Modern, and Legacy as teammates battled side by side, striving for the 6-2 or better record that would allow them to return tomorrow to play for a chance at the Top 4.


This is one of only a handful of Grand Prix whose formats match that of Pro Tour 25th Anniversary, and teams finishing well enough in Toronto will qualify for that PT. But here, sitting down across from one pro player often means sitting down across from three, as daunting teams like Damo Da Rosa/Stark/Froehlich, Jensen/Turtenwald/Duke, Larsen/Floch/Hendriks, Sigrist/Rubin/Hayne, and Wescoe/Sajgalik/Dezani dot the field.


At the end of Day 1, only one team remained undefeated – locals Morgan McLaughlin, Chris Harabas, and Lucas Siow. With the Standard format still in flux from week to week and cards from Dominaria shaking up even Modern, it's sure to be a weekend full of exciting innovation and play. Join us again tomorrow for the conclusion!
