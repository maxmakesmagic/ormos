*Magic 2015* is, in large part, the story of [Garruk Wildspeaker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Garruk+Wildspeaker) and his descent into darkness. One of the members of the original "*Lorwyn* Five" Planeswalkers, Garruk's large piece of the story (and card) will be revealed in time. But we're not here to talk about Garruk today.


Every story—whether it's about a hero's journey or a fall from grace—needs an antagonist, a foil, an opposing force to the main character and often a spark that sets everything in motion.


For Garruk, that antagonist is [Liliana Vess](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Liliana+Vess), who fought Garruk and [cursed him](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=245251) with the Chain Veil.


We've seen Liliana take a few forms over the years after her original appearance.

This *Innistrad* incarnation of Liliana tore everything down around her, from cards in hand to creatures in play to half of your opponent's permanents, if she stayed in play long enough.


Liliana returned in *Magic 2013* and *Magic 2014* from the dark realms.

Here, Liliana makes her allegiances to black mana more than clear, with every single ability referencing Swamps in some capacity. She searches, she slices, she dices—as long as Swamps are involved.


Liliana, still hunted by Garruk, returns in *Magic 2015*, in every sense of the word.


[See Liliana's return to form in *Magic 2015*](no-matter).

It's fitting that, just as Garruk's journey takes a turn, we see the original Liliana that started him on his [dark path](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/beast-2014-06-18).



And tune in Monday when we reveal just how far Liliana has pushed Garruk in *Magic 2015*...
