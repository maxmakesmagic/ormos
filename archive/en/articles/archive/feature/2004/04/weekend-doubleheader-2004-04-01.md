### Next Standalone Magic Set Announced

The Fall 2004 **Magic** set, formerly codenamed "Earth" has had a change of codename; it will now be referred to in internal documents as "Dungeons." It will kick off a block devoted to classical medieval fantasy themes, which will culminate in the third set, scheduled to be released in Summer 2005, codenamed "Dragons." **Magic** brand and R&D are especially excited about the middle set, which they have been referring to as "&".

"This is the first set ever to have a codename that's a single punctuation mark," enthused Mark Rosewater. "That's trivia gold! I'm going to be ask people to name the set with the shortest codename for *years*."

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/mtgcom/fcpics/features/ash8_spellfire.jpg)At the same time the codenames were changed, "Dungeons" was given its official name: ***Spellfire***. The combination of **Magic: The Gathering** and **Dungeons & Dragons** will provide synergy by thinking outside the box and allow Wizards of the Coast to take the initiative in leveraging its scalable core values into an explosion of streamlined buzzwords which will take the marketing world by storm. Or something like that, anyway."

Of course, rules and terminology of the game had to be adjusted slightly in order to fully immerse “Spellfire” players in a **D&D** experience. For example, players will roll a D20 to determine initiative at the beginning of each combat step. Also, in addition to buying new cards, players will be expected to occasionally purchase entirely new rulebooks.

Among the new game mechanics to be introduced in ***Spellfire*** is the “Saving Throw” which will occasionally allow a player to halve the damage they would take from a spell. A mechanic which will be welcomed by Pro Tour players is the sliding life total mechanic; players in Premier tournaments will get to start with a life total equal to the number of Pro Points they currently have instead of just 20.

R&D hasn't said what sets will follow ***Spellfire***, although the phrases "Blood Wars", "Wyvern", and "Let's just release *Fallen Empires* again; who'd notice?" have been heard.

### Wizards of the Coast Sold to German Consortium

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/mtgcom/fcpics/features/ash8_german.jpg)In a move that shocked industry insiders (by which I mean "people on message boards"), Hasbro has just announced that it will be selling the Wizards of the Coast business to a small company from Germany. Although Wizards of the Coast continues to be tremendously profitable, the offer was simply too much money to ignore.

The German Company has only three employees, counting its President/CEO, Kai Budde. "We at Phoenix Foundation have been pursuing this goal for some time. The introduction of the Team format allowed Dirk Baberowski, Marco Blume, and myself to leverage our skills and put together enough cash to initiate a hostile takeover. Hasbro didn't want to lose their whole company, so they had no choice other than to sell us WotC."

The new owners haven't announced any new policies yet, although it's anticipated that they will roll back the rules banning employees from playing on the Pro Tour.

### Magic Trivia

Last week's Question:

*What card's name is an anagram for **Magic's** creator?*

This was an easy one: **[Giant Trap Door Spider](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Giant+Trap+Door+Spider)** is an anagram for the man who created Magic, **Sir Ronpert da Togipad**, the noted Italian explorer, who invented the game on his historic seventeenth-century trip around the Cape of Good Hope.

New question:

*How many [Arcbound Worker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arcbound+Worker)s does it take to screw in a lightbulb?*

(Please do not e-mail me the answers. The correct answer will be posted in next week's column.)
