Due to complications related to COVID-19, some retailers in North America will experience delays and availability issues on certain *Magic* SKUs. Below is a running list in order of release date. All references to retailers mean only those retailers.


Please note that the timelines below are estimates only. This list represents the best information currently available, but the situation is fluid. If we receive updates that change the status below, we will notify WPN members via email, social media, and our distribution channels.


In the meantime, we are working hard to minimize the impact and resolve issues quickly. We appreciate your understanding.


*Secret Lair*: Ultimate Edition
===============================


North American Launch Date: June 12


Retailers in the United States can expect to receive *Secret Lair*: Ultimate Edition within approximately one month of the June 12 US release date. (Canada is unaffected.)


Specific timing depends on each store's distributor. Some retailers could receive *Secret Lair* within the shorter window of a few days from launch. Any changes or additional delays that might occur will vary. Please check with your local game store for updates.


*Core Set 2021* Bundles
=======================


North American Launch Date: July 3


Due to production delays, *Core Set 2021* will launch with fewer Bundles than originally planned. Some retailers may experience availability issues at launch. Product will be available, but in smaller quantities than originally intended.


We expect these availability issues to be resolved within (approximately) one week following the North American launch.


*Core Set 2021* Planeswalker Decks and *Arena* Starter Kits
===========================================================


North American Launch Date: July 3


**Please note that the these are the only confirmed delays to the product mix for *Core Set 2021*. Draft Boosters, Collector Boosters, Prerelease Packs, and so on, are unaffected.**


*Core Set 2021* Planeswalker Decks and *Arena* Starter Kits will be unavailable at launch. This includes the Planeswalker Decks included in M21 Prerelease allocations, as well as the *Arena* Starter Kits included in the new player experience kit.


We're working to resolve the delay as quickly as possible. We'll provide updates via social media and through our distribution partners once that information becomes available.


*Jumpstart*
===========


North American Launch Date: July 17


Some retailers will experience availability issues at launch. The product will be available but in smaller quantities than originally intended.


However, we also have a fun taste of *Jumpstart* planned for M21's Buy-a-Box promotion. Each Buy-a-Box will also come with two *Jumpstart* boosters to give you a sample of how fun this set can be. Those Buy-a-Box *Jumpstart* boosters are unaffected by this delay.
