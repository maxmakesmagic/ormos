For those planning to hear me talk about flashback, you're going to have to wait a week. My teaser last week accidentally talked about the next theme week that doesn't happen until seven days from now. That means I have this week free to talk about anything I want. Luckily, Ethan provided me with a topic in [his feature article](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/feature/171) last week when he broached an issue that I've been meaning to talk about for quite some time. So as long as I have a free week, let's talk about something Ramp;D has been up to for over three years (and the work leading up to it for three more), a little something we call New World Order. 

Today's column will introduce you to a big problem we had to solve, the solution that problem led to, and the realization that our solution not only solved our problem but made the game better overall. There's a lot to cover, so let's get started.

Problem Solving
As our story is all about solving a problem, I believe the best place to begin is with the problem itself. To do this, we need to go back about six years. I often talk about how we track a lot of numbers. Part of running a business is understanding how things are going, and six years ago we had a big problem. One of our most important numbers, the number of people who play **Magic**, was going down. We did a lot of research and discovered the cause: our acquisition was on the decline. In other words, fewer people were learning to play **Magic**. The big question was: Why? What about **Magic** was keeping new players from wanting to play the game?

We studied the problem and found a culprit that I often talk about: complexity creep. Let me show you what I'm talking about.
