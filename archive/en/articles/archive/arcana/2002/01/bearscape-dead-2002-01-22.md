[Dawn of the Dead](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dawn+of+the+Dead) was originally the name of card in *Odyssey*: a black enchantment that read, "![](https://web.archive.org/web/20211201201921im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless1.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227195556im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/black.gif), remove two cards in your graveyard from the game: put a 2/2 black zombie creature token into play." But at the last minute, R&D decided that the card needed to be green, so they switched it into what we all know now as [Bearscape](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bearscape).

However, everyone liked the name "Dawn of the Dead," and art had already been commissioned, so they purposefully made a *Torment* card that could use them.
