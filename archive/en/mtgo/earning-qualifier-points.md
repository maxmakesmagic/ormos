Earning Qualifier Points
------------------------


LEAGUES AND QUEUES
==================


The most common way players earn QPs is through Leagues and Queues. Performing well in these events will provide players with QPs that they can accumulate over the course of the season. Once a player has earned 40 or more QPs in the current season, they can use them to join an upcoming Premier Play event in that season.


Here is a list of QP earnings via Leagues and Queues:





| EVENT | ROUNDS | RESULT | QP |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Draft League | 3 | 3 Wins | 2 |
| Swiss Draft or Phantom Draft Queue | 3 | 3 Wins | 2 |
| Single Elimination Draft Queue | 3 | 1st Place | 3 |
| 2nd Place | 1 |
| Competitive Sealed or Constructed Leagues | 5 | 5 Wins | 5 |
| 4 Wins | 2 |
| 3 Wins | 1 |



For full prize breakdowns of Leagues and Queues, check out the [Limited Events](https://magic.wizards.com/en/MTGO/content/magic-online-limited-events) and [Constructed Events](https://magic.wizards.com/en/MTGO/content/magic-online-constructed-events) pages.

PRELIMINARIES

FORMAT CHALLENGES
=================


Held exclusively on the weekends, Format Challenges are Swiss-style scheduled events that feature a Top 8 playoff and provide a big tournament feel. These are great places to practice for Qualifiers since the structures are similar with the added benefit of earning a good number of QPs if you do well.


Each format's Challenges happen the same time each weekend on the schedule below. Players who reach the Top 8 of each Challenge will earn QPs they can use to join future Premier Play events.


Challenges are divided into two prize structures based on the minimum number of players: Large Challenges require a minimum of 64 players, and Small Challenges need at least 32.


* Modern and Legacy formats use the Large Event structure.
* Pioneer, Standard, Vintage, and Pauper formats use the Small Event structure.
