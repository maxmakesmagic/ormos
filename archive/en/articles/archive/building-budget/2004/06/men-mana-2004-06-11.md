![Manakin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Manakin)When *Mirrodin* came out I was ecstatic to see that there was a whole cycle of cards similar to one of my favorite cards – *Manakin*. These creatures looked really cool and they all produced different colors of mana. Naturally I joked about building decks full of Myr, but for Myr Week I actually got the chance to do just that. The trick to using Myr effectively is having many 4 casting cost spells in the deck since that's the casting cost that the Myr accelerate you toward best. However, things change a bit when you have an overwhelming number of Myr, because of the potential to become simply flooded with mana. So one of the most important keys to utilizing a deck filled with Myr is having a great outlet for all that mana.Attack you for one.

This deck tends to drop all of its cards into play by the fifth turn – the mana outlet that you so desperately will be seeking at that point will come to you in the form of [Myr Matrix](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Myr+Matrix).

Now I can attack you for two!

The matrix tends to eat up tons of mana when you have nothing better to do. Other good mana outlets are moving [Loxodon Warhammer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Loxodon+Warhammer) around between your attackers and defenders. Since I wanted to cram lots of Myr into the deck, I did not leave much room for removal, save for a few piping hot [Fireball](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fireball)s. You see, the thing about [Fireball](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fireball) and [Myr Matrix](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Myr+Matrix) is that they want mana. Myrs will give you lots of mana, but to really abuse them another level of mana production should be added – so in come the Urzatron and [Cloudpost](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloudpost)s to save the day. Normally it is difficult to play both the Urzatron *and* [Cloudpost](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloudpost)s in the same deck due to the amount of colored mana they displace in your deck, but the Men of Mana make their own colors, and they are not afraid to use a little help from Urza – after all, in a way Urza is the great-granddad of all Myr.

[Fireball](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fireball) you for seventeen.

  
*Who needs to choose? Use ‘em all!*

![](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Great+Furnace)

















  
One of the better draws you can hope to achieve with this deck is turn one [Cloudpost](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloudpost). Turn two [Cloudpost](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloudpost), Myr. Turn 3 [Arcbound Crusher](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arcbound+Crusher) and another Myr with a third land. Turn 4 [Myr Matrix](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Myr+Matrix) and from there start making more Myrs with the matrix while growing your Crusher and attacking. Most draws won't go exactly like this of course, but they will often be somewhat similar. [Lodestone Myr](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lodestone+Myr) and [Arcbound Crusher](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arcbound+Crusher) were made to be in the same deck I think, since they go so well together with lots of artifacts. The Crusher wants you to play more artifacts while the [Lodestone Myr](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lodestone+Myr) wants more artifacts in play. It is a match made in heaven. 

[Myr Matrix](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Myr+Matrix) works surprisingly well with [Lodestone Myr](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lodestone+Myr) as well. The big downside of the Matrix is usually that you have to take a whole turn to cast it and wait before starting to reap the benefits. [Lodestone Myr](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lodestone+Myr) turns that turn into a +2/+2…he gets bonuses from both the ability of [Myr Matrix](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Myr+Matrix) *and* the fact that it can be tapped to make him stronger. After that turn, you can make a 2/2 every turn that can also pump your [Lodestone Myr](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lodestone+Myr) more if needed.

Use your [Loxodon Warhammer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Loxodon+Warhammer)s to stay alive by attacking with an equipped creature and then handing it off to a little Myr for defense – this will allow the little Myr to block and trade with an opposing creature while bolstering your life total. If things get dicey you can always block with multiple [Myr Matrix](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Myr+Matrix) tokens to trade with creatures. If things are still going bad, that's when you pull your [Fireball](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fireball)s out of your hat and just blow everything to smithereens…

Ah, smithereens, you've got to love smithereens…

Don't look at me like that.

Hey, I am doing my best to restrain myself from making cheesy Matrix jokes, at least let me enjoy my smithereens…

### Tips on Playing the Deck

* ![Arcbound Crusher](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Arcbound+Crusher)Even though [Arcbound Crusher](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arcbound+Crusher) is not a Myr, it is very good at, well, crushing things. They are invaluable to your victory plan. Things couldn't be going better than when you have two crushers in play – the duplicate's ready to receive the mighty bounty of counters whenever its brethren dies!
* There are three basic ways the deck wins – large quantities of trample damage, large Fireballs, or attacking with a number of Myr equal to you opponent's creatures plus their life total (via [Myr Matrix](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Myr+Matrix)). Try to identify which way you are attempting to win with earlier in the game so you can set up for it properly.
* Every damage counts…it might as well be the motto of the Myr. Getting that 1 extra point of damage in with a mana Myr might make all the difference when you are trying to Fireball your opponent out.
* Don't forget that your [Great Furnace](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Great+Furnace)s will help the [Arcbound Crusher](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arcbound+Crusher) and the [Lodestone Myr](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lodestone+Myr)
* Often you will be faced with the choice of activating [Myr Matrix](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Myr+Matrix) or playing more spells from your hand. Generally activating the matrix is better, unless your spells are one of your 4 drops or another [Myr Matrix](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Myr+Matrix).

### Adding more Money to the Deck

![Temporal Cascade](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Temporal+Cascade)My original build of the deck used extra mana by casting [Temporal Cascade](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Temporal+Cascade) (mode depending on situation) which I really enjoyed since I never had the pleasure of casting the card prior to this deck. Even though it is a lot of mana to cast, let me assure you that the effect is quite powerful and worth the cost if you have the mana anyways. Of course, this was before I ran the Urzatron (you need a bit more blue mana for the Cascade version) but it might be worth a shot if you enjoy [Timetwister](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Timetwister)ing. If you are using *Fifth Dawn* cards, I recommend trying some Sunburst cards since the Myr can make many different colors of mana…even the bringer might be a good add. My [Temporal Cascade](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Temporal+Cascade) version also used [Karona, False God](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Karona%2C+False+God) to create a killing blow if I couldn't punch my way through with the 4 drops. The sight of many angry 4/4 Myrs backed by Karona is scary indeed!Until next time, [Vedalken Engineer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Vedalken%2BEngineer) to play colorless spells.
