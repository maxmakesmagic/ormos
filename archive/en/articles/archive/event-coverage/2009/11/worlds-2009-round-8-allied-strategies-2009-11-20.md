**Robert Jurkovic vs. David Ochoa**


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/worlds09/r8_jurkovic_ochoa.jpg)*Robert Jurkovic and David Ochoa are playing 39 lands between them.*David Ochoa from the United States is running pretty well at the moment. Following good finishes at PT–Austin, GP–Tampa, and GP–Minneapolis, the channelfireball.com writer sat down for Round 8 with a record of 6-1 to battle against Robert Jurkovic in the second round of *Zendikar* draft. Ochoa is a prolific drafter who regularly writes up detailed draft coverage for his articles, along with florid descriptions of the games that follow.


I cannot commit to a “good vs. evil” piece of prose (as Ochoa does weekly), but hopefully you’ll be able to keep up with how the match went.


Ochoa’s opponent, Robert Jurkovic, is having a pretty good weekend himself. Qualified for the **Magic Online** Championship Series here at the World Championships, he is playing in the main event with some success, along with playing in a second big money tournament this weekend. Jurkovic, along with former Player of the Year Shouta Yasooka and six other players, is in the Championship series, with a shot at winning $13,000 if he can prevail across the Online Classic, *Zendikar* draft, and Standard formats.


**Game 1**


Jurkovic was on the play and led with [Jwar Isle Refuge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jwar+Isle+Refuge), while Ochoa’s start of [Mountain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mountain), [Expedition Map](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Expedition+Map) suggested that he too was multi-colour. This wasn’t further realised in the early turns though, as Ochoa played a series of [Mountain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mountain)s, and a [Molten Ravager](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Molten+Ravager) as his first creature. Jurkovic had a [Stonework Puma](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stonework+Puma) as his first threat, and a [Gatekeeper of Malakir](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gatekeeper+of+Malakir) soon after to allow attacking to commence.


A [Grappling Hook](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grappling+Hook) came down for Ochoa, followed by a second [Molten Ravager](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Molten+Ravager). Jurkovic had a [Hagra Diabolist](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hagra+Diabolist) to drain with, and soon attacked in with his team. Ochoa took the bait and blocked with his Ravager, pumping it to kill off [Hagra Diabolist](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hagra+Diabolist). This led Jurkovic to pull the trigger on [Marsh Casualties](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Marsh+Casualties), finishing off Ravager number 2. A [Grim Discovery](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grim+Discovery) returned the Diabolist, and it was back to Ochoa.


David was sorely short on threats, though he did manage to kill off some of Jurkovic’s with a series of copies of [Spire Barrage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spire+Barrage). All the while though Jurkovic was plinking in for small hits, not giving Ochoa time to stabilise. While Ochoa did find a [Valakut, the Molten Pinnacle](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Valakut%2C+the+Molten+Pinnacle) with his Exploration Map, it was too little too late, with [Hagra Diabolist](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hagra+Diabolist) returning to the fray, soon joined by [Nimana Sell-Sword](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nimana+Sell-Sword). This life loss plus a larger attack force was enough to finish Ochoa off.

**Game 2**


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/worlds09/r8_jurkovic.jpg)*Robert Jurkovic has had some heartbreaking Top 8 misses, but this weekend he gets two tries.*Both players kept their seven, and Ochoa started his offence with [Zektar Shrine Expedition](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Zektar+Shrine+Expedition). For Jurkovic, the beginning was [Verdant Catacombs](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Verdant+Catacombs) to fetch a [Swamp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swamp), and a [Grim Discovery](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grim+Discovery) for rebuys on his fetch land.


While Jurkovic was doing just fine for land, Ochoa missed his third land drop, merely playing [Plated Geopede](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plated+Geopede) and passing. [Gatekeeper of Malakir](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gatekeeper+of+Malakir)’s kicker was sufficient to kill off the insect. Ochoa was not out of this though. Hitting consecutive land drops, a [Molten Ravager](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Molten+Ravager) first served as a solid road block, before [Bladetusk Boar](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bladetusk+Boar) came along to begin attacking. Jurkovic, who stalled a little on blue mana, did have a [Stonework Puma](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stonework+Puma) to block with, and a [Surrakar Marauder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Surrakar+Marauder) with which to play his own intimidation game, but Ochoa seemed happy to get involved in a race. He had a [Slaughter Cry](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Slaughter+Cry) to stop [Stonework Puma](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stonework+Puma) from securing a trade with the Boar, and [Adventuring Gear](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Adventuring+Gear) to make the now unblockable monster’s clock that much shorter. [Ruinous Minotaur](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ruinous+Minotaur) from Ochoa left the American with just one card in hand.


Jurkovic remained passive, observing the situation he was now in without showing undue concern. He cast a [Bala Ged Thief](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bala+Ged+Thief) to take the [Spire Barrage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spire+Barrage) which was Ochoa’s last card. A [Grappling Hook](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grappling+Hook) from Ochoa looked to have the potential to end things with its double strike giving power. Jurkovic, wary of a big turn from his opponent, used a [Vampire Hexmage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vampire+Hexmage) to remove the counters from [Zektar Shrine Expedition](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Zektar+Shrine+Expedition).


The combination of [Grappling Hook](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grappling+Hook) and [Ruinous Minotaur](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ruinous+Minotaur) was looking like a winner for Ochoa. While Jurkovic had creatures, they would likely be cold to 5 power of first strike, and Ochoa could be sure that he wouldn’t have to sacrifice much land. While the Minotaur was playing crowd control, [Bladetusk Boar](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bladetusk+Boar) was able to crash in, taking down Jurkovic’s life total in sizeable chunks. When Ochoa finally killed off the last of Jurkovic’s blockers, it was not a big task for him to finish off his opponent.

**Game 3**


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/worlds09/r8_ochoa.jpg)*channelFireball.com’s David Ochoa*Both players had mono-coloured starts for Game 3. Ochoa led with [Ruinous Minotaur](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ruinous+Minotaur), while Jurkovic’s first creature was [Bala Ged Thief](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bala+Ged+Thief). Ochoa, after a little thought, discarded a [Spidersilk Net](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spidersilk+Net) to the rare Ally’s ability. Ochoa had a bit of a quandary about whether or not to attack. After playing his fourth land and a [Bladetusk Boar](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bladetusk+Boar), he came in unopposed.


Jurkovic was all about the Allies this game. He followed up his thief with [Hagra Diabolist](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hagra+Diabolist), hitting Ochoa for two, and allowing him to force the discard of [Molten Ravager](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Molten+Ravager), while seeing a second Ravager sat in Ochoa’s hand.


[Adventuring Gear](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Adventuring+Gear) on [Bladetusk Boar](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bladetusk+Boar), followed by a land, seemed apt to mean that the card advantage Jurkovic was gaining through his thief might not be relevant. Ochoa crashed in, and Jurkovic threw his [Hagra Diabolist](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hagra+Diabolist) in the way of [Ruinous Minotaur](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ruinous+Minotaur) to save some life, before returning it with [Grim Discovery](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grim+Discovery).


[Nimana Sell-Sword](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nimana+Sell-Sword) meant that Jurkovic could take [Spire Barrage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spire+Barrage) from Ochoa’s hand, but attacks from David still took him to 7. Ochoa played a [Molten Ravager](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Molten+Ravager) and passed. The Ally train rumbled onward with [Hagra Diabolist](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hagra+Diabolist), taking [Torch Slinger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Torch+Slinger), leaving Ochoa empty handed. Thanks to Diabolist burn, and some attacks from Jurkovic the life totals were seven apiece. Ochoa attacked, to force a block that would mean Jurkovic was one point short on the swing back.
