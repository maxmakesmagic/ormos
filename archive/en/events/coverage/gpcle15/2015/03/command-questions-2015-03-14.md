I caught up with some of the most talented planeswalkers here in Cleveland this weekend to ask, “Why is this command so good?”



**Dromoka’s Command - Brian Braun-Duin**

“At the absolute worst, it’s [Abzan Advantage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Abzan+Advantage), which is already a playable card in Standard. All four of the abilities are relevant and versatile and the card is super inexpensive. I think it’s the best of the new commands.”



**Ojutai’s Command - Cedric Phillips**

“[Dismiss](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dismiss) is a great Magic card. The other lines of text matter sometimes... and that’s relevant!”



**Atarka’s Command - Ross Merriam**

“Atarka’s Command is [Skullcrack](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skullcrack) at the very least, and that’s a great card. The card seems like it could be very good alongside [Goblin Rabblemaster](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Rabblemaster) in Standard. Additionally, being able to put a land in play seems very good for the Red/Green decks. Now, instead of playing two very awkward copies of Rattleclaw Mystic, we get to play four of this and all the cards in our deck will be good.”



**Silumgar’s Command - Gerard Fabiano**

“Silumgar’s Command has all the versatility you want in a control deck. The card helps you catch up when you’re behind and usually seals the deal when you’re ahead. It’s basically always a two for one in any situation.”



**Kolaghan’s Command - Adam Yurchick**

“Kolaghan’s Command is a flexible card advantage spell. Normally discard can be dead in the late game, but the fact that this is an instant means that we can use it during our opponent’s draw step. In the early game it’s a reasonably costed removal spell, and as the game goes later the ability to get a creature back from the graveyard while making the opponent discard during their draw step becomes very powerful. One of the best parts about the card is that it’s less conditional than the other Commands.”
