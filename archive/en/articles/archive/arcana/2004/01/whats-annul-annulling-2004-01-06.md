When [Annul](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Annul), the *Urza's Saga* counterspell that targets artifact and enchantment spells, was reprinted in *Mirrodin*, new art was commissioned for it. Brian Snoddy got the assignment of illustrating the reprint, and when he read [Annul](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Annul)'s art description -- 



> 
> *This spell disassembles an artifact before it's even fully "summoned."*
> 

-- he decided to depict another *Mirrodin* artifact being "pre-disassembled" in its art. Can you recognize the artifact? Here's **[Annul](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Annul)**:

And here's the artifact [Annul](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Annul) is countering. It's **[Chromatic Sphere](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chromatic+Sphere)** -- another *Mirrodin* reprint illustrated by Brian Snoddy!

It remains to be seen whether anyone has actually [Annul](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Annul)ed a [Chromatic Sphere](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chromatic+Sphere) in a game of **Magic**, however.
