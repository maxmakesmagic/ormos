### Game 1


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/frnat04/fm4_1.jpg)Olivier's opening hand had a [Razor Golem](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Razor+Golem) and no [Plains](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plains), but he kept as he had at least got some castable cards. Caumes had the games first play, a [Myr Servitor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Myr+Servitor), and Olivier found a [Plains](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plains) for his [Pteron Ghost](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pteron+Ghost), then a Krark-clan Stoker. He had to stop attacking when Ben played a [Fatespinner](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fatespinner). Both players built up, Olivier with the [Razor Golem](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Razor+Golem) and an [Auriok Windwalker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Auriok+Windwalker), Benjamin with a [Spire Golem](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spire+Golem), a [Thermal Navigator](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thermal+Navigator) and then a Quicksliver Behemoth.


They agreed to a split, the loser had to buy the winner a sandwich. At the venue's prices this was equivalent to a 50-50 split in a Pro Tour Final. Dinner dealt with, they continued the game. Ben attacked with the Behemoth and it was triple-blocked by [Pteron Ghost](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pteron+Ghost), [Krark-Clan Stoker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Krark-Clan+Stoker) and [Razor Golem](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Razor+Golem). Caumes [Terror](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Terror)ed the Stoker and forced Ruel to Bolt the Behemoth to kill it. Olivier was a few cards down, and in trouble when Caumes drew an Empryial Plate.


Caumes equipped it to the [Spire Golem](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spire+Golem) and attacked, Olivier blocked and cast [Unforge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Unforge) on the Plate. This would have killed it but Ben remembered to sacrifice the Plate to his [Thermal Navigator](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thermal+Navigator) in response. The Auriok had taken two and Ben finished it with a [Consume Spirit](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Consume+Spirit). Olivier drew a [Loxodon Mystic](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Loxodon+Mystic) but was still in trouble, it's hard to race when there is a [Fatespinner](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fatespinner) in play. He had another good topdeck on his next turn, [Loxodon Anchorite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Loxodon+Anchorite), allowing him to stabilize some more.


With no more damage getting through on either side, both players built up their forces. Ben had cast a [Ensouled Scimitar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ensouled+Scimitar), [Lumengrid Sentinel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lumengrid+Sentinel), and [Somber Hoverguard](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Somber+Hoverguard), Olivier a [Darksteel Gargoyle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Darksteel+Gargoyle) and [Leonin Battlemage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leonin+Battlemage). Olivier was choosing to skip his attack step to the [Fatespinner](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fatespinner) each turn. Ben made a [Hoverguard Observer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hoverguard+Observer), and then an artifact land, which allowed the Sentinel to tap the [Darksteel Gargoyle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Darksteel+Gargoyle). Caumes attacked for six in the air dropping Olivier to nine. He couldn't attack the next turn since he didn't draw another artifact to tap the Gargoyle.


Olivier drew a [Healer's Headdress](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Healer%27s+Headdress), it was looking like a long game at that point. Then Ben drew a [Cackling Imp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cackling+Imp) to change the games complexion entirely. Olivier answered with a topdeck of his own - [Spikeshot Goblin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spikeshot+Goblin). With the Battlemage in play, the Goblin would make short work of Caumes' team. Olivier drew a [Taj-Nar Swordsmith](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Taj-Nar+Swordsmith) and fetched his Longbow as well. Caumes didn't draw anything that dealt wih the Goblin or Longbow, and after getting a few of his creatures destroyed they moved on to Game 2. At this point there were less than twenty minutes left in the round.

### Game 2


Ben had to mulligan at the start of Game 2, and then missed his second land drop despite casting a [Serum Visions](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Serum+Visions). Olivier played a [Spikeshot Goblin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spikeshot+Goblin), a [Viridian Longbow](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Viridian+Longbow) and a Healers Headdress while Caumes struggled to find enough land to play anything. Caumes' second land allowed him to play an [Empyrial Plate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Empyrial+Plate), and then a third allowed him to play [Fleshgrafter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fleshgrafter).


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/frnat04/fm4_2.jpg)Olivier had an [Electrostatic Bolt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Electrostatic+Bolt) in hand, but figured it wasnt worth trying to kill the [Fleshgrafter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fleshgrafter) as Ben almost certainly had an artifact in hand. Instead he cast a [Razor Golem](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Razor+Golem) and they began to race.


Ben just had the [Fleshgrafter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fleshgrafter) and Olivier just played a couple of chump-blockers, [Steel Wall](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Steel+Wall) and [Taj-Nar Swordsmith](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Taj-Nar+Swordsmith). Ben was down to nine when he found a [Terror](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Terror) for the Spikeshot. Olivier attacked him down to six with the Golem then put him to four with a [Magma Giant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Magma+Giant). He was only on eleven himself so the Giant also had to chump-block. This left [Razor Golem](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Razor+Golem) and an enormous [Fleshgrafter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fleshgrafter) as the only creatures. Caumes cast a [Fatespinner](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fatespinner) to try and chump the Golem, but Ruel used the [Electrostatic Bolt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Electrostatic+Bolt) he had been holding the whole game and attacked for the win
