And while you're there, get ready to join [#TheHunt](https://twitter.com/hashtag/thehunt)! Use your photography skills to hunt down Garruk and some of **Magic**'s most iconic Planeswalkers being cosplayed by your fellow PAX East attendees. Upload your photos and you could win a VIP trip for two to PAX Prime in Seattle! (Includes airfare, hotel, PAX Prime four-day passes, VIP tickets to the **Magic** PAX Party, and more!) Rules for the contest will be posted when the contest begins.
