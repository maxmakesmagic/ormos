![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/AMCHAMP01/973.jpg)*Greg Lowe vs. Jeremy Quinn*Greg is playing a Wild Research deck today, and has a respectable record of 3-0-1. The red enchantment that makes up the heart of his deck has been a major focal point of Internet discussion over the past few weeks, with various writers all chiming in with their suggestions for breaking this powerful yet tricky card. Jeremy is playing a variant of the Saproling Cluster/Static Orb/Opposition deck, which is commonly referred to as "Saproling Burt". The major change he made to his deck was to include Nether Spirit, which serves the dual purpose of being an alternate win condition, as well as holding off attackers.


### Game 1


Greg played first, and cast Millstone past Jeremy's one untapped island. Jeremy responded with Opt, and the Millstone resolved. Jeremy cast an Accumulated Knowledge, and Greg played his own, netting one card more. Millstone was activated on Jeremy's end step, and in response, Brainstorm was cast. This allowed Jeremy to manipulate his library and lose only the cards he wanted to. This plan was proved to be very beneficial, as he put a Nether Spirit on top of his library, and it was milled off. It came into play on the following upkeep, and the race between Millstone and the Spirit was now on.


Reviving Vapors was played by Greg on Jeremy's end step, and it was Counterspelled. Nether Spirit began its attack, while Greg's Millstone continued to go to work. Things slowed down somewhat for Greg, who was stuck at five lands. This is significant in a control mirror match, since the player with the most lands is capable of countering more spells on one turn. An Opposition was cast by Jeremy, but it was Counterspelled. A Nether Spirit was milled away, and it popped back into play on Jeremy's turn. This doubled his damage clock, but meant that Wrath of God would nullify his offense.


With the clock ticking, Greg played Reviving Vapors, hoping to gain some life and dig into a Wrath and/or some more lands. It was Foiled, and Greg untapped, finally playing another land. It was a Battlefield Forge, and it gave him the red mana necessary to cast Wild Research, which resolved. The Spirits continued to deal four damage a turn, and Greg was running out of time. He used Wild Research on end step, using the white ability to search out Teferi's Moat, which would hold off the Nether Spirit beatdown. Getting it to resolve, however, would be an entirely different matter. Absorb was randomly discarded to the Research.


Greg now untapped, and played the Moat. Jeremy responded with an alternate casting cost Gush, tapping the lands for mana before they were returned to his hand. He then used Foil to counter the Moat. This was reason enough for Greg to concede.


Lowe- 0 Quinn- 1


### Game 2


Play started off slowly this game, with both players hesitant to make the first move. Jeremy went up to eight cards and pitched Nether Spirit, giving him a clock to work with. It popped back into play on the following turn, and Jeremy followed by tapping out for Opposition. It resolved, and the Spirit was used to tap Greg's only red source. However, Greg was ready with a tech answer, as he played Teferi's Response. Jeremy was in a mild state of disbelief, and he called over a judge to make sure that Greg was really going to gain that much card economy. Indeed, the Opposition was destroyed, and Greg drew two cards to boot.


Regardless, the Nether Spirit started its attack. Jeremy used Land Grant to get a green source, but had to show Greg his hand, which included three Saproling Cluster, Gainsay, Squee, Counterspell and Accumulated Knowledge. After seeing those green threats, Greg decided the Land Grant was a spell worth fighting over. A counterwar resulted, which was won by Jeremy. An Accumulated Knowledge later left Jeremy tapped out, and Greg used the opportunity to play Boil. Jeremy responded with Gush, and Boil destroyed three islands.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/AMCHAMP01/975.jpg)*Greg Lowe*Still, this left Jeremy with only one land in play. Greg continued to gain card advantage by playing Accumulated Knowledge, which allowed him to draw four cards. Jeremy then played Saproling Cluster on his turn, and Greg was waiting with Counterspell. Greg had gained a significant amount of card advantage this game, but still had to deal with the Nether Spirit before it defeated him. He finally played an answer in Scorching Lava with kicker, which resolved. He then followed up by finally playing a win condition: Millstone. Jeremy tried to slow down the game with Static Orb, but Greg still had countermagic left. A Saproling Cluster did manage to resolve, but was slightly unimpressive in the current board situation.


With Jeremy on the ropes, Greg used Reviving Vapors to dig into Wild Research. It was then played, and Greg now had complete control of the game. However, Jeremy did have a small chance. He discarded Squee to produce a Saproling token. Boil was searched out to shift the game even further in Greg's favor. Jeremy was entirely out of lands except for one forest. The Cluster was still at work producing creatures with the help of Squee, but Greg did have a Research out. He used it to get Orim's Thunder. The Research forced a land to be randomly discarded. The Thunder was now cast with kicker, leaving Jeremy with no permanents other than a forest and a Saproling.


A second Millstone was soon played by Greg, increasing his clock. The Saproling continued to attack, and the Millstone put a Nether Spirit in Jeremy's graveyard. Greg realized that the Spirit would come back to attack him, so he milled twice on his turn hoping to hit another Spirit. He did not, but three Squees were milled off along the way. This wasn't entirely impressive, although if Jeremy could get a Cluster to resolve at this point it would swing the game heavily in his favor.


The Nether Spirit came into play on Jeremy's next upkeep, joining forces with the hardest working Saproling in the room. Greg realized he needed an answer to the clock on the table, so he searched out Teferi's Moat. The card discarded at random was Rout. The game now approached a tense moment. Greg had gone down to six life points, and his Millstones had left only a few cards in Jeremy's library. He searched out Urza's Rage, and randomly discarded Wild Research.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/AMCHAMP01/974.jpg)*Jeremy Quinn*The next attack brought Greg down to three life, while Jeremy's graveyard dwarfed the size of his library. Static Orb was cast to slow down Greg, and in response Research was activated to get a Counterspell. At this point, time was called. Plains was discarded at random, and Counterspell was now added to the stack, targeting Static Orb. Jeremy responded with an alternate casting cost Foil. This put Greg in a strange situation. If he got into a counterwar over the Orb, he would not be able to use both his Millstones on end step. Jeremy had seven cards left in his library. However, Static Orb resolving would be just as bad, since it would slow down his milling capability. To add complexity to this decision, Greg was at three, and was facing an attack of three on Jeremy's next turn.


The Thwart resolved, and Static Orb hit play. Mageta, the Lion was summoned by Greg on the following turn. Its special ability would not be as relevant as the fact that it was a blocker in this situation. Jeremy knew that he could not let it resolve, and used an alternate casting cost Foil to counter it. Greg responded by searching out Misdirection. Teferi's Moat was randomly discarded. Greg had no blue card to pitch to Misdirection, which allowed Foil to resolve. This cleared the way for Jeremy's attackers, and he squeaked out the win.


**Final Result:** Lowe - 0, Quinn - 2
