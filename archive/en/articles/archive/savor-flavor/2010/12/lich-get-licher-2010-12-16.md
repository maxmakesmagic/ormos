*This rerun—I mean "nostalgic content revisitation"—is just for fun. It's not particularly in the spirit of the holiday; it's not particularly the most behind-the-scenes piece of **Magic** flavor writing. It's just a column I had a lot of fun writing. It's a combination of legalese and undeath—maybe it'll get you into the spirit of getting your 2010 taxes done. Or maybe an article about a lich risen from the dead is actually in-theme for rerun week? Have a safe and happy New Year and I'll see you again—alive and kickin'—next week.*
