**Ivan Floch:** All of them. I don't think I'm especially prepared for any certain deck. I'm trying to have a good chance against everything and a sideboard plan to go with that.

**Fabrizio Anteri:** I'm trying to beat the mirror match. My list is a little bigger and more midrange, not as aggressive. So I try to beat the mirror match and have a better match against control game one.

**Thoralf Severin:** Abzan. Which i do bascially by countering everything they play.

**Andrea Mengucci:** The mirror match. I think Abzan Hangerback is the most popular deck and I've tested the mirror a lot. I don't have any secret tech, but I've tested a lot and think that's the deck you need to be able to beat.

**Michael Bonde:** I'm trying to beat Hangerback Abzan, by playing Craig Wescoe's Mono-white devotion. It wins by creating a boardstall so your opponent can't attack and then win in the long game.
