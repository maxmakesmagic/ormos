Tomorrow is a pretty special day here in the United States. Thanksgiving is a national day of, um, thanks, where families and friends gather together to eat, drink, and be merry, all thanks to a meal shared by some [pilgrims and Native Americans way back when](http://www.scholastic.com/scholastic_thanksgiving/feast/).


Whether there's much historical basis for watching football and eating turkey, there's no doubt the lore behind the [pilgrims'](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilgrim_Fathers) meal culturally speaks to Thanksgiving.


Now, here at DailyMTG.com, we like combining holidays and themes at every possible turn. So what choice do we have during Top 8 week, the day before Thanksgiving, but to give you the Top 8 Pilgrims?


No choice at all, I say. No choice at all.


Happy Thanksgiving.
