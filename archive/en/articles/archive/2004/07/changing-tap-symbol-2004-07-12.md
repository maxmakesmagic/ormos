One of the most fundamental symbols in **Magic** (right up there with ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227125855im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/white.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161115194122im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/blue.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227195556im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/black.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227130159im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/red.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20220123123600im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/green.gif)) is the tap symbol. Since its original look in the *Revised* set over years ago, the tap symbol has seen three different designs. (Magic cards in the *Alpha*, *Beta*  and *Unlimited*  sets had no tap symbols, and instead had the word "tap" in their rules text. See the [royal assassin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=royal%2Bassassin) for an example.) To see the change in design of the tap symbol over the years, let's look at how [Royal Assassin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Royal+Assassin) has changed from *Revised* to *Fourth Edition* to *Eighth Edition*.



As you can see (above if your eyesight's good, or below with less eyestrain), in the original tap symbol (as seen on the *Revised*  [Royal Assassin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Royal%2BAssassin)), it's a slightly tilted capital "T" -- standing for, of course, the word "tap." Starting with *Fourth Edition* in 1995, the tap symbol changed to the curved arrow symbol, with a black rectangle representing the tapping card behind it. This change to a more symbolic tap symbol made Magic cards more translation-friendly. Then in 2003's *Eighth Edition* set, it changed to the simple, straightforward, easy-to-see curved arrow, without the rectangle behind it. See below for high-resolution versions of the three designs.
