*We're taking a two-week holiday break and will be back with new stuff on Monday, January 3, 2011. Until then, please enjoy our favorite Arcanas of 2010. This article originally ran August 10, 2010.*

Say, have you been wondering about [Barony Vampire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Barony+Vampire)? Wondering where she could be, who she is with, and all that sort of thing? Wondering, specifically, what this Barony is?

Well, if you played *Planechase*, you're probably way ahead of us. But don't tell anybody the answer. We wouldn't want to spoil the surprise that's coming up just after the end of ... this ... sentence.

Of course, the story doesn't start with *Planechase*, because the barony in question is under the thrall of none other than [Baron Sengir](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Baron+Sengir)!
