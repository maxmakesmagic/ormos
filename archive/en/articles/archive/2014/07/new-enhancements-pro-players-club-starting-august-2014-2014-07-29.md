As *Magic* continues to grow, so do events. In order to address and better accommodate this growth, and based on feedback from the community, we are implementing changes to how players earn Professional Points (Pro Points) and earn Pro Tour invitations with a good finish at a Pro Tour. We've also made adjustments to current Grand Prix Pro Point "caps" and the Pro Players Club.



Earning Pro Points



Players will now earn Pro Points based on their match-point total at the end of an event at Grand Prix and Pro Tours, rather than based on their rank in the final standings. The Top 8 players of individual Grand Prix—Top 4 for Team Grand Prix—will still be awarded Pro Points based on final finish order.



For Grand Prix, Pro Points will be awarded based on the following scale:



**Individual Grand Prix (for Top 8 players)**





|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Top 8 Place** | **Pro Points** |
| 1 | 8 |
| 2 | 6 |
| 3–4 | 5 |
| 5–8 | 4 |



**Individual Grand Prix (for all other players)**





|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Match Points** | **Pro Points**  |
| 39+ | 3 |
| 36–38 | 2 |
| 33–35 | 1 |
| 0–32 | 0 |



**Team Grand Prix (for Top 4 teams)**





|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Top 4 Place** | **Pro Points** |
| 1 | 6 |
| 2 | 5 |
| 3–4 | 4 |



**Team Grand Prix (for all other teams)**





|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Match Points** | **Pro Points**  |
| 34+ | 4 |
| 33 | 3 |
| 30–32 | 1 |
| 0–29 | 0 |




For Pro Tours, Pro Points will be awarded as such:





|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Top 8 Place** | **Pro Points** |
| 1 | 30 |
| 2 | 26 |
| 3–4 | 22 |
| 5–8 | 18 |






|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Match Points** | **Pro Points (excludes players in the Top 8)** |
| 36+ | 15 |
| 35 | 12 |
| 34 | 11 |
| 33 | 10 |
| 32 | 8 |
| 31 | 7 |
| 30 | 6 |
| 28–29 | 4 |
| 0–27 | 3 |



The World *Magic* Cup and the World Championship's system for earning Pro Points will remain the same as before.



In addition, Pro Tour invitations and airfare awarded to players who do well at a Pro Tour—starting with Pro Tour *Khans of Tarkir*—will now be determined by match points as well. Any player who earns 33 match points will earn an invitation and airfare to the next Pro Tour.



GP Caps and Pro Levels



In order to adjust to a larger Grand Prix schedule, [Pro Players Club](/content/pro-players-club) and Player of the Year point totals will count a player's best ***6*** Grand Prix finishes. In addition, we have re-evaluated where the thresholds are for each Pro Club level.



**Starting with 2014–2015 season**, Pro Club thresholds will be set as follows:






|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Silver | 20 | No Changes |
| Gold | 35 | No Changes |
| Platinum | *48* | *Previously 45* |



In addition, the Gold-level award has been adjusted. Instead of awarding $500 as an appearance fee, Gold-level Pro Players will receive paid airfare to each Pro Tour for the season. **This will go into effect at Pro Tour *Khans of Tarkir*.**
