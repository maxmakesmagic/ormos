Did you think there *wouldn't* be a lot of **Magic** happening at PAX Prime? That's crazy! Why would you think that? It's in Seattle, which is very close to Wizards of the Coast's headquarters. Some of us (like me!) actually drive past the Convention Center every day on our way to work. It's going to be *full* of **Magic**!

So let's take a look at some of the action that will fill the Washington State Convention Center in Seattle, Washington from August 26-28!

You'll definitely want to stop by the Wizards of the Coast booth to get your first look at the expansion for **Duels of the Planeswalkers** 2012. And there's going to be a big party on Saturday night that will have *Innistrad* information that will blow your mind. But let's say you're not here for the big, exciting events. Why is that? What's the *matter* with you? Well, whatever it is, if it can be treated with **Magic** tournaments, you're in luck!

### [Paper **Magic** Tournaments](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/tcg/events.aspx?x=events/magic/paxprime2011#1)

As soon as the hall opens, the **Magic** Into Pack league kicks off. And if you're playing in that, you get free entry into specified Standard tournaments. And there's a Commander League and Win-a-Box tournaments and, oh, just all sorts of tournaments. You should probably just look at the complete list of [Paper **Magic** Tournaments](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/tcg/events.aspx?x=events/magic/paxprime2011#1).

### [**Magic Online** Tournaments](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/tcg/events.aspx?x=events/magic/paxprime2011#2)

PAX was created mostly for celebration of digital games, so of course **Magic Online** is going to be there. ***Magic** 2012* Drafts and Sealed Deck tournaments will be going on all weekend. Whee!

### Ascend into Darkness â€“ The Magic *Innistrad* Party

Seriously, you definitely want to be at this party on the evening of Saturday, August 27. You'll be able to earn an invitation by participating in PAX Prime. Stop by the Wizards of the Coast booth for details!
