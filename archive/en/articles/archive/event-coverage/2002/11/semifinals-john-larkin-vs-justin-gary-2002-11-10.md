![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/pthou02/a904.jpg)John is the only person left in this Top 8 who can stop team Your Move Games from totally sweeping the Pro Tour. Your Move Games is 9-0 in games so far, and Justin Gary is looking to make sure that's going to be 12-0. For Justin, things look pretty bright, as John commented before the match that this might just be ugly for him.

### Game 1

Justin won the flip and chose to play first. That however meant that John had to choose whether or not he'd be having his deck on the left or right side of the playing mat – the feature match tables have a 'left' and 'right' side. Justin jokingly commented:  
 "Yeah that's gonna cost me"

It didn't though, as he drew a fine opening hand of 2 [Island](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island), [Yavimaya Coast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Yavimaya+Coast), [Brainstorm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brainstorm), [Counterspell](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterspell), [Living Wish](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Living+Wish) and a [Pernicious Deed](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pernicious+Deed). John on the other hand had to mulligan his opening hand into the following mediocre hand – [Visara](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Visara), [Entomb](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Entomb), [Mesmeric Fiend](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mesmeric+Fiend), two [Swamp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swamp)s and an [Island](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island). The first few turns of the match were spent just playing land, something that's highly in Justin's favor. John had the first real spell by casting a [Mesmeric Fiend](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mesmeric+Fiend) but that got [Counter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counter)ed. That did open a window of opportunity for John to [Entomb](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Entomb) a Multani [Maro](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Maro)-Sorcerer, as Justin played a [Treetop Village](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treetop+Village) as his third land. In the graveyard is not the same as in play though, Justin untapped and played his fourth land, and now has mana open to both [Counter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counter) and [Mana Leak](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak), should John feel the urge to resurrect his Multani in some way. John just [Brainstorm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brainstorm)ed in his turn, putting back the [Visara](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Visara) from his hand, along with an [Entomb](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Entomb) keeping another [Entomb](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Entomb) and some [Exhume](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Exhume)s.. A [Brainstorm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brainstorm) from Justin's side, along with an [Intuition](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Intuition) for three [Accumulated Knowledge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Accumulated+Knowledge)s made things look very grim for John, who [Entomb](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Entomb)ed his [Visara](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Visara) at the end of his own turn as well, shuffling away the chaff at the top of his library.

Justin "You put cards in the 'yard, I put them in my hand"

John "Seems fair"

John [Vampiric Tutor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vampiric+Tutor)s at the end of Justin's turn, fetching [Duress](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress), in an attempt to force through one of the [Exhume](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Exhume)s. In response to the [Duress](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress), Justin plays the [Accumulated Knowledge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Accumulated+Knowledge), and lets the [Duress](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress) resolve, showing two [Counterspell](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterspell)s, a [Mana Leak](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak), [Krosan Reclamation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Krosan+Reclamation), [Brainstorm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brainstorm), a [Living Wish](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Living+Wish) and two lands. The [Living Wish](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Living+Wish) hits the grave as it can fetch a [Gilded Drake](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gilded+Drake) to steal the [Visara](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Visara) should it come out. John's first [Exhume](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Exhume) is countered. Justin's next turn again goes without a spell, but John draws another [Duress](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress). Knowing well what cards are in Justin's hand, he has no chance of resolving [Exhume](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Exhume) this turn. Things get a lot worse when Justin plays [Fact or Fiction](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fact+or+Fiction) next turn.

John "Good draw step as well"

Justin "My deck is full of good cards, every one of them draws more cards, stops your spells or just generally kicks ass"

John split it [Swamp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swamp), [Intuition](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Intuition), [Mana Leak](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak) vs. [Oath of Druids](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oath+of+Druids) and [Island](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island).

Justin "Wow, that's actually a good [Fact or Fiction](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fact+or+Fiction) split – they usually take me 5 seconds to pick a pile"

 John "Thanks, I guess"

Justin "Guess I picked correctly" after drawing and casting [Oath of Druids](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oath+of+Druids). Now things turned from hard to really nasty for the Irishman. He spends his next turn trying to improve his draw some by [Brainstorm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brainstorm)ing and using a [Polluted Delta](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Polluted+Delta) to shuffle away what he didn't want back. A [Pernicious Deed](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pernicious+Deed) gets added to the array of weapons Justin has against anything John could do, and he [Fact or Fiction](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fact+or+Fiction)s at the end of John's next turn, flipping over a [Forbid](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forbid), 3 lands and an [Oath of Druids](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oath+of+Druids). John places the [Forbid](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forbid) in a separate pile, and Justin takes the big one. 

John "[Greed](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Greed)y eh?"

Another Oath hits play next turn, and Justin starts beating with a [Treetop Village](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treetop+Village). Some turns later John stocked up on cards again and figured it was time to try and do something. His first [Duress](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress) gets [Counterspell](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterspell)ed. So did the second one. [Exhume](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Exhume) gets [Mana Leak](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak)ed – and after that John ran out of business spells again. Justin continued to beat with the [Treetop Village](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treetop+Village) and takes Game 1.

Justin Gary 1 – John Larkin 0

### Game 2

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/pthou02/a905.jpg)Justin sides in one of his [Powder Keg](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Powder+Keg)s and a [Gilded Drake](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gilded+Drake), taking out two [Fact or Fiction](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fact+or+Fiction)s. John goes takes out his [Wonder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wonder), [Thrashing Wumpus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thrashing+Wumpus), and two of his Careful Studies and a [Vampiric Tutor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vampiric+Tutor) for a [Gilded Drake](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gilded+Drake), [Llawan](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Llawan), 2 Cabal Therapies and a [Gainsay](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gainsay).

This time around John gets a decent opening hand of [Entomb](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Entomb), [Reanimate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reanimate), [Duress](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress), [Brainstorm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brainstorm), [Verdant Force](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Verdant+Force) and [Exhume](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Exhume) – Justin trades in his opening hand though – getting a reasonable hand of [Underground River](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Underground+River), [Treetop Village](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treetop+Village), [Forest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest), [Powder Keg](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Powder+Keg), [Brainstorm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brainstorm) and [Force Spike](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Force+Spike).

John starts out by [Entomb](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Entomb)ing his Multani [Maro](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Maro)-Sorcerer but gets his second turn [Reanimate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reanimate)[Force Spike](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Force+Spike)d by Justin. [Oath of Druids](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oath+of+Druids) hits play next turn, giving this game a feeling of being over already. John [Duress](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress)es Justin taking a [Brainstorm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brainstorm), and plays an [Underground River](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Underground+River). With the [Oath of Druids](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oath+of+Druids) in play, the Multani can't race a [Cognivore](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cognivore) anymore. John [Entomb](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Entomb)s and [Exhume](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Exhume)s his [Visara](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Visara) next turn though, making this game more interesting than it was before. Justin thinks for a long time before deciding to activate [Oath of Druids](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oath+of+Druids). He gets a [Gilded Drake](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gilded+Drake) and takes the Pit Fighter Legend. The Drake was deep down into the deck though, making decking a real possibility. John gets [Visara](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Visara) back with his own [Gilded Drake](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gilded+Drake) after [Vampiric Tutor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vampiric+Tutor)ing for it.

More time is spent during Justin's next turn, but in the end the [Powder Keg](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Powder+Keg) gets his second counter and blows up both [Gilded Drake](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gilded+Drake)s. Justin shuffles his back into his deck with [Krosan Reclamation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Krosan+Reclamation) before activating his Oath a second time, this time getting a [Cognivore](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cognivore) out of the deal. A second [Oath of Druids](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oath+of+Druids) hits, making this game more complicated. John just draws his card and passes the turn. Justin serves with the huge flier but [Visara](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Visara) kills it, and he plays a [Pernicious Deed](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pernicious+Deed). John liked the big flier Justin had, and [Reanimate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reanimate)s it after [Brainstorm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brainstorm)ing and [Duress](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress)ing Justin. During another complicated upkeep, Justin Oaths up a [Cognivore](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cognivore), then a [Gilded Drake](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gilded+Drake), which attempts to steal back John's [Cognivore](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cognivore). [Visara](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Visara) kills the Drake, preventing the exchange of the two creatures. Justin plays his sixth land, blows up his Deed for 6 killing off the [Visara](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Visara). During John's next attack step the two [Cognivore](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cognivore)s trade, and during the following few turns Justin beats down with [Treetop Village](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treetop+Village)s to take Game 2 as well.

Justin Gary 2 – John Larkin 0

### Game 3

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/pthou02/a906.jpg)[Rushing River](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rushing+River), [Gilded Drake](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gilded+Drake), [Mesmeric Fiend](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mesmeric+Fiend), [Brainstorm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brainstorm), [Reanimate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reanimate) and two [Swamp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swamp)s. That's what John traded in for 6 new cards – but those contained no land so he went down to 5. That hand contained [Duress](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress), [Careful Study](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Careful+Study), [Brainstorm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brainstorm) and a [Llawan, Cephalid Empress](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Llawan%2C+Cephalid+Empress). He [Duress](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress)ed Justin, showing a mediocre hand of [Force Spike](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Force+Spike), [Brainstorm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brainstorm), [Powder Keg](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Powder+Keg), [Accumulated Knowledge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Accumulated+Knowledge), two [Treetop Village](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treetop+Village)s and a [Polluted Delta](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Polluted+Delta). After trying to get the Delta, John took the [Brainstorm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brainstorm). Justin plays an [Island](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island), revealing the card he drew that turn, and plays an [Underground River](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Underground+River), giving him at least a small chance at this game. He draws two [Entomb](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Entomb)s and a [Swamp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swamp) and puts back one of the [Entomb](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Entomb)s and the [Llawan](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Llawan). Justin plays the [Polluted Delta](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Polluted+Delta) and passes the turn. John [Entomb](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Entomb)s his [Visara](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Visara), making him feel a bit more confident after the double mulligan he had to endure this turn. Justin plays the [Accumulated Knowledge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Accumulated+Knowledge) at the end of John's turn, hoping to improve his pretty poor draw. 

John plays a [Careful Study](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Careful+Study), commenting how that's his third mulligan this game, drawing [Entomb](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Entomb) and [Reanimate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reanimate) while discarding two [Swamp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swamp)s. He plays a [Polluted Delta](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Polluted+Delta), and then [Reanimate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reanimate)s his [Visara](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Visara). Justin all of a sudden turns quiet, showing quite obviously this game is not going exactly the way he had hoped. He [Brainstorm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brainstorm)s at the end of John's turn, plays [Living Wish](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Living+Wish) and fetches [Gilded Drake](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gilded+Drake) to take the [Visara](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Visara). John draws a land, knowing that he needed the [Gilded Drake](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gilded+Drake) or a reanimation spell to stay in this game. He attacks with his Drake, in a last-ditch effort to deal some damage to Justin.

Justin "What does he have? Why is he attacking? Did he sideboard in [Massacre](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Massacre)?"

John "..."

And Justin blocks the Drake with [Visara](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Visara). If John had drawn [Reanimate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reanimate) he could've gotten the Drake back and stayed in this game. Justin knew that he misplayed horribly after that, but it didn't matter as [Visara](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Visara) along with a [Treetop Village](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treetop+Village) did John in next turn, making the top 3 of Pro Tour Houston all Your Move Games. They did so without losing a single game in the top 8 to non-Your-Move-Games people and that's impressive

**Final Result:** Justin Gary 3 – John Larkin 0.
