*What's your favorite legendary creature, and why?*


![Kenneth Nagle](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/mtgcom/authorpics/authorpic_kennethnagle.jpg)**Kenneth Nagle:** One could argue that a legendary creature has the most flavor potential of any **Magic** card, representing a character with a unique proper name and a flavor text quote.


[Skeleton Ship](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skeleton+Ship) is the first legendary creature I purposely added to my first deck, my [Norritt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Norritt) deck (I still have it together). It would later be joined by [Nebuchadnezzar](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nebuchadnezzar), quite a legendary name indeed, but not particularly legendary all-around.


At one point in **Magic** I was disparaging my fatties, and I declared that Wizards of the Coast was incapable of printing a powerful legendary creature that costs six or more mana. Almost in defiant response, *Onslaught* was released, and a nasty lady name [Visara the Dreadful](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Visara+the+Dreadful) invaded the [Cabal Coffers](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cabal+Coffers)â€“based black decks of our multiplayer metagame.


What's more, the single most impressive **Magic** card I've ever seen was the preview of [Akroma, Angel of Wrath](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Akroma%2C+Angel+of+Wrath). I was working late on my computer science program in the Mississippi State lab alone. Upon reading it twice and mentally absorbing the luminescently crisp image, I uproariously laughed all the air in my trumpet-blasting lungs, the cackling slowly decrescending until it was droned out by the humming of PCs in sleep mode. I sighed and said aloud to no one, "Wow. I'm impressed. I'm very impressed." (Yes, this is true.)


In fact, a set later there was an entire Pro Tour where the fatties ruled the world. Check out [Randy Buehler's recap](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=sideboard/ptven03/bigmen). There are designers inside R&D (I won't name names!) who believe **Magic** would be a better game if this kind of Pro Tour was "normal" instead of "an experiment."


![Kamahl, Fist of Krosa](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Kamahl%2C+Fist+of+Krosa)But my favorite and most "legendary" creature remains [Kamahl, Fist of Krosa](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kamahl%2C+Fist+of+Krosa). Bullet list time:





* He's green. Thumbs up!
* He used to be red ([Kamahl, Pit Fighter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kamahl%2C+Pit+Fighter)). He's one of those "evolved" legendary dudes. You might not know that if you're not immersed in **Magic**'s elements.
* The red 6/1 became the greener 4/3. He retained his 7 total power and toughness (a statistic we unofficially call "heft" inside R&D).
* The "Fist of Krosa" moniker is, in my opinion, a creative homerun.
* Flavor text: *"My mind has changed. My strength has not."* Having read the *Judgment* novel (where Kamahl slams his [Mirari](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mirari)-pommeled sword into the ground as seen in [Mirari's Wake](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mirari%27s+Wake)), I see [Thriss, Nantuko Primus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Thriss%252C%2BNantuko%2BPrimus)'s training served Kamahl well.
* Kamahl learned how to cast the spell [Overrun](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Overrun). Badass!
* By animating lands, he can make his own temporary army, or save himself from [Chainer's Edict](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chainer%27s+Edict), or even kill your opponent's lands with [Goblin Sharpshooter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Sharpshooter) or their own [Wrath of God](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wrath+of+God)!

While not officially part of the [Jareth, Leonin Titan](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Jareth%252C%2BLeonin%2BTitan) / [Arcanis the Omnipotent](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Arcanis%2Bthe%2BOmnipotent) / [Visara the Dreadful](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Visara%2Bthe%2BDreadful) / [Rorix Bladewing](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Rorix%2BBladewing) / [Silvos, Rogue Elemental](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Silvos%252C%2BRogue%2BElemental) cycle of Pit Fighter Legends, I've always personally displaced Silvos with [Kamahl, Fist of Krosa](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kamahl%2C+Fist+of+Krosa) as the green *Onslaught* rare legendary 6-drop creature of that cycle. While there are certainly creatures more powerful, more epic, and more famous, [Kamahl, Fist of Krosa](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kamahl%2C+Fist+of+Krosa) remains my favorite and, to me, the most "legendary" creature.
