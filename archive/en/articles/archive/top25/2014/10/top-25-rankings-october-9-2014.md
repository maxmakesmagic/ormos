On the eve of Pro Tour *Khans of Tarkir*, welcome to our latest look at the *Magic* Top 25 Pro Rankings. Despite two Grand Prix last weekend, both featuring *Khans of Tarkir* Limited, there was very little movement in the rankings. It wasn't so much that our top-ranked players did badly—it's that they just weren't there at all! In the continuation of a trend that has been becoming more and more pronounced over the last couple of seasons, the overwhelming majority of the pros have stayed away from the Grand Prix scene the weekend before a Pro Tour, which suggests how extremely seriously they take the testing process, and how critical every hour can be.


Still, we do have a few switches to report. In [Orlando](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/gporl14), Ben Stark bucked the trend by showing up, not least because it was about as local a GP as he could ever get. He duly made it to Day Two, but didn't threaten the Top 8 down the stretch. Another Floridian, Chris Fennell, was also in attendance, and in a pleasing moment of mathematical symmetry, Stark now sits tied with Fennell for the No. 21 spot on the table.


Meanwhile, in [Shanghai](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/gpsha14), No. 10 Yuuya Watanabe, No. 11 Yuuki Ichikawa, and No. 25 Kentaro Yamamoto were all in action. Thanks to Stark, Yamamoto lost a place, down one to No. 25, while the others maintained their spots.


So, it was a weekend where only five of the Top 25 were in action. That's likely to change by, at a rough guess, twenty next weekend in Honolulu. While the churn in the second half of the table is likely to be immense, headlines could also be written at the very top, with Owen Turtenwald, Reid Duke, and William Jensen all within striking distance of the top spot currently held by the reigning Player of the Year, Jérémy Dezani. Join us next week as we unveil the latest *Magic* Top 25 Pro rankings.
