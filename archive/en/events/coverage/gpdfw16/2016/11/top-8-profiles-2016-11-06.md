Infect. I have a decent amount of experience with the deck, and it plays to my strengths.

[Become Immense](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Become+Immense) lol. :)


**What was the most important card in your sideboard and why?**  
[Viridian Corrupter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Viridian+Corrupter). Poor [Chalice of the Void](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chalice+of+the+Void)...

2016 World Champion


2 Grand Prix wins


2008 Runner Up at a local casual game


**What Modern deck are you playing, and why did you choose it?**  

Dredge. Thought it was just the best deck.


**What was the most important card in your main deck and why?**  

They are all about the same level of importance. [Conflagrate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Conflagrate) was the missing piece for why old Dredge decks sucked.


**What was the most important card in your sideboard and why?**  
[Nature's Claim](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nature%27s+Claim). Gotta have the hate.


**What Modern-legal card would you love to play with, but haven't yet?**  
[Sword of the Meek](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sword+of+the+Meek).

**Age:** 24


**Hometown:** Alta Loma, CA


**Occupation:** Game Designer


**Previous Magic Accomplishments (before this Grand Prix):**   

Three Grand Prix Top 8 (two in Modern with Grixis Control previous to this). Gold level pro, member of Team Channel Fireball.


**What Modern deck are you playing, and why did you choose it?**  

Grixis Control. It's my baby. I betrayed it in Indianapolis two months ago, but came back to my swamp lord roots.


**What was the most important card in your main deck and why?**   
[Snapcaster Mage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snapcaster+Mage). Without it, blue wouldn't be able to play a control game.


**What was the most important card in your sideboard and why?**  
[Surgical Extraction](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Surgical+Extraction). Zero-mana cards are exceptionally important, especially against the slower unfair decks and Dredge.


**What Modern-legal card would you love to play with, but haven't yet?**  
[Saheeli Rai](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Saheeli+Rai). She's very powerful. The combo with [Liquimetal Coating](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Liquimetal+Coating) may just be too cute, but she is powerful at three mana.

**Age:** 24


**Hometown:** Toronto


**Occupation:** Full-time Ninja


**Previous Magic Accomplishments (before this Grand Prix):** 12th Grand Prix NY, RPTQ Top 8, Top 64 Grand Prix LA


**What Modern deck are you playing, and why did you choose it?**  

Infect was my weapon of choice because sometimes, you have to just pump & pray.


**What was the most important card in your main deck and why?**  
[Rancor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rancor) because all my friends (including Bradley Yoo) said it was hot garbage, but it's effectively [Vines of Vastwood](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vines+of+Vastwood) if you think really hard about it.


**What was the most important card in your sideboard and why?**  
[Scavenging Ooze](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scavenging+Ooze). Hedging strongly against [Narcomoeba](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Narcomoeba) and [Lingering Souls](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lingering+Souls) was critical.


**What Modern-legal card would you love to play with, but haven't yet?**  
[Ad Nauseam](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ad+Nauseam). It's my style of deck but couldn't get together the cards in time. :(

**Occupation:** Carshop guy


**Previous Magic Accomplishments (before this Grand Prix):** A Star City Games Top 8, lost to Dredge there but hopefully not here also.


**What Modern deck are you playing, and why did you choose it?**  

Infect; I've been playing it for as long as it has been legal.


**What was the most important card in your main deck and why?**  
[Become Immense](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Become+Immense). The card won me so many games by itself.


**What was the most important card in your sideboard and why?**  
[Spell Pierce](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spell+Pierce). Card is very good and won me many games.


**What Modern-legal card would you love to play with, but haven't yet?**  
[Death's Shadow](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Death%27s+Shadow). I love the card, it is really powerful and I like casting [Become Immense](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Become+Immense).

Valakut… reasons.


**What was the most important card in your sideboard and why?**   
[Sudden Shock](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sudden+Shock). It wins the Infect matchup.

Played on the Pro Tour once...

Wafo-Tapa–inspired Jeskai, because I can't win with other decks.


**What was the most important card in your main deck and why?**  
[Think Twice](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Think+Twice); it's a powerhouse.

[Vendilion Clique](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vendilion+Clique) let me down a few times (but came in a lot).

**Age:** 22


**Hometown:** San Jose, California


**Occupation:** Lowe's


**Previous Magic Accomplishments (before this Grand Prix):**


FNM grinder … Few Opens, GPs, etc… Game Day grinder...


**What Modern deck are you playing, and why did you choose it?**  
[Skred](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skred)! Fun to play, solid matchups all around and clear lines of play.


**What was the most important card in your main deck and why?**  
[Mind Stone](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mind+Stone)/[Skred](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skred). Close tie. One is your best tempo play and the other kills almost everything in the format.


**What was the most important card in your sideboard and why?**  
[Molten Rain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Molten+Rain). Comes in against the most matchups for bad cards.


**What Modern-legal card would you love to play with, but haven't yet?**  
[Ashiok, Nightmare Weaver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ashiok%2C+Nightmare+Weaver). Most troll card, but not very good main deck.
