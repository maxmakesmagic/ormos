It's time for everyone's favorite fake game show, "Meet the *Morningtide* Creature Tokens"!

First up, we have a 2/5 Treefolk Shaman:

![Treefolk Shaman](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/mtgcom/arcana1000/1511_Token1.jpg)This happy little fellow will come in handy when you play your [Reach of Branches](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reach+of+Branches). Next, meet our second contestant. He's a 1/1 Faerie Rogue, he flies, and he enjoys long walks on the beach and Jazzercise:

![Faerie Rogue](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/mtgcom/arcana1000/1511_Token2.jpg)The Faerie Rogue is usually seen in the company of [Bitterblossom](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bitterblossom), [Notorious Throng](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Notorious+Throng), and [Violet Pall](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Violet+Pall). Our third creature token is a systems analyst from the Osterman-Price accounting firmâ€”no, sorry, that's wrong. Our third creature token is actually a mighty 5/5 Giant Warrior!

![Giant Warrior](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/mtgcom/arcana1000/1511_Token3.jpg)The Giant Warrior is a byproduct of [Feudkiller's Verdict](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Feudkiller%27s+Verdict). That's our *Morningtide* Creature Token lineup. Let's give them all a big hand!

Of course, the *backs* of the creature tokens are not completely without interest. In addition to some fascinating ads, there are also five rules tips:

Select locations in North America are having Midnight Madness events ([USA Schedule](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/events/releases-na#usa1); [Canada Schedule](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/events/releases-na#canada1)) so you can get your cards even earlier!
