Serious Fun covers a lot of territory – alternate play formats, multiplayer strategy, celebration of certain cards, occasional deck ideas, the rare issue piece thrown in, and even a little advice for the casual player. This week, I'm focusing mainly on that last bit – advice for the casual player. Some of you may already know what I'm about to say. Congratulations.


To the casual player, cycling may not be any more or less remarkable than any other mechanic Wizards has introduced (or re-introduced). We may wonder why (or not even notice that) tournament players are so excited about it, and always seem to have a few cycling cards in their decks. Cycling cards can't *always* be that good, can they? And should we really *care* if we're taking advantage of cycling in casual play?


If the answer to both questions wasn't “yes”, I'd have a short column this week. Fortunately, I can go on.


### Why Cycling Is Almost Always Good


![](http://archive.wizards.com/global/images/mtgcom_daily_aa116_picMain_en.jpg)I think I can be short here, because the case is pretty simple and only the newest among you need to learn this. Cycling allows you to take a card that may be useless in some situations and turns it into a card that's *always* useful. (The card you draw off the cycling may be useless, but that's not the fault of the poor first card. Don't get angry at it!)


With *Onslaught* block, the case became even clearer. Some cycling cards allow you to draw a new card *and* still get an effect – an uncounterable effect (short of [Stifle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stifle)).


So cycling is good – that was easy. Let's move on.


### Why Casual Players Should Care


I'll still get the occasional email (rarer now, I'm happy to say) from a reader who tells me I shouldn't spend so much time trying to improve casual players' deckbuilding and play skills, because “we're just in it for the fun”. I've treated this topic indirectly or briefly in the past, but let me take a bit more time with it now.


It's an odd argument, that you can't enjoy the game if you get any better at it. So I wonder sometimes if the argument isn't really “I don't want to get any better” than it is, “I'm afraid getting better would mean I have to play in tournaments, and I hate those guys.”


If it's the first case – that you really just don't want to get better – then I hope you have some other means for challenging yourself. Improving your **Magic** game is a good way to do this, but not the only way. Good luck with your challenges, wherever they may be.


If it's the second case – you just don't think you'd like the company you'd have to keep – I'd point out that you can improve your game without ditching your play group. Yes, it's helpful to play even in low-stakes tournaments, since we get better most quickly by playing people better than ourselves. (Maybe *that's* the issue – some of us are afraid we'll lose. I'll let each of you consider the truth of that, for your own situation.)


But if you just don't want to set foot in a tournament, because you're allergic or whatever, there's no reason why you still can't get any better. Simple practice will get you there – but so will taking some time to reflect on what's working.

So then. Let's reflect. Here are five things that get better about your game the moment you start using cycling cards to their full capacity:


**1. You learn card advantage.** If you haven't already learned this – most games are won by the player who accessed and/or eliminated the most resources. Cards represent options, and more options means more chances to make a great play (or prevent your opponent from making a great play). This is doubly true for each additional opponent you face.



![Clear](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Clear)

**2. You learn patience.** Put another way, you learn not every spell or effect needs to be done during your turn. Over and over again, I see casual players play instants during their main phase, when holding their mana and playing the spell at the end of their last opponent's next turn would be just as (or more) effective.


Cycling is a good way to get into this habit. Ninety-five percent of the time, you *don't* have to cycle until just before your next turn. (The five percent comes from situations arising from certain cycling-based decks, times when you have to dig for a response to something horrific on the stack, and last-turn desperation calls.) Every time you start to cycle a card…***stop***. Is it absolutely necessary to do it now?


By keeping the mana open, you keep your opponents guessing. It's the same logic that should be keeping you from dropping land or playing spells in your pre-combat main phase. (Again, there are exceptions – but you learn the strategies *before* you selectively ignore them.)


What really tests you are the cycling spells like [Decree of Pain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Decree+of+Pain). These are expensive to cycle, and until you have nine or ten lands, you won't be able to do something big on your turn *and* cycle for the effect later. So the temptation is to play the first sorcery or creature on your turn and hope you don't need the [Massacre](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Massacre) effect at instant speed. Way too many times, this is a mistake. I'm not a big fan of “flying under the radar”, but I'm still pleasantly surprised by what I can provoke my opponents into by simply sitting and waiting for a turn or two.


Example: I have a creatureless red-black cycling deck (I've mentioned it before) with the following core:


4x [Lightning Rift](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Rift)  

4x [Seal of Fire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seal+of+Fire)  

4x [Seal of Doom](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seal+of+Doom)  

4x [Expunge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Expunge)  

4x [Starstorm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Starstorm)  

2x [Decree of Pain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Decree+of+Pain)  

etc.


It has something like 30 lands in there, 16 of which cycle. It flops over like a dead fish to ridiculous stuff like [Psychic Battle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psychic+Battle) or [Confusion in the Ranks](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Confusion+in+the+Ranks); but that's not the point. The point is, with a [Seal of Fire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seal+of+Fire), [Lightning Rift](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Rift), and [Seal of Doom](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seal+of+Doom) on the table, I do nothing for the next three or four turns if I can help it. People are welcome to notice me and gun for me – I won't lie and say it'll get easier if they let me live – but the first one across the line gets a mighty smack.


Incentives being what they are, I often find myself passing right from upkeep to end of turn for several turns in a row. All of the action in this deck happens at turn's end for the player on my right – spot kill where necessary, mass kill if things are getting out of hand, and spend all excess damage on whichever player is the biggest threat to my plan.


Very, very little happens on my turn. The deck has an amazing record – maybe four or five losses, after almost a full year of play (which would be about 30 games, since I don't play it every week). Many of those games are emperor games – but a bunch are just simple chaos. (A few are on the lieutenant spot, which is a risk but also a rush.)


**3. You learn mana curves.** If you haven't done this yet, build your next deck this way: group all your cards by converted mana cost. Put the [Mogg Fanatic](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mogg+Fanatic)s and [Shock](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shock)s in the first column to the far left, the Goblin War Buggies and [Incinerate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Incinerate)s in the next column to the right, the [Suq'ata Lancer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Suq%27ata+Lancer)s and [Viashino Sandstalker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Viashino+Sandstalker)s in the third column, and the [Keldon Champion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Keldon+Champion)s and [Skizzik](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skizzik)s in the fourth.


![](https://media.wizards.com/legacy/global/images/mtgcom_daily_aa116_pic1_en.jpg)Once I've done this, I pull down the non-creature spells so that they're all still in the correct columns – just separate from the creatures. Now I can see when the deck is likely to get crowded (does the fourth column have all my creatures?), and when it's likely to be sitting and doing nothing (do I even have anything in the first two columns?).


After you've learned how to do this, you can start to adjust for nuances. The first would be to take the [Skizzik](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skizzik) and move it from the fourth column to the fifth, since in an ideal world you'd hang onto a 5/3 trampler in a game where you have to deal with four opponents. If you played [Oxidda Golem](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oxidda+Golem), you'd probably put it in the third column, instead of the sixth (where strict converted mana cost would put it).


And then you should take a look at stuff that cycles.


[Solar Blast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Solar+Blast) can go in the third or fourth column – when do you find you use it most often? Starstorm should go where you believe you'll want it most (I'd put it no further left than the fifth column).


Normally, you'd leave lands out of the deck's distribution and just fill them in later. But this time, take the [Forgotten Cave](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forgotten+Cave)s and [Smoldering Crater](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Smoldering+Crater)s and put them under columns one and two, respectively. They don't count as “good plays” – if they're the only things you have early game, your deck still needs to improve – but they do let you know if your first couple of turns might get a bit crowded, if you want to play that [Skullscorch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skullscorch) *and* cycle something early on.


You don't have to be perfect here. By forcing yourself to *think* about when you will play or cycle the spells, you can create a “best scenario” game plan. That's what you shoot for, every time. If you don't get it, you can choose to modify the deck. If you get that best scenario and you still lose, you can decide if the deck needs a major revision.


But without thinking about stuff like this, you'll never know – and you'll keep wondering why you're losing. Are we having fun yet?


![](https://media.wizards.com/legacy/global/images/mtgcom_daily_aa116_pic2_en.jpg)**4. You access cards and strategies you'd otherwise ignore.** For example, [Invigorating Boon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Invigorating+Boon). [Invigorating Boon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Invigorating+Boon) doesn't look like much – certainly nothing like [Astral Slide](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Astral+Slide) – until you start thinking about cards like [Spike Feeder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spike+Feeder), [Spike Weaver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spike+Weaver), and [Forgotten Ancient](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forgotten+Ancient). And once you start thinking about those cards, you also think about neat stuff like [Mindless Automaton](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mindless+Automaton), [Pentavus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pentavus), and [Triskelion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Triskelion).


And honestly, once you've taken that particular on-ramp onto that particular highway, why don't you just follow the signs to [Arcbound Slith](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arcbound+Slith) and its modular ilk?


And once you're *there*, why not go to [Power Conduit](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Power+Conduit) or [Giant Fan](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Giant+Fan), and start messing around with…well, you get the idea.


**5. You have more fun.** You don't get mana-flooded. You have a solution to color-screw. As long as you keep the total number of lands in your deck where it's supposed to be (usually 24/60, with rare exceptions), you'll find you can play cycling lands as lands and not lose too much tempo over them coming into play tapped.


This means you'll be spending less time pouting about how your deck “screwed” you, and more time playing – which will give you more practice, which in turn will make you a better player. All because you were smart enough to add a few cycling cards, where they made sense. Aren't you brilliant?


In short, cycling makes your game better, deepens your understanding of why you win or lose, and helps you have more fun. Not many mechanics can boast that kind of record – which I imagine is why cycling's one of the few mechanics in **Magic** history to return. My hope is that Research & Development will continue to be selective about the mechanics they bring back – cycling should set the bar, and it's a pretty high bar.
