**Tom LaPille:** [Daybreak Ranger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Daybreak+Ranger) / [Nightfall Predator](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nightfall+Predator) is my favorite Werewolf in *Innistrad*.

As a designer, I enjoy the evolution from archer-who-hits-flyers to angry-ball-of-fury-who-fights-anything, and I like the "fight" keyword action. As a developer, I enjoy that it pushes you into a second color in a relatively subtle way and that the games involving it have lots of cool things to think about. As a player, I like that it's pretty powerful. It's got everything I could possibly want!
