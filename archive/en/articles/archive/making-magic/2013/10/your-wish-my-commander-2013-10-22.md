By Mark Rosewater




Working for Magic R&D since October, 1995, Mark Rosewater is currently the head designer. His hobbies include spending time with his family, talking about Magic on every known medium (including a daily blog and a weekly podcast), and writing about himself in the third person. 





Welcome to Commander Week. This week, we'll be talking all about the new *Commander* (2013 Edition) supplemental product. And as this is the design column, I'm going to talk about how it was designed. I'll talk about how this product came to be, introduce you to the design team, and walk you through the set's design. Sound good? 

Same Time Next Year
 So, back in 2011, we put out a product known as ***Magic: The Gathering** Commander* . We release a supplemental product each summer and *Commander* was our release for that year. The Commander format had been rising in popularity so we thought it was worthwhile to put out a product to support it. The product consisted of five preconstructed decks, each a 100-card singleton deck, including one legendary creature that served as the deck's commander. (The decks each also had two other legendary creatures that could serve as a commander for the deck.) The five decks together had fifty-one newly designed cards. 

*Commander* performed beyond our expectations and we realized that we had tapped into something bigger than a single product. We work over a year ahead so we were unable to get new decks out for 2012 (we opted instead to do the *Commander's Arsenal* box, which took less time to create) but we were able to create a second set of *Commander* decks for 2013—the ones I am talking about today. 

 The decision was to shift the decks to the fall as we were continuing to do the summer products that housed the first *Commander* decks. Which finally gets us back to *Commander* (2013 Edition). 

Before I talk about the design itself, I want to first introduce the design team to you.

**Mark Gottlieb (lead)**

![](https://media.wizards.com/images/magic/daily/mm/mm271_gottlieb.jpg) While [Mark](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Archive.aspx?author=Mark%20Gottlieb) has worn numerous hats while at Wizards, he first came to the company many years ago as an editor. Mark then transitioned into the role that he held for the longest time, rules manager for **Magic**. Mark eventually gave up his rules manager position to become a **Magic** developer in Ramp;D. All during that time, though, Mark moonlit as a designer working on numerous design teams. 

 Mark was eventually given a chance to lead his first design with *Mirrodin Besieged*. He later went on to lead his second design (co-designing with me) with *Gatecrash*. *Commander* (2013 Edition) is his third design lead. 

Since that time, Mark has gone on to become the design manager. He and I work closely together, with him overseeing the people and scheduling while I oversee the product and technical work. You will next get to see Mark's work on the spring set of 2015, codenamed "Louie." (Yes, preceded by "Huey" and "Dewey.")

For years, we joked around that he was my archnemesis, as I was the head designer and he was the rules manager, but the truth is that the two of us actually work well together and it has been fun working with him to help shape our current talented design team.

 I also enjoying working with Mark on design teams because he is a very imaginative designer. In his spare time, he loves doing puzzle hunts (and occasionally making some as well) and this love of puzzle solving comes in handy in set design. I was happy to have Mark leading the design of *Commander* (2013 Edition) because I knew he would do a great job, and as a fan of the Commander format, I knew he'd design some cards that would, in particular, make the fans of Commander happy. 

**Ethan Fleischer**

![](https://media.wizards.com/images/magic/daily/mm/mm271_flescher.jpg) It seems like just yesterday that [Ethan](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/magazine/archive.aspx?author=ethan%20fleischer) earned a six-month internship as his prize for winning [the second Great Designer Search](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/magazine/article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/feature/133), but, in fact, it's actually been a couple of years. Ethan has numerous design teams under his belt and has now led his very first team—Journey Into Nyx, which you will all get to see next spring. 

 I chose Ethan as the winner of the GDS2 because I saw a lot of potential in him, potential I've been very happy to see come to fruition. Ethan was put on *Commander* (2013 Edition) because we were interested in him possibly running a future *Commander* design team. 

Ethan is a fan of the Commander format and embraced being on this team with gusto. 

**Dan Emmons**

![](https://media.wizards.com/images/magic/daily/mm/mm271_emmons.jpg) Dan is the youngest member of the design team. While Dan had not made it to the finals of [GDS2](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/magazine/article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/feature/133), he was one of the people very involved in helping out the Top 8 with designs. Shortly after Ethan and Shawn Main started working at Wizards, Dan swung by my desk to introduce himself. He had just gotten a job with game support (what we used to call customer service) and he was very eager to help out design in any way he could. 

We invited Dan to some playtests and allowed him to submit cards to fill holes made during development. Dan did such a good job we eventually put him onto a design team. When I realized we had a new spot opening up, I sat Dan down and offered him a job as a fulltime designer.

 Dan has a lot of energy (and coming from me, that's saying something) and enthusiasm. From the first day he swung by my desk, Dan has set out to do everything in his power to become a better designer. He is currently my strong second on "[Blood](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood)" (which means he is in charge of the card file and he and I work extra close). 

Having Dan on your design team is always a plus because he is eager to produce cards and solve whatever problem comes his way. He truly enjoys what he does and his excitement is infectious.

**Scott Larabee**

![](https://media.wizards.com/images/magic/daily/twtw/twtw271_larabee.jpg) By day, Scott Larabee is the tournament director who oversees all the Pro Tours. But, by night, he is one of the members of the [Commander Rules Committee](http://mtgcommander.net/rules.php), a group outside Wizards that makes all the key decisions about the format. Scott was involved in the first *Commander* design and he was asked back for the second. The reason is simple. There is probably no one in the entire Wizards building who loves the Commander format more than Scott. It is the format he is passionate about, and if there is one thing you want on a design team, it is someone passionate for the design at hand. 

Because of his focus on the Commander format, Scott was a valuable resource for the design team. Also, as the design team dipped its toe in some new design space that directly interacted with the Commander rules (more on this below), it was good to have him as a liaison with the Commander Rules Committee.

 I have actually known Scott for a long time. When I lived in Los Angeles, before I joined Wizards, Scott was the man who ran the weekly **Magic** event I attended (at a place known as the Costa Mesa's Women's Center). Scott just celebrated his fifteenth-year anniversary at Wizards and is one of the people I have spent the longest time working with. One of my biggest regrets of not being on the *Commander* (2013 Edition) design team is that I have never had the honor of working on a design with Scott. One day I will have to correct this injustice. 

**Steve Warner**

![](https://media.wizards.com/images/magic/daily/twtw/twtw271_warner.jpg)I spend a lot of time talking about design and development, but Ramp;D has many more people than just those two roles. Steve is one of our playtesters. It is his job to take the newest cards and do his worst with them. Over the years, Steve has built a lot of crazy, overpowered decks to make sure that you all will never have to play them.

 From time to time, we have Steve on development teams. I believe *Commander* (2013 Edition) is the first time he has been on a **Magic** design team. One of the things I like about having new blood on design teams is that they bring a unique vantage point. Steve is very familiar with **Magic**, and the Commander format, and is able to see things in a way that others on the team might not. 

On top of that, the Commander design team works as such: Each member of the five-person design team builds one of the Commander decks, which means that Steve is in his wheelhouse.

Missile Commander
 Early in the spring of 2012, Mark Gottlieb compiled his design team. The parameters were simple. They had twelve weeks to design five 100-card decks with a total resource of fifty-one new cards to be used among them. As with the first batch of *Commander* decks, each one would have a main commander, which would go on the front of the box, and two other appropriate legendary creatures, which would go into the deck but could be swapped out to be the deck's commander.
