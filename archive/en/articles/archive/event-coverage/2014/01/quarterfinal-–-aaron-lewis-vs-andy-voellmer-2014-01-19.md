Aaron Lewis, who earned his first Grand Prix Top 8 at Grand Prix Charlotte last year, hails from Madison, Wisconsin. His opponent, Andy Voellmer, made a short drive from Berkeley, California down this weekend to compete. The result for his decision is a qualification for Pro Tour Journey Into Nyx and his first Grand Prix Top 8.


**The Decks**


Aaron Lewis has the often underrated blue-red archetype, along with many of the strategy's key cards. [Flamespeaker Adept](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flamespeaker+Adept) and [Aqueous Form](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aqueous+Form) work very well together, and both are found in Lewis's deck. However, it isn't just these synergies that Lewis can fall back on, as [Bident of Thassa](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bident+of+Thassa) gives him access to a very powerful rare that can keep his hand stocked with goodies, including quick aggressive creatures as well as removal.


Andy Voellmer's deck is a little slower, but it can pack a punch. His green-black archetype has plenty of solid green creatures, along with some solid black removal and heavy-hitting creatures like [Gray Merchant of Asphodel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gray+Merchant+of+Asphodel).


**The Games**


Lewis wasted no time in getting an early lead with [Spearpoint Oread](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spearpoint+Oread) into [Bident of Thassa](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bident+of+Thassa) getting no major resistence from Voellmer, whose first play of the game was an [Insatiable Harpy](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Insatiable+Harpy). Lewis dwarfed the play even further when he dumped more creatures onto the table with Wavecrash Titan and [Akroan Crusader](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Akroan+Crusader).

Voellmer turned the life tides a bit with [Gray Merchant of Asphodel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gray+Merchant+of+Asphodel), but he was staring down a dangerous threat in the form of [Bident of Thassa](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bident+of+Thassa). Lewis continued his card drawing with [Aqueous Form](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aqueous+Form) on the [Wavecrash Triton](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wavecrash+Triton), locking down the Harpy, and then a second Form on [Akroan Crusader](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Akroan+Crusader), giving him creatures that couldn't be blocked. As a result, Voellmer had little to stop Lewis from re-stocking his hand.



[Dissolve](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dissolve) on [Anthousa, Setessan Hero](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Anthousa%2C+Setessan+Hero) a few turns later left Voellmer without any real pressure, and he ultimately succumbed to the avalanche of card draw that the [Bident of Thassa](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bident+of+Thassa) provided Lewis all game.


Voellmer led with [Flamecast Wheel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flamecast+Wheel) into [Nessian Courser](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nessian+Courser) in the second game, while Lewis's first play was [Wavecrash Triton](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wavecrash+Triton). [Flamespeaker Adept](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flamespeaker+Adept) and [Aqueous Form](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aqueous+Form) on the Triton followed, locking down a freshly played [Voyaging Satyr](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Voyaging+Satyr). The enchanted Triton and Adept made quite a combo, with the scry from [Aqueous Form](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aqueous+Form) triggering the Adept on each attack. [Minotaur Skullcleaver](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Minotaur+Skullcleaver) came down with those creatures on the next turn, crashing Voellmer to 11.

[Bident of Thassa](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bident+of+Thassa) followed after that, and Voellmer, who was stuck on green mana only, struggled to keep up. He found a Swamp, his fourth land, on the next turn, which allowed him to pop his [Flamecast Wheel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flamecast+Wheel) targeting the Adept, but Lewis had [Voyage's End](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Voyage%27s+End) to save his creature. The Adept came down on the next turn, and a sequence of a second [Aqueous Form](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aqueous+Form), a [Rage of Purphoros](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rage+of+Purphoros), and two unblockable attacks earned Lewis the game and the match.



"I guess I'll see you at the Pro Tour!" Voellmer said, offering the handshake.
