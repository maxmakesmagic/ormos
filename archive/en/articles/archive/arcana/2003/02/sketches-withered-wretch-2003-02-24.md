This week's "Sketches" looks at one of the most popular new *Legions* cards, the Zombie Cleric [Withered Wretch](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Withered+Wretch) by veteran Tim Hildebrandt.

### 1. Art Description

Withered Wretch is interesting in that the art was originally commissioned for an *Onslaught* card that was to be named "Shadowcrafter." Shadowcrafter was eventually cut from the set, and from the electronic file, so whatever it was supposed to do is lost to the sands of time.

Shadowcrafter was obviously a Zombie Cleric of some type, however, so it the art fit well onto Withered Wretch.

### 2. Sketch

This is the preliminary sketch submitted by Tim.

### 3. Final Art

Here is a large version of the final piece.

### 4. Card

Finally, here is the card as you know it today.
