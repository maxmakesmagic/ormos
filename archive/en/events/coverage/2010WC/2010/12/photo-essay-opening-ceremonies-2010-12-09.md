RICH: "At Pro Tour–San Juan, where hundreds of players had a chance to visit Puerto Rico courtesy of *Magic*, Paulo Vitor Damo da Rosa of Brazil raised his eyes to the heavens, winning his first Pro Tour in his sixth Top 8. In September, the incredible return of Germany's Kai Budde to the Top 8 showcased the thrill-ride that was Pro Tour–Amsterdam, before Paul Rietzl of the United States made history, becoming only the second Pro Tour Champion to sweep the Top 8 in nine straight games."
