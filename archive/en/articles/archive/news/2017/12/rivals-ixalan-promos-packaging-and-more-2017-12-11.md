Blake is the content manager for DailyMTG.com, making him the one you should email if you have thoughts on the website, good or less good (or not good). He's a longtime coverage reporter and hasn't turned down a game of Magic in any format ever. 






True *Rivals of Ixalan* previews don't start until January 1 (mark your calendars), but that doesn't mean we can't show off a few items before we head into DailyMTG's annual holiday Best Of season.


Without further ado . . .


Packaging
=========


First up, we've got the booster packaging. *Rivals* has five different booster images, four for the various factions and one for another denizen of the plane.

Yes, that Pirate is indeed Angrath.


Also, here are the bundle and booster box images. Because I care.

Next up, you might have already seen these, but [Polygon](https://www.polygon.com/2017/12/5/16738902/magic-the-gatherings-rivals-of-ixalan-exclusive-new-cards-art) showed off the Planeswalker Deck face and exclusive cards last week. We'll show them off here as well, just for the sake of completeness.

You've [probably already seen this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_MltCxTvu4), but if not, here's the gorgeous [Silvergill Adept](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Silvergill+Adept) you can get by participating in Open House January 6–7, 2018!

======


Participate in a [League](https://magic.wizards.com/en/event-types/magic-league) and you could do some exploring of your own deck with this fancy [Evolving Wilds](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Evolving+Wilds)!

Buy-a-Box
=========


On to the promos! First up is the Buy-a-Box. Pick up a box of *Rivals of Ixalan* and you could receive Captain's Hook! (While supplies last at participating stores; check with your local store for availability.)

Draft Weekend
=============


Participate in a Draft Weekend event January 20–21, 2018, and you could walk home with a bounty—Brass's Bounty, to be specific.

Friday Night *Magic* Tokens
===========================


Finally, we'll have three new double-sided tokens that probably raise more questions than answers. What is the city's blessing? What's a Rekindling Phoenix? What is that Merfolk staring at? So many questions.
