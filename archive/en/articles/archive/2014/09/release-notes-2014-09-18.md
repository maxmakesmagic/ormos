The Release Notes include information concerning the release of a new *Magic: The Gathering* set, as well as a collection of clarifications and rulings involving that set's cards. It's intended to make playing with the new cards more fun by clearing up the common misconceptions and confusion inevitably caused by new mechanics and interactions. As future sets are released, updates to the *Magic* rules may cause some of this information to become outdated. If you can't find the answer you're looking for here, please contact us at [Wizards.com/CustomerService](http://wizards.custhelp.com/).


The "General Notes" section includes release information and explains the mechanics and concepts in the set.


The "Card-Specific Notes" section contains answers to the most important, most common, and most confusing questions players might ask about cards in the set. Items in the "Card-Specific Notes" section include full card text for your reference. Not all cards in the set are listed.

**Theme: Five "Wedge" Clans**


The plane of Tarkir is inhabited by five clans, each led by a powerful khan, that battle for territory and supremacy. Although dragons have long been extinct on Tarkir, the clans each embody a draconic aspect. Each clan is based around three colors of magic known as a "wedge" - a pair of allied colors and their common enemy. For example, the Mardu clan uses the allied colors black and red and their common enemy white. Each clan has a signature keyword or ability word. Cards strongly associated with a clan, including all cards with that clan's mechanic, have the clan icon in their text boxes. These icons have no effect on game play.




---

**Abzan Keyword: Outlast**


Abzan is the white-black-green clan. Its clan icon is a crossed pair of dragon scales. Outlast is a new keyword that allows creatures to prepare for a long battle by becoming more powerful.


![](https://media.wizards.com/images/magic/tcg/products/ktk/8arg43u984398yf/en_o2khcvhc6o.png)



Salt Road Patrol  




The official rules for outlast are as follows:


702.106. Outlast


702.106a Outlast is an activated ability. "Outlast [cost]" means "[Cost], ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20170424152623im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/tap.gif): Put a +1/+1 counter on this creature. Activate this ability only any time you could cast a sorcery."




* The cost to activate a creature's outlast ability includes the tap symbol (![](https://web.archive.org/web/20170424152623im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/tap.gif)). A creature's outlast ability can't be activated unless that creature has been under your control continuously since the beginning of your turn.
* Several creatures with outlast also grant an ability to creatures you control with +1/+1 counters on them, including themselves. These counters could come from an outlast ability, but any +1/+1 counter on the creature will count.




---

**Jeskai Keyword: Prowess**


Jeskai is the blue-red-white clan. Its clan icon is a dragon eye. Prowess is a new keyword that gives a creature a size bonus whenever you cast a noncreature spell.


![](https://media.wizards.com/images/magic/tcg/products/ktk/8arg43u984398yf/en_oz317wz4pu.png)



Jeskai Elder  
![](https://web.archive.org/web/20211201201921im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless1.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161115194122im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/blue.gif)  

Creature — Human Monk  

1/2  

Prowess *(Whenever you cast a noncreature spell, this creature gets +1/+1 until end of turn.)*  

Whenever Jeskai Elder deals combat damage to a player, you may draw a card. If you do, discard a card.



The official rules for prowess are as follows:


702.107. Prowess


702.107a Prowess is a triggered ability. "Prowess" means "Whenever you cast a noncreature spell, this creature gets +1/+1 until end of turn."


702.107b If a creature has multiple instances of prowess, each triggers separately.




* Any spell you cast that doesn't have the type creature will cause prowess to trigger. If a spell has multiple types, and one of those types is creature (such as an artifact creature), casting it won't cause prowess to trigger. Playing a land also won't cause prowess to trigger.
* Prowess goes on the stack on top of the spell that caused it to trigger. It will resolve before that spell.
* Once it triggers, prowess isn't connected to the spell that caused it to trigger. If that spell is countered, prowess will still resolve.

**Sultai Keyword: Delve**


Sultai is the black-green-blue clan. Its clan icon is a single dragon fang. Delve is a returning keyword that lets you exile cards from your graveyard to help pay for spells.


![](https://media.wizards.com/images/magic/tcg/products/ktk/8arg43u984398yf/en_yymdlpbluz.png)



Dead Drop  
![](https://web.archive.org/web/20171126205314im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless9.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227195556im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/black.gif)  

Sorcery  

Delve *(Each card you exile from your graveyard while casting this spell pays for ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20211201201921im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless1.gif).)*  

Target player sacrifices two creatures.



The official rules for delve are as follows:


702.65. Delve


702.65a Delve is a static ability that functions while the spell with delve is on the stack. "Delve" means "For each generic mana in this spell's total cost, you may exile a card from your graveyard rather than pay that mana." The delve ability isn't an additional or alternative cost and applies only after the total cost of the spell with delve is determined.


702.65b Multiple instances of delve on the same spell are redundant.




* The rules for delve have changed slightly since it was last in an expansion. Previously, delve reduced the cost to cast a spell. Under the current rules, you exile cards from your graveyard at the same time you pay the spell's cost. Exiling a card this way is simply another way to pay that cost.
* Delve doesn't change a spell's mana cost or converted mana cost. For example, Dead Drop's converted mana cost is 10 even if you exiled three cards to cast it.
* You can't exile cards to pay for the colored mana requirements of a spell with delve.
* You can't exile more cards than the generic mana requirement of a spell with delve. For example, you can't exile more than nine cards from your graveyard to cast Dead Drop.
* Because delve isn't an alternative cost, it can be used in conjunction with alternative costs.

**Mardu Ability Word: Raid**


Mardu is the red-white-black clan. Its clan icon is a pair of dragon wings. Raid is an ability word that appears in italics at the beginning of cards that improve if you attacked with a creature that turn. (An ability word has no rules meaning.)


![](https://media.wizards.com/images/magic/tcg/products/ktk/8arg43u984398yf/en_8emfnetq8i.png)



Mardu Heart-Piercer  
![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227130050im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless3.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227130159im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/red.gif)  

Creature — Human Archer  

2/3  
*Raid* — When Mardu Heart-Piercer enters the battlefield, if you attacked with a creature this turn, Mardu Heart-Piercer deals 2 damage to target creature or player.




* Raid abilities care only that you attacked with a creature. It doesn't matter how many creatures you attacked with, or which opponent or planeswalker controlled by an opponent those creatures attacked.
* Raid abilities evaluate the entire turn to see if you attacked with a creature. That creature doesn't have to still be on the battlefield. Similarly, the player or planeswalker it attacked doesn't have to still be in the game or on the battlefield, respectively.



---

**Temur Ability Word: Ferocious**


Temur is the green-blue-red clan. Its clan icon is a dragon's claws. Ferocious is an ability word that appears in italics at the beginning of abilities that improve if you control a creature with power 4 or greater. (An ability word has no rules meaning.)


![](https://media.wizards.com/images/magic/tcg/products/ktk/8arg43u984398yf/en_2xj3o0jkm0.png)



Stubborn Denial  
![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161115194122im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/blue.gif)  

Instant  

Counter target noncreature spell unless its controller pays ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20211201201921im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless1.gif).  
*Ferocious* — If you control a creature with power 4 or greater, counter that spell instead.






  
![](https://media.wizards.com/images/magic/tcg/products/ktk/8arg43u984398yf/en_t3ndmavtnb.png)



Roar of Challenge  
![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161225105850im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless2.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20220123123600im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/green.gif)  

Sorcery  

All creatures able to block target creature this turn do so.  
*Ferocious* — That creature gains indestructible until end of turn if you control a creature with power 4 or greater.




* Some ferocious abilities that appear on instants and sorceries use the word "instead." These spells have an upgraded effect if you control a creature with power 4 or greater as they resolve. For these, you only get the upgraded effect, not both effects.
* Ferocious abilities of instants and sorceries that don't use the word "instead" will provide an additional effect if you control a creature with power 4 or greater as they resolve.

**Returning Keyword: Morph**


All five clans of Tarkir regularly use deception in their battles with each other. Morph is a returning keyword that lets a creature hide its true identity.


![](https://media.wizards.com/images/magic/tcg/products/ktk/8arg43u984398yf/en_cv7yxupc0r.png)

Morph ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161225105850im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless2.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227125855im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/white.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227195556im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/black.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20220123123600im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/green.gif)*(You may cast this card face down as a 2/2 creature for ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227130050im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless3.gif). Turn it face up any time for its morph cost.)*



Other than some minor terminology changes and rules renumbering, the official rules for morph haven't changed since their last appearance in an expansion. They are as follows:


702.36. Morph


702.36a Morph is a static ability that functions in any zone from which you could play the card it's on, and the morph effect works any time the card is face down. "Morph [cost]" means "You may cast this card as a 2/2 face-down creature, with no text, no name, no subtypes, and no mana cost by paying ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227130050im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless3.gif) rather than paying its mana cost." (See rule 707, "Face-Down Spells and Permanents.")


702.36b To cast a card using its morph ability, turn it face down. It becomes a 2/2 face-down creature card, with no text, no name, no subtypes, and no mana cost. Any effects or prohibitions that would apply to casting a card with these characteristics (and not the face-up card's characteristics) are applied to casting this card. These values are the copiable values of that object's characteristics. (See rule 613, "Interaction of Continuous Effects," and rule 706, "Copying Objects.") Put it onto the stack (as a face-down spell with the same characteristics), and pay ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227130050im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless3.gif) rather than pay its mana cost. This follows the rules for paying alternative costs. You can use morph to cast a card from any zone from which you could normally play it. When the spell resolves, it enters the battlefield with the same characteristics the spell had. The morph effect applies to the face-down object wherever it is, and it ends when the permanent is turned face up.


702.36c You can't cast a card face down if it doesn't have morph.


702.36d Any time you have priority, you may turn a face-down permanent you control face up. This is a special action; it doesn't use the stack (see rule 115). To do this, show all players what the permanent's morph cost would be if it were face up, pay that cost, then turn the permanent face up. (If the permanent wouldn't have a morph cost if it were face up, it can't be turned face up this way.) The morph effect on it ends, and it regains its normal characteristics. Any abilities relating to the permanent entering the battlefield don't trigger when it's turned face up and don't have any effect, because the permanent has already entered the battlefield.


702.36e See rule 707, "Face-Down Spells and Permanents," for more information on how to cast cards with morph.




* Morph lets you cast a card face down by paying ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227130050im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless3.gif), and lets you turn the face-down permanent face up any time you have priority by paying its morph cost.
* The face-down spell has no mana cost and has a converted mana cost of 0. When you cast a face-down spell, put it on the stack face down so no other player knows what it is, and pay ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227130050im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless3.gif). This is an alternative cost.
* When the spell resolves, it enters the battlefield as a 2/2 creature with no name, mana cost, creature types, or abilities. It's colorless and has a converted mana cost of 0. Other effects that apply to the creature can still grant it any of these characteristics.
* Any time you have priority, you may turn the face-down creature face up by revealing what its morph cost is and paying that cost. This is a special action. It doesn't use the stack and can't be responded to. Only a face-down permanent can be turned face up this way; a face-down spell cannot.
* If a face-down creature loses its abilities, it can't be turned face up because it no longer has morph (or a morph cost).
* Because the permanent is on the battlefield both before and after it's turned face up, turning a permanent face up doesn't cause any enters-the-battlefield abilities to trigger.
* Because face-down creatures don't have a name, they can't have the same name as any other creature, even another face-down creature.
* A permanent that turns face up or face down changes characteristics but is otherwise the same permanent. Spells and abilities that were targeting that permanent, as well as Auras and Equipment that were attached to the permanent, aren't affected.
* Turning a permanent face up or face down doesn't change whether that permanent is tapped or untapped.
* At any time, you can look at a face-down spell or permanent you control. You can't look at face-down spells or permanents you don't control unless an effect instructs you to do so.
* If a face-down spell leaves the stack and goes to any zone other than the battlefield (if it was countered, for example), you must reveal it. Each graveyard is kept in a single face-up pile.
* If a face-down permanent leaves the battlefield, you must reveal it. You must also reveal all face-down spells and permanents you control if you leave the game or if the game ends.
* You must ensure that your face-down spells and permanents can easily be differentiated from each other. You're not allowed to mix up the cards that represent them on the battlefield in order to confuse other players. The order they entered the battlefield should remain clear. Common methods for doing this include using markers or dice, or simply placing them in order on the battlefield.

**New Layout: Modal Spells and Abilities**


A spell or ability is modal if it has two or more options preceded by "choose one" or similar. Each of those options is a mode. The layout of modal spells and abilities is being updated starting with *Khans of Tarkir*. Now, all modes will be presented in a bulleted list. Older cards will receive updated wordings in the Oracle card reference.

Instant  

Choose one —  

• Destroy target monocolored creature.  

• Destroy target artifact or enchantment.  

• Draw two cards, then discard a card.




* This is a layout change only. The rules for how modal spells and abilities function have not changed.
* You choose which mode a spell or ability uses as you cast that spell or activate that ability.
* If a mode requires one or more targets, you choose those targets only if that mode is chosen. If the chosen mode doesn't require targets, the spell or ability is treated as though it didn't have those targets.
* If a modal spell or ability is copied, the copy has the same mode as the original.

Choose one —  

•Exile target creature with power 3 or greater.  

•You draw two cards and you lose 2 life.  

•Distribute two +1/+1 counters among one or two target creatures.




* If you choose the third mode, you choose how the counters will be distributed as you cast the spell. Notably, if you choose to put one +1/+1 counter on each of two target creatures, and one of those creatures becomes an illegal target in response, the +1/+1 counter that would have been put on that creature is lost. It can't be put on the remaining legal target.

* Gaining control of a creature doesn't cause you to gain control of any Auras or Equipment attached to that creature.

Artifact  

Whenever another permanent enters the battlefield under your control, each opponent puts the top card of his or her library into his or her graveyard.

Anafenza, the Foremost  
![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227125855im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/white.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227195556im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/black.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20220123123600im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/green.gif)  

Legendary Creature — Human Soldier  

4/4  

Whenever Anafenza, the Foremost attacks, put a +1/+1 counter on another target tapped creature you control.  

If a creature card would be put into an opponent's graveyard from anywhere, exile it instead.




* Anafenza's first ability can target any tapped creature you control. That creature doesn't necessarily have to be attacking.
* While Anafenza is on the battlefield, abilities that trigger whenever a nontoken creature your opponent owns dies won't trigger, as that card will never reach that player's graveyard. (Token creatures will still go to the graveyard briefly before ceasing to exist.)
* If your opponent discards a creature card while Anafenza is on the battlefield, abilities that function when a card is discarded (such as madness) still work, even though that card never reaches a graveyard. In addition, spells or abilities that check the characteristics of a discarded card (such as [Chandra Ablaze](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chandra+Ablaze)'s first ability) can find that card in exile.
* Anafenza's last ability cares only what the card would be in the zone it's moving from, not what it would be in the graveyard. For example, if a land card you control becomes a creature due to an effect and then dies, the land card will be exiled. But if a creature card with bestow is an Aura when it would be put into the graveyard, it ends up in the graveyard.

Arc Lightning deals 3 damage divided as you choose among one, two, or three target creatures and/or players.




* You choose how many targets [Arc Lightning](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arc+Lightning) has and how the damage is divided as you cast the spell. Each target must receive at least 1 damage.
* If some of the creatures are illegal targets as [Arc Lightning](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arc+Lightning) tries to resolve, the original division of damage still applies but no damage is dealt to the illegal targets. If all targets are illegal, [Arc Lightning](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arc+Lightning) is countered.

Notably, if you choose to put one +1/+1 counter on each of two target creatures, and one of those creatures becomes an illegal target in response, the +1/+1 counter that would've gone on that creature is lost. It can't be put on the remaining legal target.

Whenever Avalanche Tusker attacks, target creature defending player controls blocks it this combat if able.

If there's a cost associated with having that creature block, its controller isn't forced to pay that cost. If the player doesn't, the creature doesn't block in that case either.

You may have Clever Impersonator enter the battlefield as a copy of any nonland permanent on the battlefield.




* You choose which nonland permanent Clever Impersonator will copy, if any, as it enters the battlefield. This doesn't target that nonland permanent.
* Remember that if you control more than one legendary permanent with the same name, or more than one planeswalker with the same type, you'll need to choose one to remain on the battlefield and put the rest into their owner's graveyards.
* If Clever Impersonator enters the battlefield as a copy of a planeswalker, it will enter the battlefield with a number of loyalty counters on it equal to the loyalty printed in the lower right corner of the planeswalker card. It won't copy the number of loyalty counters on the original planeswalker.
* Clever Impersonator copies exactly what is printed on the chosen permanent (unless that permanent is copying something else or is a token; see below). It doesn't copy whether that permanent is tapped or untapped, whether that permanent has any counters on it or any Auras and/or Equipment attached to it, and it doesn't copy any non-copy effects that have changed that permanent's power, toughness, types, color, abilities, or so on.
* If the chosen permanent has ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20160829100442im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/x.gif) in its mana cost, X is considered to be 0.
* If the chosen permanent is a copy of something else (for example, if the chosen permanent is another Clever Impersonator), then your Clever Impersonator enters the battlefield as whatever the chosen permanent copied.
* If the chosen permanent is a token, Clever Impersonator copies the original characteristics of that token as defined by the effect that put that token onto the battlefield. Clever Impersonator is not a token.
* Any enters-the-battlefield abilities of the chosen permanent will trigger when Clever Impersonator enters the battlefield. Any "as [this permanent] enters the battlefield" or "[this permanent] enters the battlefield with" abilities of the chosen permanent will also work.
* If Clever Impersonator enters the battlefield at the same time as another permanent, it can't become a copy of that permanent. You may only choose a nonland permanent that's already on the battlefield.
* You can choose not to copy anything. In that case, Clever Impersonator enters the battlefield as a 0/0 creature, and it's put into the graveyard immediately (unless something is raising its toughness above 0).

* The sacrifice is not dependent on the damage being dealt. It doesn't matter if that damage is prevented or redirected.
* Crackling Doom doesn't target any player or creature. For example, a creature with protection from black could be sacrificed.
* In a multiplayer game, each opponent, starting with the active player and proceeding in turn order, chooses which creature he or she will sacrifice and then all creatures are sacrificed at the same time. Each successive player will know what the players before him or her chose to sacrifice.

Notably, if noncombat damage would be dealt to you by a source controlled by an opponent, you choose the order in which to apply Deflecting Palm and the planeswalker redirection effect. If you apply Deflecting Palm first, the damage will be prevented (and damage will be dealt to the source's controller) and the planeswalker redirection effect won't apply.

* The value of X is determined as the activated ability resolves. If the equipped creature isn't on the battlefield at that time, use its power the last time it was on the battlefield to determine the value of X. If that power was negative, other creatures you control will lose power and toughness. For example, if the equipped creature was 2/2 and a spell gave it -5/-5 in response to Dragon Throne of Tarkir's activated ability, other creatures you control would get -3/-3 until end of turn.

Sorcery  

When you cast your next instant or sorcery spell this turn, copy that spell. You may choose new targets for the copy.  
*Raid* — If you attacked with a creature this turn, when you cast your next instant or sorcery spell this turn, copy that spell an additional time. You may choose new targets for the copy.




* Howl of the Horde creates a delayed triggered ability that triggers when you cast your next instant or sorcery spell that turn. The raid ability creates a second, identical delayed triggered ability. Each of these will create a single copy of the next instant or sorcery spell you cast during that turn. If you don't cast another instant or sorcery spell during that turn, both delayed triggered abilities will cease to exist.
* The delayed triggered abilities will copy any instant or sorcery spell, not just one with targets.
* When either ability resolves, it creates a copy of the instant or sorcery spell. You control each copy. Each copy is created on the stack, so it's not "cast." Abilities that trigger when a player casts a spell won't trigger. The copy or copies will then resolve like normal spells, after players get a chance to cast spells and activate abilities.
* Each copy will have the same targets as the spell it's copying unless you choose new ones. You may change any number of the targets, including all of them or none of them. If, for one of the targets, you can't choose a new legal target, then it remains unchanged (even if the current target is illegal). You can choose different targets for each copy.
* If the spell being copied is modal (that is, it says "Choose one —" or the like), each copy will have the same mode. You can't choose a different one.
* If the spell being copied has an X whose value was determined as it was cast (like Crater's Claws has), each copy will have the same value of X.

* Each creature you control with a +1/+1 counter on it untaps at the same time as the active player's permanents. You can't choose to not untap them at that time.
* Effects that state a creature you control doesn't untap during your untap step won't apply during another player's untap step.
* Controlling more than one Ivorytusk Fortress doesn't allow you to untap any creature more than once during a single untap step.

If you do, return a creature card at random from your graveyard to the battlefield. It gains flying, trample, and haste. Exile that card at the beginning of your next end step. If it would leave the battlefield, exile it instead of putting it anywhere else.




* You decide whether to pay ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161225105850im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless2.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227195556im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/black.gif) as the ability resolves.
* The creature card returned to the battlefield is chosen at random as the ability resolves. If any player responds to the ability, that player won't yet know what card will be returned.
* Because the ability doesn't target any creature card, any creature card (including Kheru Lich Lord itself) put into the graveyard in response to that ability may be returned to the battlefield.
* The ability that exiles the card at the beginning of your next end step is a delayed triggered ability. If the delayed triggered ability is countered, the creature will stay on the battlefield and the ability won't trigger again. However, the replacement effect will still exile the creature when it eventually leaves the battlefield.
* Kheru Lich Lord grants flying, trample, and haste to the creature that's returned to the battlefield. However, neither of the "exile" abilities is granted to that creature. If that creature loses all its abilities, it will still be exiled at the beginning of your next end step, and if it would leave the battlefield, it is still exiled instead.
* If a creature card returned to the battlefield with Kheru Lich Lord would leave the battlefield for any reason, it's exiled instead. However, if that creature is already being exiled, then the replacement effect won't apply. If the spell or ability that exiles it later returns it to the battlefield (as Suspension Field might, for example), the creature card will return to the battlefield as a new object with no relation to its previous existence. The effects from Kheru Lich Lord will no longer apply to it.
* The exiled creature is never put into the graveyard. Any abilities the creature has that trigger when it dies won't trigger.

* You can target a spell you control with Kheru Spellsnatcher's triggered ability. This will give you the ability to cast the card later without paying its mana cost.
* Because you're already casting the card using an alternative cost (by casting it without paying its mana cost), you can't pay any other alternative costs for the card, including casting it face down using the morph ability. You can pay additional costs, such as kicker costs. If the card has any mandatory additional costs, you must pay those.

* If you control no creatures as Kin-Tree Invocation resolves, you'll put a 0/0 token onto the battlefield. Unless something else is raising its toughness above 0, it will immediately be put into its owner's graveyard and then cease to exist. Any abilities that trigger when a creature enters the battlefield or dies will trigger.

* Because you're already casting the card using an alternative cost (by casting it without paying its mana cost), you can't pay any other alternative costs for the card, including casting it face down using the morph ability. You can pay additional costs, such as kicker costs. If the card has any mandatory additional costs, you must pay those.
* If the card has ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20160829100442im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/x.gif) in its mana cost, you must choose 0 as the value for X when casting it.
* Any exiled cards you don't cast remain in exile.

Planeswalker — Sarkhan  

4  

+1: Until end of turn, Sarkhan, the Dragonspeaker becomes a legendary 4/4 red Dragon creature with flying, indestructible, and haste. *(He doesn't lose loyalty while he's not a planeswalker.)*  

−3: Sarkhan, the Dragonspeaker deals 4 damage to target creature.  

−6: You get an emblem with "At the beginning of your draw step, draw two additional cards" and "At the beginning of your end step, discard your hand."




* If Sarkhan, the Dragonspeaker becomes a creature due to his first ability, that doesn't count as having a creature enter the battlefield. Sarkhan was already on the battlefield; he only changed his types. Abilities that trigger whenever a creature enters the battlefield won't trigger.
* Any loyalty counters on Sarkhan when his first ability resolves will remain on him while he's a creature. Because he's not a planeswalker at this time, damage dealt to him won't cause those counters to be removed.
* After the first ability resolves, Sarkhan won't be a planeswalker until the end of the turn. Later that turn, if you cast another Sarkhan, the Dragonspeaker, neither permanent will be put into its owner's graveyard. The "legend rule" sees only the original Sarkhan and the "planeswalker uniqueness rule" sees only the new Sarkhan. However, if you activate the first ability of the new Sarkhan, you would then control two legendary permanents with the same name. You'd choose one to remain on the battlefield and the other would be put into its owner's graveyard. If you don't activate the first ability of the new Sarkhan, the original Sarkhan will return to being a planeswalker during the cleanup step. You would then control two planeswalkers with the same planeswalker type. You'd choose one to remain on the battlefield and the other would be put into its owner's graveyard. There would then be another cleanup step before the turn ended.
* If a permanent enters the battlefield as a copy of Sarkhan after his first ability has resolved, the copy will be a Sarkhan planeswalker. It will enter the battlefield with four loyalty counters, no matter how many loyalty counters are on the original Sarkhan. You'll then find yourself in the same situation described above.

* Smoke Teller's ability lets you look at the creature as the ability resolves. It doesn't let you look at it later, although you should be given a reasonable amount of time to look at it. In a multiplayer game, be sure not to reveal the card to other players.
* You could target a creature you control with Smoke Teller's ability, but there's no benefit to doing so. Remember, you may look at face-down spells you control on the stack and face-down permanents you control at any time.

Enchantment  

When Suspension Field enters the battlefield, you may exile target creature with toughness 3 or greater until Suspension Field leaves the battlefield. *(That creature returns under its owner's control.)*




* Suspension Field's ability causes a zone change with a duration. It's a single ability that creates two one-shot effects: one that exiles the creature when the ability resolves, and another that returns the exiled card to the battlefield immediately after Suspension Field leaves the battlefield.
* If the target creature becomes an illegal target before the ability resolves, perhaps because its toughness was lowered, the ability will be countered and none of its effects will happen. No creature will be exiled, and Suspension Field will remain on the battlefield.
* If Suspension Field leaves the battlefield before its enters-the-battlefield ability resolves, the target creature won't be exiled.
* Auras attached to the exiled creature will be put into their owners' graveyards. Equipment attached to the exiled creature will become unattached and remain on the battlefield. Any counters on the exiled creature will cease to exist.
* If a token is exiled this way, it ceases to exist. It won't be returned to the battlefield.
* The exiled card returns to the battlefield immediately after Suspension Field leaves the battlefield. Nothing happens between these two events, including state-based actions. Suspension Field and the returned card aren't on the battlefield at the same time.
* In a multiplayer game, if Suspension Field's owner leaves the game, the exiled card will return to the battlefield. Because the one-shot effect that returns the card isn't an ability that goes on the stack, it won't cease to exist along with the leaving player's spells and abilities on the stack.

* Extra turns can still be created while Ugin's Nexus is on the battlefield. They're not skipped until they would begin, so if Ugin's Nexus leaves the battlefield before that happens, the extra turns will be unaffected.

Ignore timing restrictions based on the cards' types. Other timing restrictions, such as "Cast [this card] only during combat," must be followed.
* Because you're already casting the cards using an alternative cost (by casting them without paying their mana costs), you can't pay any other alternative costs for the cards, including casting them face down using the morph ability.

* Each time a creature dies, check whether Zurgo had dealt any damage to it at any time during that turn. If so, Zurgo's ability will trigger. It doesn't matter who controlled the creature or whose graveyard it went to.
