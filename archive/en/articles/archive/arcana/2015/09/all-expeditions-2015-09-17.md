There's really not much I can say here to make you read this article. You probably aren't even reading this. Or this. You've scrolled down, haven't you? And here I spent a good 60 seconds thinking of this introduction that breaks the fourth wall while providing a meta commentary on both internet content and the hype surrounding the *Zendikar Expeditions*.


Oh well. Give the people what they want.


If you haven't seen all of them yet, I present to you all 25 *Zendikar Expeditions* from *Battle for Zendikar*.
