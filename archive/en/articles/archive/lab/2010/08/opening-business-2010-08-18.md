Hello all, and welcome back to the Lab. Today I will follow my fellow columnists in discussing what may be the most overlooked aspect of the game of **Magic**: The opening hand. Oh, sure, the actual cards in that hand are scrutinized, but many players, myself included, often casually toss off the general concept of the "opening hand". It's only in the forefront when you add the whopping eleven possible cards in the whole game that the opening hand can be manipulated by. And, as a Johnny, manipulation of little-known rules can be quite fun.

Before I get into these cards, I want to quickly cover a subject that can be quite dodgy among casual circles: The mulligan. Sure, sometimes the mulligan is just as easy as reshuffling, drawing six new cards, and saying go. Other times, however, it can be surprisingly different. For example, my hometown playgroup of three to five players has adopted the 'free mulligan' rule: Your first mulligan can be seven cards, not six.
