Luis Scott-Vargas vs. Ben Zoz
-----------------------------


This third-place playoff would determine who goes to Paris as part of the US National Team, and who takes 4th as the alternate. It was a Solar Flare mirror match, pitting two black-white-blue, dragon-packed reanimator decks, piloted by Luis Scott-Vargas and Ben Zoz, against one another. Zoz knew that Scott-Vargas would love to make the team to join his friend Paul Cheon, but Zoz had a few dragons of his own to put in the way of that dream.

### Game 1


Scott-Vargas got to town with an opening "[Compulsive Research](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Compulsive+Research) discarding land" - a phrase you'll see a lot in this report. He later cracked the first business spell with [Persecute](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Persecute). Zoz had the [Remand](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Remand), but Scott-Vargas's [Remand](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Remand) asked politely for that [Remand](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Remand) to stick around until later, and [Persecute](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Persecute) resolved. Scott-Vargas named black and hit Kokusho, [Persecute](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Persecute), and [Angel of Despair](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Angel+of+Despair), leaving two Wraths and the stuck [Remand](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Remand).


"Come on [Zombify](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Zombify)," quipped Zoz.


Both players piled lands for a while, including [Mikokoro, Center of the Sea](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mikokoro%2C+Center+of+the+Sea) for Zoz. As Scott-Vargas set up with a [Court Hussar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Court+Hussar), Zoz activated Mikokoro almost "for free," keeping his opponent's hand full and causing him to discard the extra cards. The two fought over a [Court Hussar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Court+Hussar) here and a [Persecute](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Persecute) hit Zoz's Wraths, but Zoz was not out. He kept up card parity with that hard-working Mikokoro, and finally got through a [Zombify](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Zombify) on its second casting. A zombified [Angel of Despair](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Angel+of+Despair) loomed over the board for just a moment, until Scott-Vargas animated his own Angel, Vindicating Zoz's.


Zoz Researched discarding land, then hardcast [Yosei, the Morning Star](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Yosei%2C+the+Morning+Star). Scott-Vargas struck back with his own copy of the legend, and both players spent a turn flattened under Yosei triggers.


Zoz got to untap first and saw the green light. He sent in a [Court Hussar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Court+Hussar), which got through and became [Ink-Eyes, Servant of Oni](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ink-Eyes%2C+Servant+of+Oni), which in turn reanimated Scott-Vargas's Yosei. Zoz then dropped [Mortify](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mortify) on the Yosei to keep Scott-Vargas's world tilted at ninety degrees. One more crash-and-reanimate later, Zoz dropped [Angel of Despair](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Angel+of+Despair) on the zombie Yosei, and Scott-Vargas reached for his board. The big ninja and white dragon-based disruption allowed Zoz to recover from [Persecute](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Persecute) pain and hit back hard.

### Game 2


After a flurry of land drops and signets, Scott-Vargas opened with [Castigate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Castigate). Seeing three [Court Hussar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Court+Hussar), [Remand](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Remand), and [Cranial Extraction](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cranial+Extraction), he unsurprisingly took the Cranial. Zoz started the Hussar Train to dig for action, and Scott-Vargas matched with two of his own. Zoz had [Remand](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Remand) for Scott-Vargas's Meloku, and untapped to [Persecute](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Persecute)-blue the legend away, seeing a white dragon and land.


Scott-Vargas summoned Yosei while Zoz looked for an answer with his third Hussar. Scott-Vargas fired a blind [Cranial Extraction](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cranial+Extraction) naming [Condemn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Condemn), and skewered Zoz's only two spells, leaving just a slightly smoking, four-land hand behind. Yosei got in there for 5, bringing Zoz to 13.


Zoz answered with a Vindicate Angel off the top, killing Yosei, but Scott-Vargas had a replacement white dragon as Zoz's permanents napped for a turn. Kokusho joined its white cousin, and although Zoz had Miren to gain life from his Angel, he had no good plays against the two dragons.


A nearly prophetic Extraction on [Condemn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Condemn) paved the way for another draconic killing blow.


Scott-Vargas 1, Zoz 1


### Game 3


Zoz opened Game 3 with a mulligan. Scott-Vargas had a bounce land going second, conveniently discarding [Angel of Despair](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Angel+of+Despair). Zoz's [Persecute](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Persecute) met [Remand](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Remand), and Scott-Vargas [Persecute](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Persecute)d right back, hitting [Persecute](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Persecute) times two and [Angel of Despair](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Angel+of+Despair), leaving lands and Wrath.


Stripped of action, Zoz could only look on as Scott-Vargas Zombified his Angel, [Stone Rain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stone+Rain)ing an [Azorius Chancery](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Azorius+Chancery) on its way in. Zoz Researched, discarding Wrath and Yosei and leaving a [Caves of Koilos](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Caves+of+Koilos) up. [Fear](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fear)ing that untapped white source, Scott-Vargas Researched for something to stop [Condemn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Condemn), but marched Angel in there anyway, and [Condemn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Condemn) indeed sent Angel to the bottom. Unable to reanimate, Scott-Vargas made a consolation [Court Hussar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Court+Hussar).


Zoz took the opportunity to [Cranial Extraction](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cranial+Extraction)[Angel of Despair](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Angel+of+Despair), seeing his opponent's [Condemn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Condemn), [Zombify](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Zombify) and Yosei. Sitting on almost twice Zoz's mana, Scott-Vargas deployed Yosei and [Remand](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Remand)ed Zoz's attempt at [Zombify](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Zombify). Scott-Vargas's Hussar marched into the Red Zone as Yosei No. 2 set up the lockdown, and when Scott-Vargas reanimated one of the white dragons the same turn, Zoz packed it up.


Scott-Vargas 2, Zoz 1


### Game 4


Scott-Vargas had a bounce land-discarding-Meloku trick, and his [Castigate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Castigate) met [Remand](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Remand). [Castigate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Castigate) bounced off a [Remand](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Remand) again, and Scott-Vargas Researched discarding land, his hand full but unable to pierce the [Remand](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Remand)-wall.


Zoz lowered the boom with a [Cranial Extraction](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cranial+Extraction) naming [Castigate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Castigate), and was pleased to find *three* copies along with Extraction, Research, and Hussar. Scott-Vargas's return Extraction wiped out Angels of Despair.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/usnat06/3-4_Scott-Vargas.jpg)*Luis Scott-Vargas sets up with Court Hussar while Randy Buehler busts a freestyle rap.*
Zoz hardcast Ink-Eyes, followed it up with [Persecute](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Persecute) on a pair of [Compulsive Research](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Compulsive+Research)es. Scott-Vargas counted his life total and his outs, and even holding a [Zombify](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Zombify) and Kokusho, the math wasn't good. That uppercut to Scott-Vargas's hand disruption allowed Zoz to get down the hardest-working ninja in the game, then work over his opponent in short order. This fight would go to a fifth and final game.


Scott-Vargas 2, Zoz 2


### Game 5


Zoz had the first business spell in [Court Hussar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Court+Hussar). Scott-Vargas took that crucial turn-four opportunity to throw a [Persecute](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Persecute) at his opponent, which resolved, and took black cards - a déjà vu-inducing double [Persecute](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Persecute) and [Angel of Despair](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Angel+of+Despair), leaving lands and Wrath. Scott-Vargas followed up with his own Hussar and then Yosei, forcing Zoz to Wrath and spend a turn all sideways.


Scott-Vargas pressed the attack with [Compulsive Research](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Compulsive+Research) discarding a Hussar and Signet, and reanimated the white dragon while Zoz dropped Mikokoro. Yosei got in there, and [Cranial Extraction](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cranial+Extraction) removed the possibility of [Angel of Despair](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Angel+of+Despair), seeing his opponent's hand of lands. Zoz activated Mikokoro to drill for action spells.


He found one - a hardcast Ink-Eyes. Scott-Vargas's next [Castigate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Castigate) hit Yosei, and the in-play dragon crashed in, taking Zoz to 10 and showing either a [Court Hussar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Court+Hussar) chump or a Minamo-untap.


Zoz had a [Persecute](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Persecute)-blue to check the situation - and had he named black, he would have hit Ink-Eyes, [Persecute](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Persecute) and [Angel of Despair](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Angel+of+Despair), but instead whiffed. Ink-Eyes attacked and Yosei duly untapped and blocked, tapping him down. Zoz regenerated Ink-Eyes, but this tapped him out. Scott-Vargas played quickly now, seeing the opening - he dropped [Angel of Despair](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Angel+of+Despair) on Ink-Eyes, killing the rat ninja, then stormed the gates with Angel and Hussar, ninjutsu'ing out his own Ink-Eyes for lethal damage.
