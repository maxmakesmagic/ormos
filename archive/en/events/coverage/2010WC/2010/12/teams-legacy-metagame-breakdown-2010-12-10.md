**Survival of the Fittest - 12**  

A green based deck that uses [Survival of the Fittest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Survival+of+the+Fittest) to search out silver bullets as well as power out multiple [Vengevine](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vengevine)s in a single turn thanks to [Basking Rootwalla](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Basking+Rootwalla).


**Merfolk - 8**  

The quartet of [Lord of Atlantis](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lord+of+Atlantis), [Merrow Reejerey](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Merrow+Reejerey), [Merfolk Sovereign](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Merfolk+Sovereign) and [Coralhelm Commander](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Coralhelm+Commander) backed by free counterspells like [Force of Will](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Force+of+Will) and [Daze](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Daze) are swinging games in its favor.


**Tendrils Combo - 6**  

Cheap mana effects are plentiful in Legacy and when combined with the storm spell, [Tendrils of Agony](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tendrils+of+Agony), games could end in a single turn.


**Junk - 5**  

When you combine green, white and black into one deck, you get the best creatures like [Tarmogoyf](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf), [Knight of the Reliquary](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Knight+of+the+Reliquary) and [Dark Confidant](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dark+Confidant), paired with the best removal in the form of [Swords to Plowshares](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swords+to+Plowshares), [Vindicate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vindicate) and [Pernicious Deed](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pernicious+Deed).
