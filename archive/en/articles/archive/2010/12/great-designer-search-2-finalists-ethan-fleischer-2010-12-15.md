### Commentary:


Each card in my common cycle has to do with tunneling or excavating, making the addition of the Dig keyword natural.


Light needed a counterpart to Dark's sneaky Morph mechanic. Why would Dark resort to sneaky guerrilla tactics? Because it's outnumbered! I simplified Jon's Living Reflection mechanic, then introduced the twist of switching the token's power and toughness. My focus-group testing indicates that the power and toughness switch appeals to some players, but not to others. It serves a useful game function, however, giving a control deck a defensive creature early in the game, and a bonus aggressive creature later in the game, once the control player has stabilized the battlefield. The Light faction is comprised of four colors, which makes a cycle of such cards difficult. Black's member of the cycle is a morph creature with a similar ability, flavored as spy.


The rare cycle gets to the heart of the set, at least as I perceive it. A battle between Light and Darkness suggests dualism, Manichaeism, dichotomy. This theme implies split cards, with one half Dark-themed and one half Light-themed. White always represents Light and black always represent Darkness. This time, the math worked out in my favor, and each of the three other colors got to be Dark on one card and Light on another. We tried to make the Light effects positive and the Dark effects negative. Some of these cards are still a bit rough, but the structure of the cycle is sound, I think.
