Sunday, 11:06 a.m. – Drafting with Kazuya Mitamura
--------------------------------------------------


*by Rich Hagon* 

The 2009 Pro Tour Honolulu Champion came into day two with a 6-1 record, having made a clean sweep of his draft pod yesterday. It was green that served him well on day one, but he seemed happy to see what the cards brought him.



![Skinshifter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Skinshifter)

What the cards brought him first was a green rare, [Skinshifter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skinshifter) . This is just the kind of card a Pro player loves - something with options.


A 4/4 trampler, a 2/2 Bird, or a 0/8 Plant, and all three can be useful in the right situation. Given the green opening, it was a surprise when he passed on the opportunity to take [Overrun](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Overrun) in pack two. Instead he took the much more manageable and always excellent [Incinerate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Incinerate) . [Greater Basilisk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Greater+Basilisk) was next, and then a [Titanic Growth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Titanic+Growth) over [Stampeding Rhino](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stampeding+Rhino) - perhaps he felt one 4/4 trampler was enough! [Acidic Slime](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Acidic+Slime) rounded out the first five picks, and all seemed well.


Then the shape of the draft began to kick in, and things started to go not so well.


To his right, Yuuta Takahashi, a multiple Grand Prix winner, was taking red aggressively, but had begun to take green as a support color. To Takahashi's right, [Garruk, Primal Hunter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Garruk%2C+Primal+Hunter) had been opened, and that meant that he too was going to be green. As the first pack wound down, the good cards dwindled markedly, with a playable/sideboard [Plummet](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plummet) the only thing of note.



![Warstorm Surge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Warstorm+Surge)

Into pack two then, and Mitamura found an easy pick waiting for him, quickly shuffling the six casting cost red rare [Warstorm Surge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Warstorm+Surge) to the front of the pack. Of course, it's quite an investment, being six mana and a card for something that does precisely nothing alone, but it's also the kind of card that can finish off an opponent just as they're starting to gain control of a game. [Chandra's Outrage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chandra%27s+Outrage) brought him some more removal and burn in a neat package, but the third pack saw him disappointed. There were plenty of quality cards left in the pack, with a blue-white player having [Pacifism](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pacifism) , [Merfolk Looter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Merfolk+Looter) , and [Divination](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Divination) to choose from, but Mitamura was left with a [Lightning Elemental](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Elemental) , normally a 'filler' card in the mid to late picks.


Then came a real choice in pack four:



![Garruk's Companion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Garruk%27s+Companion)
![Furyborn Hellkite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Furyborn+Hellkite)

[Garruk's Companion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Garruk%27s+Companion) is an excellent card. It's really efficient, always does a job for you, whether that's beating, trading aggressively, or taking removal from an opponent's hand. Meanwhile, there's [Furyborn Hellkite](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Furyborn+Hellkite) . That's a 6/6 flyer for seven mana that has Bloodthirst 6. That's potentially a 12/12 flyer. I have a sneaking suspicion that this is one of those 'Pro v Joe' picks. Personally, I'd take the flyer. It makes for great stories, it's really hard to kill, nobody wants to lose to a gigantic rare flying man, and it's mythic, so how often are you going to get to play with it? Then there's the Pro argument. Games don't always get to seven mana. What if they have [Act of Treason](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Act+of+Treason) or [Mind Control](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mind+Control) ? If you have it in your opening hand, it's as if you mulliganed. The Companion is ultra-consistent. Consistent wins games, games win matches, matches win tournaments, so take the Companion.


Mitamura took the Companion.


He had some decent cards the rest of the way through pack two, which is no surprise since the player to his left was solidly black-white.


[Llanowar Elves](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Llanowar+Elves) , [Shock](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shock) , [Stampeding Rhino](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stampeding+Rhino) , and [Trollhide](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Trollhide) all made their way into his pile. This is all good, but it needs to be, because green and red would be in short supply in pack three.



![Lightning Elemental](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Lightning+Elemental)

What he really wanted was a nice opening pack, and that's certainly what he didn't get. In the second booster he took [Lightning Elemental](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Elemental) as a third pick. Here, it was his first pick. With a weak pack second that only featured [Manic Vandal](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Manic+Vandal) in red and nothing in green, he took [Gideon's Lawkeeper](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gideon%27s+Lawkeeper) , presumably to help clear the way for his hasty 4/1s. [Incinerate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Incinerate) and [Titanic Growth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Titanic+Growth) are nice at three and four, but then another blank, with all the cards he wanted already gone. He took [Pacifism](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pacifism) . Does anybody splash for [Pacifism](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pacifism) and [Gideon's Lawkeeper](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gideon%27s+Lawkeeper) ?!?


Another [Titanic Growth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Titanic+Growth) and [Fiery Hellhound](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fiery+Hellhound) were all that the rest of the pack had to offer.


So, a plan: Use some removal to clear a path, beatdown with hasty men, and pump them up for maximum damage. Then cast [Warstorm Surge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Warstorm+Surge) and deal the final points to the face.


It sounds like a good plan. Not sure it's going to be that easy...


 

Sundary, 11:50 a.m. – Throne, Crown, & Scepter
----------------------------------------------


*by Rich Hagon* 

Magic is full of cards that belong together. Take the Urzatron lands for example:




![Urza's Mine](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Urza%27s+Mine)![Urza's Tower](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Urza%27s+Tower)


![Urza's Power Plant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Urza%27s+Power+Plant)


Alone, unexciting. Together, powerhouse. In *M12*, there are a group of three artifacts that have a relationship with each other that bears close examination. They are, of course, the Empire artifacts.




![Throne of Empires](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Throne+of+Empires)![Crown of Empires](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Crown+of+Empires)


![Scepter of Empires](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Scepter+of+Empires)


Let's assume for a moment that you're going to play all three of them together in Sealed if you happen to open them, if only because you won't have the opportunity very often. Let's also assume for a moment that they aren't powerful enough to become the cornerstone of a Standard deck. Therefore, let's look at the possibilities in Draft.


The [Crown of Empires](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Crown%2Bof%2BEmpires) is clearly good in its own right. Yes, three mana is a lot to sink into it every turn, but it's also a small price to pay if it means avoiding getting hit by a [Serra Angel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Serra+Angel) , or [Sengir Vampire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sengir+Vampire) , or anything with a [Greatsword](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Greatsword) equipped. The [Throne of Empires](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Throne%2Bof%2BEmpires) is also a card that does something on its own, churning out a 1/1 every turn. That's not super-exciting, but it is something that can keep you in the game while you find your cards that are super-exciting.


Then there's the [Scepter of Empires](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Scepter%2Bof%2BEmpires), and this is where things start to get interesting. It's always an intriguing area of the game when cards don't directly impact the board. You have to spend an amount of mana and a whole, precious card to change nothing about the battlefield, so what it does away from the battlefield has to be proportionally better to justify inclusion in your deck. One damage to a player doesn't sound like a lot. Even if you draw this when your opponent is at something like five live, that's still a ton of time for them to draw an answer. In that situation, even a 1/1 dude might sometimes be better.


What about the upside if you assemble the trinity?


[Scepter of Empires](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scepter+of+Empires) still isn't super-exciting, although three damage to the face will end games a lot quicker than one damage a turn.


[Throne of Empires](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Throne+of+Empires) becomes close-to unstoppable, generating five 1/1s each turn instead of just one, although you could still die to a random flyer. That's where the [Crown of Empires](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Crown%2Bof%2BEmpires) steps in, not just tapping the creature, but stealing it instead. That's an unbelievable upgrade.


Alright, so there's no doubt that assembling all three, if you can do it, is incredibly powerful. How often can you expect that to happen?


Now we get into really complicated number-crunching, but we'll try to keep it simple. There are 24 rares in any given draft (all things being equal). That in itself guarantees that there will only be a [Throne of Empires](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Throne+of+Empires) in your draft less than 50% of the time. Is it powerful enough on its own that anybody would first pick it? Probably not, so if there's one in the draft you might get it a few picks down the line.


Both the [Scepter of Empires](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Scepter%2Bof%2BEmpires) and the [Crown of Empires](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Crown%2Bof%2BEmpires) are uncommon, and there are 72 of those (give or take) in each draft. At least one of each should be there. As we've discovered, the [Scepter of Empires](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Scepter%2Bof%2BEmpires) isn't that exciting, although presumably a Bloodthirst black-red player would be more interested than most.


Nonetheless, experience here at Japan Nationals suggests that the [Scepter of Empires](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Scepter%2Bof%2BEmpires) goes late, so if you want it, you can probably get it.


The [Crown of Empires](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Crown%2Bof%2BEmpires), however, is another matter. Tapping things is good news, even at a cost. Tapping things with a class of permanent that many decks have difficulty destroying - it's much harder to kill a [Crown of Empires](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Crown%2Bof%2BEmpires) than a [Gideon's Lawkeeper](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gideon%27s+Lawkeeper) - make the [Crown of Empires](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Crown%2Bof%2BEmpires) very appealing, and of course being an artifact means that it fits in any deck. If you want the [Crown of Empires](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Crown%2Bof%2BEmpires), you're going to have to take it early.


So let's take stock. If you open the [Throne of Empires](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Throne%2Bof%2BEmpires), and take it, your priority becomes finding the [Crown of Empires](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Crown%2Bof%2BEmpires). If you do that, you should get there, because the [Scepter of Empires](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Scepter%2Bof%2BEmpires) goes late. Of course, you might take a [Crown of Empires](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Crown%2Bof%2BEmpires) early, get passed a [Scepter of Empires](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Scepter%2Bof%2BEmpires) late, and then open the [Throne of Empires](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Throne%2Bof%2BEmpires) in pack two or three. Now that would be good times. In reality, though, opening the [Throne of Empires](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Throne%2Bof%2BEmpires) and trying to put the trinity together?


Good luck. You're going to need it.


 

Round 9: Feature Match – Katsuhiro Mori vs. Makihito Mihara
-----------------------------------------------------------


*by Rich Hagon* 

What a matchup. This is the kind of head to head that makes watching Magic fun. Two genuinely outstanding players with great records, looking to advance to 8-1, both having won their opening match of the day. Both players are former World Champions. Mori defeated Frank Karsten on home soil in Yokohama 2005, while Mihara travelled to Paris a year later to claim the 2006 title with his Dragonstorm deck.


### Game 1


Mihara opened with [Ponder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ponder) , checking his hand before leaving the cards on top of his library. With [Mind Control](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mind+Control) amongst the three, that was no surprise. [Crimson Mage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crimson+Mage) on turn two met with [Wring Flesh](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wring+Flesh) from Mori, who spent turn two looking at Mihara's hand with [Distress](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Distress) . Mihara revealed [Incinerate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Incinerate) , [Fiery Hellhound](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fiery+Hellhound) , [Mind Control](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mind+Control) , and [Skywinder Drake](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skywinder+Drake) . The 3/1 flyer hit the graveyard, with Mori casting a 3/1 of his own in [Bloodrage Vampire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodrage+Vampire) . That didn't last long, Mihara using his [Incinerate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Incinerate) before attacking. He added [Phantasmal Bear](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phantasmal+Bear) , and reloaded with [Divination](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Divination) .


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/jpnat11/fm9%20mori.jpg)*Katsuhiro Mori*
With Mori having just three [Swamp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swamp) s in play and no action, Mihara continued to press. A [Plains](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plains) allowed Mori to cast [Pacifism](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pacifism) , but Mihara took the game up a notch with [Bonebreaker Giant](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bonebreaker+Giant) . Mori got to five mana and cast [Vengeful Pharaoh](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vengeful+Pharaoh) , which is a very good card. Mihara spent three mana, and cast [Frost Breath](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Frost+Breath) , and that turned out to be even better.


**Mori 0 - 1 Mihara**


### Game 2


Mori elected to draw at the start of game two, and he had the first action of the game on turn three with [Devouring Swarm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Devouring+Swarm) . Mihara considered that enough of a threat to [Incinerate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Incinerate) it, spending his fourth turn drawing two cards with [Divination](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Divination) . [Diabolic Tutor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Diabolic+Tutor) from Mori fetched up [Grave Titan](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grave+Titan) , with Mihara laying [Bonebreaker Giant](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bonebreaker+Giant) .


After Mori cast [Vengeful Pharaoh](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vengeful+Pharaoh) , Mihara was ready with [Mind Control](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mind+Control) .


When Mori cast his [Grave Titan](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grave+Titan) the following turn, Mihara wasn't so ready...He traded his [Bonebreaker Giant](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bonebreaker+Giant) for the pair of 2/2 Zombies that had arrived with [Grave Titan](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grave+Titan) , and cast [Crown of Empires](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crown+of+Empires) , which would ensure that those Zombies wouldn't be replaced. Turns out he was kind of ready after all...


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/jpnat11/fm9%20mihara.jpg)*Makihito Mihara*
Mori cast [Distress](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Distress) , seeing two [Fiery Hellhound](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fiery+Hellhound) , [Turn to Frog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Turn+to+Frog) , and [Skywinder Drake](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skywinder+Drake) . Mori got rid of one of the [Fiery Hellhound](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fiery+Hellhound) s, before laying a [Forest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest) . What was his green splash? A second [Diabolic Tutor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Diabolic+Tutor) saw him spend a little time choosing between two cards. He was torn between [Pacifism](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pacifism) and [Smallpox](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Smallpox) . Which would he choose?


Mihara attacked with Mori's [Vengeful Pharaoh](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vengeful+Pharaoh) , dropping [Fiery Hellhound](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fiery+Hellhound) and leaving back enough mana to activate his [Crown of Empires](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crown+of+Empires) . [Mind Rot](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mind+Rot) from Mori saw Mihara discard [Turn to Frog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Turn+to+Frog) and [Skywinder Drake](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skywinder+Drake) , both cards that Mori knew from the earlier [Distress](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Distress) , leaving Mihara a lone card in hand, unknown to his opponent. In came the [Vengeful Pharaoh](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vengeful+Pharaoh) and [Fiery Hellhound](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fiery+Hellhound) once more, with Mori taking a huge eight damage and falling to just three life. [Goblin Tunneler](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Tunneler) joined the Mihara team, and Mori was in a really tough spot.


He drew for the turn. Mihara duly tapped the [Grave Titan](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grave+Titan) , and Mori scooped them up. Turn four [Diabolic Tutor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Diabolic+Tutor) , turn five [Vengeful Pharaoh](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vengeful+Pharaoh) , turn six [Grave Titan](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grave+Titan) . Nowhere near enough.


**Katsuhiro Mori 0 - 2 Makihito Mihara**


 

Sunday, 2:00 p.m. – The Art of Nils Hamm
----------------------------------------


*by Rich Hagon* 

With the second draft of Japan Nationals winding down, I took the chance to sit and chat with German artist Nils Hamm. This is a weekend of firsts for Nils, both his first time in Japan, and his first time at a Magic event on this scale. What are his impressions of Japan?


"Well of course I'm seeing it from a really privileged position. I'm staying in a fantastic hotel, eating fantastic food...it's a very specialist viewpoint of a place."


With a day to acclimatize on Friday before the event began in earnest, what did he do with his time off?


"I visited the aquarium and did some sketches for a couple of hours.It's something I do a lot of wherever I am. When I'm at home on weekends I'll often visit my local zoo and do some sketches of the animals there. That's also something I like to do when I'm away."


"There's something extremely peaceful about seeing the animals, and whether I'm in the strangest city, or the furthest place from home, that gives me that sense of peace. Also, it's quite interesting because zoos are all that little bit different around the world."


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/jpnat11/blog4%20Nils%20Hamm.jpg)*Artist Nils Hamm*


It isn't just the confined wildlife that's different.


"I get really excited by seeing nature up close, whether that's a type of bird I haven't seen before, or a cockroach on a sidewalk, or even a centipede eating a worm, which I got to see yesterday!"


If you look at Nils' Magic art via Gatherer, you'll find plenty of creatures with a strong insectile theme. Take [Pith Driller](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pith+Driller) from New Phyrexia for example. Is that something he's aware of nurturing when he's looking at the ways of nature?


"It's not something I'm conscious of," he says. "I certainly don't look at a bug and think 'that could be the start of a Magic piece somewhere down the line'. It's more a case of, if I have a commission for a piece, and then I suddenly see something and it might trigger a thought for an element of the final picture."

Nils has been working on Magic since Future Sight, and now has more than fifty cards to his name. How did he start?


"I played some role-playing games when I was a kid, so I knew about Magic when it came out. I was already drawing and painting, and I loved the way there were so many different styles of art on the cards. When I got older and knew that I wanted to be an illustrator I started sending portfolios in to Wizards of the Coast - I probably tried about five times! Then the opportunity came to start working on Hecatomb, and I moved from there to Magic."


So what has his first Magic event been like?


"It's been very nice. It's really great to meet so many people who appreciate what you do. The artist life can be very solitary, so it's great to have contact with so many people."


There's no doubt that Nils' most famous piece of Magic art is busy tearing up the top tables this weekend - it's [Grave Titan](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grave+Titan) . What does he remember about creating the art for this mythic powerhouse?



![Grave Titan](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Grave+Titan)

"I told the art director Jeremy Jarvis that I wanted to do some more cheerful pieces. I had done a lot of black cards, which I find pretty easy to do, but it's also draining, because you have to focus on the dark stuff, and I was churning out Zombie after Zombie after Zombie.


"Jeremy gave me a few lighter pieces to do, and that was easier anyway in Lorwyn because of the theme of the set. Then I got [Grave Titan](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grave+Titan) - that wasn't just dark, it was super-dark. I really wanted to do it - Zombies coming out of his stomach sounded like so much fun.


"The other thing that I remember is that I had just visited a very close friend out in California. He's an artist too, and works as a concept artist for many Hollywood studios. He's really good, and always teaches me a few new tricks. [Grave Titan](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grave+Titan) was the first piece I did after my California vacation, and I was able to try out some new things with [Grave Titan](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grave+Titan) . It looks like it came out pretty well!"


It certainly did.

The deck begins with a ton of mana acceleration. [Overgrown Battlement](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Overgrown+Battlement) is a tough-to-kill guarantee of four mana on turn three. [Rampant Growth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rampant+Growth) also gets you there. So does [Explore](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Explore) , presuming you have enough land to make that happen. That's phase one of the plan, so now we're at turn three with four mana to play with.




![Overgrown Battlement](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Overgrown+Battlement)![Rampant Growth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Rampant+Growth)


![Explore](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Explore)


There are broadly two options at this point. The most common is to lay a land, commit all four mana to an [Everflowing Chalice](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Everflowing+Chalice) with two counters on it, and then tap that Chalice for two more mana to create a second [Everflowing Chalice](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Everflowing+Chalice) with one counter on it. That takes you to a potential eight mana on turn four!


Alternatively - and this is the new innovation in the deck, courtesy of *M12* - spend the four mana on [Quicksilver Amulet](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Quicksilver+Amulet) . Historically it has been a little awkward if you end up with huge casting cost spells you can't cast, and there has always been a trade off between having enough Emrakuls and Ulamogs and [Terastodon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Terastodon) s and [Wurmcoil Engine](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wurmcoil+Engine) s to find them with your [Summoning Trap](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Summoning+Trap) s, and not having your hand swamped with them.



![Quicksilver Amulet](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Quicksilver+Amulet)

With the [Quicksilver Amulet](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Quicksilver+Amulet) , that's no longer a problem. Assuming that you get to untap on turn five, you can activate the Amulet and drop one of your big guys into play. You won't get the extra turn from Emrakul, because you didn't cast it, but let's not pretend that a turn five Emrakul isn't going to give opponents plenty of problems anyway...


Assuming that you've gone the more conventional turn three route of further mana acceleration, you now have a slew of options on turn four. Six mana allows you to hard cast your [Wurmcoil Engine](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wurmcoil+Engine) . Although that's one of your smaller threats, it's still a very big deal, especially that early in the game. With a couple of [Overgrown Battlement](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Overgrown+Battlement) s, it's easily possible to reach [Terastodon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Terastodon) territory on turn four. Or, with a more 'reasonable' six mana on turn four you can use [Summoning Trap](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Summoning+Trap) to go hunt one of your fatties out of the top seven. Of course, this is still something of a fishing expedition, but you do have ten creatures in your deck, not including the 'please don't let this be what I have to take' [Overgrown Battlement](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Overgrown+Battlement) .



![Spellskite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Spellskite)

Another neat card comes in the form of [Spellskite](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spellskite) out of the sideboard. Once your opponents have fallen victim to a [Quicksilver Amulet](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Quicksilver+Amulet) in games one or two, it's a good bet that they'll try to do something about it. That might mean [Manic Vandal](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Manic+Vandal) , or it might mean [Nature's Claim](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nature%27s+Claim) . In either case, getting [Spellskite](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spellskite) out as part of your turn four package makes it very tough to deal with [Quicksilver Amulet](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Quicksilver+Amulet) before it comes on line the following turn.


It looks as if Standard is wide open right now, and Eldrazi Green just got another shot in the arm. If you're playing Standard at **Friday Night Magic** this week, it's something you should take a look at. It's a lot of fun, and in the hands of Toshiyuki Kadooka at least, it's very good.


 

Sunday, 4:00 p.m. – Translators Needed
--------------------------------------


*by Rich Hagon* 

The Japanese coverage team here this weekend have undertaken the gargantuan task of typing all three hundred and fifty eight decklists.


That's a lot of [Mountain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mountain) s. However, sometimes enquiring minds want answers on the spot, and that means turning to one of the many 'excellent' free translation software packages available courtesy of the internet.


Let's give you a neat example. Here's a Standard decklist:


12 《山》  

4 《乾燥台地》  

4 《沸騰する小湖》  

4 《ぐらつく峰》  

-土地（24）-  
  

4 《ゴブリンの先達》  

4 《トゲ撃ちの古老》  

4 《渋面の溶岩使い》  

4 《ゴブリンの奇襲隊》  

4 《燃えさし運び》  

2 《ゴブリンの戦煽り》  

-クリーチャー（22）- 4 《稲妻》  

4 《ゴブリンの手投げ弾》  

1 《壊滅的な召喚》  

4 《燃え上がる憤怒の祭殿》  

1 《槌のコス》  

-呪文（14）- 3 《躁の蛮人》  

2 《ヴァルショクの難民》  

2 《焼却》  

4 《四肢切断》  

2 《反逆の行動》  

2 《魔力のとげ》  

-サイドボード（15）-


How's that working for you? I must admit, I'm struggling. So now here's the same decklist run through the 'global translator':


12 The Mountain  

4 The Dry Plateau  

4 The Small Lake Which Boils  

4 The Peak Which Is Shaken  

4 The Precursor Of Goburin

4 Sudden Attack Party Of Goburin

Round 12: Feature Match – Shouta Yasooka vs. Shouhei Yamamoto
-------------------------------------------------------------


*by Rich Hagon* 

With three rounds to go here in Standard both players have only two losses on the weekend. Win here, and they'll be on the cusp of the top 8. Lose, and there's still plenty of work to do. Although he's facing the 2006 Player of the Year Shouta Yasooka, Shouhei Yamamoto has plenty of Nationals pedigree, having made the top 8 on three occasions.


### Game 1


Yasooka began with a double mulligan, and against [Celestial Colonnade](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Celestial+Colonnade) and [Darkslick Shores](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Darkslick+Shores) from Yamamoto, that wasn't a good sign. At least Yasooka had some land to play, casting a mixture of blue and black lands that also included [Inkmoth Nexus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inkmoth+Nexus) , the first clue as to what he was playing. On turn five he offered [Tumble Magnet](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tumble+Magnet) , which Yamamoto allowed to resolve. He also allowed [Ratchet Bomb](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ratchet+Bomb) from Yasooka. Seven land in play, and Yamamoto hadn't cast a spell. Yasooka aimed for [Torpor Orb](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Torpor+Orb) , and that resolved as well.


Finally, a spell from Yamamoto, in the form of [Batterskull](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Batterskull) . Yasooka cast [Everflowing Chalice](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Everflowing+Chalice) for one, and used his [Tumble Magnet](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tumble+Magnet) to tap down the [Batterskull](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Batterskull) . Yamamoto used his second main phase to cast [Gideon Jura](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gideon+Jura) , while a planeswalker also appeared for Yasooka, casting [Jace Beleren](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace+Beleren) , and drawing himself a card.


Yamamoto activated his [Celestial Colonnade](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Celestial+Colonnade) and piled his team into Jace, offing the planeswalker. Yasooka had another which promptly drew him a card. [Ratchet Bomb](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ratchet+Bomb) was up to four counters by this point. In fact, there seemed to be counters everywhere - one on [Everflowing Chalice](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Everflowing+Chalice) , one on [Tumble Magnet](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tumble+Magnet) , four on [Ratchet Bomb](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ratchet+Bomb) , two on [Jace Beleren](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace+Beleren) , eight on [Gideon Jura](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gideon+Jura) ....it might be time to buy shares in a dice company...


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/jpnat11/fm12%20yasooka_sphinx.jpg)*Yasooka casts Consecrated Sphinx*
Yamamoto attacked and killed Jace, before Yasooka cast [Inquisition of Kozilek](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inquisition+of+Kozilek) , seeing two [Go for the Throat](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Go+for+the+Throat) and two [Mana Leak](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak) in Yamamoto's hand. He took a Mana leak, and despite his double mulligan had been given the time to get back into the game. When Yamamoto went to attack, Yasooka blew the [Ratchet Bomb](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ratchet+Bomb) , causing Yamamoto to return [Batterskull](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Batterskull) to hand, with Gideon going to the graveyard. Down came the mighty Equipment once more to end the turn.


For six mana Yasooka tried for [Wurmcoil Engine](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wurmcoil+Engine) , leaving exactly three mana open to render the [Mana Leak](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak) worthless. Yamamoto didn't try, and the Engine resolved. Now Yamamoto cast [Grave Titan](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grave+Titan) , which didn't get the 2/2 Zombies due to Yasooka's [Torpor Orb](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Torpor+Orb) . [Inquisition of Kozilek](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inquisition+of+Kozilek) from Yasooka revealed the two [Go for the Throat](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Go+for+the+Throat) and [Mana Leak](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak) , with him taking a [Go for the Throat](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Go+for+the+Throat) . He activated [Creeping Tar Pit](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Creeping+Tar+Pit) , and sent in his team, causing Yamamoto to use his second [Go for the Throat](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Go+for+the+Throat) on the [Creeping Tar Pit](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Creeping+Tar+Pit) .


Back we went, and a big crowd had gathered to watch an epic game.


[Celestial Colonnade](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Celestial+Colonnade) activated for Yamamoto, who forced Yasooka to remove his last [Tumble Magnet](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tumble+Magnet) counter. Fortunately he had another waiting. [Wurmcoil Engine](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wurmcoil+Engine) attacked the other way, with Yamamoto now at fifteen. Once again his [Mana Leak](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak) couldn't stop Yasooka from casting [Consecrated Sphinx](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Consecrated+Sphinx) .


When Yamamoto cast [Squadron Hawk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Squadron+Hawk) he found [Torpor Orb](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Torpor+Orb) scuppering his plans again. [Wurmcoil Engine](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wurmcoil+Engine) continued the assault, Yamamoto letting his [Batterskull](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Batterskull) token die, before seeing Yasooka attempt a [Batterskull](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Batterskull) of his own. For this Yamamoto made him pay three extra, leaving Yasooka short on mana.


Both players drew at the start of Yamamoto's turn, and his [Inquisition of Kozilek](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inquisition+of+Kozilek) revealed [Tezzeret, Agent of Bolas](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tezzeret%2C+Agent+of+Bolas) , [Consume the Meek](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Consume+the+Meek) , and [Sorin's Vengeance](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sorin%27s+Vengeance) from *M12*.Yamamoto was finally able to attack and generate a pair of 2/2s, but Yasooka was ready to pull the trigger on [Tezzeret, Agent of Bolas](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tezzeret%2C+Agent+of+Bolas) . The loyalty went to four, netting Yasooka an [Everflowing Chalice](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Everflowing+Chalice) . Yamamoto came back with [Gideon Jura](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gideon+Jura) , which killed the [Consecrated Sphinx](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Consecrated+Sphinx) . In came Yamamoto with [Grave Titan](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grave+Titan) , [Squadron Hawk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Squadron+Hawk) , and [Inkmoth Nexus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inkmoth+Nexus) . [Consume the Meek](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Consume+the+Meek) from Yasooka made this attack less profitable, and Yamamoto passed the turn.


Down came a flurry of artifacts, taking Yasooka to eight in total. Two times eight is sixteen, and that's how much life Yamamoto lost to the planeswalker's game-ending ultimate ability. What a game!


**Yasooka 1 - 0 Yamamoto**


### Game 2


The players sideboarded quickly and were into action once more, this time with seven cards each. Yasooka attempted to accelerate with [Everflowing Chalice](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Everflowing+Chalice) for one, which Yamamoto decided was unacceptable, using [Mana Leak](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak) to counter it. [Sword of Feast and Famine](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sword+of+Feast+and+Famine) was turn three for Yamamoto, with [Memoricide](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Memoricide) on turn four, naming [Tezzeret, Agent of Bolas](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tezzeret%2C+Agent+of+Bolas) . That caused Yasooka to take a long hard look at his sideboard. Was it possible that he had almost no routes to victory left? Well, no, but it was going to be a lot more difficult! It didn't help that apart from Tezzeret in hand - lost to the [Memoricide](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Memoricide) - he had nothing but land.


[Inquisition of Kozilek](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inquisition+of+Kozilek) revealed [Preordain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Preordain) , [Oblivion Ring](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oblivion+Ring) , and a land in Yamamoto's hand, and Yasooka took [Preordain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Preordain) . [Inkmoth Nexus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inkmoth+Nexus) traded with [Inkmoth Nexus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inkmoth+Nexus) , before Yamamoto cast another. He was able to equip it with the [Sword of Feast and Famine](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sword+of+Feast+and+Famine) , then follow up with a [Squadron Hawk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Squadron+Hawk) . This time that resolved, and he went to his deck in search of the rest of the formation flying team.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/jpnat11/fm12%20yamamoto.jpg)*Shouhei Yamamoto*
Yasooka replied with [Batterskull](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Batterskull) , while [Sea Gate Oracle](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sea+Gate+Oracle) and a [Squadron Hawk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Squadron+Hawk) continued to build Yamamoto's board. Oh, and the [Sword of Feast and Famine](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sword+of+Feast+and+Famine) on the first Hawk wasn't exactly bad news either...


Yasooka was down to one card, and [Inquisition of Kozilek](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inquisition+of+Kozilek) revealed that to be a land. Yamamoto cast [Jace Beleren](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace+Beleren) , drew himself a card, smashed into the red zone, and added [Batterskull](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Batterskull) . [Jace Beleren](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace+Beleren) from Yasooka merely dealt with the opposite planeswalker but did nothing to change the likely outcome, which was game three moments away...


**Yasooka 1 - 1 Yamamoto**


### Game 3


After the mauling of [Memoricide](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Memoricide) , Yasooka elected to take out two [Doom Blade](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Doom+Blade) , and put back in the [Consecrated Sphinx](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Consecrated+Sphinx) es that had done him so well in game one. A 'diverse threat base' they call it. Possibly.


On the play Yasooka knew he could get [Torpor Orb](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Torpor+Orb) into play unmolested on turn two, and that's how he began. Yamamoto cast [Squadron Hawk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Squadron+Hawk) knowing the same thing. Again being one turn ahead was critical, as Yasooka landed [Jace Beleren](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace+Beleren) and drew a card. Yamamoto pushed two cards to the bottom with [Preordain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Preordain) , laid [Inkmoth Nexus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inkmoth+Nexus) , and attacked Jace with his [Squadron Hawk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Squadron+Hawk) . Yasooka kept Jace alive by allowing both players to draw a card. After a [Preordain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Preordain) and a [Creeping Tar Pit](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Creeping+Tar+Pit) , he passed.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/jpnat11/fm12%20yasooka.jpg)*Yasooka takes command*
[Squadron Hawk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Squadron+Hawk) again attacked Jace, this time down to two counters, but Yasooka was ready with the [Mana Leak](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak) when Yamamoto went for [Sword of Feast and Famine](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sword+of+Feast+and+Famine) . [Inquisition of Kozilek](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inquisition+of+Kozilek) revealed two [Batterskull](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Batterskull) , [Liliana Vess](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Liliana+Vess) and [Go for the Throat](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Go+for+the+Throat) , so Yasooka sent [Go for the Throat](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Go+for+the+Throat) to the graveyard. He cast [Tezzeret, Agent of Bolas](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tezzeret%2C+Agent+of+Bolas) , and swiftly turned his [Torpor Orb](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Torpor+Orb) into a 5/5 before attacking with it. Now the [Squadron Hawk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Squadron+Hawk) had two planeswalkers to aim at, with Yamamoto choosing Tezzeret.


He closed the turn by dropping [Batterskull](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Batterskull) .


Yasooka drew from Jace, activated his [Inkmoth Nexus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inkmoth+Nexus) , and sacrificed Tezzeret as he made the 1/1 poisonous flyer a 5/5. Down came [Tumble Magnet](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tumble+Magnet) . Desperate times then for Yamamoto, who saw his [Batterskull](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Batterskull) tapped before it could attack. When he cast [Solemn Simulacrum](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Solemn+Simulacrum) he yet again failed to get any value due to that terribly annoying [Torpor Orb](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Torpor+Orb) . Yasooka attacked, leaving Yamamoto to block with his [Solemn Simulacrum](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Solemn+Simulacrum) . A second [Tumble Magnet](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tumble+Magnet) surely left Yamamoto in terrible trouble. He attempted [Batterskull](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Batterskull) to no avail. [Stoic Rebuttal](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stoic+Rebuttal) was there when Yasooka needed it, and the 2006 Player of the Year took another giant stride towards a bunch of Pro Points, and another crack at the biggest title in the game.


**Shouta Yasooka 2 - 1 Shouhei Yamamoto**


 

Sunday, 6:30 p.m.: Announcement – Disqualifications
---------------------------------------------------


*by Event Coverage Staff* 

It is always unfortunate when we are obliged to pass on bad news, but two players have been disqualified without prize here at Japan Nationals 2011. During the final round of draft, the two players - Kazuya Mitamura and Yuuta Takahashi - were observed discussing the possibility of a concession. Following that discussion, an apparent concession occurred, which later one of the players attempted to rescind. Both players then agreed to restart the game. After a lengthy investigation, it was deemed necessary to disqualify both players for Cheating, with Takahashi additionally cited for Unsportsmanlike Conduct.


This statement was prepared by Level 3 Head Judge Naoaki Umesaki:


"**Magic** exists for everyone to have fun in a competitive but fair environment. It is never a pleasant duty when the DCI has to step in to ensure those standards are upheld, but there are times when that duty becomes necessary to protect the integrity of both the tournament and the game as a whole. The investigation into this matter was extensive, with all judges in full agreement that this was the only course of action available to us. The DCI will investigate further, and take any appropriate action in due course."


 

Round 14: Feature Match – Takashi Akiyama vs. Makihito Mihara
-------------------------------------------------------------


*by Rich Hagon* 

The final round of Swiss, and two, one, or maybe even neither of these players will return tomorrow for the top 8. Ten minutes ago, Mihara was in the box seat, already at 33 points from his eleven wins and just two losses. Now, though, he has been paired down against Akiyama, who still has top 8 chances. A win for Mihara guarantees him a place in the top 8. Even a loss, and his tiebreaks may hold up. Akiyama needs to win, and hope his tiebreaks are good enough.


Ah, the last round of Swiss...


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/jpnat11/fm14%20shake.jpg)### Game 1


[Raging Ravine](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Raging+Ravine) began the match for Mihara, while Akiyama had [Preordain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Preordain) .


Mihara cast [Explore](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Explore) and laid [Valakut, the Molten Pinnacle](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Valakut%2C+the+Molten+Pinnacle) as his extra land for the turn. He attempted a further [Explore](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Explore) on turn three, leading into [Rampant Growth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rampant+Growth) , which Akiyama again allowed to resolve.


Mihara cast [Oracle of Mul Daya](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oracle+of+Mul+Daya) , and swiftly found it in his graveyard via [Doom Blade](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Doom+Blade) . Akiyama's fourth land was [Tectonic Edge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tectonic+Edge) , which he used to kill Mihara's Valakut. Mihara went for [Cultivate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cultivate) , and again it resolved, taking him to seven mana, four of them [Mountain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mountain) s. Another [Tectonic Edge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tectonic+Edge) followed from Akiyama, who seemed content to bide his time.


That changed when Mihara tapped out for [Avenger of Zendikar](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Avenger+of+Zendikar) . It resolved, netting him seven 0/1 plants. All Akiyama could do was cast [Into the Roil](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Into+the+Roil) with kicker to return the Avenger and draw a card, hopefully a more permanent answer. What is certain is that [Mana Leak](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak) was ready when Mihara tried again, though Akiyama showed no signs of relief. [Inquisition of Kozilek](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inquisition+of+Kozilek) revealed two [Green Sun's Zenith](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Green+Sun%27s+Zenith) in Mihara's hand, with one at least no longer a threat.


What about the second? [Stoic Rebuttal](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stoic+Rebuttal) answered that problem, and now Akiyama felt sufficiently in control to activate [Creeping Tar Pit](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Creeping+Tar+Pit) and begin the journey to victory. Mihara, however, had other ideas, ripping a third [Green Sun's Zenith](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Green+Sun%27s+Zenith) , and successfully resolving it, gaining both a [Primeval Titan](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Primeval+Titan) and double Valakut. He laid a third copy of the amazing land, and passed. [Tectonic Edge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tectonic+Edge) reduced the Valakut threat to two at the end of the turn.


Back to Akiyama, who cast [Ratchet Bomb](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ratchet+Bomb) and passed. Mihara knew his many plants were destined for death, so he didn't activate his [Raging Ravine](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Raging+Ravine) . He attacked, triggering the [Primeval Titan](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Primeval+Titan) , and the two [Mountain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mountain) s, coupled with one in Mihara's hand, were more than enough to get the job done, and take the 2006 World Champion to within one game of the top 8.


**Mihara 1 - 0 Akiyama**


### Game 2


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/jpnat11/fm14%20akiyama.jpg)*Takashi Akiyama*
[Inquisition of Kozilek](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inquisition+of+Kozilek) from Akiyama found Thran the last troll, two [Mountain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mountain) s, a [Forest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest) , [Terramorphic Expanse](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Terramorphic+Expanse) , [Valakut, the Molten Pinnacle](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Valakut%2C+the+Molten+Pinnacle) and [Rampant Growth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rampant+Growth) . There was only one target then, and [Rampant Growth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rampant+Growth) going away meant a less than great opening for Mihara.


He tried for [Explore](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Explore) on turn three, with Akiyama taking long enough to at least represent a [Mana Leak](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak) before allowing it. Akiyama cast [Spreading Seas](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spreading+Seas) on Mihara's [Forest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest) , ensuring that Mihara would use [Terramorphic Expanse](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Terramorphic+Expanse) to find another. When Mihara went for [Cultivate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cultivate) , Akiyama pulled the trigger on his [Mana Leak](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak) , and had a sideboarded [Flashfreeze](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flashfreeze) at the ready for another [Cultivate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cultivate) soon after.


Mihara continued to lay lands, casting [Oracle of Mul Daya](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oracle+of+Mul+Daya) , revealing [Avenger of Zendikar](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Avenger+of+Zendikar) on the top of his library. When he drew the Avenger, [Cultivate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cultivate) was on top, so still no free lands. Still, Mihara was up to seven lands, and he added to the future threat with a third copy of Valakut coming down. Only the [Spreading Seas](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spreading+Seas) on the second [Forest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest) was preventing him from trying for the Avenger.


Akiyama activated [Creeping Tar Pit](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Creeping+Tar+Pit) and attacked, but had nothing else.


Still Mihara found spells on top of his deck, drawing the [Cultivate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cultivate) to reveal a backup [Oracle of Mul Daya](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oracle+of+Mul+Daya) . He cast the [Cultivate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cultivate) . Akiyama responded with [Doom Blade](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Doom+Blade) for the Oracle before allowing the [Cultivate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cultivate) to resolve, Mihara choosing to find one [Forest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest) and one [Mountain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mountain) , opening up the possibility of [Avenger of Zendikar](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Avenger+of+Zendikar) the following turn.


[Spreading Seas](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spreading+Seas) averted that threat for the second time in the game, Akiyama again activating his [Creeping Tar Pit](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Creeping+Tar+Pit) and hitting Mihara down to fourteen. Mihara laid [Evolving Wilds](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Evolving+Wilds) , and passed. Now Akiyama had a precious bit of breathing room. He spent five mana on [Liliana Vess](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Liliana+Vess) , and sent her loyalty to three, going in search of future answers to present problems. As expected, Mihara searched up a [Forest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest) at end of turn, and the stage was set.

Finally Mihara had the mana he wanted. He began with [Oracle of Mul Daya](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oracle+of+Mul+Daya) which resolved, getting him both [Terramorphic Expanse](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Terramorphic+Expanse) and [Verdant Catacombs](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Verdant+Catacombs) , which he swiftly cracked for another [Forest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest) . This time [Primeval Titan](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Primeval+Titan) was revealed on top of the deck. Finally, it was time.


Mihara swept his land sideways, and went for the Avenger, which would be worth twelve tokens. Moments later, the tokens were on the battlefield. Now what for Akiyama?


Whatever he had found with Liliana needed to be good. Mihara had [Terramorphic Expanse](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Terramorphic+Expanse) ready to find a [Mountain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mountain) , he had a [Mountain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mountain) in hand, an [Oracle of Mul Daya](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oracle+of+Mul+Daya) in play...Akiyama didn't have the look of someone who was ready to find a way out. He cast [Jace Beleren](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace+Beleren) and used Liliana's ability to tutor up a card, which he then drew with Jace.


The trouble is, when you look through your deck and know that there's no answer, there really is no hope.


It had taken an extra round, but now Makihito Mihara was firmly into the top 8 of Japan Nationals 2011.


**Makihito Mihara 2 - 0 Takashi Akiyama**


 

Sunday, 7:49 p.m. – Shuuhei Super Sealed
----------------------------------------


*by Rich Hagon* 

The Player of the Year playoff back in February did more than produce one of the most compelling Magic storylines of all time. It also created a brand new format, and it's a format that lots of people have been trying out away from the cut and thrust of tournament play. Super Sealed features twelve boosters rather than the usual six, but the way Magic works, twelve boosters can give you decks that are comfortably more than double the power of normal Sealed play.


As we head for the second phase of the Battle of Champions, we thought we'd show you just what a player has to deal with when it comes to building Super Sealed. Here's the pool that ended up with Shuuhei Nakamura, the 2008 Player of the Year.

So there it is, and it's quite a collection. Part of the beauty of Super Sealed is that you aren't trying to decide between the last two or three cards for the one deck that seems really 'obvious'. Instead, you're often building two or three completely different archetypes, where perhaps barely a handful of cards overlap.


For example, you could build a deck that was determined to kill absolutely everything your opponent ever did, based in Black-Red. You might try to build Bloodthirst, because that's an aggro strategy which, when complemented with some removal, can be unstoppable.


Perhaps you're wanting to build a big green fatties deck. Or maybe blue-white flyers is your thing, taking to the air en route to victory.


Have a go yourself at building from this pool, and then take a look at what Shuuhei ended up playing:
