**Name:** Sveinung Bjørnerud


**Age:** 28


**Occupation:** Garbologist


**Hometown:** Drammen, Norway


**Previous *Magic* accomplishments:** 


Couple of Grand Prix Top 8s a good while ago. Runner-up at Team Worlds 2011.


**What was the best card in your Day 1 Sealed Deck, what color combination did you play, and what was your (individual) record?**


I played white-black and my best card was [Ixalan's Binding](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ixalan%27s+Binding). Not entirely sure what my record was. Isn't it irrelevant? But I'm pretty sure I didn't drop any matches.


**What was the best card in your Day 2 Sealed Deck, what color combination did you play, and what was your (individual) record?**


[Vona, Butcher of Magan](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vona%2C+Butcher+of+Magan) is pretty dumb, so that, probably. You would then correctly guess that I was white-black again. Record wasn't good. 1-2 maybe? There were a couple I didn't finish.


**What's the secret to success in Team Limited?**


Let's not succumb to survivor's bias quite yet! Actually, I'm not sure.

**Hometown:** Zurich, Switzerland


**Previous *Magic* accomplishments:** 


Grand Prix winner, National Champion.


**What was the best card in your Day 1 Sealed Deck, what color combination did you play, and what was your (individual) record?**


My red-green Sealed Deck was an assortment of equally mediocre cards. I can't disclose my personal record for policy reasons.


**What was the best card in your Day 2 Sealed Deck, what color combination did you play, and what was your (individual) record?**


Black-Red Pirate Aggro with [Ruin Raider](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ruin+Raider). Same record policies apply.


**What's the secret to success in Team Limited?**


Try to maximize the best cards in your pool while identifying subtle synergies that give you little edges. Make sure to get carried by your teammates ...
