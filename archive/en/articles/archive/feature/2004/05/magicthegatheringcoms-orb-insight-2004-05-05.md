### Instructions

 Type in a single term - with no spaces - in the input field and click Search to have the Orb of Insight reveal the number of instances of that term in the *Fifth Dawn* expansion spoiler (excluding Flavor Text). Colored casting costs may be searched using U for blue, B for Black, R for Red, G for Green, and W for White. Case doesn't matter.*For example, try...*  
 Auriok  
 Sorcery  
 Zug  
 1RR  
 3  
 +1/+1  
 2/1  


Only complete matches will be revealed... i.e. searching for the term *Arc* will not reveal words such as *Arcbound* but only the specific term *Arc*. Similarly, searching for *1* will not reveal terms matching *one*, *1/3*, or *2/1* but just the instance of *1* .

Be sure to [discuss your results](http://boards1.wizards.com/showthread.php?s=&threadid=233949) on the message boards!


  
*5/12 Note: "Relentless Rats" card name failed to import correctly into the Orb dataset. We have fixed this to correctly show the proper instance totals.*
