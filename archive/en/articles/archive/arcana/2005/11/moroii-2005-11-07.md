It's Dimir Week on **magicthegathering.com**! This week we get a chance to do what this guarded guild would never let a citizen of Ravnica do -- steal a look into their darkest secrets.


Today we take a look at the *moroii*, a potential [Lexicon](/en/articles/archive/lexicon-ravnica-edition-2005-10-05) entry in the making and part of the Dimir repertoire of sneaky minions.


In Romanian folklore, the moroii is a type of living vampire. Unlike the dead or undead variety (called by the more generic term *strigoi* in Romanian), this breed of vampire drains people of youth and beauty as well as blood, and doesn't need to spend its daylight hours in tombs. 


Similarly, in Ravnica, aside from being a vicious beatdown creature cut from the same mold as [Juzam Djinn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Juzam+Djinn), the [**moroii**](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=moroii) is a vampiric creature that drains years from life of its victim:

*"Touched by moroii"  
 —Undercity slang meaning "to grow old"*



The Ravnican moroii can also be seen in the art of **[Psychic Drain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psychic+Drain)**:

 *"Gold can be reearned, goods restored. The moroii steal youth, more precious than either, and once gone, it’s gone forever."  
 —Berta Suszat, civic healer*


The moroii, in essence, forms a bridge between two aspects of House Dimir -- on the one hand, it's a killer in the night, an infiltrator with deadly capabilities. On the other hand, it's tied to the flavor of "milling" a player's library -- a way to drain the life from other guilds and suck interlopers' brains dry of any stolen secrets.


Enjoy Dimir Week.
