We're moving on to week four in the "Selecting *Eighth Edition*" promo ([click here](http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=mtgcom/vote8e/home) to go to the page and vote), and this week's big winner was [Nekrataal](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nekrataal). Can't say I'm surprised. The original "187" creature (not the "official" name for the ability -- hope I don't get in trouble) has a nice ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161225105850im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless2.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227195556im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/black.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227195556im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/black.gif) price tag that offset the [Dark Hatchling](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dark+Hatchling)'s size and evasion. Next year [Nekrataal](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nekrataal) will get to smash stuff all over Friday Night **Magic**, PTQ's, and **Magic** Online, as well as a kitchen table near you! Will it be the "black Flametongue"?

| **Which card should be in *Eighth Edition*?** |  |  |
| [Nekrataal](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nekrataal) | 5959 | 71.7% |
| [Dark Hatchling](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dark+Hatchling) | 2353 | 28.3% |
| **Total** | **8312** | **100%** |

As for the [Angel of Mercy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Angel+of+Mercy) art voteâ€¦ We moved our web servers to the east coast recently in an attempt to handle all the traffic. While this is definitely a good thing, and our page updates three hours earlier now (midnight Eastern as opposed to midnight Pacific), some stuff was "broken" in the move. The Angel vote has been fixed since, so if you were having trouble with it before, give it a try now. We'll leave it up for another week.


The new art vote is for [Telepathy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Telepathy), a one-mana blue enchantment from *Urza's Saga* and *Seventh Edition*. The former is by Matthew Wilson, and the latter by Mark Tedin. I'm sure the old art is more recognizable, but take a second to look at the newer art as well -- it's very good.


The card choice for this week is sort of "addition by subtraction". Some room needs cleared out in rare artifact, and only one of these two bad boys gets to stay. So which will it be, [Static Orb](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Static+Orb) or [Ensnaring Bridge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ensnaring+Bridge)?


Both cards show up in tournament play as well as casual decks. But only one will live to fight another day. Register and vote! Head over to the [promo page](http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=mtgcom/vote8e/home) and choose wisely. Tune in Monday when Mark Rosewater discusses this promotion from the inside.
