Want a closer look at the new novel by the master craftsman who brought you *The Cheesehandler*?

  
*Mockup by Unhinged art director Brian Dumas*


Well, actually this is a fake novel cover mockup used on display box packaging of *Unhinged*, and on the [*Unhinged* product page](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=magic/expansion/unh). It's really small on the box and product page, though -- now you can read the cover. Sort of.

(There's a back cover for *Tijuana Nights*, too. But we'll let Brian Dumas weigh in on that and a lot more *Unhinged*  behind-the-scenes stuff later, a while after the set releases [this weekend](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=events/magic/prereleases).)

"Dear Ask Wizards, where can I submit my fanfic sample chapter of *Tijuana Nights*?" Uh, the [message boards](http://boards1.wizards.com/showthread.php?t=330498), I suppose. You do know it's a joke, right?
