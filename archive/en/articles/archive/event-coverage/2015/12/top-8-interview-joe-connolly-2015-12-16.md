With the Top 8 just announced, Joe was a little stunned with scraping into the last place of the final but was evidently relieved. He had piloted his deck, well Dave Williams' Obliterate deck, through 11 rounds of the GP, starting day one off with 2 byes. Living in Australia, and particularly Melbourne where the Magic scene is still a little slow, doesn't exactly do wonders for a man's rating. The cost of the flight from Melbourne was relatively cheap, and Joe was staying in a backpackers' lodge in Kings Cross with the New Zealand players who had flown in to play in the GP.



Despite the large amount of spectators that would gather around the matches, curious as to the new deck that was being played, Joe was not all that impressed with his deck. "You just mise sometimes" he said, "The deck really isn't all that great, but I got some amazing draws." He thought that this was clearly evident in his record versus Trix, which was 2-1 on Day 2. "There's really no way that I can beat it" he admitted "I just got lucky I think." These thoughts didn't sound too promising for his match in the Top 8 which was of course top seed Royce Chai playing Trix.



Still shocked at his Top 8 berth, Joe wandered off to talk to his friends about the match up ahead, looking for some words of encouragement to help him complete the impossible dream
