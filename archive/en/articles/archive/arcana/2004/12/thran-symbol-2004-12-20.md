*Happy holidays! This Arcana originally ran on January 20, 2004. Magicthegathering.com will return with new content on January 4th, 2005.*The Thran, an extinct race to which the Phyrexians belonged before they became half-mechanical monstrosities, once ruled Dominaria. They created powerful artifacts long before the times of *Mirrodin* or the *Urza Saga* block, and crafted ornate designs into their creations.

Buried in a **Magic** artist's style guide from the *Urza's Saga* days is this tidbit about the Thran: the Thran symbol, an icon representing the Thran culture and technology (see the symbol at right). This symbol is depicted in a few **Magic** cards; for example, see the art of *Urza's Legacy's* 
[Thran War Machine](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thran+War+Machine) and *Urza's Saga's* 
[Thran Quarry](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thran+Quarry), below.
