"Mr. SV, as a long-time proponent of fatty-riddled draft decks, tell me: just how excited are you for *Dragons of Tarkir* Limited?" That seemed like a reasonable start to a conversation, and it was.

Luis Scott-Vargas, Hall of Famer, five-time Grand Prix winner, Pro Tour champion, ChannelFireball superpro, and all-around good guy, certainly didn't disappoint. "*Dragons of Tarkir* is looking really good. I mean, so far we've mostly seen the splashy cards, all the rares and mythics and not too many commons and uncommons. Without them—the bread and butter of Limited—it's difficult to speculate about the format."


While that's true—by our count 22 rares and eleven mythics, but only ten commons and ten uncommons have officially been previewed so far—LSV did have more to say about the set's new mechanics. "Formidable is very similar to ferocious, maybe a little bit more all-in. Exploit seems like a sweet ability, rewarding good resource management and creating interesting game play. I definitely like that morph is back, or megamorph rather, which I suspect will feel pretty much like morph."


And what about rebound? "Oh, rebound is awesome! I loved it in *Rise of the Eldrazi* and *Rise of the Eldrazi* is actually one of my favorite draft formats of all time. If *Dragons of Tarkir* is anything like that, I will be so happy!"
