Both Tung Yi Cheng and Li Ciang Lyu defeated their quarterfinals opponents with aggressive Black-Red decks, which they would now have to pitch against each other in a gruesome pseudo-mirror match.


And it was just as gruesome as advertised. Game 1 ended as quickly as it started, with both players trading early drops, until Cheng played a turn five [Rotfeaster Maggot](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rotfeaster+Maggot), and a turn six [Scuttling Doom Engine](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scuttling+Doom+Engine). Lyu could only smile and reach for his sideboard.

They again traded their early drops in Game 2, but Lyu pressed his momentum with a [Gravedigger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gravedigger), and breezed through a [Rotfeaster Maggot](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rotfeaster+Maggot) with a [Necrobite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Necrobite). [Juggernaut](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Juggernaut) from Cheng looked like it might swing the game back in his favor, but Lyu pushed it home with a [Nightfire Giant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nightfire+Giant).

Cheng mulliganed to six in the deciding game, and was confronted by a hand of six land. He scoffed, before shuffling them back in for five replacements, only to find five non-lands waiting for him. He kept those, and passed back his first turn without play.


Lyu wasted no time playing lands of his own, and a [Witch's Familiar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Witch%27s+Familiar), only to see Cheng peel the two land he needed to summon a [Generator Servant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Generator+Servant), and power out a hasty [Juggernaut](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Juggernaut). Lyu played [Sign in Blood](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sign+in+Blood) and his own [Generator Servant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Generator+Servant), but when he pushed his creatures in front of the [Juggernaut](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Juggernaut), Cheng took out the Servant with a [Heat Ray](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Heat+Ray). Unfortunately for the [Witch's Familiar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Witch%27s+Familiar), it appeared the Servant had been load-bearing, leaving the Familiar to be crushed under the weight of the [Juggernaut](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Juggernaut). Lyu untapped and levelled a [Flesh to Dust](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flesh+to+Dust) at the artifact creature to finally stop it in its tracks.


Cheng played a [Child of Night](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Child+of+Night), and immediately sent it in with a [Hammerhand](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hammerhand), but Lyu came back over the top with a [Rotfeaster Maggot](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rotfeaster+Maggot), a Child of his own, and a [Rummaging Goblin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rummaging+Goblin). Cheng summoned [Kurkesh, Onakke Ancient](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kurkesh%2C+Onakke+Ancient) and the game ground to a halt.

Lyu began rummaging away his excess cards and played a pair of [Accursed Spirit](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Accursed+Spirit)s, while Cheng finally found enough land to play a [Rotfeaster Maggot](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rotfeaster+Maggot). Lyu summoned a [Shadowcloak Vampire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shadowcloak+Vampire), and the [Soul of Innistrad](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soul+of+Innistrad). Remarkably, Cheng had a [Flesh to Dust](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flesh+to+Dust) for the Avatar, and managed to take care of the back half of it with another [Rotfeaster Maggot](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rotfeaster+Maggot).



It really looked like Cheng might pull off the comeback of the weekend when Lyu sent the Vampire to the air, and Cheng called down a [Lightning Strike](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Strike), but Lyu saved it with a [Necrobite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Necrobite), before finishing Cheng off with a [Covenant of Blood](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Covenant+of+Blood) a turn later.


Li Ciang Lyu defeats Tung Yi Cheng 2-1 and advances to meet Hao-Shan Huang in the finals.
