Two natives from Tennessee faced off in this feature match. Craig Wescoe is playing his aggressive blue/white/red design and Doug Hanson is playing liquid tempo.


### Game 1


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/GPMINN01/958.jpg)Craig won the die roll and led off with a second turn [Galina's Knight](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Galina%27s+Knight). Doug responded with a third turn [Gaea's Skyfolk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gaea%27s+Skyfolk) but declined to block, signaling his intentional to play the damage race instead of playing into one of Craig's [Repulse](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Repulse)s. At the end of Doug's next turn, Craig cast Ice on Doug's [Shivan Oasis](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shivan+Oasis), reducing him to three mana and making him unable to cast [Mystic Snake](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mystic+Snake). Craig then took the opportunity to cast [Goblin Trenches](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Trenches), one of his primary bombs. 


Craig began to generate tokens, but he was still taking damage from a [Gaea's Skyfolk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gaea%27s+Skyfolk); after eight points of damage from the airbear, Craig fell helplessly to an assault of burn including two [Prophetic Bolt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Prophetic+Bolt)s, an [Urza's Rage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Urza%27s+Rage), and an unkicked [Breath of Darigaaz](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Breath+of+Darigaaz).

### Game 2


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/GPMINN01/957.jpg)Nine lands were on the table before a single spell was cast in this game. Doug, sitting on three Islands and a [Keldon Necropolis](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Keldon+Necropolis), cast an Ice to tap down a land and, most importantly, draw a card. Doug found a [Yavimaya Coast](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Yavimaya+Coast) off of his Ice, but at three mana, he was open to a [Fact or Fiction](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fact+or+Fiction) from Craig which yielded a [Goblin Trenches](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Trenches). The Trenches hit play and immediately began its work to create tokens. 


On the next turn, Doug yet signaled that he didn't have a [Mystic Snake](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mystic+Snake) by casting a [Lay of the Land](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lay+of+the+Land) and a [Gaea's Skyfolk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gaea%27s+Skyfolk), leaving three mana open. Craig cast a [Lightning Angel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Angel) on his next turn and [Disrupt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Disrupt)ed Doug's [Exclude](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Exclude), sending the Angel directly into combat. The [Gaea's Skyfolk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gaea%27s+Skyfolk) was removed by an [Urza's Rage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Urza%27s+Rage) one turn later, allowing the two leftover Goblin/Soldier tokens to begin attacking. 


In an attempt to stop Craig's creatures, Doug cast Fire on the opposing token creatures but had to take a point of mana burn because he failed to tap a red mana in casting the spell. This changed his life from five to four after the next attack from the [Lightning Angel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Angel), allowing him to be killed by Craig's [Prophetic Bolt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Prophetic+Bolt).

### Game 3


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/GPMINN01/954.jpg)Although there was definitely nothing fast about this game, it was nonetheless completely one-sided in Craig's favor. The fact that Doug drew about four more land than Craig combined with a pair of Craig's [Fact or Fiction](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fact+or+Fiction)s created a large card deficit. Doug was aptly able to handle a multitude of Craig's threats including several bears and a [Goblin Trenches](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Trenches), but it was Doug's last response which crushed him. On what became the last turn of his game, Doug chose to use [Breath of Darigaaz](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Breath+of+Darigaaz) for one to kill eight of Craig's Goblin/Soldier tokens -before- destroying the Trenches first with his [Tranquility](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tranquility). This mistiming allowed Craig to make enough tokens in response to the [Tranquility](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tranquility) to kill Doug on the next turn with a touch of burn.


**Final Result:** Doug Hanson 1 - Craig Wescoe 2


Craig Wescoe advances to 8-0-1 and remains on top of the leader board.
