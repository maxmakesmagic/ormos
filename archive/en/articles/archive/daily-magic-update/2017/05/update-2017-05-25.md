The May 25, 2017 Update
=======================

Blake is the content manager for DailyMTG.com, making him the one you should email if you have thoughts on the website, good or less good (or not good). He's a longtime coverage reporter and hasn't turned down a game of Magic in any format ever. 






The Daily *Magic* Update is a roundup of everything *Magic* you should know on May 25, 2017. Today's Update is brought to you by not acknowledging rumors either way. Which is our policy. You know, in case that was relevant.


Today's Must
============


1. [A Victory 14 Years in the Making](http://articles.mtgcardmarket.com/a-victory-14-years-in-the-making/) | MTG Card Market | Kevin Jones

This "wide-eyed little kid" (disclaimer: Kevin Jones is neither little nor actually a kid) recounts his experience growing up with *Magic* and just how much it means to him to have finally won a Grand Prix. The article is a heartfelt and touching look at what it means to finally get a trophy after living this game for so long.


Want more Kevin Jones? Who doesn't! StarCityGames.com [had an interview with him](http://www.starcitygames.com/article/35175_Interview-With-The-Editor-Kevin-Jones.html) today as well.


After That, Read, Watch, or Listen to These
===========================================


1. [Ben Stark on *Amonkhet*](http://lrcast.com/limited-resources-390-ben-stark-on-amonkhet/) | Limited Resources | Marshall Sutcliffe and Luis Scott-Vargas

No, Ben Stark isn't actually on Amonkhet. He's talking about *Amonkhet*. I know. I was confused, too.


Stark talks about the Limited format, and if you've seen any of the [Team Draft Super League](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3rP64NRtmbiiZKHZ9_UuflsbNxbhXGlA), then you already know he can talk and talk about *Amonkhet* Limited. Oh, and if you want even more Ben Stark after your Ben Stark, check out his [*Amonkhet* Draft videos just posted on Channel Fireball](https://www.channelfireball.com/videos/channel-bens-amonkhet-draft/).


1. [Everything You Need to Know About Aetherworks Marvel](https://soundcloud.com/user-121566285/gam-e35-everything-you-need-to-know-about-aetherworks-marvel) | GAM Podcast | Michael Majors and Gerry Thompson

The description has this listed as a "can't miss episode," and if Pro Tour Champion Gerry Thompson (now his full, legal name) says something is "can't miss," well, then you shouldn't miss it.


1. [Abzan Traverse for GPs Copenhagen and Kobe](http://www.dexarmy.com/?p=521) | DEX Army | Willy Edel

With a pair of Modern Grand Prix this weekend, eyes are starting to turn toward Modern. Edel goes deep here on his pet archetype—BGx (in this case, that x is white for the full Abzan)—and has the results to back it up. Definitely worth a look if you're slinging any Modern spells this weekend.


1. [Against the Odds: Cats (Modern)](https://www.mtggoldfish.com/articles/against-the-odds-cats-modern?src=wizards) | MTGGoldfish | SaffronOlive

On the other hand, maybe don't sleeve up this deck if you want to be competitive. If you want to build a cat deck for your fiancée (which I have), on the other hand, this is a great place to start. Maybe even a purrrrfect place to start.


Yes, I could have resisted. But I didn't.


1. [EDH MTG Commander Breya vs Sliver Overlord](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVBUJZyh9JE) | Brian Weissman

Yes, that Brian Weissman, of The Deck fame. He creates 1v1 Commander videos, and his latest comes on the heels of [the latest bannings in the format](http://wizardsmtgo.tumblr.com/post/161023137579/commander-1v1-banned-update). Weissman is articulate, thoughtful, and deeply entrenched in the world of 1v1 Commander, so definitely check out his Breya video for a look under the hood of this digital format.

1. [Did You Know Magic: Necropotence ft. TheMagicManSam](http://www.gatheringmagic.com/didyouknowmagic-05242017-did-you-know-magic-necropotence-ft-themagicmansam/) | Gathering Magic

Everything you wanted and didn't want to know about [Necropotence](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Necropotence), one of the most powerful cards ever printed.


1. [Is Aetherworks Marvel Too Good for Standard?](https://www.channelfireball.com/articles/is-aetherworks-marvel-too-good-for-standard/) | Channel Fireball | Mike Sigrist

[Aetherworks Marvel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aetherworks+Marvel) is the best deck in Standard—but is it *too* good? Siggy explores.

Happy Birthday, Mark Rosewater! Here's to 150 more (I'm really banking on science solving this aging thing at some point in my lifetime).


Deck of the Day
===============


1. [Brad Carpenter's Modern Abzan (Counters) Company](http://sales.starcitygames.com/deckdatabase/displaydeck.php?DeckID=113708)

As [Sam Black said in a (premium) article yesterday](http://www.starcitygames.com/article/35160_My-SCG-Baltimore-Recommendations.html), the "Counters" moniker probably won't stick as this becomes the de facto Abzan Company strategy going forward. And all thanks to a mid-level *Amonkhet* draft uncommon that doesn't even see Standard play. And it's thanks to this combination:


[![](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Vizier+of+Remedies)](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vizier+of+Remedies) [![](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Devoted+Druid)](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Devoted+Druid)
Persist combos have long been a part of Modern. First [Kitchen Finks](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kitchen+Finks)/[Murderous Redcap](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Murderous+Redcap) and [Viscera Seer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Viscera+Seer) combined with [Melira, Sylvok Outcast](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Melira%2C+Sylvok+Outcast). Then [Anafenza, Kin-Tree Spirit](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Anafenza%2C+Kin-Tree+Spirit) arrived and replaced some number of Melira. But now they've both been overshadowed by the Vizier, who does the same thing those two do in the combo while also adding another infinite mana combo alongside it.


Vizier stops -1/-1 counters from being placed on creatures (well, one per effect, which is all we need). That means counters from creatures who persist, yes, but it also means [Devoted Druid](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Devoted+Druid) doesn't get a -1/-1 counter when it untaps itself. Which means it can tap and untap to its heart's content (it's devoted—it certainly has a heart, though I'm not up to date on my elvish biology).


With as much green mana as you'd like, you can do a few things. [Collected Company](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Collected+Company) and [Chord of Calling](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chord+of+Calling) can search up [Duskwatch Recruiter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duskwatch+Recruiter), who can then find you every creature in your deck by activating its ability over and over again. Once you've drawn everything with legs, something like a [Walking Ballista](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Walking+Ballista) can kill an opponent immediately.


The key part, and this has always been the attraction of these kinds of decks, from [Birthing Pod](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Birthing+Pod) to Company, is that the deck has a reasonable backup plan of just attacking with effective, sometimes disrupting creatures. You don't *need* to combo to win. But it's nice to know you have the option.
