You might notice a change to your *Secret Lair* drop packaging coming soon. While we're continuing our efforts toward making *Magic: The Gathering* packaging plastic-free, we are also exploring other ways to make packaging more sustainable. Finding appropriate opportunities to reduce package size—or right-sizing the package—is one way we're doing this.


How It Works and What It Will Look Like
=======================================


Smaller packaging often uses less material and is lighter in weight, thereby creating less waste and making distribution more sustainable. Our new *Secret Lair* drop envelopes were designed to do just that!


Here is a look at the new packaging that you can expect with most drops within a superdrop starting with the April 2022 Superdrop:

You can still expect to see the slim black box packaging for all 2022 Astrology Lands drops, most cobranded *Secret Lair* drops (e.g., *Secret Lair x Street Fighter*), and most philanthropic drops (e.g., *Extra Life 2021*).


What is "*Secret* *Lair*"?
==========================


*Magic: The Gathering* *Secret* *Lair* products are intended to be fun ways for players to customize their decks and express themselves. From basic lands designed by renowned guest artists to dynamic renditions of iconic planeswalkers, *Secret* *Lair* has something for everyone!


Sustainability
