September is going to have its Mondays made just a little better. And by a little, I mean a lot. The folks over at **Magic Online** are running *Modern Masters* drafts every Monday of the month!

Every two hours of the day, a 64-player *Modern Masters* Top 8 Premier Phantom Draft will fire. The event is a 6-round single-elimination event; anyone who goes 3-0 to start the event will get to draft again! If the event fails to fill 64 seats, refunds will be fulfilled within two business days.)

Entry to the event is either 15 Event Tickets OR 6 Event Tickets and 15 Phantom Points.

With every new set release we bring back the **Magic Online** Cube as a palate cleanser between draft formats. We pair it with another draft format for prizes such as last time when we paired it with the awesome *Rise of the Eldrazi* draft format.

Starting today, we're opening the choice of the format to pair with the **Magic Online** Cube to you all, so cast your vote below. The poll will run through the Community Cup and close at midnight Sunday night, September 1, 2013, 9 p.m. Pacific.


 **Choose your draft format!**
