With the *Shadows over Innistrad* previews coming in by the day, discussion of the new cards and mechanics are making the rounds at Grand Prix Washington D.C, not to mention speculation of what *exactly* has become of Avacyn. So we asked some players around the room, what are you most excited for from *Shadows over Innistrad?*

“I'm more into the storyline of this set. The last story really made things interesting, and the next few weeks we're going to have some sweet stories finding out what's going on with Avacyn and Innistrad.”

“Lightning Axe. Madness is sweet, and Axe kills everything.”

“Declaration in Stone, the new [Maelstrom Pulse](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Maelstrom+Pulse) for creatures. They get to investigate for every creature, but I think it's still very good.”

“I like Relentless Dead. I think it's going to be a really powerful card.”


**Oliver Tiu**

“I'm looking forward to the flip cards coming back. I really liked playing with them, and I liked what they did to the draft, which was to make it much more interesting.”

“Really, I'm looking forward to [Siege Rhino](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Siege+Rhino) and [Rally the Ancestors](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rally+the+Ancestors) rotating out. I like new formats and thinning the ice in Standard, so it will be fun.”
