 The *Modern Masters* set is a 229-card expansion that contains reprints of Modern-legal cards from *Eighth Edition* through *Alara Reborn*. The set will not be Standard legal and will be produced in very conservative quantitiesâ€”this is a bit of an experiment for us, and we want to get it right; we will not be increasing the quantity of any card in circulation by more than a fraction of what is already out there.
