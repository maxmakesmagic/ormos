A Champion is Born!
===================




July 2-3, 2011












2011 China National Championship
--------------------------------


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration//mtg/images/daily/events/chnat11/champion.jpg)A Champion of strength is born! Zhuang literally means strength in Mandarin and Chen Zhuang has certainly lived up to his name. After fifteen matches held over an intense weekend, he managed to emerge victorious as the China Nationals 2011 Champion.


His Blue Black control deck (along with his superior navigational skills) did not disappoint and he managed to pilot this deck all the way to the finals before beating Xu Bin for eternal honor and glory. Wang Xuan Ji also made the National Team by defeating Lü Jiachong (incidentally also last year's alternate) in the playoffs. We look forward to seeing this excellent team do wonders at the World Championships at the end of the season.
