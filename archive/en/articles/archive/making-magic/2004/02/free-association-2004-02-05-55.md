If you're up for an offbeat, cool little game, may I suggest Set. Set is a pattern recognition game that is [different](/en/articles/archive/making-magic/free-association-2004-02-05-14) than any other game I've ever seen. The game is quick, small and cheap. If you ever get a chance I suggest giving it a try.
