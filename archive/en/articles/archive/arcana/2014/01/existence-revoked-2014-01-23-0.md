There are thousands of **Magic** cards, which means sometimes, rather than creating a new card, R&D simply pulls one that already exists. Today, we're taking a look at a reprint from *Scars of Mirrodin*.

Now, there is an obvious parallel to this card—[Disenchant](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Disenchant)—with the difference being that by switching from instant to sorcery, players gain the ability to exile the target rather than just destroy it. In sets where there are indestructible Gods running around, this becomes much more important...

That art is slightly more... epic than the first. I think we can all agree to that. Here is what the new art description was:


> Location: An open plain on Theros   
>  Action: Show a Nyx infused Colossus that has been hit with a thunderbolt of golden energy from the sky. The thunderclouds overhead have parted for this shaft of golden lightning to strike the Colossus, shattering it.   
>  Focus: The bolt of lightning magic.   
>  Mood: Even the mightiest can fall.
