*Of the recent rules changes, which one were you happiest to see?*

![Lee Sharpe](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/mtgcom/authorpics/authorpic_leesharpe.jpg)**Lee Sharpe:** My favorite recent change to the rules was, well, reorganizing the rules! **Magic** Rules Manager Mark Gottlieb went through and reordered the rules to make a lot more sense and made it way easier to find topics you were looking for. The Glossary is now similar to a Glossary in any other document, short definitions of terms. All the rules that appeared only in the glossary now exist in numbered sections. A lot of things that occur in the game that really deserved their own section of rules finally received it, which makes it a lot easier to find the relevant portion of the rulebook when needed.

In terms of functional changes, I like how deathtouch and lifelink cause damage to function differently, like what was done with wither. I think this makes a lot more sense to players as wither was extremely well-received. Plus, it's always amusing to add more state-based effects, or, rather, state-based actions to the rules! There's also a change I've been hoping for awhile got in, which was that instead of "other" layer, we split it up into the only two things it covered, color and abilities, which got their own layers in that order. This also cleans up weird things like casting [Snakeform](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snakeform) on a creature enchanted with [Runes of the Deus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Runes+of+the+Deus).

Most importantly, I like how while it like so many rules have changed (and no doubt more will in the future), by and large, **Magic** still feels and plays like the awesome game it has always been.
