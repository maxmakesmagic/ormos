![Twiddle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Twiddle)It's no secret that every time a new Extended format rolls around, everyone looks to the Japanese to come up with something spectacular. Somehow they always come up with crazy decks, and not only are they crazy, they're actually highly competitive against the metagame.As someone who was fairly involved with the testing and preparation for this Pro Tour, I didn't think they could do it again. So many people were working on the format; so many ideas were brought up and dismissed. How could they possibly come up with yet another deck that the rest of the world had missed?

Well, they did it again. And it's a thing of beauty.

Remember a little card from *Alpha*, the first set in **Magic: the Gathering**'s long history, called [Twiddle](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Twiddle)? It's a humble, simple card. In those days one blue mana could draw you three cards, but [Twiddle](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Twiddle) simply tapped or untapped a permanent of your choice. No less, no more.

Even in the early days, no one actually thought about playing [Twiddle](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Twiddle) in tournaments. It was cute, but it didn't really do anything.

Those times are no longer. It's now ten years later, and Twiddle is part of the engine of one of the most astonishing decks here, along with its friends Dream's Grip and Burst of Energy. Burst of what, you say? You're not alone, as I haven't seen a single opponent all day that hasn't paused to read the card.

![](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Ancient+Tomb)

















![Gilded Lotus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Gilded+Lotus)Yes, you read that right. A mere fourteen lands, without any cantrips or ways to find more except [Brainstorm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brainstorm). It even has only two copies of the win condition in a deck that plays four copies of [Diminishing Returns](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Diminishing+Returns). It seems crazy, but who can question it, because it's winning. Both Osamu Fujita and Tsutomo Yamada are running the deck, which was designed by Tsuyoshi Fujita, on day two.How does it work? Essentially it wants to get a [Gilded Lotus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gilded+Lotus) into play by whatever means possible, and then start tapping and untapping it to produce two mana each time. Efficient card drawing like [Diminishing Returns](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Diminishing+Returns), [Meditate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Meditate), and [Trade Secrets](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Trade+Secrets) allows the deck to run cards like [Twiddle](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Twiddle) because it can refill its hand so easily. All of these spells allow the player to draw more cards than the mana spent, and the drawbacks are minimal in a deck that intends to win the turn it casts them.

Between the number of cheap spells and the scarcity of lands, [Mind's Desire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mind%27s+Desire) is a perfect fit for the deck. It can either be used to find the game-winning [Tendrils of Agony](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tendrils+of+Agony) or simply to add a bunch more spells to the Storm count by playing them all for free. It's not uncommon for this deck to cast ten to fifteen spells on turn two, especially if it manages to [Tinker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tinker) for a Lotus.

![Mind's Desire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Mind%27s+Desire)And yes, the deck can even win on turn one. [City of Traitors](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=City+of+Traitors), [Chrome Mox](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chrome+Mox) (imprinting a blue card), [Tinker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tinker) away the [Chrome Mox](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chrome+Mox) for [Gilded Lotus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gilded+Lotus). Tap the [Gilded Lotus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gilded+Lotus), untap it with a [Twiddle](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Twiddle) effect, tap it again, cast [Diminishing Returns](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Diminishing+Returns) to refill. Continue milking the [Gilded Lotus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gilded+Lotus) with untap effects and refilling with cheap card drawing until you can play a [Tendrils of Agony](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tendrils+of+Agony) with nine or more previous spells cast that turn.After Tsuyoshi saw the cardlist for *Mirrodin*, he began work on a [Mind's Desire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mind%27s+Desire) deck for Standard which included both [Twiddle](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Twiddle) and [Dream's Grip](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dream%27s+Grip). The evolution of the deck into its current Extended version was only natural. He's a little disappointed in how the deck is performing today, but promises an even more exciting deck for next time. I, for one, believe he can deliver.

But as for Twiddle Desire: will we see this deck in the qualifying seasons of the near future? It's very possible. It certainly thrives in a format where most countermagic is too slow and the games are fairly non-interactive. And better yet, it looks like a whole lot of fun to play.
