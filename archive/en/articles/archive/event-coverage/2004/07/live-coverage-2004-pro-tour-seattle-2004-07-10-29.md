![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/ptsea04/sai.jpg)While not as well-known as the other Japanese team in the Top 4, S.A.I. may be as deadly. As the only team to remain undefeated Friday night, S.A.I. continued to pummel opponents on Saturday to nab the third top slot. Consisting of Ichirou Shimura, Masami Ibamoto, and Ryuuichi Arita, S.A.I. has effectively doubled Japan's chances of claiming victory in the Emerald City.

### Pocket Rockets

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/ptsea04/pocketrockets.jpg)Ontario based Pocket Rockets came out of absolutely nowhere to snatch the coveted 4th top slot from a slew of Magic celebrity players all desperate for that extra point. Canadian rookies Paul Russell, Matthew Wood and Joe Derro out-muscled the competition despite playing their first Pro Tour ever, and are no doubt excited about their impressive debut.

**Team Name:** Pocket Rockets  
**Members:** Matthew Wood, Paul Russel, and Joe Derro  
**What is the story behind your Team Name?** Matthew Wood - "We tried several team names, but we were playing a lot of poker recently and settled on this one." Joe Derro - " We've got a weekly game of Texas Hold'em at my house, and the name seemed fitting."

**Name:** Paul Russell  
**Age:** 25  
**Hometown:** Waterloo, Ontario Canada  
**Occupation:** Child Youth Worker  
**Number of times playing on the Pro Tour:** Zero  
**How did you qualify for PT Seattle?** PTQ in Toronto  
**Number of GP, PT Top 8s?** Zero  
**Previous Magic accomplishments:** Day 3 GP Columbus, Day 2 GP Boston, 23rd at GP DC  
**What do you think of your chances on Sunday?** About 50/50. I hope we win at least one Rochester.

**Name:** Matthew Wood  
**Age:** 25  
**Hometown:** Waterloo, Ontario  
**Occupation:** Advertising Manager  
**Number of times playing on the Pro Tour:** Zero  
**How did you qualify for PT Seattle?** PTQ win, though we were close on rating  
**Number of GP, PT Top 8s?** None.  
**Previous Magic accomplishments:** 23rd GP Washington  
**What do you think of your chances on Sunday?** I think our chances are very good, but I'm still feeling high from the top 4.  
**Do you have any interesting stories from Friday and Saturday?** I had to rip [Goblin Charbelcher](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Charbelcher) and then hit my opponent for five in order to win game 2 in Round 11.  
**Anything else you want to add?** Seattle is a beautiful city and I'm having a blast. I think Canada is underrated in the Magic community, considering we have only 30 million people. I've learned a lot from playing Canadian Pros like Rich Hoaen, Gab Tsang, Mark Zadjner, etc

**Name:** Joe Derro  
**Age:** 22  
**Hometown:** Kitchener, Ontario  
**Occupation:** Retail

**Number of GP, PT Top 8s?** Zero  
**Previous Magic accomplishments:** 6-0 draft at Canadian Nationals, made a few bucks at GP: Detroit  
**What do you think of your chances on Sunday?** We haven't lost a team rochester draft yet, so who knows? I think it's safe to say we're not exactly the favorites.  
**Do you have any interesting stories from Friday and Saturday?** I'd say the fact that we T4'd is pretty interesting.  
**Anything else you want to add?**  
 What's good in Extended?
