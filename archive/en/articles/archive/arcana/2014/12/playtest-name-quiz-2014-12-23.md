*DailyMTG is catching you up on some of the best articles from the past year while our whole crew enjoys the holidays. We’re replaying some of our authors' most popular works and some of your favorites December 15–26, but don’t be surprised if we have a special present or two for you somewhere during the holidays…*



*But in the meantime, enjoy the best of 2014. Happy Holidays!*


Now that *Commander* (2014 Edition) is out and covering tabletops everywhere, it's time for Arcana to take a peek under the hood. Let's explore the mysterious world that is Multiverse to let you all in on a bit of inside info.


One of the most fun parts of the *Commander* products is when old cards get to resurface and shine again. Old-school players, like myself, love seeing old favorites; while newer players get to know many of these cards for the first time.


But just how well do you know some of these reprints, now that you've had time to play with them? Well enough that you can guess the actual card from the playtest name?


Here's how the game works. We give you a card's playtest name, like so:


"Cycling Swamp"


And you click on the name to reveal the actual answer, which in this case is, of course:

They won't all be that easy, though. So pull up a chair, fan out your Commander decks, and quiz on.
