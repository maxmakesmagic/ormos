*Dragons of Tarkir* Standard is a format with a tremendous variety of powerful cards, many of which form the respective backbones of the defining archetypes of the format—from [Dragonlord Ojutai](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragonlord+Ojutai) in Esper Dragons to [Atarka's Command](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Atarka%27s+Command) in its namesake red deck. We asked four of the top pros in attendance in Providence which of the many heavy hitters was their hands-down favorite card in the format.

*Paulo Vitor Damo Da Rosa: [Dragonlord Ojutai](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragonlord+Ojutai)*



For No. 17 Paulo Vitor Damo Da Rosa that card is [Dragonlord Ojutai](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragonlord+Ojutai). He has been nigh unbeatable with Esper decks ever since Pro Tour *Dragons of Tarkir*, and the 5-mana Dragon “is extremely powerful, and added a dimension to the Esper deck without which I wouldn't really have been able to play it.”

*Craig Wescoe: [Fleecemane Lion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fleecemane+Lion)*



To nobody's surprise No. 20 Craig Wescoe pointed to an aggressively costed white (and green) creature. [Fleecemane Lion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fleecemane+Lion) is exceptional for its versatility, he said. “It's a quick attacker against slow decks, and a very good blocker against fast decks, all while providing a good late game thanks to its ability to go monstrous.”

*Ari Lax: [Thoughtseize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtseize)*



Pro Tour *Khans of Tarkir C*hampion Ari Lax was quick to name [Thoughtseize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtseize). “It's as if you're cheating,” he said. “You just get to know everything.”

*Brian Braun-Duin: [Fleecemane Lion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fleecemane+Lion)*



Like Wescoe, Brian Braun-Duin was singing the praises of [Fleecemane Lion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fleecemane+Lion). The Grand Prix New Jersey champ was off to a 6-0 start here in Providence, and the 3/3 Cat was a big part of the reason why, thanks to its ability to play both offense and defense, he said.
