[![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/tcg/resources/VansLogo_Small.jpg)](http://vanswarpedtour.com/)The [Vans Warped Tour 2012](http://vanswarpedtour.com/) features over 90 bands performing at 43 stops across North America. And this year, [**Magic: The Gathering** is a sponsor](http://vanswarpedtour.com/sponsor/magic-the-gathering)!

This means two things that may interest you. First, we have tickets to give away. From May 28 to June 22 our official Twitter Account ([@wizards\_magic](https://twitter.com/#!/wizards_magic)) will be tweeting out trivia questions twice a day. The first person to respond with the correct answer AND the proper hashtag gets a pair of tickets for that city! For the list of when we’re tweeting, what show stop you’ll be competing for, and the proper hashtag for that show stop, go to [www.wizards.com/warpedtickets](http://www.wizards.com/warpedtickets).

Second, when you're *at* the Warped Tour, look for the **Magic** truck. It'll look something like this:

Then tweet a picture of yourself with it for a chance to win [**Duels of the Planeswalkers 2013**](/en/articles/archive/duels-planeswalkers-2013-2-2012-04-05) game codes, **Magic: The Gathering** product, and even a brand new laptop!
