**Daily Events**
Click on each title for event details. Premier Events are displayed in **bold**, and Events in red are available if [this week's downtime](http://community.wizards.com/magiconline/blog) allows. Though we will always try to notify players of any significant changes to the events schedule, **Magic Online** reserves the right to adjust the events schedule without advance notice.
