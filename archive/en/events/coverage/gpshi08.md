Grand Prix Shizuoka 2008
------------------------


Faeries Fly High in Shizuoka!
=============================




March 8-9, 2008












[日本語の取材へ](/en/articles/archive/event-coverage/japanese-coverage-grand-prix-shizuoka-2008-2008-03-06)


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gpshi08/KJ.jpg) Under the shadow of Mount Fuji, over 800 players came from all around Japan to compete in the only Standard Grand Prix prior to Pro Tour-Hollywood. Only one pro traveled from further afield, and that pro, Olivier Ruel rode his Faerie deck all the way to the finals. In a field packed with good players causing trouble with [Reveillark](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reveillark) decks, faeries were a good metagame call that dealt with the deck handily. While Olivier has now dethroned Alex Shvartsman as the player with the most GP Top 8s ever, he did not prevail here in Shizuoka.


It was Yuuta Takahashi, one of the finalists of Pro Tour-San Diego who prevailed in a tense final. Takahashi, who also piloted faeries, had a hard-fought victory, as he defeated Kenji Tsumura in the semifinals to make it to the finals.


For more of Standard, our eyes now turn to Pro Tour-Hollywood. For Japanese Grand Prixs we have to wait a little longer, but when the Grand Prix return to Japan on the weekend of August 2nd they will be do so in expanded form. Announced just this weekend for Kobe, the first Japanese Summer Series Grand Prix -- with extra money and extra Pro Points -- will not be one to be missed


Congratulations again to Yuuta Takahashi, GP Shizuoka 2008 Champion!

Quarterfinals – Olivier Ruel vs Akira Asahara
---------------------------------------------


*By Tim Willoughby*
![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gpshi08/QF-Ruel.jpg)*Olivier Ruel* All weekend Olivier has been talking about how good his matchup against [Reveillark](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reveillark) is. This top eight is a great place for him if he is correct. With the possibility of a [Reveillark](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reveillark) matchup every round, his faeries seemed a sound metagame call. Against Akira Asahara's build of [Reveillark](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reveillark), which doesn't have [Wrath of God](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wrath+of+God) until after sideboarding, he felt the matchup was even better than normal.


Having won the roll, Olivier kept and started things off with [Oona's Blackguard](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oona%27s+Blackguard), one of the cards he says he would remove from the deck if he were making adjustments. Asahara had a [Mind Stone](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mind+Stone) to accelerate with, and a [Venser, Shaper Savant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Venser%2C+Shaper+Savant) ready to hold off [Scion of Oona](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scion+of+Oona). Venser even got stuck in for two before Akira passed his turn.


A [Rune Snag](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rune+Snag) from Asahara stopped [Pestermite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pestermite), and it was up to [Oona's Blackguard](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oona%27s+Blackguard) to nip in alone, for only small amounts of damage. The second time that [Scion of Oona](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scion+of+Oona) came down it was hit by a second [Rune Snag](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rune+Snag), leaving Olivier with only the slowest of clocks, losing in a race to a lone Venser.


Asahara tried for a [Sower of Temptation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sower+of+Temptation), only to have it stopped by [Cryptic Command](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cryptic+Command). On Oli's turn, the Blackguard got stuck in, and [Notorious Throng](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Notorious+Throng) meant another faerie, and another turn with which to beat.


A second Sower was tried by Asahara, but with [Faerie Conclave](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Faerie+Conclave)'s help [Spellstutter Sprite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spellstutter+Sprite) stopped it. Subsequent attacks were enough to get Asahara to scoop up his cards.


Olivier Ruel 1 – 0 Akira Asahara


For Game 2, Asahara kept a land heavy hand, which was somewhat speculative. He topdecked a [Careful Consideration](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Careful+Consideration), which found him more. Unfortunately for Arita, while this was happening, Olivier had a turn two [Bitterblossom](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bitterblossom), which was followed by [Pestermite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pestermite), with which beats could be applied. [Sower of Temptation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sower+of+Temptation) stole [Pestermite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pestermite), to slow things for the Frenchman. He had a [Pendelhaven](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pendelhaven) though, which made blocking a mite toughter for Asahara, who dropped to 18 on attacks.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gpshi08/QF-asahara.jpg) *Akira Asahara*Asahara drew, played [Mind Stone](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mind+Stone) and passed. Olivier shrugged, put more faeries into play and beat with them. At the end of Ruel's turn, Asahara tried for Teferi, only for [Rune Snag](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rune+Snag) to thwart him. Asahara was in the awkward position of not being able to wait for Olivier to act so that he could respond with Teferi, as [Bitterblossom](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bitterblossom) already gave him a threat each turn.


On his own turn, Asahara played [Mulldrifter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mulldrifter), a land, and passed. Oli had a [Pestermite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pestermite) at the end of turn, and ran in with is team on attack. Asahara traded [Pestermite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pestermite)s using the [Pestermite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pestermite) that [Sower of Temptation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sower+of+Temptation) had stolen, but took three. There were then sad looks from Ruel as his [Notorious Throng](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Notorious+Throng) was countered.


"Please no Crovax" begged Oli, still despondent at his failed [Notorious Throng](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Notorious+Throng).


There was not one, only a [Riftwing Cloudskate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Riftwing+Cloudskate) who bounced a token. Asahara beat in, in what had become an old fashioned race. Akira tried for a [Reveillark](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reveillark), which was hit by [Spellstutter Sprite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spellstutter+Sprite). His [Rune Snag](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rune+Snag) got [Rune Snag](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rune+Snag)ged, and Olivier clapped his hands as he looked at his attacks, with what was now 6 faeries. Akira drew his card, played a land and said go.


Attacks from Ruel took Asahara to 5, while Ruel, who had been taking damage from [Bitterblossom](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bitterblossom) all game, was on 4. He'd not been attacking with too many faeries, just to make sure that he had enough blockers just in case.


This all changed on the final turn though where he attacked with just enough to elicit the scoop from Akira.


Olivier Ruel wins 2-0



Semifinals – Olivier Ruel vs. Ryousuke Masuno
---------------------------------------------


*By Tim Willoughby*
Olivier Ruel was really hoping that Kazuya Mitamura would win his match. The elf matchup for the French Level 8 pro is a much harder one than [Reveillark](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reveillark). The match itself didn't kick off until a little later than expected, as Olivier was nowhere to be found. When he eventually showed up, he had food.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gpshi08/sf_Ruel.jpg)*Yum!*


"Is there enough for everyone?"


Yes, as it turns out there was. Olivier shared his dinner with both his opponent and a jubilant Mitamura.


Olivier was less jubilant with the way that the game started. A quick [Llanowar Elves](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Llanowar+Elves) enabled turn-two [Imperious Perfect](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Imperious+Perfect). The second [Imperious Perfect](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Imperious+Perfect) got countered, but Masuno still had quite a clock. Oli had a [Pestermite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pestermite) to stop [Mutavault](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mutavault) attacking him for 3, but still went to 14 on attacks.


Masuno was short on coloured mana, with all of it coming from a [Llanowar Wastes](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Llanowar+Wastes), but he was hardly complaining. He got to beat Oli down to 9 with his creatures while the Frenchman had no black mana and, it appeared, little response to the assault.


Oli cracked back with his team, taking Masuno to 12. This became 11 when [Llanowar Wastes](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Llanowar+Wastes) was used by [Imperious Perfect](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Imperious+Perfect) to make another Elf Warrior. In Masuno's upkeep, [Mistbind Clique](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mistbind+Clique) came out both to tie up the Japanese player's mana and to serve as a warm body to attack and block with. Following blocks, a [Nameless Inversion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nameless+Inversion) off a fresh [Swamp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swamp) and [Llanowar Elves](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Llanowar+Elves) took down the big faerie, but there was still some racing potential. After attacks from Oli the life totals were 7 each, and Ruel had both [Oona's Blackguard](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oona%27s+Blackguard), and another [Mistbind Clique](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mistbind+Clique) with which to put the hurt on Masuno. Suddenly Ryousuke was reluctant to attack. Olivier beckoned him to try it, and in the end two elf tokens ran in.


Olivier wasn't scared, blocking one with the [Mistbind Clique](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mistbind+Clique). There were no tricks from Masuno, and on the swings back it was on to game 2.


Olivier Ruel 1 – 0 Ryousuke Masuno


For Game 2, Olivier had a good idea that he would be facing both a pair of [Cloudthresher](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloudthresher)s and a pair of [Squall Line](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Squall+Line)s. Tough times ahead.


Masuno stated out with a turn one [Llanowar Elves](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Llanowar+Elves), and got hit by [Thoughtseize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtseize) before he could play his [Imperious Perfect](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Imperious+Perfect) on turn two. The Perfect hit the bin, though Wrens Run Vanquisher and [Bramblewood Paragon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bramblewood+Paragon) stayed in his hand. The following turn he played the Vanquisher, and saw his [Llanowar Elves](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Llanowar+Elves) die soon after to [Peppersmoke](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Peppersmoke). The Vanquisher then got hit by [Unsummon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Unsummon), forcing Masuno to waste a turn replaying it.


[Bramblewood Paragon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bramblewood+Paragon) came down for Masuno, while Olivier's first creature of the game was a [Scion of Oona](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scion+of+Oona) with nothing else to help. Attacks back took Oli to nine, while he applied some largely ineffectual beats. He used [Notorious Throng](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Notorious+Throng) to produce a single 1/1 Faerie Rogue token, without gaining a turn out of it. Attacks from [Wren's Run Vanquisher](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wren%27s+Run+Vanquisher) took him to 6. Still Oli had no gas. One more turn's attack was enough to end it.


Olivier Ruel 1 – 1 Ryousuke Masuno


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gpshi08/sf_Masuno.jpg)*Masuno contemplates his next move.*  



There was another Flash Freeze on the [Civic Wayfinder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Civic+Wayfinder), which prompted a very unexcited sounding "Wow." from the Japanese player. The next [Civic Wayfinder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Civic+Wayfinder) got hit by [Spellstutter Sprite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spellstutter+Sprite). It seemed that Olivier's plan for Game 3 involved opponent's never resolving a spell. Randy Buehler thought of that one a while ago, but it seems it's still a good plan.


Olivier swung in for five, to drop his opponent to just 8. He was facing a [Treetop Village](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treetop+Village) but not much else. [Mistbind Clique](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mistbind+Clique) seemed like a good answer to that threat, and whatever lurked on top of Masuno's deck. This was enough to win it for the Frenchman.


Olivier Ruel wins 2 – 1, advancing to the finals of Grand Prix–Shizuoka.



Finals – Yuuta Takahashi vs Olivier Ruel
----------------------------------------


*By Tim Willoughby*
Olivier Ruel has already beaten Alex Shvartsman's record on GP top eights this weekend. The pro points he has received will help him in his bid to catch Jon Finkel on lifetime points. If he wins this one final match here in Shizuoka, he will be able to again take away a claim to fame of Shvartsman's. Alex is the only non-Japanese Pro to ever win an individual GP in Japan.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gpshi08/final-ruel.jpg) Unfortunately for Ruel, his opponent, Yuuta Takahashi, who beat Kenji Tsumura in the semi-finals, has already beaten Olivier once in the tournament. Also playing faeries, in the Frenchman's opinion Yuuta's build is better, especially in the mirror match.


While Takahashi won the die roll, he did have to mulligan his opener. Both players had a [Bitterblossom](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bitterblossom) to begin their offensives, and Takahashi had a suspended [Ancestral Vision](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ancestral+Vision)s to follow – a play that Olivier could not match. For Ruel there was a [Pendelhaven](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pendelhaven), which effectively made his faeries better able to win fights. When every creature in the match can fly, you don't exactly have a ground stall, but functionally it that is kind of how it works.


Olivier was the first to attack, with extra confidence thanks to his legendary land. He did not play a spell though, passing the turn wary of countermagic. On either side of the board life totals were dropping, but it was only Olivier attacking, so he looked to have the best of it.


Two faeries came in from the French side of the table, and when each was blocked, Ruel used [Pendelhaven](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pendelhaven) to gain the advantage in one fight. There were no tricks from Takahashi's side of the board, and Oli played a second [Bitterblossom](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bitterblossom). Without lifegain available on either side of this matchup, it *would* end fast.


Yuuta had a [Sower of Temptation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sower+of+Temptation) to allow for some attacks at Ruel's expense, but Olivier's board was soon refilled by the pair of [Bitterblossom](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bitterblossom)s he controlled. Takahashi had a big turn coming though. [Ancestral Vision](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ancestral+Vision)s gave him a lot more options, and he attacked with all the faeries he could given that Ruel was shocking himself each turn to get more creatures.


Olivier blocked two faerie tokens with two of his own, then played a [Pestermite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pestermite) to untap his [Pendelhaven](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pendelhaven), so that the fight was again not quite fair.


For the first time in the match, Olivier declared his attack step – fishing for a [Cryptic Command](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cryptic+Command) from his opponent. He didn't find one, and got to swing with [Pestermite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pestermite) and two tokens. The [Pestermite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pestermite) traded, while Olivier hit his opponent down to 12. On just 8 himself, things looked tough for the Frenchman. At the end of Oli's turn, Yuuta used a [Cryptic Command](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cryptic+Command) to bounce [Pendelhaven](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pendelhaven) and draw a card. This allowed [Sower of Temptation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sower+of+Temptation) to attack, and Yuuta tried to frustrate a double block with a [Nameless Inversion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nameless+Inversion). An [Unsummon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Unsummon) on Sower was Olivier's response, and the Sower was then dealt with for good by a pair of [Rune Snag](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rune+Snag)s. Olivier was on 6, and his opponent tapped out. Now was the time to strike if ever. A [Notorious Throng](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Notorious+Throng) would be sufficient to do it, but unfortunately for Olivier he didn't have his big sorcery. He knocked Yuuta down to 5 with his attacks. This soon became 4 thanks to [Bitterblossom](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bitterblossom), and at the end of Yuuta's turn Olivier brought out [Pestermite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pestermite) to tap one of his opponent's faeries. [Cryptic Command](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cryptic+Command) tapped Olivier's creatures, but it couldn't stop [Mutavault](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mutavault) taking Takahashi to 2. On just one life after his upkeep, he drew and smiled.


Yuuta attacked with 2 faeries, needing to do 2 damage so that Bitterblooms could finish Olivier off. Olivier activated [Faerie Conclave](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Faerie+Conclave) to make a blocker, but a [Scion of Oona](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scion+of+Oona) meant that the damage would sneak through regardless, and the Frenchman scooped up his cards for game 2.


Olivier Ruel 0 – 1 Yuuta Takahashi


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gpshi08/final-takahashi.jpg) There was no [Bitterblossom](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bitterblossom) for Olivier for game 2, but there was the start of a pair of [Ancestral Vision](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ancestral+Vision)s from Takahashi. In upkeep a [Pestermite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pestermite) tapped down one of Takahashi's lands, but this did not stop a [Bitterblossom](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bitterblossom) from the Japanese player who appeared to have all the right cards for this final.


Olivier had a second [Pestermite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pestermite) at end of turn, knowing that there was a [Mistbind Clique](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mistbind+Clique) in his opponent's hand thanks to having seen it on a [Secluded Glen](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Secluded+Glen) reveal. The [Pestermite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pestermite) was countered by [Spellstutter Sprite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spellstutter+Sprite), and Ruel shrugged, not happy about how things were going. He had a [Spellstutter Sprite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spellstutter+Sprite) of his own to stop [Ancestral Vision](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ancestral+Vision)s #1, but was quite far behind on the board. In upkeep, [Mistbind Clique](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mistbind+Clique) tried its luck, only to be stopped by [Rune Snag](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rune+Snag) from Olivier. Another [Spellstutter Sprite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spellstutter+Sprite) stopped the second [Ancestral Vision](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ancestral+Vision)s, and the life totals were even at 15 each. How long could Ruel hold out against the ongoing threat of [Bitterblossom](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bitterblossom) for though? That amount of time was reduced as [Sower of Temptation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sower+of+Temptation) built Yuuta's board yet further. It seemed Olivier's predictions of a bad matchup were accurate.


Ruel played [Mistbind Clique](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mistbind+Clique), but took quite a beating as Yuuta floated mana and cast [Scion of Oona](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scion+of+Oona). On just 7, to Takahashi's 14, he was close to out of the game. When he attacked with [Mistbind Clique](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mistbind+Clique), he was one mana off being able to prowl out [Notorious Throng](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Notorious+Throng). He did cast it regular style though, and got 4 tokens for his trouble. These could no longer trade with their counterparts on the other side of the board, but served as adequate blockers nonetheless. Olivier went to one in the combat, and hopefully drew for his turn.


He didn't find what he needed though, and extended his hand.


Congratulations to Yuuta Takahashi, Grand Prix Shizuoka Champion!
