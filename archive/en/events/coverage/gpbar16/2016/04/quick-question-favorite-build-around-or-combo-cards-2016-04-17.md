The debate over just how synergy driven *Shadows over Innistrad* Limited really is had only just begun. But already it was clear that there were a lot of combos, both large and small, hidden in the set. We asked some of the pro players in attendance this weekend for their favorite synergy and/or build-around cards.

**No. 8 Sam Black:** [Intrepid Provisioner](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Intrepid+Provisioner) and [Call the Bloodline](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Call+the+Bloodline). To me, [Intrepid Provisioner](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Intrepid+Provisioner) is one of the more important cards in the aggressive green-white Human deck which I quite like. And [Call the Bloodline](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Call+the+Bloodline) just combos with everything, madness obviously but also [Indulgent Aristocrat](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Indulgent+Aristocrat), [Sanitarium Skeleton](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sanitarium+Skeleton) â€¦

**Pro Tour *Oath of the Gatewatch* semifinalist Patrick Dickmann:** I haven't drafted enough yet, but I already learned I like combining [Thing in the Ice](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thing+in+the+Ice) with instants and sorceries. I had two in my first draft deck, played them on turn two and turn three, then cast [Nagging Thoughts](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nagging+Thoughts), [Macabre Waltz](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Macabre+Waltz), [Grotesque Mutation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grotesque+Mutation), and [Just the Wind](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Just+the+Wind), to flip both by turn six. Even though Waltz and Wind didn't really do anything in this sequence, it was totally worth it and totally awesome.

**Pro Tour *Oath of the Gatewatch* quarterfinalist Pascal Maynard:** [Rise from the Tides](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rise+from+the+Tides). When you have it, it's fairly easy to build the all-spell deck because it uses so many cards that no one else at the table wants. And it's very powerful when you have at least two [Rise from the Tides](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rise+from+the+Tides) or [Pieces of the Puzzle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pieces+of+the+Puzzle) to find them. But it is risky because if you don't find a second [Rise from the Tides](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rise+from+the+Tides) or [Pieces of the Puzzle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pieces+of+the+Puzzle), then you'll end up with a really bad deck.

**Hall of Famer Luis Scott-Vargas:** [Ongoing Investigation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ongoing+Investigation). It gives you all these options, and I love gaining a bunch of life and drawing a lot of cards.


![](https://media.wizards.com/2016/events/gpbar16/qq_shenhar.jpg)  
**Two-time World Champion Shahar Shenhar:** [Stensia Masquerade](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stensia+Masquerade) and [Howlpack Resurgence](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Howlpack+Resurgence). You'll be rewarded highly if you get the right creature types for them. These enchantments are very good if 80% of your creatures are Vampires or Wolves.

**Gold-level pro (missing four points to lock Platinum) Oliver Polak-Rottmann:** [Fork in the Road](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fork+in+the+Road) plus [Stoic Builder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stoic+Builder) is a sweet little combo. Doesn't generate insane value, but the cards are easy to get late without much investment.
