### You, **Magic**, and **Magic Online**


**How did you learn to play Magic, or who taught you?**  

I started playing **Magic** in 1995, when I was five years old. My mother brought home two starter decks—*Fourth Edition* for me and *Ice Age* for my brother, Ian. We basically taught ourselves to play, but it was a little rocky at first. By our rules, [Zephyr Falcon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Zephyr+Falcon) was pretty overpowered, because Ian would attack me with it twenty times in the same turn! There was also endless confusion from the expression "First Strike Counts as a Wall" on the *Fourth Edition* [Wall of Spears](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wall+of+Spears).


I remember the release of *Alliances*, and I guess that was when we really started to get the rules down and found some other people to play the game with.


**How long have you played Magic Online?**  

I started playing my freshman year of college, in 2007 or 2008.


**How often do you draft on Magic Online?**  

Three or four times a day when I'm preparing for a tournament. One or two times a week when I'm not.


**How often do you play Constructed on Magic Online?**  

It's my main way to prepare for tournaments. Six hours or more, three or four times a week (unless my next tournament is Limited).
