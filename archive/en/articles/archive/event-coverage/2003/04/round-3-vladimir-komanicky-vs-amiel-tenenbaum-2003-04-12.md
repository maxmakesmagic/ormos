![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gppra03/a965.jpg)Vladimir chose to play first and mulliganed as his first hand didn't contain any land. While Carlos Romao takes place to support his Bandana friend, Amiel shows me a good opening hand including [Sparksmith](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sparksmith), [Canopy Crawler](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Canopy+Crawler) and [Erratic Explosion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Erratic+Explosion).

Komanicky starts with Primoc on turn three followed by a morph creature on turn four. But Amiel's first turns are far more annoying for Vlad as the Frenchman draws his second goblin and plays a 4/4 [Canopy Crawler](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Canopy+Crawler). Komanicky tries to react by playing [Charging Slateback](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Charging+Slateback), another 3 toughness creature, but after a few swings it quickly appears that he can't win the race.

Komanicky 0-1 Tenenbaum

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gppra03/a964.jpg)Game 2, despite being as short as the first one, is a lot more interesting. Komanicky doesn't draw a fourth land before turn 7 but his turn three Primoc hurts Amiel a lot more than in the first game. His life goes down very fast, 18, 16, [Erratic Explosion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Erratic+Explosion) for four on [Spitting Gourna](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spitting+Gourna). Rogon arrives on the table as a 5/5, and despite the Sliver Tenenbaum manages to deal Komanicky a few damage, but the clock is still on.

14,12,10,8,6, Amiel doesn't have much time left to recover. Rogon and [Wirewood Channeler](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wirewood+Channeler) can't get past the Sliver and morph defense, and as Vlad got a [Skirk Marauder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skirk+Marauder) back from [Aphetto Dredging](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aphetto+Dredging), Tenenbaum only has two turns to win. He played [Silvos](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Silvos) and announced his end of turn.

Komanicky enchants his flyer with [Crown of Fury](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crown+of+Fury), attacks (14-3) and adds another blocker. The game seems to be over then, but Amiel has [Wave of Indifference](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wave+of+Indifference) in hand and manages to avoid a third game by attacking with [Silvos](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Silvos), Channeler and Rogon for the win.

**Final Result:** Komanicky 0-2 Tenenbaum
