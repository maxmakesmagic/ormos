It's been a while since James Zhang had big tournament win in Australia, but considering they were both Grand Prix wins in 2005 and 2006, that's nothing to sneeze at. His opponent, Cameron Maitland, was on the Australian National Team in 2011, and he has drafted a fast mono-white tokens deck that James's slower Green/Black build would have to compete against.



**Game 1**




 Both players mulliganed to six, then agreed to keep. Zhang went on the offensive, first with a [Runeclaw Bear](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Runeclaw+Bear) and then with a [Juggernaut](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Juggernaut). Cameron played excellent defence, using a [Midnight Guard](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Midnight+Guard) to convoke a Warforge Golem, untapping the Guard. Zhang played out a [Shaman of Spring](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shaman+of+Spring), while Cameron resolved a [Sacred Armory](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sacred+Armory), thereby making every token he can muster a threat. Cameron decided to race the [Juggernaut](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Juggernaut) with his Warforge Golem, leaving the [Midnight Guard](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Midnight+Guard) back to block. Zhang looked to push more [Juggernaut](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Juggernaut) damage through and resolved to two-for-one himself to do so. He used [Hunt the Weak](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hunt+the+Weak) on his [Shaman of Spring](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shaman+of+Spring) against the [Midnight Guard](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Midnight+Guard), which Cameron then pumped using the [Sacred Armory](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sacred+Armory). The trade was made, the way cleared, and Zhang pushed more damage through. Cameron tried to re-stabalise, but a [Necrogen Scudder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Necrogen+Scudder) from Zhang was enough for lethal in the air.






*Maitland Cameron doesn't like [Necrogen Scudder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Necrogen+Scudder) any more. Not one bit.* 

  

**Cameron 0 - Zhang 1**




 Cameron was the aggressor in Game 2, spurting out a veritable token army with two [Raise the Alarm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Raise+the+Alarm) and a [Triplicate Spirits](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Triplicate+Spirits). Although Zhang puts down the beats with a [Juggernaut](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Juggernaut) and a [Necrogen Scudder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Necrogen+Scudder), Cameron managed to remove both thanks to the efforts of his [Selfless Cathar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Selfless+Cathar). Zhang reassembled his ground forces and and the two traded blows in the air, Cameron with his two remaining Spirit tokens and Zhang with a [Shadowcloak Vampire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shadowcloak+Vampire). Zhang found just enough removal to eliminate the two Spirit tokens, and even with the vampire bringing Zhang's life total perilously close to zero, Cameron can't find an opening and his tokens get overrun.






*James Zhang makes his way to another Grand Prix finals.*

  

**Maitland Cameron 0 - James Zhang 2**
