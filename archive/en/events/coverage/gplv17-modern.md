Day 2 Coverage



The Legacy and Limited Grand Prix have drawn to a close, and only six Swiss rounds and one final Top 8 remain. Thirteen undefeated players lead the Modern field as we head into Day 2 of the Modern Grand Prix.


Only one trophy remains, a field of 922 players in hot pursuit. While the field is populated with Grixis Death's Shadow and Eldrazi Tron, the undefeated decks represent traditional Modern archetypes like Burn, Affinity, and Abzan, new favorites like Death's Shadow, and a few unanticipated strategies like Blue-Black Taking Turns.
