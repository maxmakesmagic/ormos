Sometimes I just like to page through our internal tool called Multiverse. It's our database that R&D relies on to help with the development of **Magic**. From art to cards it contains lots and lots of data. So being able to flip through cards and then look through the iterations of the art in the system is a wonderful thing to be able to do.

Normally, we will see a few iterations per card, maybe around five, for the pieces of art. The last three tend to be color corrections and adjustments, which aren't that exciting and aren't Arcana worthy. But then sometimes we discover a rich look through the evolution of an art piece.

That's what I found when I looked with Karametra, God of Harvests.

So how did we get to the piece you see on the card above? Here is an excerpt from the art direction that was given to Eric Deschamps for this piece:


> Imagine a shot of Karametra, seated in her nature-woven 'Throne of Abundance' with her Sable curled at its base or around it. Her hair is made of orderly leaves and she is surrounded by jugs and amphorae that can contain or even be spilling colorful yields of the harvest. She is seen as if in the distance, huge against the bright blue sky. Her 'positive' form pushes and pulls against the figure-ground relationship. Edges of her or her throne and the sable can be shared by background elements to give her an 'in-place but out-of-place' feeling, like all of the gods. The bottom of the piece should be landscape, probably an orchard, or maybe some areas of cultivated farm-land.

And from there, we arrive at the final piece:
