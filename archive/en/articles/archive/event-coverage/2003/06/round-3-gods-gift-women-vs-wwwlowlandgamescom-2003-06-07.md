In Seat B Wessel Oomens faced off against Victor van den Broek in a black-white mirror match.

### Game 1


The first game didn't last too long. Oomens started beats quickly with a [Festering Goblin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Festering+Goblin) and [Spectral Sliver](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spectral+Sliver). Van den Broek played a facedown [Soul Collector](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soul+Collector) but that was quickly the target of a [Lingering Death](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lingering+Death). An [Infest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Infest) from van der Broek put it out of it's misery and cleared Oomen's side of the board.


Oomens' hand was all gas though as a pair of [Daunting Defender](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Daunting+Defender)s smashed face with a [Pacifism](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pacifism) to clear the road. Van den Broek dealt with one with a [Clutch of Undeath](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Clutch+of+Undeath) but had taken too much damage too quickly and Oomen's took a quick lead for God's Gift.


Oomens 1-0 van den Broek


As they shuffled up for game 2 Wiegersma's red-green deck wiped out God's gift's advantage by going 1-0 up against Warmenhoeven's white-blue. Frank Karsten reinforced this lead by taking the lead in his match.


### Game 2


Game 2 was quicker. Oomen's was mana-screwed and van den Broek killed all his early drops before beating him up with some morphs.


Oomens 1-1 van den Broek


### Game 3


 



![Cabal Archon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Cabal+Archon)

Game 3 looked more like a contest. Oomens curved up with morph, [Screeching Buzzard](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Screeching+Buzzard) and [Gluttonous Zombie](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gluttonous+Zombie). Van den Broek matched with [Plains](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plains)cycling a [Noble Templar](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Noble+Templar), then gumming up the ground with [Battlefield Medic](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Battlefield+Medic), [Daru Healer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Daru+Healer) and a morph. Fearing the [Soul Collector](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soul+Collector) Oomens kept the [Gluttonous Zombie](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gluttonous+Zombie) back on defense. His fears were correct but a [Lingering Death](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lingering+Death) allayed that problem. Van den Broek fought back by [Cruel Revival](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cruel+Revival)ing a [Windborn Muse](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Windborn+Muse) on Oomen's side.

Oomen's evasion creatures were free to attack now though and when he brought a [Cabal Archon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cabal+Archon) onto the table a few turns later he was able to take the deciding game and open up a 1-0 lead for God's Gift.


**Result:** Oomens beat van den Broek 2-1


God's Gift to Women 1-0 [www.lowlandgames.com](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=www.lowlandgames.com)


In the other matches Warmenhoven and Assen leveled to leave God's Gift looking solid. But from then it went wrong as in their deciding match Karsten cast [Rush of Knowledge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rush+of+Knowledge) for three then summoned an [Aven Brigadier](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aven+Brigadier) with [Dragon Scales](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragon+Scales) to make that game all but over.


In the other match Warmenhoven was on the receiving end of a [Symbiotic Beast](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Symbiotic+Beast) and [Needleshot Gourna](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Needleshot+Gourna). He dropped some high toughness bodies to try and stem the bleeding but it wasn't enough as he went down 2-1 to Wiegersma.


Assen held on but his deck didn't have an answer to the 4/7 flying, double Glorious Anthem that didn't tap to attack.


**Final Result:** [www.lowlandgames.com](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=www.lowlandgames.com) beat God's Gift to Women 2-1
