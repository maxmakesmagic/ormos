### Alan Comer (Bant) vs. Luis Scott-Vargas (Naya)

In the last 45 individual Pro tours, the 45 winners have all won their first rounds. Luis Scott-Vargas accomplished just that in Berlin in 2008, while his opponent, renowned deck builder and Hall of Famer Alan Comer, has yet to contribute to that particular statistic. 

"So you're 2-0 already," Comer laughed to Scott-Vargas. "It's been a *long* time since I was in a tournament and started 2-0."

"Yeah, Rich Hagon had a really interesting statistic about Pro Tour winners," Scott-Vargas replied. This sparked a lengthy discussion about the statistics of winning the Pro Tour after having won the first round, which ended in Scott-Vargas saying, "Well, we've both won the first round, so at least we can still win the Pro Tour!"

"I've actually Top 8ed a Pro Tour after losing the first round," Comer replied after a bit of thought. "Ironically, I lost in the first round of the Top 8, too."

Lacking a randomization method, they asked me to ninja some dice away from Shuhei Nakamura, who was playing behind me. Resorting to the oft-used ninja tactic of asking nicely, I handed them a pair of dice that Comer really seemed to take a shine to after seeing Scott-Vargas's roll.

"Four! I like those dice!"

One second, one roll, and one pip less later, and Comer had reevaluated things.

"I lied. I don't like those dice."

### Game 1

Scott-Vargas and Comer both started the game with a mana-generating creature, prompting Comer to remark, "Mana creatures? Who would have thought of that?"

"Unfortunately, I'm afraid your mana creature won't be alive for much longer," Scott-Vargas said as he aimed a [Lightning Bolt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt) at comer's [Birds of Paradise](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Birds+of+Paradise). When Comer tried to replace it with another, an [Ajani Vengeant](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ajani+Vengeant) from Scott-Vargas took it away. Undaunted, Comer dropped a *third* one-mana creature, this time a [Noble Hierarch](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Noble+Hierarch). This one stuck, though Scott-Vargas did keep his mana down by locking a [Forest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest) down with Ajani. He also added a [Knight of the Reliquary](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Knight+of+the+Reliquary) to his board, putting him way ahead.

Comer added a real threat to the board with a [Rhox War Monk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rhox+War+Monk), but he was facing a slightly larger board from Scott-Vargas. Things got even bigger when Scott-Vargas used a [Tectonic Edge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tectonic+Edge) to kill Comer's [Celestial Colonnade](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Celestial+Colonnade).

"That's to make *my* Knights bigger, right?" Comer joked.

Scott-Vargas fired up his [Raging Ravine](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Raging+Ravine) and sent it and his other animals into the Red Zone. Comer dropped to 9.

"I need some life," Comer said bluntly as he dropped a [Finest Hour](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Finest+Hour) into play. This let him send his [Rhox War Monk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rhox+War+Monk) over twice to drop Scott-Vargas to 15 and raise himself up to 17. With [Ajani Vengeant](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ajani+Vengeant) on the other side, The Monk was quickly locked down, leaving Comer with no creatures save the ones that were currently lands.

Scott-Vargas already had a boardful of creatures, and a [Ranger of Eos](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ranger+of+Eos) recruited him a pair of [Wild Nacatl](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Nacatl)s. When they attacked on the next turn into a virtually empty board, Comer looked at the fistful of cards Scott-Vargas had in reserve and packed it in.

### Game 2

When both players mulliganned, it sparked Comer, who famously created the Miracle-Gro deck featuring an improbable *ten* lands, to remark, "That's what happens when I play more than twenty lands—I don't draw any."

This game began with Comer landing a second-turn [Noble Hierarch](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Noble+Hierarch) that defied the odds and lived to attack Scott-Vargas for 1. A [Knight of the Reliquary](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Knight+of+the+Reliquary) came down to bar the way, so Comer just upped the ante with a [Rafiq of the Many](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rafiq+of+the+Many). [Ajani Vengeant](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ajani+Vengeant) came down and promptly dealt with the problematic legend. True to form, Comer just added an even bigger monster to combat the roadblock, but, true to form himself, Scott-Vargas had a [Path to Exile](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Path+to+Exile) to remove Comer's [Baneslayer Angel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Baneslayer+Angel). In addition, Scott-Vargas made a [Bloodbraid Elf](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodbraid+Elf), which cascaded into a [Cunning Sparkmage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cunning+Sparkmage), which immediately ate the [Noble Hierarch](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Noble+Hierarch). On the following turn, the Sparkmage picked up a [Basilisk Collar](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Basilisk+Collar), allowing it to kill Comer's freshly cast Rafiq, and he was left defenseless as Scott-Vargas smashed over for the win.
