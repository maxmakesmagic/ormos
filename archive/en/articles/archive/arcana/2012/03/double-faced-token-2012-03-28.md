The moon is very important in *Innistrad* Block, and on Innistrad-the-plane. The place is teeming with werewolves, for one thing. And cards such as [Moon Heron](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Moon+Heron) and [Full Moon's Rise](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Full+Moon%27s+Rise) call it out explicitly.


We bring this up because in the real world, April 6, 2012 is a full moon. And it's a Friday. And what could be more thematic than playing *Innistrad* Block cards at Friday Night **Magic** under a full moon?


To help answer that question, Wizards of the Coast has sent out the first Double-Faced Token. One side's a 1/1 Human, and the other side is a 2/2 Wolf. Neither side is foil. While supplies last, they'll be given out to everyone who plays Friday Night **Magic** on April 6, 2012. And of course, the regular Friday Night **Magic** promo card for April will be there too.
