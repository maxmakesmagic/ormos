|   | *Luis-Scott Vargas* | *David Ochoa* |
| Favorite card | Juzam Djinn. It was one of the first cards I saw when I started playing that just captured my imagination. It represented all of the things that I really wanted in **Magic**. | I'll go with [Gifts Ungiven](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gifts+Ungiven). |
| Favorite Deck | The old [W/U Desire](http://www.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Events.aspx?x=mtgevent/phi05ptq/0305mountainview) from Extended. | [W/U Desire](http://www.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Events.aspx?x=mtgevent/phi05ptq/0305mountainview) was pretty good. That or [Omnichord](http://www.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/daily/fk55)... |
| Favorite place **Magic** has taken you | We went to Peru before Grand Prix Santiago, so we went to Machu Picchu which was just incredible. But my favorite place I've played is Japan. | Machu Picchu, and it isn't close. |
| Favorite player to watch? | Shouta. He plays super-fast and super-well. The fast part is important, because I get bored watching slower people. | Shouta in Constructed, because you'll always be in for a show. That is if you like [Eternal Witness](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eternal+Witness), [Æther Vial](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=%C3%86ther+Vial), and [Cryptic Command](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cryptic+Command)... |
| What would be your feature match entrance music? | Yakity Sax | Foreplay/Long Time by Boston. |
| If we were casting the movie of your life, who would you have play you? | Someone very durdly. That's about as specific as I can get. | Darth Vader. Or maybe Tom Selleck or Groucho Marx... It'd have to be someone with a very likeable voice. James Earl Jones or Morgan Freeman. You know what, Daniel Day Lewis, not close. |
| What formats would you like to see played in this event in future years? | Cube and Vintage | Cube, Vintage, and... maybe Winston or Winchester Draft. |
| What's your favorite movie? | The Usual Suspects | For my Facebook profile, I have it as "too many to list." |
| What's your favorite sports team? | Uh, no opinion | I prefer to follow players, but I don't really follow them enough to be able to have a real conversation about them. If I had to pick a team, I'd say... Team [Channel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Channel)fireball. |
| What is your favorite book? | Blink by Malcolm Gladwell | I actually don't read all that often, but I did finish reading Heart of [Darkness](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Darkness) recently, and that was pretty interesting, I thought. I liked The Count of Monte Cristo, too. I guess you could say my favorite book is the one I haven't read yet. |
| If you married a morph, which creature would you be the most upset for it to unmorph into? | [Scornful Egotist](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scornful+Egotist) | Hah, [Scornful Egotist](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scornful+Egotist). They're too large, and they're too much like me. |
|  | *Brian Kibler* | *Josh Utter-Leyton* |
| Favorite card | [Knight of the Reliquary](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Knight+of+the+Reliquary). It's an awesome and extremely versatile creature. | [Sensei's Divining Top](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sensei%27s+Divining+Top) |
| Favorite Deck | [My Red Zone deck from Chicago.](http://www.wizards.com/sideboard/article.asp?x=sb20010420b) | [*Time Spiral* Block Constructed Teachings.](http://www.wizards.com/magic/samplehand.asp?x=mtgevent/ptyok07/t50decks&amp;decknum=1) |
| Favorite place **Magic** has taken you | Probably Rome. I've been there twice and it was just amazing. | Probably Nagoya. Anywhere in Japan is really nice. |
| Favorite player to watch? | Paul Rietzl. He's very entertaining in addition to being very good. | Luis Scott-Vargas. He's the person I'm closest to and rooting for the most. That and he's arguably the best, so... |
| What would be your feature match entrance music? | The Final Countdown by Europe. | It would change every tournament. For this one it would be Tritonal Everafter Club Mix. |
| If we were casting the movie of your life, who would you have play you? | Matt Damon | Edward Norton |
| What formats would you like to see played in this event in future years? | Definitely more Cube. | Cube, Cube, and Cube. Barring that, I guess Legacy would be fun. |
| What's your favorite movie? | Good Will Hunting | Memento |
| What's your favorite sports team? | Team Solo Mid Gaming from League of *Legends*. | San Jose Sharks. I do live a mile from the stadium. |
| What is your favorite book? | Ender's Game by Orson Scott Card | Catch-22 by Joseph Heller |
| If you married a morph, which creature would you be the most upset for it to unmorph into? | I'd be terrified if it was [Krosan Cloudscraper](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Krosan+Cloudscraper). | [Wall of Deceit](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wall+of+Deceit) |
|  | *Samuele Estratti* | *Alexander Hayne* |
| Favorite card | [Geist of Saint Traft](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Geist+of+Saint+Traft) | [Gifts Ungiven](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gifts+Ungiven) |

The Extended one was good too though. |
| Favorite place **Magic** has taken you | Vegas, Honolulu, Puerto Rico... basically any good tourist spot. | Amsterdam. But I'd love to go to Japan. |
| Favorite player to watch? | Jon Finkel. | Probably Yasooka. |
| What would be your feature match entrance music? | I'm Sexy and I Know It by LMFAO | Eye of the Tiger by Survivor |
| If we were casting the movie of your life, who would you have play you? | Um... you don't want to know. | Sylvester Stallone. Seriously. |
| What formats would you like to see played in this event in future years? | Two-Headed Giant would be kind of cool. | Bring Your Own Block. I was talking to Finkel about playing it yesterday, and he talked about how fun it was, though I have no idea which sets I would use... |
| What's your favorite movie? | Big Fish | I like a lot of movies... Let's go with V for [Vendetta](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vendetta). |
| What's your favorite sports team? | Team Italy | Please. The Montreal Canadiens. |
| What is your favorite book? | Is Harry Potter alright? | Ender's Game by Orson Scott Card |
| If you married a morph, which creature would you be the most upset for it to unmorph into? | [Blistering Firecat](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blistering+Firecat) seems like it'd be pretty bad. | Hah, [Shaper Parasite](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shaper+Parasite) |
|  | *Owen Turtenwald* | *Paulo Vitor Damo da Rosa* |
| Favorite card | Hahaha, [Wild Swing](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Swing) | [Vendilion Clique](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vendilion+Clique) |
| Favorite Deck | [Goblins, just any Goblins.](http://www.wizards.com/magic/samplehand.asp?x=mtgevent/gpcol07/welcome&amp;decknum=4) The two best Pro Tour finishes I've ever had have come with Goblins. | White Weenie... Just kidding. [Faeries](http://www.wizards.com/magic/samplehand.asp?x=mtgevent/pthol08/qf2&amp;decknum=2). |
| Favorite place **Magic** has taken you | Bozeman, Montana. | I don't know. I like so many places. I think... I guess Hawaii. |
| Favorite player to watch? | Jackie Lee. | Luis Scott-Vargas. |
| What would be your feature match entrance music? | It's gotta be something from wrestling. Let's go Triple H's entrance music. | The Phantom of the Opera opening theme. |
| If we were casting the movie of your life, who would you have play you? | George Clooney | Myself, but if not myself, James McAvoy. |
| What formats would you like to see played in this event in future years? | Rochester would be fun. ("That's almost as unrealistic as my answer of Vintage," Luis Scott-Vargas chimes in.) | Anything that is not an established Constructed format. |
| What's your favorite movie? | Little Shop of Horrors. That kind of explains a lot, doesn't it? | I don't have one. What's your favorite movie? |
| What's your favorite sports team? | Sports? What are sports? | The Brazilian Women's Volleyball team. Honestly. They're the only team I really root for in competitions. |
| What is your favorite book? | Lord of the Flies by William Golding | Harry Potter! |
| If you married a morph, which creature would you be the most upset for it to unmorph into? | [Fortune Thief](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fortune+Thief)! | [Zombie Cutthroat](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Zombie+Cutthroat) would be kind of bad, I think. |
|  | *Martin Juza* | *Shuhei Nakamura* |
| Favorite card | [Counterspell](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterspell) | [Jace, the Mind Sculptor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace%2C+the+Mind+Sculptor) |
| Favorite Deck | [Berlin's Extended Elves](http://www.wizards.com/magic/samplehand.asp?x=mtg/daily/eventcoverage/ptber08/t8decks&amp;decknum=2). | [Mind Over Matter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mind+Over+Matter) Combo. |
| Favorite place **Magic** has taken you | Machu Picchu. The best place by far. By 5000 miles or so. | Rome. |
| Favorite player to watch? | Shouta. | I like to watch any legends like Finkel or Kai Budde. Superstars when I was growing up. |

| If we were casting the movie of your life, who would you have play you? | Borat. | I do not know. |

| What is your favorite book? | The Game by Neil Strauss | No books, sorry. |

I would want to marry [Exalted Angel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Exalted+Angel). ("That's not the question," Paulo Vitor Damo da Rosa chided as he heard Juza's reply. "Everyone would want to marry [Exalted Angel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Exalted+Angel)...") | Umm...[Vesuvan Shapeshifter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vesuvan+Shapeshifter) |
|  | *Jun'ya Iyanaga* | *Yuuya Watanabe* |
| Favorite card | [Counterspell](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterspell) | [Ponder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ponder) |
| Favorite Deck | [Psychatog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psychatog). | [My 2008 Japanese Nationals deck.](http://www.wizards.com/magic/samplehand.asp?x=mtg/daily/eventcoverage/jpnat08/welcome&amp;decknum=3) |
| Favorite place **Magic** has taken you | Rome. | Kyoto. |
| Favorite player to watch? | n/a | Kai Budde in 2000. He was unbeatable. |
| What would be your feature match entrance music? | Heh, no music please. | I don't know, sorry. |
| If we were casting the movie of your life, who would you have play you? | n/a | That is a good question. |
| What formats would you like to see played in this event in future years? | Extended! | Team Rochester!!! |
| What's your favorite movie? | Eizouno 20 Seiki | K-On! |
| What's your favorite sports team? | I don't watch a lot of sports. | I don't watch sports. |
| What is your favorite book? | Roma-jin No Monogatari | Hmm...no books, no. |
| If you married a morph, which creature would you be the most upset for it to unmorph into? | [Spined Basher](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spined+Basher) | [Voidmage Prodigy](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Voidmage+Prodigy) |
|  | *Shouta Yasooka* | *Jon Finkel* |
| Favorite card | [Eternal Witness](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eternal+Witness) | Awkwardly I really don't have one. I mean, [Ancestral Recall](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ancestral+Recall) is nice, but I haven't cast one in years... |
| Favorite Deck | Every deck I make, especially [Jushi Control](http://www.wizards.com/magic/samplehand.asp?x=mtgevent/la05ptq/0813yokohama&amp;decknum=4). | [My Pro Tour Chicago 1997 deck](http://www.wizards.com/magic/samplehand.asp?x=sideboard/strategy/20021015a&amp;decknum=1). |
| Favorite place **Magic** has taken you | Anywhere and everywhere. | Cape Town. It may not actually be my favorite, but it was one of the most interesting. Sydney was nice, too. |
| Favorite player to watch? | I don't really like watching anyone else play. | I don't really watch the players that much, honestly. |
| What would be your feature match entrance music? | Hmm... no music. | Every Day is Like Sunday by Morrissey. |
| If we were casting the movie of your life, who would you have play you? | Kenji Tsumura! | Justin Timberlake. |
| What formats would you like to see played in this event in future years? | I don't care as long as I get to play **Magic**. Well, except for Vintage. I have no cards! | Cube was definitely good, and they should keep doing it. It's very skill testing and interesting, basically everything players really want in a format. I would like to see the Constructed bias removed some. Some of the events from the Invitational were very good. The Solomon Drafts, Auction of the People, and Duplicate Sealed... These are very skill-testing formats and it would be nice to see have a place again. |
| What's your favorite movie? | Lyrical Nanoha | I don't even know. I'm not really big on the concept of "best" things. It's always a range. This is really bad in New York, too. If someone asks you which pizza place is best, I can give you a dozen or so that are all a 9.5 or a 10, and which one you choose is really up to how you feel on a given day. I did answer this question recently, though, with This is Spinal Tap, so I will go with that one. |
| What's your favorite sports team? | I am not a sports person. | The Philadelphia Eagles. When I was younger I was really into sports, and I followed them, but I've fallen away from that as I've gotten older. |
| What is your favorite book? | I can't think of one. | In fiction, I'd recommend Flash Man by George MacDonald Frasier, and for nonfiction I'd say The Blank Slate: The Modern Denial of Human Nature by Steven Pinker. |
| If you married a morph, which creature would you be the most upset for it to unmorph into? | The protection from Goblins creature...[Foothill Guide](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Foothill+Guide)! | [Bane of the Living](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bane+of+the+Living) |
|  | *Tzu-Ching Kuo* | *Reid Duke* |
| Favorite card | [Geist of Saint Traft](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Geist+of+Saint+Traft) | [Green Sun's Zenith](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Green+Sun%27s+Zenith) |
| Favorite Deck | I like aggro/control decks like [this Standard season's](http://www.wizards.com/magic/samplehand.asp?x=mtg/daily/eventcoverage/wmc12/standarddecks&amp;decknum=46) [Delver of Secrets](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Delver%2Bof%2BSecrets). And [Caw-Blade](http://www.wizards.com/magic/samplehand.asp?x=mtg/daily/eventcoverage/ptpar11/top8/decklists&amp;decknum=3) last year. Decks like that. | [Natural Order](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Natural+Order) in Legacy. |
| Favorite place **Magic** has taken you | San Francisco. | I'll go with Amsterdam. |
| Favorite player to watch? | Yuuya Watanabe. | Jon Finkel. No reason in particular. |
| What would be your feature match entrance music? | We Are the Champions by Queen. | Escape (The Pina Colada Song) by Rupert Holmes. |
| If we were casting the movie of your life, who would you have play you? | Some handsome guy, hah. | Keanu Reeves. |
| What formats would you like to see played in this event in future years? | I think Modern is okay. Maybe another casual format like Commander. Maybe Two-Headed Giant. We'd have to pick a teammate... | I liked the Cube draft. |
| What's your favorite movie? | Resident Evil. I think it was released as Biohazard in Japan. | The Shawshank Redemption |
| What's your favorite sports team? | Philadelphia Phillies. It's the only team I ever watch. | New York Knicks |
| What is your favorite book? | I don't really have one. I don't really read a lot of books. | Don't really have one. I'll take a pass. |
| If you married a morph, which creature would you be the most upset for it to unmorph into? | [Brine Elemental](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brine+Elemental) | [Skirk Commando](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skirk+Commando) |
