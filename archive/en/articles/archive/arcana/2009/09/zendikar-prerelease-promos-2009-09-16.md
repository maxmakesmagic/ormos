Hey! You! That's right, *you*, the one in front of the computer! Are you going to a [*Zendikar* Prerelease](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/tcg/events.aspx?x=mtgcom/events/prereleases) on September 26-27?

Yeahhhh. That's right. But we're not done! If you participate in a prerelease event (and the supplies hold out), you'll *also* receive *this*!
