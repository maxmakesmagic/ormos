Iwan Tan is a German player who travels to a lot of the Grand Prix tournaments but only has one Top 8 (from Grand Prix-Moscow) to his credit. Zdenek Lysák is a Czech player having another good tournament after picking up $650 in Vienna, mostly out of the Amateur prize funds.

This match is a straight knockout. The winner advances to the Top 8, the loser goes home. Not much pressure then.

Tan has a quick red-green deck while Lysák has also drafted aggro, pairing red with black instead of green.

### Game 1

Tan chose to go first and thought a long time about whether to keep his hand as the cheapest monster it contained cost four mana. Not the best for a quick deck. He kept it and it paid off as a Blightcutter came out on turn 3. Lysák dropped a [Grim Lavamancer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grim+Lavamancer) on turn 1 and then a [Longhorn Firebeast](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Longhorn+Firebeast). This creature is not thought to be very strong as a player will nearly always take the five damage. This time was no exception.

Tan killed the Lavamancer with a [Flame Burst](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flame+Burst) and then cast [Chatter of the Squirrel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chatter+of+the+Squirrel).

Lysák was suffering under a horrific colour screw though as he hadn't found any [Swamp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swamp)s. He used two [Acceptable Losses](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Acceptable+Losses) to kill first the Blightcutter and then a [Pardic Firecat](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pardic+Firecat) but he could only play with half his deck and died with a bunch of black cards in hand and no [Swamp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swamp)s on the table.

Tan 1-0 Lysák

### Game 2

Lysák had an equally awful draw in game 2, drawing only four spells and a lot of land. One of those spells was a [Longhorn Firebeast](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Longhorn+Firebeast) that hung around only long enough to deal five damage to Tan, the only damage he took the entire game.

In contrast Tan came racing out of the blocks – turn 1 Rootwalla, turn 2 [Mad Dog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mad+Dog), turn 3 Blightcutter.

Lysák reduced the pressure with successive [Ghastly Demise](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ghastly+Demise)s on first the Rootwalla and then the [Mad Dog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mad+Dog). Then he ran out of spells and Tan didn't run out of creatures.

A [Halberdier](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Halberdier) showed up and might have given Lysák some hope except Tan smashed straight through it with a [Muscle Burst](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Muscle+Burst).

Lysák drew then tipped his hand to reveal a hand full of land.

When you're battling for Top 8 the last thing you need are draws like that.

**Final Result:** Iwan Tan beat Zdenek Lysák 2-0 and advances to the Top 8 of Grand Prix-Naples.
