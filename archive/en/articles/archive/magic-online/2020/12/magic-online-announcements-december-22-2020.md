Updated Alternative Play Schedule

The alternative play schedule that was announced in the *Zendikar Rising* set article has changed! Check out the latest schedule below.


* January 13–20: **A brand-new addition to the Spotlight Cube Series**. As usual, more details will come later, but this one promises to be a wheel of a good time.
* January 20–28: ***Vintage Masters* Flashback**. One of the most popular Draft formats of all time is back to round out *Zendikar Rising* season. We'll have a little more than a week of that, and then . . . well, it's not quite time to talk about *Kaldheim* just yet.

Showcase Qualifiers
-------------------


Players who earned entry into the Showcase Qualifier will be squaring off for an invitation to the Champions Showcase. The entry fee for Showcase Qualifiers is a format token that matches the format of the Showcase. As with QPs, after the season's Showcase Qualifiers are finished, all unused Format Tokens will be removed from players' accounts. Each Showcase Qualifier is a scheduled Swiss-style event with a Top 8 playoff. The winner of each Showcase Qualifier earns a spot in the final Showcase event and a chance to earn their share of $70,000 and an upcoming Premier Event invitation.


Showcase Qualifiers are scheduled as follows:





| **DATE** | **TIME** | **EVENT** | **FORMAT** | **INVITATION** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Sunday, December 26, 2020 | 8:00 a.m. | Modern Showcase Qualifier | Modern | Season 3 Showcase |
| Sunday, December 27, 2020 | 8:00 a.m. | Legacy Showcase Qualifier | Legacy | Season 3 Showcase |


Learn more about Showcase Qualifier events [here](https://magic.wizards.com/en/mtgo/premier-play-2020#shq).

Showcase Opens January 2–3
--------------------------


The penultimate events of each season, Showcase Opens allow anyone to try their hand at earning an invitation to the Showcase. Players don't need to earn points or another qualification to enter, and because these events are Sealed, players don't even need a deck. The winner of each Open will get an invitation to the Showcase, and both the winner and runner-up earn invitations to the *Kaldheim* Championship on *MTG Arena*. Entry options include 40 Event Tickets or 400 Play Points, and events consist of Swiss pairings followed by a single-elimination Top 8 draft.


Showcase Opens are scheduled as follows:





| **DATE** | **TIME** | **FORMAT** | **INVITATION** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Saturday, January 2, 2021 | 7:00 a.m. | ZNR Sealed | Season 3 Showcase |
| Sunday, January 3, 2021 | 7:00 a.m. | ZNR Sealed | Season 3 Showcase |
