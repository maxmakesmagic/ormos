Check out the latest [State of the Game article](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/magic-digital/kamigawa-neon-dynasty-mtg-arena-2022-02-09) for details on what's happening in *MTG Arena* with the new *Kamigawa: Neon Dynasty* release coming out tomorrow, February 10! From mechanics, to collecting the new cards in *MTG Arena*, to an update on the new format Alchemy, this will get you ready for what's new and on the horizon.


New *Jump In!* Packets Coming!
==============================


We’re updating the available *Jump In!* packets with the *Kamigawa: Neon Dynasty* release tomorrow, February 10! Check the [*Jump In!* event details and packet list page](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/magic-digital/mtg-arena-jump-in) on Friday, February 11 for details of the new packets.


Double Feature Draft
====================


There's just one more day of [Double Feature Draft](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/magic-digital/mtg-arena-double-feature-event-2022-01-19)! This event ends February 10, so now's your final chance to play and grab Dracula card styles! A bug caused a problem with the granting of card styles, so we'll be granting *two* card styles to accounts for each entry beyond the first to compensate for the inconvenience.


Note: card styles will be granted shortly after the February 10 release of *Kamigawa: Neon Dynasty*.
