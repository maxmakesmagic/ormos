![oppression](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=oppression)You see his name on cards like [Ring of Gix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ring+of+Gix), [Claws of Gix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Claws+of+Gix), and [Priest of Gix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Priest+of+Gix), and maybe you even know that's him on the art of the original *Urza's Saga* [oppression](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=oppression). But what else do we know of Gix?

The *Urza's Saga* Styleguide doesn't offer much more help, descibing Gix simply as a "demonic construct of Yawgmoth himself, built of bone, machine parts, and soft yucky meat stuffs." Sounds delicious.
