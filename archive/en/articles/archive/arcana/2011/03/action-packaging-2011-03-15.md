Here's what we've said about the third set in *Scars of Mirrodin* block:

* Its code name was "Action" (because *Scars of Mirrodin* was "Lights" and *Mirrodin Besieged* was "Camera").
* It will be for sale on May 13, 2011, and the Prerelease Events will be May, 7-8.
* It will be called either *New Phyrexia* or *Mirrodin Pure*. Not both. And it's already decided.

At this point, we would normally show you some pictures of the packaging for Action. You know, the booster packs, the intro packs, that sort of thing. So let's get to it!

On the left, *Mirrodin Pure*. On the right, *New Phyrexia*. One of these will be the third set of *Scars of Mirrodin* block, released in May, 2011. Exciting!
