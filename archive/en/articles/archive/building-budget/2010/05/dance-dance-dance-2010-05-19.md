Welcome back to Building on a Budget. This week I'd like to explore the possibility of a Standard Enchantress deck. [Kor Spiritdancer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kor+Spiritdancer) makes a whole new archetype possible. [Spreading Seas](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spreading+Seas), an aura, is arguably the most well positioned card in Standard these days. Decks packing a full count of [Spreading Seas](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spreading+Seas) get a huge percentage of wins off the [Spreading Seas](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spreading+Seas) alone. I've found it to be very difficult to lose games to Jund where I win the die roll and have a [Spreading Seas](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spreading+Seas) in my opening hand. That may seem like a rare occurrence, but it comes up surprisingly often. [Spreading Seas](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spreading+Seas) also does an excellent job at turning off manlands in the late-game.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/boab/boab91_kor.jpg)I've recieved well over fifty emails from you guys with various lists for the archetype. Some lists have been straight white-blue, some green-white, but most lists have played with all three Bant colors.

Sigil of the Empty Throne
 |

The biggest choice, it seems, when designing a Standard Enchantress deck is whether or not to include [Sigil of the Empty Throne](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sigil+of+the+Empty+Throne). There are sound arguments on both sides of the debate. Personally, I like having a big win condition. [Kor Spiritdancer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kor+Spiritdancer) can be big and bad, but having an aerial assault of 4/4s seems like a much more reasonable way to win the game. I'd love to hear your thoughts on this in the forums.


Lets take a look at the card choices:


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/boab/boab91_theCardsHeader.jpg)[Kor Spiritdancer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kor+Spiritdancer): The inspiration for the deck! [Kor Spiritdancer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kor+Spiritdancer) provides us with an excellent defense, an absurd amount of card advantage, and a formidable win condition. Truly scary things become possible when you have multiple copies of this in play.


[Mesa Enchantress](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mesa+Enchantress): The extra mana here is a hefty price, but having more enchantress effects is crucial to the inner workings of the deck. [Mesa Enchantress](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mesa+Enchantress) lets us draw cards off our [Oblivion Ring](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oblivion+Ring)s and [Sigil of the Empty Throne](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sigil+of+the+Empty+Throne)s, so the extra mana isn't all for nought.


[Canopy Cover](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Canopy+Cover): [Path to Exile](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Path+to+Exile) seems like your worst enemy. [Canopy Cover](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Canopy+Cover) lets you abuse any opening your opponent might give you. If they tap out for a turn four [Jace, the Mind Sculptor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace%2C+the+Mind+Sculptor) you can follow with a [Kor Spiritdancer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kor+Spiritdancer) and a [Canopy Cover](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Canopy+Cover). [Canopy Cover](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Canopy+Cover) really shines against the planeswalker decks, once your [Kor Spiritdancer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kor+Spiritdancer) has an Umbra and a [Canopy Cover](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Canopy+Cover) the game is just about over.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/boab/boab91_theCardsCross1.jpg)[Hyena Umbra](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hyena+Umbra): One mana for the totem armor effect is what's most important here. The first strike is very nice against decks like Jund. Making your [Kor Spiritdancer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kor+Spiritdancer) immune to [Day of Judgment](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Day+of+Judgment) or [Martial Coup](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Martial+Coup) is always good.


[Spreading Seas](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spreading+Seas): I've already talked at length about this one. [Spreading Seas](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spreading+Seas) may be the best card in the current Standard. It happens to be an Aura, making it fit perfectly in this type of strategy.


[Sigil of the Empty Throne](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sigil+of+the+Empty+Throne): I wanted a good late-game finisher. [Sigil of the Empty Throne](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sigil+of+the+Empty+Throne) seems like my best option.


[Bear Umbra](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bear+Umbra): I just couldn't help myself. Giving my [Kor Spiritdancer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kor+Spiritdancer) +4/+4 and totem armor, getting to untap all my lands to draw some more cards with the goodies I've found. Sign me up!


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/boab/boab91_theCardsCross2.jpg)[Ponder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ponder): I'm worried that this deck won't perform very well if we cannot find a [Kor Spiritdancer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kor+Spiritdancer) in the early stages of the game. I want to play [Ponder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ponder) to ensure we draw the right pieces at the right times.


[Oblivion Ring](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oblivion+Ring): I'm a strong believer in [Oblivion Ring](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oblivion+Ring) these days. Planeswalkers, [Emrakul, the Aeons Torn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Emrakul%252C%2Bthe%2BAeons%2BTorn)s, [Vengevine](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vengevine)s, you name it. [Oblivion Ring](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oblivion+Ring) gets the job done. We may not draw a card off our [Kor Spiritdancer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kor+Spiritdancer), but we deal with whatever problem we need to.


[Crystallization](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crystallization): I thought about playing [Pacifism](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pacifism), but I did a quick Gatherer search and found this gem. I used to first pick it in drafts all the time, so I figure it will probably be good enough.

I decided to play a few games with the deck and see how things went.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/boab/boab91_match1Header.jpg)  
![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/boab/boab91_guide.jpg)I lost the roll and kept [Evolving Wilds](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Evolving+Wilds), [Island](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island), [Kor Spiritdancer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kor+Spiritdancer), [Ponder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ponder), [Crystallization](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crystallization), [Sigil of the Empty Throne](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sigil+of+the+Empty+Throne), [Mesa Enchantress](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mesa+Enchantress). My opponent cast a [Goblin Guide](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Guide) and attacked. I revealed a [Seaside Citadel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seaside+Citadel). I drew a [Plains](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plains), played my [Seaside Citadel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seaside+Citadel), and passed the turn discarding the [Sigil of the Empty Throne](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sigil+of+the+Empty+Throne). My opponent attacked for another two, I revealed another [Crystallization](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crystallization). My opponent cast a [Plated Geopede](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plated+Geopede) and passed the turn. I drew the [Crystallization](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crystallization), played my [Plains](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plains), cast [Crystallization](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crystallization) on the Geopede, and passed the turn. My opponent tapped out for a [Ball Lightning](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ball+Lightning) and attacked for eight, I revealed an [Oblivion Ring](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oblivion+Ring). I drew the [Oblivion Ring](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oblivion+Ring). Played my [Plains](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plains), cast [Kor Spiritdancer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kor+Spiritdancer), cast [Hyena Umbra](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hyena+Umbra) on the Spiritdancer, drew another [Hyena Umbra](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hyena+Umbra), and passed the turn. My opponent drew his card and passed the turn back. I drew another [Kor Spiritdancer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kor+Spiritdancer), cast it, cast [Hyena Umbra](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hyena+Umbra) on it, which my opponent responded to with a [Staggershock](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Staggershock). I drew [Mesa Enchantress](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mesa+Enchantress) and another [Seaside Citadel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seaside+Citadel). I played the [Seaside Citadel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seaside+Citadel) and passed the turn. My opponent played a fourth land, cast [Kargan Dragonlord](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kargan+Dragonlord), leveled it twice, and passed the turn. I drew a [Ponder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ponder), cast [Crystallization](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crystallization) on the Dragonlord, drew a [Bear Umbra](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bear+Umbra), cast a [Ponder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ponder), saw all lands and Shuffled my Library, drew an [Oblivion Ring](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oblivion+Ring), played an [Evolving Wilds](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Evolving+Wilds) and passed the turn. My opponent played a fifth land and cast another [Kargan Dragonlord](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kargan+Dragonlord), which he leveled a few times and passed the turn. I popped my [Evolving Wilds](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Evolving+Wilds) for another land. I drew a [Forest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest), played it, cast [Bear Umbra](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bear+Umbra) on my [Kor Spiritdancer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kor+Spiritdancer), drew a [Spreading Seas](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spreading+Seas), cast [Ponder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ponder), put a [Crystallization](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crystallization), [Oblivion Ring](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oblivion+Ring), and [Sigil of the Empty Throne](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sigil+of+the+Empty+Throne) on top in that order. I attacked for 8 with my Spiritdancer and my opponent took the damage. I untapped all my lands, cast [Mesa Enchantress](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mesa+Enchantress), cast [Crystallization](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crystallization) on the [Goblin Guide](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Guide), drew [Oblivion Ring](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oblivion+Ring) and Sigil of the empty throne, and passed the turn. My opponent cast a [Burst Lightning](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Burst+Lightning) on the [Mesa Enchantress](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mesa+Enchantress) and passed the turn. I drew a [Canopy Cover](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Canopy+Cover) and cast it on the [Kor Spiritdancer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kor+Spiritdancer), I drew into another [Bear Umbra](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bear+Umbra) off of that and cast that one also. I attacked for lethal damage.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/boab/1_0.jpg)My opponent's burn-light draw didn't work out very well. I think red decks should be very focused on my life total and not very focused on my engine. I have too many ways to protect it and they can usually race me.

My opponent was pretty excited about the deck so we played a few more games. He won a little less than half of them. I found it especially difficult to win when he held back mana for his [Lightning Bolt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt)s and I didn't draw [Spreading Seas](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spreading+Seas). During our conversation we decided that [Sigil of the Empty Throne](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sigil+of+the+Empty+Throne) was unnecessary. [Canopy Cover](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Canopy+Cover) usually provides the evasion needed for a [Kor Spiritdancer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kor+Spiritdancer) to go all the way.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/boab/2_1.jpg)Sometimes [Kor Spiritdancer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kor+Spiritdancer) can get really out of hand. The deck is not as consistent as I would like it to be, but once the cogs get going, this deck becomes very difficult to beat. Argothian Enchantress was one of my favorite cards of all time and I really wanted to build a new Enchantress deck. If I were going to add more money to this deck I would probably do so in the manabase. If you're lucky enough to have [Jace, the Mind Sculptor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace%2C+the+Mind+Sculptor)s or [Gideon Jura](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gideon+Jura)s then those may actually have a place in the deck. They don't necessarily work toward our engine, but their absurd power levels make them very tempting to play. [Lifelink](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lifelink) seems like it could be a great sideboard option. I can't see a lot of decks beating an umbra'ed lifelinking [Kor Spiritdancer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kor+Spiritdancer). There may be a build of this that has true competitive potential. Perhaps it will be revealed at the Grand Prix in Washington D.C. this weekend.

Grand Prix–D.C. is this weekend. Huge **Magic** tournaments like this are a great opportunity to step up your game and try to get to the next level. The tournament will be Standard constructed so remember to bring a Standard legal deck. Get some friends together and make the roadtrip. I'll see you there!


Happy Brewing!


Next week is Rebound Week. I haven't seen many decks play with [Surreal Memoir](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Surreal+Memoir) yet and I plan to change that! If you have any especially exciting ideas for this deck I'd love to hear them on the forums or in an email.
