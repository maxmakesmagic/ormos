You'll be able to find much-beloved cards in *Double Masters 2022*, with many featuring new art and some of your favorite cards from the past returning in new, fancy versions.


Borderless Cards
================


There are 80 borderless cards in *Double Masters 2022*: 9 commons, 21 uncommons, 30 rares, and 20 mythic rares. You can find these cards in both Draft and Collector Boosters, in foil and non-foil. They have alternate art in the borderless frame.


![Borderless Liliana, the Last Hope](https://media.wizards.com/2022/2x2/en_2klLqAdlfw.png)![Borderless Kozilek, Butcher of Truth](https://media.wizards.com/2022/2x2/en_WVHfq8druY.png)


In Draft Boosters, commons and uncommons that have a borderless treatment will be borderless a third of the time. That is, a third of all the non-foil Mulldrifters and Rampant Growths you'll open in *Double Masters 2022* Draft Boosters will have the borderless treatment. It's the same with the foils—a third of all the traditional foil Mulldrifters and Rampant Growths you'll open in *Double Masters 2022* Draft Boosters will have the borderless treatment.


Eleven percent of *Double Masters 2022* Draft Boosters contain at least one non-foil borderless rare or mythic rare. It's possible to open two borderless rares or mythic rares, including two mythic rares, in one booster.


Each of the two foil slots in *Double Masters 2022* Draft Boosters has a 1.25% chance of being a traditional foil borderless rare or mythic rare. It's possible to open two borderless rares or mythic rares, including two mythic rares, in one booster.


Each *Double Masters 2022* Collector Booster contains two rare or mythic rare borderless cards—one is non-foil, and one is a traditional foil or a textured foil.


Textured Foil Cards
===================


Five borderless mythic rares have a special textured foil version. These cards are borderless with the same art as their non-foil and traditional foil counterparts but are foiled with a special textured pattern, giving the art some appearance of movement:


![Textured foil Kozilek, Butcher of Truth](https://media.wizards.com/2022/images/daily/tf_kozilek_2x2_3NYwesednW.jpg)


These textured foils are exclusive to *Double Masters 2022* Collector Boosters. Three percent of Collector Boosters contain a textured foil mythic rare. The textured foiling is quite distinctive, but the textured foils also have higher collector numbers than the non–textured foil versions to help tell them apart.


Foil-Etched Cards
=================


Each of the rares and mythic rares in *Double Masters 2022* has a foil-etched version. These foil-etched cards use the same art as their main set counterparts.


![Foil-etched Liliana, the Last Hope](https://media.wizards.com/2022/2x2/en_eQ0T9QOjjd.png)


They are foil etched in what is now *Magic*'s standard approach to foil etching, using a matte frame with a special varnish in the same style as the foil-etched cards in *Commander Legends: Battle for Baldur's Gate*. Each *Double Masters 2022* Collector Booster contains exactly one foil-etched rare or mythic rare.


Cryptic Spires
==============


Cryptic Spires is the first new-to-*Magic* card to appear in a *Masters* set—it's to help smooth out the mana in the Draft format.


![Cryptic Spires](https://media.wizards.com/2022/2x2/en_RNFFTh1jHT.png)


Each *Double Masters 2022* Draft Booster contains exactly one Cryptic Spires. Cryptic Spires is like a checklist card; it doesn't appear in foil, nor does it appear in Collector Boosters. Cryptic Spires is legal in any Commander deck. You can change the colors Cryptic Spires taps for between games at your Preview Event.


Get Ready
=========


Double draft picks. Exciting cards to play. *Double Masters 2022* is twice as nice for any *Magic* fan to dive into. Be there July 1–7 for Preview Events at a [WPN Premium game store near you](https://locator.wizards.com/), then July 8 at [your local game store](https://locator.wizards.com/), [online through Amazon](https://gtly.to/-hdgzSziO), and everywhere else *Magic* is sold.
