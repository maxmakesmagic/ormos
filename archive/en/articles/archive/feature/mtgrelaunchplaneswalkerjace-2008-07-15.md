*Jace Beleren is a planeswalker who wields blue magic. His specialty is mental magic: spells of mind-reading, illusion, knowledge, and deception.*


Curiosity has always gotten the better of Jace Beleren. As a magical prodigy, he delved into lessons of sorcery deeper than the other students in mage academies, and succeeded to the point that even his instructors were suspicious of him. As a specialist in mind magic, he uses his abilities to gaze into the minds of others, discovering even closely guarded secrets. This practice has lead him into danger more than once. In fact, his mind magic has helped him discover the existence of planeswalkers and of worlds beyond his own, opening his eyes to an even greater scope of secrets.


Now that Jace's own planeswalker spark has ignited, his curiosity has begun to take him deep into the Blind Eternities, the chaotic void that holds all the planes of the Multiverse. Jace has finally found a milieu vast enough to satisfy his thirst for knowledge.


Jace now faces the same problem of every exceptional being: the temptations of power. His skills in illusion, mind-reading, and even memory modification have flourished during his travels, and they've helped him gain ever broader access to the secrets he craves. But the deeper he delves, the more he encounters individuals and beings who don't want him prying into their business...and who have the power to stop him. Jace has the potential to rival even these adversaries if he's willing to cast aside the limits of his conscience and embrace the power rising within him. The enemy colors of white and black are like an angel and devil on his shoulders. Will he choose to use his abilities to enrich those he cares about, or to empower only himself? However Jace chooses, the realization of his potential will have a dramatic effect on the Multiverse.
