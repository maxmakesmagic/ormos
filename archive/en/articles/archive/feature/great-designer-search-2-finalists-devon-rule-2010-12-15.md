### Commentary:

In reading the judge responses to Jonathan Woodward's previous submissions, I felt there was a gap between his concept of enlarged creatures as tiny animals raised to human size and intelligence and the audience/judge expectations of enlarged creatures as giant monsters. I wanted to address this discrepancy while staying true to Jonathan's vision. I eventually realized that if bats, rats, and insects were the humanoid races of Golamo, then maybe cats, birds, and hounds could be the gigantic beasts. I expanded this idea into a cycle of abnormally-large common creatures, using a simple mechanical twist suggested by Havelock Vetinari to tie the cycle into Golamo's mechanical themes.

I liked the design of Embodiment of Wisdom/Ophidian Aura in Woodward's Challenge #1 submission, and decided it would be well-suited to a cycle of saboteur+incarnate auras. The gameplay is fun because it creates tension without making either side feel like a missed opportunity. I decided to keep the costs and power/toughness bonus even across the auras to conserve brainspace.

I knew early on that I really wanted to do a set of splashy rare sorceries to represent Golamo's mana geysers. Bradley Rose came up with the "tripling" theme and designed 80% of the cycle himself.

Particular thanks to shdwcat, Pojo, unbroken circle, Havelock Vetinari, Bradley Rose, and especially Jonathan Woodward for giving me such a fun world to play around in.
