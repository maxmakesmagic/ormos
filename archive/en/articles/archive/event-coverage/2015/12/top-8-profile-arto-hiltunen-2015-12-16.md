**Name:** Arto Hiltunen  
**Age:** 24  
**Location:** Helsinki, Finland  
**Occupation:** Manager/Business Intelligence Solutions  
**Played Magic since:** "Ice Age"  
**Best accomplishments:** Top 8 1999 Euros, Finnish Champion 1997 and 1999, Top 16 Pro Tour Paris



**Q: What made you decide to come to Grand Prix Helsinki?**  

A: I love to play at my home city with all the friends also competing.



**Q: What were your expectations going into this tournament, and why?**  

A: I was expecting to make at least top 16, hopefully top 8. I've always done really well in Finland! (Dozen of PTQ wins and two Finnish Championships).



**Q: Briefly describe your tournament play-wise so far, both day one and day two.**  

A: Day one I had a solid deck without gamebreakers, but main reason 7-0 was I managed outplay some opponents. Day two I drafted well staying all day with R/B beatdown and had two awesome decks.



**Q: What do you think about the formats used in this tournament, and what was your strategy?**  

A: I really like the draft format, it's really intensive. And I enjoy a lot playing R/B beatdown. It's really a deck that suits my style of playing.



**Q: What do you think is the main reason for you making top 8 in this tournament, and why?**  

A: Solid drafts and almost flawless play. I don't take other people's picks ever in draft.



**Q: What does this top 8 performance mean to you?**  

A: It's really cool to be back again at the Tour, and it's really great to do that here in Finland.



**Q: What are your predictions for the top 8?**  

A: I'm going to stick with R/B and make it to at least top 4, hopefully my draft will cary me through for victory!
