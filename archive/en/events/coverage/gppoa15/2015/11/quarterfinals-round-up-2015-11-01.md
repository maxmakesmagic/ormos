With so many aggro decks in the Top 8 here at Porto Alegre, the elimination rounds proceeded pretty quickly! Regardless, we don't want you to miss out on any of the action!


Here's a quick summary from each of the Quarterfinals. No frills! Just the gist of it!


Quarterfinals 1: Thiago Saporito (White-Green Hexproof Auras) VS Vagner William Casatti (Naya Burn)
===================================================================================================


### Game 1


After a mulligan to five, Saporito was forced to keep a hand of four lands and a single [Ethereal Armor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ethereal+Armor). Casatti punished mercilessly with [Grim Lavamancer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grim+Lavamancer) and [Eidolon of the Great Revel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eidolon+of+the+Great+Revel), while Saporito failed to draw any of his 11 Hexproof creatures, a bunch of Auras stranded. Naturally, things didn't go very well for Saporito and he was quickly down one game.


### Game 2


It seemed like Saporito's luck ran dry and was forced to mulligan to five once more. He ended up keeping a hand with [Silhana Ledgewalker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Silhana+Ledgewalker), [Path to Exile](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Path+to+Exile), [Hyena Umbra](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hyena+Umbra) and two lands. However, without the Lifelinking Auras, Casatti was once again able to run over Saporito with the help of [Goblin Guide](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Guide) and [Eidolon of the Great Revel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eidolon+of+the+Great+Revel). When Casatti presented the game-winning [Boros Charm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Boros+Charm), Saporito extended his hand.

Quarterfinals 2: Caio Amaral (Bant Zoo) VS Guilherme Merjam (Living End)
========================================================================


### Game 1


Merjam was forced to mulligan, and quickly faced assault by double [Wild Nacatl](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Nacatl). Those were swept with [Living End](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Living+End), netting Merjam a pair of [Deadshot Minotaur](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deadshot+Minotaur)s and [Monstrous Carabid](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Monstrous+Carabid) which he had cycled earlier.


[Retreat to Coralhelm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Retreat+to+Coralhelm) enabled Amaral to smooth his future draws, and that found him [Knight of the Reliquary](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Knight+of+the+Reliquary), which Merjam had no solution to. Untapped unopposed, Amaral proceeded to go through all the lands in his deck before tapping down the opposing team to win with a 20/20 [Knight of the Reliquary](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Knight+of+the+Reliquary)!


### Game 2


[Noble Hierarch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Noble+Hierarch) enabled an early [Geist of Saint Traft](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Geist+of+Saint+Traft). After cycling a couple of creatures, Merham “pulled the trigger” to create a formidable team while killing his opponent's. Amaral's life total plummeted and was forced to trade away most of his creatures, leaving behind only [Knight of the Reliquary](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Knight+of+the+Reliquary) to race against a 4/4 [Simian Spirit Guide](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Simian+Spirit+Guide) (enhanced by [Jund Charm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jund+Charm)). When he presented a creature to chump, a second [Jund Charm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jund+Charm) from Merjam cleared it out of the way, killing Amaral who was at exactly 4 life.


### Game 3


Amaral led with [Wild Nacatl](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Nacatl) and [Thalia, Guardian of Thraben](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thalia%2C+Guardian+of+Thraben), setting back the back-breaking [Living End](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Living+End) by two turns. Merjam used the “forced vacation” to cycle [Architects of Will](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Architects+of+Will), [Street Wraith](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Street+Wraith) and [Deadshot Minotaur](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deadshot+Minotaur). When Amaral added [Scavenging Ooze](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scavenging+Ooze) to the board, Merjam cleared them away with [Jund Charm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jund+Charm).


However, Amaral had the replacement Thalia, which meant that Merjam will need to reach five mana before he could “do his thing”. Stuck on just four mana and facing a lethal clock, Merjam extended the hand.

Quarterfinals 3: Marcos Paulo De Jesus Freitas (Naya Zoo) VS Diego Marquez (Green-Red Tron)
===========================================================================================


### Game 1


De Jesus Freitas opened with [Noble Hierarch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Noble+Hierarch) and [Voice of Resurgence](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Voice+of+Resurgence), which Marquez cleared away with [Pyroclasm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyroclasm). That didn't stop him from taking a few hits from the Elemental token, as well as a 4/4 [Scavenging Ooze](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scavenging+Ooze), eating up fallen comrades.


However, that wasn't quite enough pressure and Marquez soon assembled the Urzatron wiped the board with [Ugin, the Spirit Dragon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ugin%2C+the+Spirit+Dragon). Long story short, De Jesus Freitas found no way to answer the mighty Planeswalker.


### Game 2


De Jesus Freitas claimed Game 2 quicker than they could sideboard and shuffle up. Slamming [Blood Moon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Moon) on the board on turn three, it slowed Marquez to a crawl, practically shutting him out. [Collected Company](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Collected+Company) hitting [Magus of the Moon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Magus+of+the+Moon) added insult to injury.


### Game 3


De Jesus Freitas had the perfect foil to [Oblivion Stone](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oblivion+Stone) by jamming it with [Stony Silence](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stony+Silence). This allowed both his [Wild Nacatl](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Nacatl)s and [Voice of Resurgence](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Voice+of+Resurgence) to run wild. With [Sylvan Scrying](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sylvan+Scrying), Marquez completed his “set”, which enabled him to cast the [Wurmcoil Engine](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wurmcoil+Engine) he found with [Ancient Stirrings](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ancient+Stirrings).


If De Jesus Freitas had the [Path to Exile](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Path+to+Exile), it would be over. He didn't and could only plop the remaining two cards in his hand onto the board, [Noble Hierarch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Noble+Hierarch) and [Knight of the Reliquary](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Knight+of+the+Reliquary). Marquez could smell victory, dropping [Karn Liberated](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Karn+Liberated) to stabilize.


However, [Path to Exile](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Path+to+Exile) turned the tables, allowing De Jesus Freitas to attack for lethal! What a crazy topdeck!

Quarterfinals 4: Gabriel Fehr (Blue-Red Twin) VS Alejandro Cesa (Naya Burn)
===========================================================================


### Game 1


Promptly killing Cesa's [Wild Nacatl](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Nacatl) with [Lightning Bolt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt), Fehr smoothened his draws with [Serum Visions](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Serum+Visions). [Goblin Guide](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Guide) was the follow-up which was toasted by [Snapcaster Mage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snapcaster+Mage) flashing back [Lightning Bolt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt).


After taking a mountain of damage from [Lava Spike](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lava+Spike), [Lightning Bolt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt) and [Rift Bolt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rift+Bolt), Cesa's grip of double [Atarka's Command](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Atarka%27s+Command) looked very effective against Fehr's fragile life total, but [Spell Snare](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spell+Snare) could only keep one of them in check. Despite Fehr's best efforts, he was burned to a crisp before he could assemble the combo.


### Game 2


After [Serum Visions](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Serum+Visions), Fehr dropped [Grim Lavamancer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grim+Lavamancer) on turn two. Countering [Lightning Bolt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt) with [Dispel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dispel), that didn't stop him from getting one hit from [Wild Nacatl](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Nacatl) and [Monastery Swiftspear](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Monastery+Swiftspear). Fehr killed both of them with [Roast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Roast), and a [Grim Lavamancer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grim+Lavamancer) activation.


However, the damage was done and Fehr had no solution to the [Eidolon of the Great Revel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eidolon+of+the+Great+Revel) that was presented. Down to just six life, Fehr was forced to fire [Electrolyze](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Electrolyze) at the Eidolon. Cesa saved it with [Atarka's Command](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Atarka%27s+Command), giving it +1/+1 while dealing three to Fehr, putting him at 1 life. Having no second card in the graveyard to activate [Grim Lavamancer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grim+Lavamancer) with, he should have been happy to draw [Desolate Lighthouse](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Desolate+Lighthouse). However, when he tapped out to “loot”, Cesa revealed the [Boros Charm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Boros+Charm) to the roar of the crowd!
