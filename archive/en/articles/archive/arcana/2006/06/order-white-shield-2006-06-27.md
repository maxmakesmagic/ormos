Lucilde Fiksdotter is the leader of the Order of the White Shield, an elite cadre of Kjeldoran knights who fought the forces of the necromancer Lim-Dûl. Lucilde herself was quoted in the flavor text of several *Ice Age* and *Alliances* cards—her words carried inspiration to all her knights in the long winter before Freyalise's thawing World Spell.

You'll see more from the [Order of the White Shield](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Order+of+the+White+Shield), from their ally King Darien, and from the shadowy agents of Stromgald, at the [*Coldsnap* prerelease](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/events/prereleases). A host of dangers, including the Rimewind mage Heidar, the madman who wants to end the Thaw and ring in the dawn of a new ice age, present many opportunities for the White-Shielders to ride into righteous combat again.

Lucilde Fiksdotter may actually be depicted here, on the *Ice Age* art of [Order of the White Shield](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Order+of+the+White+Shield).
