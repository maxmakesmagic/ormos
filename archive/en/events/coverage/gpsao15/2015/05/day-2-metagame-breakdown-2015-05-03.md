Day 2 of Grand Prix São Paulo has begun, and we've got a metagame breakdown of what the field looks like here today.


The Top Three Decks
===================




| Deck archetype | Number of players (percentage of metagame) |
| --- | --- |
| U/B(/W) Dragons | 21 (16%) |
| Red Aggro | 20 (15%) |
| Abzan Aggro | 17 (13%) |

Some quick notes:


* Out of the 21 Dragon Control players, 19 of them were on Esper and 2 were on straight Blue/Black.
* Out of the 20 Red Aggro players, 13 splashed green for Atarka's Command and 7 stayed mono-color.
* The set of Abzan Aggro players includes Willy Edel's Aggro-Morph hybrid.

The Next Tier of Decks
======================




| Deck archetype | Number of players (percentage of metagame) |
| --- | --- |
| R/G Dragons | 12 (9%) |
| Abzan Control/Megamorph | 11 (8%) |
| G/W Company | 9 (7%) |
| Sidisi-Whip | 7 (5%) |
| Bant Megamorph | 7 (5%) |
| Green Devotion | 5 (4%) |
| Bant Heroic | 5 (4%) |

The Abzan category consists of 6 control decks without a graveyard recursion engine and 5 midrange decks with [Den Protector](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Den+Protector) and [Deathmist Raptor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deathmist+Raptor).


This is a lot of decks already, and we haven't even gotten to the less-represented archetypes yet. All of this indicates that Standard's diversity is holding up strong.


The Less Popular Decks
======================




| Deck archetype | Number of players (percentage of metagame) |
| --- | --- |
| Jeskai | 3 (2%) |
| RG Megamorph | 2 (2%) |
| WUBG Midrange | 1 (1%) |
| W/R Aggro/Control | 1 (1%) |
| UW Control | 1 (1%) |
| Temur Aggro | 1 (1%) |
| RB Dragons | 1 (1%) |
| Mono-Red Dragons | 1 (1%) |
| Mono-Blue Ensoul Devotion | 1 (1%) |
| Mardu | 1 (1%) |
| Jeskai Tokens | 1 (1%) |
| Jeskai Ascendancy combo | 1 (1%) |
| Grixis Dragons | 1 (1%) |
| G/R Aggro | 1 (1%) |
| Chromantiflayer | 1 (1%) |
| BW Warriors | 1 (1%) |

We've already covered some of these brews, such as [Nicholas Damian's Mono Blue Ensoul Devotion](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/gpsao15/nicholas-damians-mono-blue-ensoul-devotion-2015-05-02) yesterday, but we'll have more decklists and more deck techs later today!
