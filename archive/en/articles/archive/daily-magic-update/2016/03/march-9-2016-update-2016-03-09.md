The Daily *Magic* Update is a roundup of everything *Magic* you should know on March 9, 2016. Today's Update is brought to you by [cheering on your local favorites](https://www.facebook.com/FlipSideGaming/posts/1067168973345841).


Today's Must
============


1. [Top 10 Card Clusters that Will Rotate out of Standard](http://www.channelfireball.com/articles/top-10-card-clusters-that-will-rotate-out-of-standard/) | ChannelFireball | Frank Karsten

Looking forward to rotation, but not sure how things will change? Frank Karsten, as usual, does a lot of the heavy lifting for you, detailing the groups of cards—connected by a strategy, archetype, or similarity—that will be rotating out with *Shadows over Innistrad*. He finishes up with an early look at what will be left for post-rotation Standard. So it's pretty much the quintessential rotation-related article.


This also serves as your occasional reminder that *Shadows over Innistrad* starts our new two-block rotation! If you want more detail, check out the article "[Metamorphosis Redux](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/feature/metamorphosis-redux-2015-08-24)" by Mark Rosewater where he details the new rotation.


After That, Read, Watch, Or Listen to These
===========================================


1. [Crapshots Ep327—The New Formats](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8Jy5xx7JBQ) | LoadingReadyRun

I'd listen to Sensei's Divining Talk, possibly the most National Public Radio name possible for a *Magic* show (though I'm willing to accept other suggestions). Crapshots are quick, funny shorts from LoadingReadyRun, and this one is certainly worth your 43 seconds.


<https://www.youtube.com/embed/m8Jy5xx7JBQ>


1. [The Commander Summit #99](http://www.rocketjump.com/listen/11329) | The Command Zone | Jimmy Wong and Josh Lee Kwai

Jimmy and Josh bring in Andy Hull from [Commander's Brew](https://itunes.apple.com/ca/podcast/the-commanders-brew-podcast/id1018124010?mt=2) and Phil DeLucal from the [Commanderin' MTG Podcast](http://www.commanderinmtg.com/) for a Commander Summit. You know, like the title says. On the nose and everything. Anyway, they talk about the state of the format, what they'd do if they were on the rules committee, and then they arm wrestle over who has the best Commander podcast. Probably. I can't actually see what they're doing because, ya know, podcast.


1. [*Shadows over Innistrad* and Patreon Deck Doctor...LIVE!](http://www.rocketjump.com/listen/11325) | Masters of Modern | Alex Kessler and Ben Bateman

The Masters of Modern host a live podcast (and record it for you to listen later), featuring Innistrad talk, a Deck Doctor segment, and Mayan culture (not at all).


1. [CMDR VS: A Special Request](http://www.starcitygames.com/article/32538_CMDR-VS-A-Special-Request.html) | StarCityGames.com | Justin Parnell and Stephen Green

It's the season finale of Commander VS, and Justin and Stephen use it to honor a viewer who...well, you'll just have to watch. It's pretty touching.


There will also be Commander. In this case, [Savra, Queen of the Golgari](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Savra%2C+Queen+of+the+Golgari) faces off with [Trostani, Selesnya's Voice](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Trostani%2C+Selesnya%27s+Voice), [Mayael the Anima](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mayael+the+Anima), and [Reaper King](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reaper+King).


The Top 25
==========


1. Winners Move Up

It's a fact of the Top 25 that winning is better, and our winners proved that this week as almost all of our risers were Top 8 competitors this past weekend. Jason Chung and Kentaro Yamamoto were the big winners, each moving up six spots to 15th and 18th, respectively, after their Top 8 performances at [Grand Prix Melbourne](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/gpmel16). Fabrizio Anteri, who finished 5th in [Bologna](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/gpbol16), also moved up two spots to crack the Top 10. Alexander Hayne also moved up two spots after finishing 16th in [Detroit](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/gpdet16), while Mike Sigrist moved up two as well after finishing 24th.


Meanwhile, the top three spots remain solidly locked with Owen, Paulo, and Seth a step—or, in Owen's case, sixteen steps—ahead of the crowd. Paul Reitzl holds at No. 4, but his lead over Hayne is narrow.


This weekend we've got [Grand Prix Washington, D.C.](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/premierplay/grandprix/fact-sheet-gpdc16), a team format that often rewards the best players pairing up with the best players. So could we see a revolution in the Top 25? Only if they win.

What People Are Talking About

1. [Siege Rhino Rotation Timer](http://www.timeanddate.com/countdown/generic?iso=20160408T00&p0=171&msg=Siege+Rhino+Rotation&ud=1&font=cursive&csz=1)

Because it's never too soon to start counting down till [Siege Rhino](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Siege+Rhino) rotates.

Thought I'd touch on this one since it also spawned a [Reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/49mkdg/soi_full_art_lands_in_fat_packs/), though most people correctly sussed out that it was a copy-paste error—which it was. The [*Shadows over Innistrad* product page](http://magic.wizards.com/en/content/shadows-over-innistrad-paper) (did you know those existed?!) has been corrected.


Community Spotlight
===================


1. [Freshly Brewed](http://freshlybrewed.libsyn.com/) | Frank Lepore and Ali Aintrazi

We Franked yesterday, so I figured we'd Frank again. It helps that Freshly Brewed—a podcast from Frank and Ali Aintrazi—pushed [a new episode yesterday](http://freshlybrewed.libsyn.com/freshly-brewed-episode-32-spoilers-over-innistrad-part-1), but we also haven't featured their podcast yet. Freshly Brewed is a somewhat-weekly produced podcast that focuses on brewing new decks, being creative, and doing Frank and Ali things. It's certainly worth checking out to see if you want to add it to your *Magic* podcast rotation.


Deck of the Day
===============


1. [Black-Green Eldrazi in Standard](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/mtgo-standings/standard-constructed-league-2016-03-08)

Even as we near rotation, it doesn't seem like innovation in Standard is anywhere near slowing down. Today's offering comes to us from Nartian323, who took a bunch of Eldrazi and packed them around some black and green cards. We've seen Abzan Eldrazi a bit lately, but Nartian decided he didn't need white, letting him skip most of the pain lands and play lands such as [Sea Gate Wreckage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sea+Gate+Wreckage), [Rogue's Passage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rogue%27s+Passage), and [Tomb of the Spirit Dragon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tomb+of+the+Spirit+Dragon). He's also adapted, like many, [Hedron Crawler](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hedron+Crawler), which is quickly becoming the colorless ramp creature of choice.
