### You, **Magic**, and **Magic Online**


**How long have you played Magic?**  

I've played on and off for over twelve years, but only in extremely low-key kitchen table settings. In the last eight months, I've tried to truly learn the game: drafting, Standard, following tournaments, etc.


**What is the first set you remember from Magic?**  
*Ice Age*! I played before that set, but the imagery from the set has always stuck with me (particularly the art for the snow-covered lands).


**How did you learn to play Magic, or who taught you?**  

When I was young, I learned the game via a mix of my 6th-grade buddies and the instruction manual. As a result, I had wildly incorrect understandings, each of which was slowly undone over my thirteen years of playing with new people, lol. That said, my friend Case Kiyonaga (of *Legends of the Five Rings* fame) has been teaching me how to play well. He watches most of my drafts and critiques my decisions and soon will be helping me learn Standard.


**How long have you played Magic Online?**  

Seven months (started in June 2012!)


**Do you stream? If so, what's your channel URL?** <http://www.twitch.tv/day9tv> (Mostly *StarCraft*, but soon **Magic** drafts too!)


**How often do you draft on Magic Online?**  

At least five times a week or so. :D I love drafting!


**How often do you play Constructed on Magic Online?**  

I've never played Constructed. I'm drafting to build my collection and soon I'll be sparring away! :D


**Do you play any casual formats on Magic Online?**   

I'm a total try hard. Despite my lack of skill, I will valiantly try to gobble up all the rating points!


### Your Favorites


**Favorite formats to play on Magic Online:**   

Drafting!


**Favorite draft format:**  

I love 3x RTR drafts, but tripleâ€“*New Phyrexia* was extremely fun too. Phyrexian mana made for very interesting splashes and drafting decisions.


**Favorite Magic Card:**  
[Wolfir Silverheart](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wolfir+Silverheart). I love the art and having an 8/8 on turn five feels amazing.


**Favorite piece of Magic art:**   
[Wurmcoil Engine](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wurmcoil+Engine).


**Favorite Planeswalker card:**  
[Gideon Jura](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gideon+Jura). He's has the coolest Planeswalker name to me. So fun to say. :D


### *Return to Ravnica*


**What do you think of *Return to Ravnica*?**   

It's incredibly fun to draft! Also, the new cards have made the Standard format super interesting. There seems to be a huge variety of deck builds.


**Did you play during the original *Ravnica*?**  

I tragically didn't. :[


**Favorite guild to draft in *Return to Ravnica*?**   

Golgari, although I don't draft it very much. If I can snatch up a few [Axebane Guardian](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Axebane+Guardian)s and [Trestle Troll](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Trestle+Troll)s, there's no better feeling than casting some enormous seven-drops on turn five.


**What's your favorite non-rare first pack first pick in *Return to Ravnica* draft?**   
[Stab Wound](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stab+Wound). That card does SO much damage. There needs to be a ticker on **Magic Online** of the global amount of damage [Stab Wound](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stab+Wound) has done to players. It might exceed the national debt.


### Silly Questions


**If you were to get a **Magic** tattoo (or already have one) what would it be?**   

I'd tattoo a [Wingcrafter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wingcrafter) on my arm. When I'm at the club, all the hotties will come up and say "Oooh what's the tattoo all about?" I'd reply, "I'm looking for a hunny to soulbond with. Join me, and you'll feel like you can fly."


**If you could play Magic against anyone, who would it be and why?**  

I'd want to play my *StarCraft* idol Jaedong in a one-on-one. I'll never beat him in *StarCraft*, so hopefully we can spar in **Magic** and, afterwards, I can tell everyone how much awesomer I am. And, if I lose, I can just claim that I drew poorly. The important thing about my hypothetical fantasy is that I have excuses in advance.


**If you could play Magic Online against any villain AI from the movies, which would it be?**  

I'm a nerd so I'm going to choose an AI from video games. I'd play against LINC from  [*Beneath a Steel Sky*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beneath_a_Steel_Sky) . I really, really hated the character, so I'd like any opportunity to bash him down.
