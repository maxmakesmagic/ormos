Both of them had three byes, and they were looking for a win in their first match of the day. Summersberger was with CounterSliver, while Tony had chosen a rather unusual deck - Obliterwhat. Based on Zvi Mowshowitz's Turboland deck, Obliterwhat was developed by "CoolGuy" on IRC. He added Obliterates to the deck, which enhanced it tremendously, and since then, David Williams played it to finish ninth at Grand Prix Phoenix.



**Game 1**


CounterSliver isn't the best match-up for Obliterwhat though, and Tony also had to mulligan once after drawing an opening hand that held only two lands, a Mountain and a Taiga. He had an Oath, but he didn't know what Helmut was playing, and so he chose to mulligan. His second hand was better, it held three lands and a couple of spells, including an Obliterate, and Tony chose to keep it.



Helmut played a turn one Flood Plains, while Tony dropped an Island. The Austrian then fetched an Underground Sea and played a Gemstone Mine. He then Duressed Tony, who held a Time Warp, the Obliterate, a Counterspell, an Undiscovered Paradise, a Taiga and a Volcanic Island. The Counterspell ended up in Tony's graveyard, and Helmut passed priority. Tony then played the Volcanic Island.



During his third turn, Helmut played his first Sliver, a Hibernation Sliver. Tony Impulsed during his end of turn step and got an Exploration, which he then played. Helmut dropped a Tropical Island, and then he attempted to cast a Muscle Sliver, but Tony had a Counterspell for it. The Hibernation Sliver took Tony down to 18 though, and Helmut then summoned a Crystalline Sliver.



Tony found himself under pressure, and he needed lands to get to eight lands so that he could cast his Obliterate. He played an Island and an Undiscovered Paradise, and then he Time Warped, gaining an extra turn. The extra turn gave him a Treetop Village, and he also re-played the Undiscovered Paradise. But he had only six lands, and the only card in his hand was the Obliterate.



Helmut wanted more offense. He attacked with the two slivers on the table, and then he cast another Crystalline Sliver and another Hibernation Sliver. Tony drew and cast a Scroll Rack, but with only one card in hand, things didn't look too good for him.



During his sixth turn, Helmut Consulted for a Muscle Sliver, which went through. The attack took Tony down to two life. The Englishman Scroll Racked for one, got an Impulse and cast it, taking the Obliterate. Then he drew. Only a Gush could save him as he would then get enough lands in play to cast the Obliterate, but he drew something else and conceded.



Summersberger 1 - Dobson 0



**Game 2**


Summersberger sideboarded in a lot of hate. Four Annuls, one Seal of Cleansing, two Dwarven Miner and three Pyroblast went into his deck. Dobson, on the other hand, added Pyroblasts and two Spike Weaver to his deck. He also opted to play first in the second game.



Tony's opening hand was decent, it included lands, an Impulse and a Crater Hellion. Helmut drew two lands, Force of Will, three slivers and a Seal of Cleansing, and he kept as well. Tony then played Volcanic Island, Taiga, Exploration. Unfortunately, Helmut had drawn an Annul, and he countered the Exploration. He also cast a Hibernation Sliver, but his Muscle Sliver was Counterspelled.



Tony Impulsed to try and find something useful, while Helmut continued playing slivers. He got out a Muscle Sliver, and the Hibernation Sliver grew big and took Tony down to 15. Tony Impulsed again, but got nothing but another Impulse when he really needed a Spike Feeder or a Spike Weaver to stop the Sliver assault while saving up mana and some countermagic to get the Hellion onto the table. He had a Horn of Greed though, and cast it to try and draw into the cards he needed.



Helmut had the upper hand though. During his own turn, he attacked to bring Tony down to ten. Then he cast Duress, and Tony revealed his hand that contained the Hellion, an Undiscovered Paradise, a Pyroblast and the Impulse. Helmut didn't know what to do though. He thought for five minutes before finally choosing the Pyroblast. His hand at that point contained a Seal of Cleansing, an Acidic Sliver and two Force of Wills, and he was afraid of Tony's spikes. So he chose to take the Pyroblast to make sure that a Spike would not get on the table if Tony were to draw one.



The choice was indeed pretty tough. If he had let Tony have the Pyroblast, the Englishman could have Pyro'd the Hibernation Sliver and drawn a Spike Feeder. Knowing that Tony had the Hellion in his hand, Helmut wouldn't be able to afford using his two Force of Wills to kill it. So the Feeder could have blocked and killed the Muscle Sliver, and Tony would get to eleven life as well and gain a lot of time to draw into something. After figuring that out, Helmut played Acidic Sliver and ended his turn.



So Tony got to Impulse, but he didn't really get anything useful - out of three lands and an Oath, he chose the Oath. A Gush could actually have given him the victory as he would then be able to cast a Hellion and maybe draw into a Counterspell or a Pyroblast - or possibly a Force of Will and another blue card. But that didn't happen, and when he cast the Hellion, it was Force of Willed. Summersberger then attacked with all his Slivers and finished Dobson off by sacrificing one of them to activate the Acidic Sliver's ability.



**Final Result:** Helmut Summersberger 2 - Tony Dobson 0
