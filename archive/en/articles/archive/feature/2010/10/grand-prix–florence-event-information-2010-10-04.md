### Artist Information

**Rob Alexander**

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/gpbru10/artist_alexander.jpg) Rob Alexander is a Canadian-born artist who has spent the past 18 years working primarily in the publishing and gaming industries. He has written and illustrated two books: "Welcome to My Worlds", a collection of his work released by Paper Tiger, and "Drawing and Painting Fantasy Landscapes and Cityscapes", an art instruction book from Quarto in the UK and Barron's in the USA. A third book, also from Quarto / Barron's, which focuses on architecture for the fantasy artist is currently in production and will be released late in 2010. He has also done conceptual art and world design work for the likes of Sony, Microsoft, Hasbro, Nickelodeon and Warner Bros.

**Greg Staples**

**Raymond Swanland**

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/gpflo10/artist_swanland.jpg)Ever since his formative years in the sprawling cities of Southern California, Raymond Swanland has been exploring worlds of the imagination through his art. Inspired by artists ranging from Caravaggio to H. R. Giger, he has been drawn to create work both dark in subject and visceral in style.

Shortly out of high school, Raymond had the great fortune to start his professional art career with the video game company *Oddworld Inhabitants*. That job, which ranged from conceptual and character design to cinematic art direction, turned into a career that spanned all four Oddworld video games over eight years, from 1997 to 2005. 

In addition to his career with Oddworld, Raymond gradually launched a freelance illustration career starting in 2001 with the covers for the Korean manhwa Priest (soon to be a feature film). From there, he’s gone on to work primarily in books (WotC, TOR, Nightshade, Pyr) as well as comics (Dark Horse), advertising, and album covers. This strong foundation in fantasy and sci-fi illustration ultimately led him to be invited to join the many creative talents of the **Magic: The Gathering**  card game, for which he has created nearly 40 pieces to help flesh out the rich and expansive universe, including [Arid Mesa](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arid+Mesa), [Bituminous Blast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bituminous+Blast), [Vampire Nocturnus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vampire+Nocturnus), [Violent Ultimatum](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Violent+Ultimatum), [Obsidian Fireheart](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Obsidian+Fireheart), [Vengevine](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vengevine+)  and [Wurncoil Engine](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wurncoil+Engine).

Raymond currently lives in the Hawaiian Islands, where he occasionally allows the primordial natural beauty pull him away from his artistic endeavors.

**Volkan Baga**

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/gpflo10/artist_baga.jpg)Volkan Baga is a contemporary painter with a preference for the traditional techniques of oil painting. His style leans towards academic realism, which in turn is orientated on the art of the antique. This influence is reflected in the historical character of Volkan's paintings. Although the content of his works borders on the fantastic, Volkan wants to be seen as a classical painter. 

In works like in **Magic: The Gathering**, Volkan succeeds in visualizing actual topics of fantasy with masterly charm. His motifs carry off into foreign worlds and allow the viewers to immerse themselves in the mystical atmosphere. 

Volkan's stylistic approach is based on old historical paintings, combined with his penchant for the fantastic. In his work, the content moves to the centre of the painting and becomes a narrative representation. 

Volkan lives in Würzburg, Germany. He created the artwork for [Elspeth, Knight Errant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elspeth%2C+Knight+Errant), [Ranger of Eos](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ranger+of+Eos), [Mox Diamond](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mox+Diamond+)  from *From The Vault: Relics*  and [Mindslaver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mindslaver+)  and [Mox Opal](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mox+Opal+)  from *Scars of Mirrodin*.
