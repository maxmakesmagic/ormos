![Dawn's Reflection](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Dawn%27s+Reflection)[Dawn's Reflection](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dawn%27s+Reflection) is a green enchant land spell in *Fifth Dawn* that greatly increases a land's mana output and gives it the ability to make all five colors of mana.

In flavor terms, the concept behind this card is that all the surfaces of the enchanted land become reflective, like chrome. This allows the five suns of Mirrodin to be reflected, infusing the land with multicolored mana.

In the art by John Avon below, you can see twisting trees of the Tangle forest affected by this enchantment. Even the forest floor has a chrome finish, reflecting two of the Mirrodin suns.
