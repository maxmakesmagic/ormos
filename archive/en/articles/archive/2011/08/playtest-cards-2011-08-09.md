Hey there! We've got some playtest cards here, and we thought it might be fun to show them to you. It's an exciting look into the process of making **Magic** cards. It's also an exciting look into Monty's desk!


These four cards came from four different sets: *Champions of Kamigawa, Eventide, Ravnica: City of Guilds,* and *Time Spiral*. Can you guess which cards these playtest cards became? Click on each card to find out.

"CQI" stands for "Continuous Quality Improvement." On playtest cards, it means "Somebody will think of something for this card to do later." That part about slivers considering themselves warned probably doesn't mean anything. This card was from *Time Spiral*, so it might have ended up as [Venser's Sliver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Venser%27s+Sliver). But the playtest card was for an uncommon slot, so maybe it was [one of these](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?action=advanced&subtype=+%5B%22Sliver%22%5D&set=%7C%5B%22Time%20Spiral%22%5D&rarity=%7C%5BU%5D).
