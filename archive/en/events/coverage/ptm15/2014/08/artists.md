One of the highlights of this Pro Tour weekend was a feature well away from the lights and splendor of the show. Two artists arrived Friday, committed to working on an art project that can be best described as unique.



 Eric Deschamps and Cynthia Sheppard, talented illustrators in *Magic* for years, joined Pro Tour *Magic*2015 to embark on a journey with Garruk. Collaborating on a creating a new piece of art with Garruk doesn't sound very exciting until you know the rest: A wheel of things to be added or taken out of the art was on hand, and spectators would spin the wheel to change the artwork live.



The end result was a unique piece of art, filled with mundane and nonsensical things, to be made into ten exclusive play mats or prints given away. It was one of the many ways all weekend that spectators could participate and win without being a Pro Tour participant.


Collaboration, let alone adapting to changes, was the first obstacle Sheppard and Deschamps had to overcome. "This is the first time and I was really excited about it," Deschamps said. "As an illustrator we're always doing stuff by ourselves so it was really nice to work collaboratively. If I was working on a portion of Garruk and got stuck I'd just stop instead of continuing. 'Oh, Cynthia can fix this!' That was real nice: We could take our strengths and weakness and combine them together."
