### Famous Cards

Multiplayer Magic has a level of strategy and fun not found in a standard two-player game. Cards that are dangerous in a two-player game become downright NASTY in multiplayer.


That's why we've included famous multiplayer cards in our decks like Wrath of God, Land Tax and Llurgoyf.


If it's a classic multiplayer card then chances are it's in one of these decks.
