Once worthy of [guarding Wizards of the Coast](/en/articles/archive/face-game-2008-04-07) itself, the Minotaur seems to be having a bad decade.


Here we see our Greek friend absorbing four:

The lesson is clear: Mamas, don't let your babies grow up to be Minotaurs.


**Core Set Survivor!**There are exactly sixteen cards that have been in every core set from *Alpha* to *Tenth Edition*. When ***Magic** 2010* comes out, only *eight* cards will have been in every core set. Over the weeks before the ***Magic** 2010* prerelease, we'll be counting them down in this special Arcana sub-feature, giving you an "IN" or "OUT" on one card a day. Step forward, [Drudge Skeletons](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Drudge+Skeletons).
