Day-by-Day Breakdown
--------------------


#### Day One


* Stage 1 (3 Rounds) - *Guilds of Ravnica* Team Sealed Deck
* Stage 2 (Up to 4 Rounds) - Team Unified Standard Constructed
* 12 *Guilds of Ravnica* boosters per team will be used for Team Sealed Deck
* Standard deck lists must be submitted through the online decklist submission tool provided to all competitors via email by Wednesday, December 12 at 11:59 p.m. local time

32 teams in total will advance into Day Two.


* Once a team reaches four wins before Round 7 on Day One, they will automatically advance into Day Two and are finished playing for that day
* The remaining 32 teams will be comprised of the top finishing teams based on the standings at the end of Round 7

#### Day Two


The format for Day Two is Team Unified Standard. There are no draws in Day Two. Each team will have 60 minutes to successfully complete a match. Once a team has two teammates win a match, that team wins. In the event time is called and there is no conclusion to the match yet:


* The team with the most match wins after extra turns wins the match for the round.
* In the event of a tied score between teams at 1-1, the deciding match will be determined by game count at the end of extra turns.
* In the event the deciding match's game count is tied, the player with the highest life total wins the match, which then wins that player's team the match.
* In the event the team match count, game count, and life totals are tied at the end of extra turns, the first change in life total will result in the player whose life total is higher after said change winning the match for their team.
* In the event the game count becomes tied in extra turns, and a third game needs to be played, the match will be decided by the first change in life total, with the player whose life total is higher after said change winning the match for their team.

Teams will use the same Standard decks from Day One for both stages of Day Two.


Day Two consists of two stages. Both are modified double-elimination.


**Stage 1 (3 Rounds)**


* 32 teams compete in seeded pools (8 pools of 4 teams each).
* Teams are seeded in the Stage 1 pools based on total wins from Day One. In the event a team was automatically advanced to Day Two, those rounds that the team did not play count as a win. Teams that automatically advanced to Day Two after round 4 will be seeded first, then those teams that automatically advanced to Day Two after Round 5 will be seeded next, and so on.
* Teams will be paired against other teams within their pools randomly for the first round of the stage.
* The winners of the first round play each other in the second round. The losing teams from the first round play against each other in the second round.
* Once a team wins two matches in their pool, they automatically advance to the next stage. This means that the sole team in each pool that has two wins after two rounds does not play the last round of the stage.
* Once a team loses two matches in their pool, they are automatically eliminated from the tournament.

**Stage 2 (3 Rounds)**


* 16 teams compete in seeded pools (4 pools of 4 teams each).
* Teams are seeded in the Stage 2 pools based on total wins from Day One and Day Two, Stage 1. In the event a team was automatically advanced to another day or another stage, those rounds that the team did not play count as a win.
* Teams will be paired against other teams within their pools randomly for the first round of the stage.
* The winners of the first round play each other in the second round. The losing teams from the first round play against each other in the second round.
* Once a team wins two matches in their pool, they automatically advance to the next stage. This means that the sole team in each pool that has two wins after two rounds does not play the last round of the stage.
* Once a team loses two matches in their pool, they are automatically eliminated from the tournament.

#### Playoffs


* 8 Teams compete in a seeded, single-elimination bracket.
* Teams are seeded in the bracket based on total wins from Day One and Day Two. In the event a team was automatically advanced to another day or another stage, those rounds that the team did not play count as a win.
* Playoff rounds will be Team Unified Standard Constructed.
* Teams will use the same Standard decks from Day One and Day Two.
