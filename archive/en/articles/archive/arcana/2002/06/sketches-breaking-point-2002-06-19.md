This week's Sketches looks at the *Judgment* rare [Breaking Point](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Breaking+Point) from Matthew Wilson, the artist just featured in [Behind the Canvas](/en/articles/archive/behind-canvas-matt-wilson-2002-06-14).

### 1. Art Description

These are the instructions given to the artist:

"This is a red card and should show Kamahl slamming his sword, with the Mirari attached to the pommel, into the ground. This causes the ground to erupt and sends lava streaming towards a battlefield. See reference for Kamahl."

### 2. Sketch

This is the preliminary sketch submitted by Matt. He was kind enough to label the lava for ease of viewing.

### 3. Final Art

Here is a large version of his final piece. Matt added the fire and energy wrapping around the sword blade.

### 4. Card

Finally, here is the card as you all know it today.
