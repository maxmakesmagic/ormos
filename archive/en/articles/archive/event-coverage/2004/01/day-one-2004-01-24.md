Exactly 400 players have come to Okayama this weekend, with Extended decks in tow looking for tournament glory and a piece of the $25,000 up for grabs. This is the first major Extended tournament since the major bannings that followed Pro Tour New Orleans, and it will be interesting to see how the metagame shapes up. Will the environment slow down, or are there more combo menaces waiting to be unleashed? What sort of powerful, creative decks can we expect out of the Japanese this time around? Stay tuned to live coverage throughout the day as we play out eight rounds to make the cut to day two.
