W[Wild Pair](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Wild%2BPair) is a splashy enchantment from *Planar Chaos* that auto-summons a buddy from your library whenever you play a creature. It’s not just any buddy, however—it has to be a creature of the same total power and toughness. For instance, you could play a simple [Grizzly Bears](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grizzly+Bears), and [Wild Pair](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Pair) could provde anything from [Clockwork Beast](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Clockwork+Beast) to [Avalanche Riders](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Avalanche+Riders), from [Disciple of Tevesh Szat](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Disciple+of+Tevesh+Szat) to [Windreaver](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Windreaver). Handy!

But—a total power/toughness of four? We’re thinking too small here. Check out the card’s art.

Two critters are shown busting out of the aether here: on the left, we have one creature and on the right we have another. Can you recognize them without clicking the links? Here’s a hint: these creatures go to eleven.
