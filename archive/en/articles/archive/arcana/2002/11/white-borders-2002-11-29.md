We've seen posts on some message boards talking about card shops selling white-bordered versions of current cards for exorbitant prices, claiming that they are part of some exclusive box set or something like that. We figured we should let the cat out of the bag.


It's possible to "erase" the border off of a card using transparent tape, a good eraser, and some elbow grease. Just lay the tape inside the border to insure a straight edge and erase until you're blue in the face. The tape peels off easily enough and if you have a steady hand, you can make a black-bordered card white bordered.


Now that you know the trick, don't be fooled!
