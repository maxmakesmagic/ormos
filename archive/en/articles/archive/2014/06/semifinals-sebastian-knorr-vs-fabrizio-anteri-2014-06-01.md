- ### Semifinal - Sebastian Knörr vs. Fabrizio Anteri



*by Tobi Henke*

  

 Fabrizio Anteri had been on a run in recent months. He had placed third at last year's Grand Prix in London, second at Grand Prix Antwerp, and finally had taken home the trophy three weeks ago in Warsaw. Would this be his second Grand Prix title? He had already secured Gold level with his Top 8 here, as well as his spot at the **Magic** World Cup (playing for his country of residence England), and was now looking to go pro.






*Fabrizio Anteri*

  

 Facing him in this semifinal was Sebastian Knörr, an up-and-coming player from Germany, who had managed to qualify for Pro Tour *Journey into Nyx*. While he failed to finish anywhere close to the top at that event, he did gain valuable insight into the Block Constructed format.



At this Grand Prix he was running a mono-black aggro deck he called "horribly underrated." That may well have been true, seeing as he had actually beat every single one of the other players in this Top 4 during the Swiss rounds. Anteri came equipped with a much more common deck in BUG Control.



**Game 1**




 Knörr led with [Gnarled Scarhide](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gnarled+Scarhide) and [Tormented Hero](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tormented+Hero), but had both his [Mogis's Marauder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mogis%27s+Marauder) as well as [Hero's Downfall](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hero%27s+Downfall) discarded by a pair of [Thoughtseize](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtseize)s. However, the early beatdown plus lifeloss took a big bite out of Anteri's lifetotal.

 While Anteri tried to recover with [Courser of Kruphix](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Courser+of+Kruphix), Knörr redoubled his grip on the game with another [Mogis's Marauder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mogis%27s+Marauder) and another [Hero's Downfall](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hero%27s+Downfall) as well as a [Pain Seer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pain+Seer). Anteri went to 10, then 4, then 5 thanks to another [Courser of Kruphix](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Courser+of+Kruphix), then 1, but ultimately he could not stem the tide and lost a rather one-sided first duel.




**Sebastian Knörr 1-0 Fabrizio Anteri**




**Game 2**




 Anteri had boarded in [Silence the Believers](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Silence+the+Believers), [Unravel the Æther](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Unravel+the+%C3%86ther), [Dark Betrayal](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dark+Betrayal), two copies of each of [Drown in Sorrow](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Drown+in+Sorrow) and [Feast of Dreams](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Feast+of+Dreams), altering the balance of the match-up considerably.






*Sebastian Knörr*

  

 And it was a completely different story indeed. [Unravel the Æther](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Unravel+the+%C3%86ther) traded with [Brain Maggot](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brain+Maggot), [Thoughtseize](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtseize) with [Mogis's Marauder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mogis%27s+Marauder), [Feast of Dreams](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Feast+of+Dreams) with [Master of the Feast](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Master+of+the+Feast), [Hero's Downfall](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hero%27s+Downfall) with another [Mogis's Marauder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mogis%27s+Marauder). Knörr never managed to mount a sizeable offense. He did succeed in keeping [Prognostic Sphinx](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Prognostic+Sphinx) and [Reaper of the Wilds](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reaper+of+the+Wilds) off the table, via [Thoughtseize](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtseize) and [Hero's Downfall](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hero%27s+Downfall) respectively, but at some point Anteri could land a [Courser of Kruphix](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Courser+of+Kruphix) and that stuck around.



The Courser recouped about 10 points of life and generated about seven extra cards throughout the game, and it was only a matter of time before further copies of Anteri's larger threats took the game.



**Sebastian Knörr 1-1 Fabrizio Anteri**




**Game 3**




 In an anticlimactic end to the match, Knörr mulliganed into a six-card hand without a single land, then had to keep a less than stellar five: Swamp, [Gnarled Scarhide](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gnarled+Scarhide), [Pain Seer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pain+Seer), [Odunos River Trawler](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Odunos+River+Trawler), [Hero's Downfall](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hero%27s+Downfall). When he finally drew his second Swamp on about turn four, Anteri killed [Scar](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scar)hide plus [Pain Seer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pain+Seer) via [Drown in Sorrow](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Drown+in+Sorrow). And by the time Knörr found his third, [Reaper of the Wilds](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reaper+of+the+Wilds) and [Prognostic Sphinx](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Prognostic+Sphinx) were already poised to take over the game.




**Sebastian Knörr 1-2 Fabrizio Anteri**
