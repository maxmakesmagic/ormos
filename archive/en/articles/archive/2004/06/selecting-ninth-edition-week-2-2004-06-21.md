[Blinding Angel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blinding+Angel) is a beatdown control device and a win condition rolled into one. [Dawn Elemental](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dawn+Elemental) is an efficient combat powerhouse unaffected by damage. Which will you choose to put into *Ninth Edition*?
