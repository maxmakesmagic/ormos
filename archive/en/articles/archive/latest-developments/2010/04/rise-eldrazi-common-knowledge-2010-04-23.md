*Rise of the Eldrazi* Common Knowledge
======================================

Tom LaPille makes things. Some of the things he makes are card sets, like Dark Ascension and Born of the Gods. Sometimes he makes stories, too. Sometimes he makes unexpected things, like 16th-century Japanese clothing. He's probably making something right now. 







Thousands of **Magic** players across the world played in *Rise of the Eldrazi* Prerelease tournaments last weekend. This weekend, many players will play in *Rise of the Eldrazi* Launch Party events. Both of these are Sealed Deck tournaments, and so many of you are getting to know the commons from the new set quite well. Inside **Magic** R&D, we have a very different relationship with **Magic** cards, as we meet them near their earliest conception and watch them grow and change over months of development. Today, I'll give you a glimpse of the time in which we got to know them, and how we changed them into the cards you know now.


The following is a key to the people you're about to read Multiverse comments from.

Stalwart Shield-Bearers

Erik is, of course, referring to Legends (and Masters Edition III) oddball [Kobold Drill Sergeant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kobold+Drill+Sergeant):

Â 

A few people suggested that we remove the second point of toughness gain from [Stalwart Shield-Bearers](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stalwart+Shield-Bearers) and add trample instead, but Matt convinced them otherwise.


Dawnglare Invoker
-----------------


![Dawnglare Invoker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Dawnglare%20Invoker)There is a cycle of five Invokers in *Rise of the Eldrazi*. Each one has an activated ability that costs ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20220908064341im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless8.gif) to activate, and all of these abilities are large-scale abilities that end games. The *Rise of the Eldrazi* design team intended for Limited games to go longer than normal so that the colorless Eldrazi would be showcased, but they also knew that not everyone would have Eldrazi to end games with. The Invokers were built to serve as another way for players to move long games toward an end. Although their intentions were noble, there was a problem with the first ones.



> 
> TML 3/24/2009: These guys should all have bodies that you aren't embarrassed to have in a limited deck. They only help end games if they are in your deck, and they only end up in your deck if they aren't terrible before you hit 8 mana. 2C 2/2 is enough to get in a deck. C 1/1 is not.
> 
> 
> 


Remember the invokers from *Legions*?


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/ld/ld87_3Cards1.jpg)The shtick here is that these are reasonably priced creatures that you aren't unhappy to have in your deck in the early game. Because they are already in your deck thanks to their numbers, when you hit eight mana, you'll start doing cool things. The problem with the first version of the *Rise of the Eldrazi* Invokers is that their numbers weren't good enough. [Dawnglare Invoker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dawnglare+Invoker), for example, was a ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227125855im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/white.gif) 1/1 without flying. Unsurprisingly, no one put that card into Limited decks, which meant that it couldn't help end Limited games.


Designer Ken Nagle, perhaps prompted by the lack of love that the Invokers were getting from playtesters, questioned their existence, pointing out that the *Legions* Invokers don't seem to be popular with casual players. However, Lead designer Brian Tinsman continued to fight for his vision of the Invokers:




|  |  |

Wildheart Invoker
 | 
Bloodrite Invoker

> 
> BT 3/25: This set is dripping with casual friendly stuff already so these don't need to fill that role. They play an important function in allowing locked games to end spectacularly and provide dramatic tension as the player creeps closer to the critical number.
> 
> 
> 


I don't think that at the time they were accomplishing Brian's goals, but that's why we have developers. He was pretty sure that the Invokers as they were could be developed into a good end product, so he let them be until the design handoff.


Once the set was handed off to the development team, the same issue came up again.



> 
> BT 4/13: I like the sense of excitement that the invokers bring when you are getting close to dropping your 8th mana. This new ability reads less powerfully and provides less of that excitement than the others.  
> 
> DB 4/14/2009: I'm not sure it matters what it does, if its body in the meantime is a 1/1 -- doesn't seem like it gets into decks. I may misjudge Prosper limited though.  
> 
> TML 4/20/2009: I still won't play this at C 1/1. I really want to put him in a deck though. Request 2C 2/2, 1C 2/1, something reasonable.
> 
>

Proving that people do actually read Multiverse comments, lead developer Matt Place changed the card to the mana cost and numbers that it was printed at.

It was exciting to see [Dawnglare Invoker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dawnglare+Invoker) and its friends start showing up in Limited decks and ending games.


Shared Discovery
----------------


![Shared Discovery](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Shared%20Discovery)Matt Place loves to draft **Magic** sets over and over, and he knows that it takes depth to make a set fun for him over many replays. Mark Rosewater, also a member of the *Rise of the Eldrazi* development team, loves to build layers of interaction into **Magic** sets. Between the two of them, they worked hard to construct lots of surprise interactions between different *Rise of the Eldrazi* cards.


The Eldrazi Spawn tokens that are such a centerpiece of the set were originally intended to make Eldrazi easier to cast. Neither Matt nor Mark were happy with there being only one thing to do with Eldrazi Spawn, however, so they made a push to add more interactions with them to each color. [Shared Discovery](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shared+Discovery) was added during this pass, and during the same pass [Lavafume Invoker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lavafume+Invoker) gained the ability that it now has.



> 
> TML 5/12/2009: Cards like this and Facebook Friends are making me feel a lot better about my manabots. Nice to see this stuff.  
> 
> AF 5/21: Card I want to build a deck around!  
> 
> GM 6/15: What's stopping you?

Note that our first name for Eldrazi Spawn tokens was "manabots." You'll meet Facebook Friends below.


See Beyond
----------


![See Beyond](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=See%20Beyond)[See Beyond](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=See+Beyond) began life as a different card-drawing spell. I liked what it started as, and I'm not going to tell you what it was because I think we might print it someday. However, that card sparked the following conversation.



> 
> AF 12/17: I like this; I'd like "draw 2, shuffle 1 back in" more.  
> 
> MJG 2/12/2009: The time charge for the reshuffle seems too much for this card. I'd rather the card be discard or put on the bottom.  
> 
> TML 2/27/2009: MT suggested U draw 2, put one on top. I would enjoy that.  
> 
> MP 3/6: I like MT's suggestion, also if we keep this it should be put on bottom not shuffle.  
> 
> AF 3/11: The point of this was "I drew a 14 mana guy, let me hide him for later and get something else." Discard/put on top/put on bottom don't accomplish that as well.  
> 
> MR 4/13/09: While we should crack down on unnecessary shuffling, I agree with Aaron that some shuffling is okay.
> 
> 
> 


We are cautious about the amount of shuffling we put into **Magic**. Moments in which nothing happens for a while slow down games; video games try to minimize load times, and we do the same thing by only including shuffling when the card really wants it. In the case of the *Zendikar* "fetch lands," we knew that players had been clamoring for them for years and that they interacted well with landfall cards. Here, Aaron explains perfectly why the card needs to shuffle: you're just putting the card away for later.


Induce Despair
--------------


![Induce Despair](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Induce%20Despair)[Induce Despair](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Induce+Despair) is a card that we all had way too much fun playing with early on. Part of the fun of *Unglued*'s [Infernal Spawn of Evil](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Infernal+Spawn+of+Evil) is that you get to show off your huge monster early on and threaten what you will do later in the game, and here we got to do that trick again.



> 
> GTH 10/31: I kept choosing to show my 12-mana monster instead of the 4-mana one in my hand that would have done the trick as well. That was a really fun way to show off and have the eldrazi impact the play experience, even if it doesn't get out that game.  
> 
> BT 11/24: Looking for opportunities for more of these.  
> 
> TML 3/24/2009: It is oddly fun to give a creature -14/-14.  
> 
> DB 3/24/2009: ...just until end of turn, though.  
> 
> TML 4/3/2009: That is long enough for me!
> 
> 
> 


Brian's observation that this was fun and the ensuing search for more of this kind of card led to cards like [Explosive Revelation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Explosive+Revelation) and [Living Destiny](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Living+Destiny).

I like working in **Magic** R&D a lot.


Ondu Giant
----------


![Ondu Giant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Ondu%20Giant)[Ondu Giant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ondu+Giant) is pretty much exactly the card you want in *Rise of the Eldrazi* Limited. A ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227130050im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless3.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20220123123600im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/green.gif) 2/4 gets in the way of little creatures, and every land is valuable even late into the game. The defender theme largely fell flat for me, but I enjoyed cards that helped me cast Eldrazi, and [Ondu Giant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ondu+Giant) is about as good at that as anything else in this set. I posted as much in Multiverse.



> 
> TML 5/12/2009: This card is doing the wall thing in a way that is actually fun to me.  
> 
> AF 5/21: By giving you card advantage and letting you attack?  
> 
> TML 5/27/2009: Yes, exactly.
>

As an aside, while I was [playing with *Rise of the Eldrazi* cards](/en/articles/archive/latest-developments/big-and-massive-2010-04-16) two weekends ago, I tweeted this picture of a hand I kept:


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/ld/ld87_thisIsAPicture.jpg)The card that costs ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227130050im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless3.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20220123123600im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/green.gif) is [Ondu Giant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ondu+Giant), which is perhaps the most perfect card I could think of to be the card in this hand that costs ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227130050im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless3.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20220123123600im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/green.gif). I won this game handily.


Might of the Masses
-------------------


![Might of the Masses](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Might%20of%20the%20Masses)
> 
> MP 5/12: Added facebook friends.  
> 
> TML 5/12/2009: This is much, much more natural in play in this set than big small big. I like both existing, but I like this one being common.
> 
> 
> 


Remember Facebook Friends from earlier? You're looking at it now. Big Small Big is, of course, [Prey's Vengeance](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Prey%27s+Vengeance), the other [Giant Growth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Giant+Growth) variant in Rise of the Eldrazi. There was a point in time where both of these were common. I had tons of fun with Big Small Big, but it was also weird enough that I wasn't sure how I felt about it being the common green pump spell of the set. This card felt much more correct to me, and Matt must have agreed, since it's the one he kept at common.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/ld/ld87_break.jpg)I hope you enjoyed meeting all these cards at the *Rise of the Eldrazi* Prerelease last weekend. This weekend's Launch Parties are another chance to meet them, and today the set gets released into the wild. The Eldrazi are rising, and you'd better make sure they annihilate your opponents and not you!
