Green got the lion's share of the kicker mechanic in *Time Spiral* Block. Kicker naturally harmonizes with a color that celebrates the "the more the better" philosophy.


Two of the three of *Time Spiral's* "timeshifted" cards with kicker are green: [Thornscape Battlemage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thornscape+Battlemage) and [Verdeloth the Ancient](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Verdeloth+the+Ancient). Both show off green's mana capabilities well, both in terms of multi-color access and straight-up enormous amounts of mana.

In *Planar Chaos*, mechanics such as kicker were organized along themes for each color. Green's share of the *Planar Chaos* color pie was built around the theme of "growth." Cards like [Harmonize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Harmonize) and [Gaea's Anthem](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gaea%27s+Anthem) showed off a slightly different take on what "growth" could mean, and kicker fit into that theme as well. Green is already the best color at mana acceleration, so a mechanic that rewards having access to large amounts of mana was a natural fit. That's why you see kicker only on green cards in *Planar Chaos*.

In *Future Sight*, kicker shows up as part of mix-and-match cards, where two keywords that have never existed together combine in interesting ways. Kicker works interestingly with convoke, so you can see that combination on [Kavu Primarch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kavu+Primarch). It combines well with the vanishing mechanic when on giant creatures, so that led to [Ravaging Riftwurm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ravaging+Riftwurm). Aside from *Time Spiral's* timeshifted [Desolation Giant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Desolation+Giant), the only non-green *Time Spiral* Block card with kicker is [Molten Disaster](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Molten+Disaster), another mix-and-match card. It combines kicker with the new split second keyword, a combination that made the most sense on a fiery burn spell.
