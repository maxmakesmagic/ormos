The elves of Lorwyn often hunt *eyeblights*, creatures who fail the elves' exacting standards of beauty and therefore have the lowest status in their eyes. But sometimes, instead, they create *vinebred* minions from such creatures. Elves can animate a parasitic plant called *nettlevines* to bind around their victims, creating twisted, but powerful and eminently controllable minions.


In the background of the art of [Elvish Branchbender](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elvish+Branchbender), you can see the elf's victim, a tree that has taken on a twisted life as a result of the nettlevine. Other treefolk would be horrified by such a vinebred creatureâ€”it has not undergone a true *Rising* (the process by which a tree gains sentience and motility to become a treefolk), but is instead an unnatural mockery of a treefolk.

Nettlevine is also, eventually, lethal for the afflicted victim. In the art of [Nettlevine Blight](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nettlevine+Blight), we can see a vinebred treefolk suffering the lethal effects of the controlling vine.

The card [Scarred Vinebreeder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scarred+Vinebreeder) represents what happens to an elf who has afflicted *himself* with nettlevine. The parasitic plant will shorten his lifespan, but in the meantime, he gains immense strength.
