Welcome to another edition of [Sketches](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/fullarchive&tablefilter=sketches)! You know, not all sketches come in the traditional "pencil on paper" format. Some artists, like Jason Chan, deliver color sketches that are closer to a final version. Sometimes, they even give us more than one option!


### 1. Art Description


Here's the original art description for [Wilt-Leaf Liege](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wilt-Leaf+Liege):



> 
> Color: Green and white  
> 
> Location: A stretch of mossy, dead woods lit by elvish lanterns (your design)  
> 
> Action: Show a elvish knight mounted on a [Jelly] version of a cervin (deerlike creature). The elf is armored and armed. Perhaps she has a dog companion who looks up at her as she patrols the perimeter of the elvish haven.  
> 
> Focus: the elf knight  
> 
> Mood: Noble, innocent, earnest
> 
> 
> 


### 2. Sketches


Jason turned in three options for our creative team to choose from:

### 3. Final Art


In the end, Jason took the bottom sketch and filled it out nicely, as you can see.
