Each week we'll post a "comic" made from three random pieces of **Magic** art. Your challenge is to take that comic and finish it off with whatever funny text, thought bubbles, or other dialogue makes it work. 


First off, here's the comic from last week:


![Flint Golem (Nemesis) â€“ Rhystic Study (Prophecy) â€“ Tel-Jilad Lifebreather (Fifth Dawn)](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/activity/60_new.jpg)**And now, here's your winner!**

Congratulations to the winner, PhoenixLAU! Again!


Now, before we get to this week's comic, we're going to mix things up a bit. The next You Make The Comic isn't for two weeks (because of the Thanksgiving Holiday here in the US), so we're going to go a few different ways. First, we've got the usual style:


![Ivory Gargoyle (Alliances) â€“ Abandoned Outpost (Odyssey) â€“ Agent of Stromgald (Alliances)](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/activity/65_new.jpg)  
Next, we've noticed that sometimes just putting a single piece of card art behind the comic frame looks kind of neat. So if you want to try a slightly different comic, have a crack at this:


![Stone Catapult (Portal Three Kingdoms)](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/activity/65_new2.jpg)  
But maybe you're thinking that the comic strip is a dead art form. Maybe you're wishing that we'd shamelessly latch on to an Internet trend. Well, we're pleased to introduce LOLCards! Here's how they work:


![Mwonvuli Ooze (Weatherlight)](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/activity/65_example.jpg)  
Yeah, yeah. "Hilarious", right? Well, I suppose you could do better?


![Blessed Orator (Odyssey)](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/activity/65_new3.jpg)  
Have at it!


See below for complete rules, but the basic idea is that we'll take submissions by email and then post the top contenders for a vote on the message boards Tuesday afternoon, at which point everybody will have 24 hours to vote for their favorite. We invite you to post your comics to the message boards and discuss your favorites, but only submissions sent in to the official email address will be considered for the poll. Next Friday when we come back we'll show the winning comic along with a shout out to the creator, and then post the new comic for the following week.


So here's your chance to show the world just how funny you are. How will this work out? Are we totally crazy? We're not sure, so we'll see how many of you are up to the challenge. 


When you're ready, read the rules and guidelines, and then follow the directions to send in your version of the comic. Remember that the winner gets to be seen here on the site so make sure that whatever you're doing, it's something we can (and want to!) show on the site. 


Get creative, have fun, and check the thread on Tuesday in the special ["You Make the Comic!" forum](http://forums.gleemax.com/forumdisplay.php?f=905) to vote for your favorite!

### Format Rules


Each submission must consist of a copy of the available 3 panel image that has the user's dialogue added to it. 


Each entrant may add dialogue to each panel for their entry. Thought or text bubbles or balloons may be added as well. No other alteration of the art will be accepted except to allow for whatever text you are adding. All comics must be within the guidelines of the [forums code of conduct](http://forums.gleemax.com/community_coc.php) and must be appropriate for showing on the official site.

Any submission that has the art altered in any other way (outside of included text and/or dialogue balloons) will be ineligible. Submissions must also include either your first name or forum name so we can credit you if you make it. You may also include where you're from if you'd like that included should you make the voting or become the winner.
