There's a new feature on our front page, and you'll want to familiarize yourself with it.

Over the next three weeks, we're going to be revealing the contents of *Eighth Edition* – the next Core Set – a few cards at a time. What should you be trading for? What goodies are leaving, at what old favorites are making triumphant returns? What will Standard be like this fall? Tune in each day as we fill you in, piece by piece.

By Friday, June 27, the entire set will be revealed.

Go to the *Eighth Edition* Rollout main page [**here**](http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=mtgcom/8erollout/welcome).

*Eighth Edition* will be released on July 28, 2003. There will be Global Celebration tournaments (a type of prerelease) on July 26-27 worldwide. Stay tuned to MagicTheGathering.com for further details.
