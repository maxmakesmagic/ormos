=====================================

 "You have two of them?! That's so good!" Eric Pei said as he looked over Denis Ulanov's decklist. The card he was talking about [Scouring Sands](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scouring+Sands).



That is the weirdest thing I've heard in a Grand Prix Top 8 for a while. The two Mono-Red players left standing were downright giddy while comparing the each others' decks. Comparing and contrasting. It was like two mono-colored unicorns meeting in a room full of three-color rhinoceroses.



 "I really don't think I can beat that. Two [Scouring Sands](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scouring+Sands) is too good." Pei wasn't just talking about the board-sweeper, but also the [Goblin Rabblemaster](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Rabblemaster). Pei's deck didn't play them at all. That's usually good for a deck aiming to win by turn three or four, but in this attrition-based grinding mirror match (comparatively speaking, of course), the Rabblemasters would shine through.




**The Games**




 This was a funny match. [Firedrinker Satyr](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Firedrinker+Satyr) and [Monastery Swiftspear](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Monastery+Swiftspear)s abounded, and both players were really hesitant to make the first move. Each attack, each spell, was deliberate. Eric Pei was sitting with a handful of burn, while Ulanov had more early creatures. That would prove all the difference.
