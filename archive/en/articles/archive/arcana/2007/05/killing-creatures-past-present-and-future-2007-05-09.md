The temporal themes of the *Time Spiral* Block are played out across a series of common black kill spells. 


*Time Spiral* is full of themes of the past. Premature Burial kills a creature that has come into play a turn ago—a spell that destroys creatures “in the past.”

*Planar Chaos’s* themes are about the alternate present. Cradle to Grave kills a creature that came into play *this* turn—a piece of removal usable only in the immediate present.

*Future Sight* is all about the future. Grave Peril isn’t an instant or sorcery; it is an enchantment. It sticks around until it finds an adequate target. In effect, when you cast it, you’re killing a creature that hasn’t even arrived yet—a spell that reaches “into the future.”
