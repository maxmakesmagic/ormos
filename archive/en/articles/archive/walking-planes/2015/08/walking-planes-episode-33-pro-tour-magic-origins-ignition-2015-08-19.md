Has it happened to you yet? Have you experienced the moment when your casual interest in *Magic* transformed into an absolutely crazy passion? Maybe it was a particularly fascinating card or deck that did it for you. Or maybe it happened that one night at a friend's house or Friday Night *Magic* when your whole plan finally came together. Perhaps you were confronted by a dark lord of black magic and your spark ignited in a time of great trauma, thereby transforming you into a Planeswalker. Though it happens in many ways, the result is the same: *Magic* is more than just a hobby.
