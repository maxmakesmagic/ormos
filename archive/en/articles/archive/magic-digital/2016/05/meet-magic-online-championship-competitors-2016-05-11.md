By David Whitfield




 David works on the Magic community team as a content specialist. He spends his days writing about Magic Online and trying to play too many colors at once in Limited. 






Once a year, masters of *Magic* from across the globe converge on a location disclosed to them via ancient scroll (delivered by a rare [Bird Wizard](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&subtype=+%5bbird%5d+%5bwizard%5d) courier) to determine who is truly the best player on *Magic Online*. Those days of destiny are fast approaching: May 13 through 15, the 2015 *Magic Online* Champion will be decided!


[Last time](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/magic-digital/introducing-magic-online-championship-field-2016-03-31), we learned a little bit about each of the competitors, how they qualified, the gauntlet of *Magic* trials that they will compete in, and the coverage team who will be recounting their deeds and etching them into the annals of history. Since then, we've been chatting with the competitors to learn how they've made their way to the *Magic Online* Championship and a bit about their *Magic* history.


What *Shadows over Innistrad* cards are the competitors most excited about, what other hobbies do they enjoy outside of *Magic*, and—most importantly—what colors represent them on the *Magic* color pie? Read on to find out, and don't forget to tune into twitch.tv/magic May 13 through 15 to find out who will walk away as a *Magic Online* Champion!

My favorite *Magic* player to watch is my brother Tobias Gräfensteiner, because he makes almost no mistakes and plays clean *Magic*. I learned a lot watching him play. He's a good sportsman and doesn't rage when he goes on a losing streak. I think he is the best player in Germany.

Defending Champion Magnus Lantto (Lantto)
=========================================


*When did you start playing* Magic*?*


Close to 20 years ago, during the time of *4th Edition*.


*What is your favorite format to play and why?*


It's been changing through the years, but I used to be really high on Limited, then Modern, but the last year I'd say that Standard has just been the best by far.


*What hobbies do you have aside from* Magic*?*


I'm a big foodie, so trying out new restaurants and cuisines during my *Magic* travels is great!


*How long have you been on* Magic Online*?*


Since the beta.


*What is your favorite* Magic *card in* Shadows over Innistrad *and why?*


Traverse the Ulvenwald—green toolbox strategies have always been a thing for me. Also Thraben Inspector—so innocent yet does so much for your draw.


*What is your favorite deck archetype/color combination to play in* Shadows over Innistrad *Limited?*


White-based aggro. I even had a turn-four kill yesterday with this!


*What colors do you think best represent you? Why?*


Green. Definitely the color I enjoy playing the most, and it's been a part of every successful tournament I've had so far.


*What are you doing to prepare for the* Magic Online *Championship?*


I [have been] testing for Pro Tour *Shadows over Innistrad* with team EUreka, so that is where I get my testing for Draft and Standard. The older formats I mostly test online, but get great help with inspiration from the team.


*What other* Magic *results do you have?*


Winner of last year's *Magic Online* Championship, 5th place at Worlds 2015, winner of GP Milan 2014, 2nd at GP Madison 2015, and Top 8 at GP Brussels 2015.

Niels Noorlander (NielsieBoi)
=============================


**Qualified via the Season 6 *Modern Masters (2015 Edition)* Sealed MOCS Finals**

I started playing in 2000 when a girl from my class showed me her [Quicksilver Amulet](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Quicksilver+Amulet) Dragons deck.


*What is your favorite format to play and why?*


My favorite format is Booster Draft. Playing with a different deck every three rounds is very fun and keeps a format interesting after you have played it a lot.


*What hobbies do you have aside from* Magic*?*


I'm a season ticket holder for the football club in my city: Feyenoord Rotterdam.


*How long have you been on* Magic Online*?*


I've had my account for quite some time, while I only occasionally played a draft, but I started playing a lot in August 2014.


*What is your favorite deck archetype/color combination to play in* Shadows over Innistrad *Limited?*


White-Black [Sorin, Grim Nemesis](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sorin%2C+Grim+Nemesis) Control.


*What colors do you think best represent you? Why?*


Red because I can be impulsive and blue because I strive to be rational.


*What are you doing to prepare for the* Magic Online *Championship?*


Obviously, playing *Magic Online* a lot. Besides that, me and my friend Mitchell Manders, both from Rotterdam, were lucky enough to both qualify for the *Magic Online* Championship, so we will be doing some testing between the both of us.


*What is one fact about you that might surprise people?*


I don't like chicken.


*What other* Magic *results do you have?*


Top 4 Worlds with the Dutch team, one Grand Prix Top 8, qualified for eight Pro Tours.

==============================


**Qualified via the Season 2 *Khans of Tarkir*-*Fate Reforged* Sealed MOCS Finals**


*When did you start playing* Magic*?*

*What hobbies do you have aside from* Magic*?*


I enjoy playing different sports with friends like soccer, handball, and tennis.


*How long have you been on* Magic Online*?*


I've been on *Magic Online* for approximatively two years.


*What is your favorite* Magic *card in* Shadows over Innistrad *and why?*


[Pyre Hound](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyre+Hound), also known as my friend Luis Gobern's puppy.


*What is your favorite deck archetype/color combination to play in* Shadows over Innistrad *Limited?*


I like red-green because a lot of the Werewolves are good. Usually, I focus on playing whatever's open.


*What colors do you think best represent you? Why?*


I've always liked the blue-red combination, as I enjoy playing tempo decks. I don't know if those colors describe me, though.


*What are you doing to prepare for the* Magic Online *Championship?*


I'm planning on playing a lot on *Magic Online* and in various tournaments. I will also try to talk to some friends about what they think of the formats to try to gather information and be the best prepared I can be.


*Who is your favorite* Magic *player to watch?*


Marcio Carvalho.


*What is one fact about you that might surprise people?*


I lived in Democratic Republic of Congo for eight years, from age eight to sixteen. I lived for two years in a small town called Boma. When I arrived, I didn't speak French, so I had a difficult transition period. Fortunately, I was able to adapt to the change, and I learned how to speak French in about a month.


*What other* Magic *results do you have?*


I don't have a lot of other *Magic* accomplishments. I've qualified for Pro Tour *Shadows over Innistrad* in an RPTQ. As of today, I went 8-1 in the first day of GP Barcelona.

Mike Sigrist (msigrist)
=======================


**Qualified via the Season 8 *Magic Origins* Sealed MOCS Finals**


*When did you start playing* Magic*?*


I started playing *Magic* around the time *4th Edition* was released.

I like Booster Draft the most because the games are always different.

*How long have you been on* Magic Online*?*


I've been playing *Magic Online* since it was released, off and on.


*What is your favorite* Magic *card in* Shadows over Innistrad *and why?*


My favorite card in *Shadows* is [Archangel Avacyn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Archangel+Avacyn). It's just completely busted.


*What is your favorite deck archetype/color combination to play in* Shadows over Innistrad *Limited?*


The one that's most open.

Blue and white—I like to be in control.

Two-time GP champion, two PT Top 8s, and 2014–2015 Player of the Year.

Joe Spanier (ExisFlame)
=======================


**MOCS Last Chance Qualifier Winner**


*When did you start playing* Magic*?*


Seventh grade, right around the release of *Legions*. I was playing competitive *Pokémon* at the time, but the girl I had a crush on was playing *Magic* and told me to give it a try, so then I started.


*What is your favorite format to play and why?*


Legacy. The games are incredibly deep and pack a lot of highly relevant decisions into a short period. On top of that, many of the top decks function very differently, so even though a lot of the cards are the same, the games play out quite differently.


*What hobbies do you have aside from* Magic*?*


I cook a lot.


*How long have you been on* Magic Online*?*


Late 2010, about a week before *Scars of Mirrodin* came online. That was also when I came back to *Magic* (after quitting around *Dissension* as high school debate took over my life). I haven't actually made much of a return to paper *Magic*. I consider myself almost entirely a *Magic Online* player.


*What is your favorite* Magic *card in* Shadows over Innistrad *and why?*


It has to be THE GITROG.


*What is your favorite deck archetype/color combination to play in* Shadows over Innistrad *Limited?*


[Rise from the Tides](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rise+from+the+Tides). I haven't drafted the set much at this point, but it's [Spider Spawning](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spider+Spawning), or at least the closest thing I've seen so far.


*What colors do you think best represent you? Why?*


I would tell you my colors, but then I would have to kill you. If only we had a guild...


*What are you doing to prepare for the* Magic Online *Championship?*


Playing *Magic*. Then playing more *Magic*. And when I'm done? I'll probably play a bit more.


*What is one fact about you that might surprise people?*


I have never chewed a piece of gum. Yes, really. Someone offered me a piece of gum in chemistry class in tenth grade, and I realized I'd never had any before. I then decided I'd rather be able to say I've never chewed a piece of gum, so I haven't.

Gerry Thompson (Thage)
======================


**Qualified via the Season 5 Standard MOCS Finals**


*When did you start playing* Magic*?*


My first sanctioned tournament was the *Invasion* Prerelease. Before that, I played at the end of the hallway during lunch in high school.


*What is your favorite format to play and why?*


Is Extended circa 2002 a real answer? If not, I guess I'll say Legacy since those formats have some similarities. Realistically, I just like playing *Magic*.


*What hobbies do you have aside from* Magic*?*


When I get invested in something, I tend to go deep, which doesn't leave very much time for anything else. Plus, *Magic* is how I make my living, so most of my time is spent on it, whether it's brewing, writing, playtesting, or even just thinking about it.


If I have time, I enjoy JRPGs, loud concerts, anime, and reading.


*How long have you been on* Magic Online*?*


Since triple *Odyssey* drafts were a thing. I got in more reps than I ever could playing in real life and it elevated my game quickly, so I never really stopped playing.


*What is your favorite* Magic *card in* Shadows over Innistrad *and why?*


[Thing in the Ice](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thing+in+the+Ice)!


Casting instants and sorceries is something I already want to be doing, and then it resets my opponent's board and smashes them. I also have a history of thawing ice counters.


*What is your favorite deck archetype/color combination to play in* Shadows over Innistrad *Limited?*


I'm always down to mill myself for profit, so Black-Green Delirium.


*What colors do you think best represent you? Why?*


Blue is a given due to my thirst for knowledge and overwhelming desire to be in control of any situation. Red because of my temper and bouts of temporary insanity.


*What are you doing to prepare for the* Magic Online *Championship?*


Leverage the knowledge I gained by testing for, and playing in, Pro Tour *Shadows over Innistrad*, plus brewing a Legacy deck (or just asking Mike Sigrist what decks he's playing).


*Who is your favorite* Magic *player to watch?*


Michael Majors for the crisp, clean, perfect gameplay.


*What is one fact about you that might surprise people?*


In the last couple years, I found a fond appreciation for the competitive *Pokémon* VGC [Video Game Championships] scene. I even played in several Regionals, some of which I flew to. Shout-out to Tiago Maltez, a *Magic* player who got me up to speed quickly.


*What other* Magic *results do you have?*


I am the only person to win both StarCityGames.com Opens in the same weekend. The tournament structure changed, so I will forever be the only person to ever do that. While it's nice to know I won't ever get surpassed, I did enjoy watching them try.

Oliver Tiu (tiutangclan)
========================


**Qualified via the Season 9 *Legacy Cube* Sealed MOCS Finals**


*When did you start playing* Magic*?*


When I was around nine years old. I was introduced to the game during a summer camp.


*What is your favorite format to play and why?*


Standard, because I enjoy the challenge of constantly adapting to a dynamic metagame. It also often consists of grindy and interesting games.


*What hobbies do you have aside from* Magic*?*


I enjoy watching poker, although I haven't played much of it.


*How long have you been on* Magic Online*?*


Around three or four years.


*What is your favorite* Magic *card in* Shadows over Innistrad *and why?*


[Rise from the Tides](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rise+from+the+Tides)—the card is very fun to draft around and also powerful in the right deck. It's a crucial aspect of the Blue-Red Spells archetype in draft.


*What is your favorite deck archetype/color combination to play in* Shadows over Innistrad *Limited?*


Blue-Red Spells. The deck wins in very unorthodox ways, and is a blast to play.


*What colors do you think best represent you? Why?*


Blue because I'm a Spike and always play to win. Blue is the most powerful color in *Magic* history, and I also enjoy drawing extra cards more than anything else in *Magic*.


*What are you doing to prepare for the* Magic Online *Championship?*


Playing tons and tons of *Magic Online.*


*Who is your favorite* Magic *player to watch?*


LSV, he's one of the all-time best and also very entertaining. He often sees weird lines of play, and is extremely knowledgeable. I learn a lot from him.


*What is one fact about you that might surprise people?*


I cashed my first Grand Prix at twelve years old.


*What other* Magic *results do you have?*


Top 16 Pro Tour *Oath of the Gatewatch*, Top 8 Grand Prix Providence.

Peter Yeh (DeepFinesse)
=======================


**Qualified via the Season 7 Modern MOCS Finals**


*When did you start playing* Magic*?*


*Scars of Mirrodin*.


*What is your favorite format to play and why?*


Draft. I love it when all the pieces of a good Draft deck fall into place neatly. I also (occasionally) find it amusing to attempt to salvage a train wreck at low-stakes events.


*What hobbies do you have aside from* Magic*?*


I play bridge competitively. Unfortunately it's taken a back seat recently due to my *Magic* activities.


*How long have you been on* Magic Online*?*


Since original *Innistrad*. I burned so many tickets back then, but it helped me improve tremendously as a Limited player.


*What is your favorite* Magic *card in* Shadows over Innistrad *and why?*


It depends on the day, and on recent Limited events I played in. Today, it's Avacyn because I opened one in my Sealed pool.


*What is your favorite deck archetype/color combination to play in* Shadows over Innistrad *Limited?*


Green-blue with [Graf Mole](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Graf+Mole) and [Epitaph Golem](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Epitaph+Golem).


*What colors do you think best represent you? Why?*


I suppose it's blue and red, since I find myself to be methodical, intellectual, and secretly very self-centered.


*What are you doing to prepare for the* Magic Online *Championship?*


I'll be leaning on my friends' expertise in Urbana-Champaign and I suppose I will also play a lot of *Magic Online*.


*Who is your favorite* Magic *player to watch?*


I enjoy LSV's Draft videos a lot.


*What is one fact about you that might surprise people?*


I spend a lot of time daydreaming.


*What other* Magic *results do you have?*


I Top 8ed the first Release event I ever attended; it was *Mirrodin Besieged* Sealed. I also won a play set of [Underground Sea](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Underground+Sea)s at Red Raccoon Games in Bloomington, Illinois, a while ago.

We were unable to reach Mitchell Manders and Akira Tamaki in time to include their interviews within this article. Furthermore, due to circumstances beyond our and the players' control, Konstantin Puzanov and Dmitriy Timohkin will be unable to attend the *Magic Online* Championship. We've extended them a special invitation to Pro Tour Dublin in 2017—we look forward to seeing them there!


We're only a few days away from the big event. Remember to keep your Twitch tuned to twitch.tv/magic from May 13 through 15 to find out who emerges with the title of *Magic Online* Champion!
