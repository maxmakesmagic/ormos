Last week, I began my  [*Magic 2015* card-by-card design stories](mm27stub) . As I only made it to *H*, that means that this week is Part 2. Remember that, as part of this two-part column, I am discussing [the fifteen outside-designer cards](mm27main) made for *Magic 2015*. I'll mention as I hit each card if it's one of the outside-designer cards.

We wanted to make sure players were afraid of Garruk. Yes, we made Garruk, Apex Predator (see last week's article) but that wasn't enough. We wanted a spell that would make the opponent shake in his or her boots. Well, black is allowed to kill both creatures and Planeswalkers. What if we just turned that dial up to 11? What if Garruk killed all creatures and all Planeswalkers? How about just all of your opponent's creatures and Planeswalkers? You're smart enough to stay out of his way.

This is the eighth outside-designer card. It was designed by Dave Sirlin, designer of *Super Street Fighter II HD Remix* and *Yomi*. (Also of a cool new chess variant if you're in to that type of thing.) Dave's design is what we refer to as a bluffing card. A bluffing card is one where you have to make a decision, but its effectiveness is based on whether or not your opponent can successfully guess what you are about to do. As Dave Sirlin is famous for game balance, he does something very smart: he makes a weighted choice.


What do I mean by this? Well, the card allows you to play a spell for free from your hand. The opponent has to decide whether the spell costs 4 or less or 5 or more. If your opponent guesses correctly, he or she stops the spell. Now, a spell that costs 5 or more is going to be a stronger spell. So wouldn't your opponent err toward choosing 5 or more, to guarantee the bigger spell doesn't happen? Your opponent can, but then you get to cast a smaller spell if he or she doesn't guess that's what you're up to.


Also, an average deck has a lot more cheap spells than expensive ones, so the odds are that most of the spells will be smaller, meaning if your opponent chooses 4 or less, he or she is more likely to hit a larger number of spells in your hand. So why not just choose 4 or less, as much of the time it will hit all the spells in your hand? Your opponent can, but what happens if you have the bigger spell and choose to try cast it?


As you can see, Dave has set up a very dynamic situation that allows each player to weigh a number of different factors. It's not just a coin flip, and that's what makes this card so interesting.

One of the fun ways to design a new card is to take a reward but tie it to a condition that is not normally associated with it. For example, blue is all about card drawing but is the color that least attacks with its creatures. Military Intelligence takes this contrast and builds a card out of it. Hey blue player, you want to draw a lot of cards? We know you do. So let's find a way to attack with a lot of creatures.


Designs like this are cool because they force players to think about decks from a new vantage point. I've talked a number of times before about how I try with each design to begin from a new starting point, so I'm forced to approach things from a direction I never have before. This allows me to discover things I might not otherwise have ever stumbled upon. I feel card design can often do this as well.

Nissa first appeared as the character on the cover of the original *Duels of the Planeswalkers*.

We knew from the moment we saw the image it was just a matter of time before Nissa got her own Planeswalker card. That card showed up in *Zendikar*.
