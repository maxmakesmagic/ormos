### Jérémy Dezani


**Age:** 23  
**Hometown:** Paris/Orleans in France  
**Occupation:****Magic**/Tennis


 

**Previous **Magic** accomplishments:**   

Four GP Top 8s with one win, and Pro Tour *Theros* champion.


**What deck did you play and why did you choose it:**  

Mono Blue. This deck gave me $40,000, so I couldn't reasonably make another choice.


**What changes would you make to your deck and why would you make them:**  

No change; I love my build choices.


**What is the most important card in your deck:**  

In general, [Master of Waves](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Master+of+Waves) and [Thassa, God of the Sea](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thassa%2C+God+of+the+Sea). Against Mono Black, [Bident of Thassa](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bident+of+Thassa); it's a crazy card in this matchup.

None.

[Burning-Tree Emissary](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Burning-Tree+Emissary) into [Nykthos, Shrine to Nyx](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nykthos%2C+Shrine+to+Nyx).

### Stanislav Cifka


**Age:** 26  
**Hometown:** Cesky Krumlov 1, Czech Republic  
**Occupation:****Magic**

 

**Previous **Magic** accomplishments:**   

Platinum level for the last two years, Pro Tour *Return to Ravnica* winner.


**What deck did you play and why did you choose it:**  

UW Control. The only bad matchups are other [Sphinx's Revelation](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sphinx%27s+Revelation) decks, and they are less popular than they should be at the moment.


**What changes would you make to your deck and why would you make them:**  

None.


**What is the most important card in your deck:**  
[Last Breath](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Last+Breath).

### Niklas Kaltenböck


**Age:** 24  
**Hometown:** Graz, Austria  
**Occupation:** Student, work for people with special needs


 

**Previous **Magic** accomplishments:**   

None.


**What deck did you play and why did you choose it:**  

White Weenie with a splash for [Boros Charm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Boros+Charm). I don't play Constructed normally, so I don't know the format, so aggro was the way to go for me. I chose it because it punishes slow draws and [Brave the Elements](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brave+the+Elements) is awesome.


**What changes would you make to your deck and why would you make them:**  

Definitely cut [Wear & Tear](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wear+%26+Tear) and [Renounce the Guilds](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Renounce+the+Guilds) for something else. Maybe 1 [Abrupt Decay](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Abrupt+Decay) (for bluffing reasons, flip it before every match).


**What is the most important card in your deck:**  
[Brave the Elements](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brave+the+Elements).

### Johan Prinzell


**Age:** 31  
**Hometown:** Stockholm, Sweden  
**Occupation:** Student


 

**Previous **Magic** accomplishments:**   

None to speak of.


**What deck did you play and why did you choose it:**  

Red devotion with a white splash. With 4 [Chained to the Rocks](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chained+to+the+Rocks) and 4 [Mizzium Mortars](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mizzium+Mortars) it has a good game versus Mono Blue. With 4 [Assemble the Legion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Assemble+the+Legion) in the sideboard it has a good matchup versus Mono Black. I expected lots of these decks.


**What changes would you make to your deck and why would you make them:**  

4 [Burning-Tree Emissary](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Burning-Tree+Emissary); in retrospect 3 was just a mistake.


**What is the most important card in you deck:**  
[Mizzium Mortars](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mizzium+Mortars).
