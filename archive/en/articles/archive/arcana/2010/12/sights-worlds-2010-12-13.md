Worlds isn't all about the World Championships, you know. It's about a big festival of **Magic**, at which all sorts of wacky things happen. Well, not *all* sorts. That sounds excessive. Nobody spontaneously turned into custard or anything. But there was this:

Or if you're not into the idea of sticking your head through a hole so you can pretend to be Jace, there was this:

Mark Tedin wasn't the only artist there. There was also Chris Rahn, Chippy, and Raymond Swanland. Read all about them [here](/en/articles/archive/event-coverage/2010-magic-gathering-world-championships-feature-state-art-worlds), as well as Yoshino Himori, who illustrated the Manga-style Jace and Chandra.

There was also a pair of game shows hosted by Mark Rosewater and Koichiro Maki. You can try to get that experience yourself [here](/en/articles/archive/event-coverage/2010-magic-gathering-world-championships-question-mark-2010-12-11) and [here](/en/articles/archive/event-coverage/feature-magic-game-show-2010-12-11), but it won't be as good as being in Japan.


We could go on for days listing things, but we'll close with Massive **Magic**. Mark Rosewater and Richard Garfield faced off with huge cards (more information and cool pictures [here](/en/articles/archive/event-coverage/2010-magic-gathering-world-championships-feature-massive-magic)), and in the course of the game, the following cards were revealed:

Hey ... those are from *Mirrodin Besieged*! Here's a better look at them, especially if you don't speak Japanese.

| Mirran Crusader | Phyrexian Crusader |

While we're on the subject, this seems like a good time to mention that Mirran Crusader is the Buy-a-Box promo card, although it comes with alternate art. Alternate art that looks like THIS!
