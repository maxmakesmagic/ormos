When you're cracking a *Modern Horizons* booster, you're getting more than *just* a rare, three uncommons, and ten commons (as if that isn't enough with this set).


There are, of course, the full-art snow lands that come one per pack. Those are a delight.

Also, as usual, you get a token. *Modern Horizons* has a lot going on, so there are a whopping 21 tokens, most repeats but some (like the emblems) very new.

Finally, you'll get something newâ€”cards we're calling the *Modern Horizons* Art Series. They're a bit tough to translate to the screen because, well, they're basically all art, all the time. We showed them off on Weekly MTG last week, so here's a clip to give you a better sense.
