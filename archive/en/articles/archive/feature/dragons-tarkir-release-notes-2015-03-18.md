The Release Notes include information concerning the release of a new *Magic: The Gathering*set, as well as a collection of clarifications and rulings involving that set’s cards. It’s intended to make playing with the new cards more fun by clearing up the common misconceptions and confusion inevitably caused by new mechanics and interactions. As future sets are released, updates to the *Magic* rules may cause some of this information to become outdated. If you can’t find the answer you’re looking for here, please contact us at [Wizards.com/CustomerService](http://wizards.com/CustomerService).


The “General Notes” section includes release information and explains the mechanics and concepts in the set.


The “Card-Specific Notes” section contains answers to the most important, most common, and most confusing questions players might ask about cards in the set. Items in the “Card-Specific Notes” section include full card text for your reference. Not all cards in the set are listed.

**Theme: Dragons and Two-Color Dragon Broods**


Sarkhan’s journey to the past to save the Spirit Dragon Ugin has changed Tarkir. Dragons are everywhere, and *Dragons of Tarkir* has more Dragons than any set before it. Five clans still rule the landscape, but they are two-color clans each named after and led by a fearsome dragonlord. These present-day clans strongly resemble the clans of Tarkir’s past, as well as those in a present that never was. Each clan has an icon associated with it, appearing on cards strongly associated with that clan, including cards with that clan’s signature ability. These icons have no effect on game play.

**Dromoka Keyword Action: Bolster**


The Dromoka clan is green and white. To her followers, Dromoka is the ideal draconic embodiment of endurance.


Bolster is a returning keyword action that puts +1/+1 counters on your smallest creature, ensuring there are no weak links in your army. It hasn’t changed since its appearance in the *Fate Reforged* set.

The official rules for bolster are as follows:


701.30. Bolster


701.30a “Bolster N” means “Choose a creature you control with the least toughness or tied for least toughness among creatures you control. Put N +1/+1 counters on that creature.”


* Bolster itself doesn’t target any creature, though some spells and abilities that bolster may have other effects that target creatures. For example, you could put counters on a creature with protection from white with Aven Tactician’s bolster ability.
* You determine which creature to put counters on as the spell or ability that instructs you to bolster resolves. That could be the creature with the bolster ability, if it’s still under your control and has the least toughness.



---

**Ojutai Keyword: Rebound**


The Ojutai clan is white and blue. To his followers, Ojutai is the ideal draconic embodiment of cunning.


Rebound is a returning keyword found on some instants and sorceries that lets you cast those spells a second time for free at the beginning of your next upkeep. It hasn’t changed since its last appearance in the *Rise of the Eldrazi* set.

> 
> Rebound *(If you cast this spell from your hand, exile it as it resolves. At the beginning of your next upkeep, you may cast this card from exile without paying its mana cost.)*
> 
> 
> 


The official rules for rebound are as follows:


702.87. Rebound


702.87a Rebound appears on some instants and sorceries. It represents a static ability that functions while the spell is on the stack and may create a delayed triggered ability. “Rebound” means “If this spell was cast from your hand, instead of putting it into your graveyard as it resolves, exile it and, at the beginning of your next upkeep, you may cast this card from exile without paying its mana cost.”


702.87b Casting a card without paying its mana cost as the result of a rebound ability follows the rules for paying alternative costs in rules 601.2b and 601.2e–g.


702.87c Multiple instances of rebound on the same spell are redundant.



* Casting the card again due to the delayed triggered ability is optional. If you choose not to cast the card, or if you can’t (perhaps because there are no legal targets available), the card will stay exiled. You won’t get another chance to cast it on a future turn.
* If a spell with rebound that you cast from your hand is countered for any reason (either because of another spell or ability or because all its targets are illegal as it tries to resolve), that spell won’t resolve and none of its effects will happen, including rebound. The spell will be put into its owner’s graveyard and you won’t get to cast it again on your next turn.
* At the beginning of your upkeep, all delayed triggered abilities created by rebound effects trigger. You may handle them in any order. If you want to cast a card this way, you do so as part of the resolution of its delayed triggered ability. Timing restrictions based on the card’s type (if it’s a sorcery) are ignored. Other restrictions, such as “Cast [this spell] only during combat,” must be followed.
* As long as you cast a spell with rebound from your hand, rebound will work regardless of whether you paid its mana cost or an alternative cost you were permitted to pay.
* If you cast a spell with rebound from any zone other than your hand (including your opponent’s hand), rebound will have no effect.
* If a replacement effect (such as the one created by [Rest in Peace](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rest+in+Peace)) would cause a spell with rebound that you cast from your hand to be put somewhere other than into your graveyard as it resolves, you can choose whether to apply the rebound effect or the other effect as the spell resolves.
* Rebound will have no effect on copies of spells because you don’t cast them from your hand.
* If you cast a card from exile this way, it will go to its owner’s graveyard when it resolves or is countered. It won’t go back to exile.



---

**Silumgar Keyword: Exploit**


The Silumgar clan is blue and black. To his followers, Silumgar is the ideal draconic embodiment of ruthlessness.


Exploit is a new keyword ability found on creatures. When a creature with exploit enters the battlefield, you may sacrifice a creature. Creatures with exploit have another ability that gives you a benefit for doing so.


![](https://media.wizards.com/2015/dftyuvbd564776rvf/en_tNQ0n2p4UZ.png)

> Exploit *(When this creature enters the battlefield, you may sacrifice a creature.)*  
> 
> When Minister of Pain exploits a creature, creatures your opponents control get -1/-1 until end of turn.
> 
> 
> 


The official rules for exploit are as follows:


702.109. Exploit


702.109a Exploit is a triggered ability. “Exploit” means “When this creature enters the battlefield, you may sacrifice a creature.”


702.109b A creature with exploit “exploits a creature” when the controller of the exploit ability sacrifices a creature as that ability resolves.


* You choose whether to sacrifice a creature and which creature to sacrifice as the exploit ability resolves.
* You can sacrifice the creature with exploit if it’s still on the battlefield. This will cause its other ability to trigger.
* You can’t sacrifice more than one creature to any one exploit ability.



---

**Kolaghan Keyword: Dash**


The Kolaghan clan is black and red. To her followers, Kolaghan is the ideal draconic embodiment of speed.


Dash is a returning keyword that lets you cast creature spells for an alternative cost, giving the creature haste and returning it to its owner’s hand at the end of the turn. It hasn’t changed since its appearance in the *Fate Reforged* set.


![](https://media.wizards.com/2015/dftyuvbd564776rvf/en_ejfKSXcJUJ.png)

> 
> Dash R *(You may cast this spell for its dash cost. If you do, it gains haste, and it’s returned from the battlefield to its owner’s hand at the beginning of the next end step.)*
> 
> 
> 


The official rules for dash are as follows:


702.108. Dash


702.108a Dash represents three abilities: two static abilities that function while the card with dash is on the stack, one of which may create a delayed triggered ability, and a static ability that functions while the object with dash is on the battlefield. “Dash [cost]” means “You may cast this card by paying [cost] rather than its mana cost,” “If you chose to pay this spell’s dash cost, return the permanent this spell becomes to its owner’s hand at the beginning of the next end step,” and “As long as this permanent’s dash cost was paid, it has haste.” Paying a card’s dash cost follows the rules for paying alternative costs in rules 601.2b and 601.2e–g.


* If you choose to pay the dash cost rather than the mana cost, you’re still casting the spell. It goes on the stack and can be responded to and countered. You can cast a creature spell for its dash cost only when you otherwise could cast that creature spell. Most of the time, this means during your main phase when the stack is empty.
* If you pay the dash cost to cast a creature spell, that card will be returned to its owner’s hand only if it’s still on the battlefield when its triggered ability resolves. If it dies or goes to another zone before then, it will stay where it is.
* You don’t have to attack with the creature with dash unless another ability says you do.
* If a creature enters the battlefield as a copy of or becomes a copy of a creature whose dash cost was paid, the copy won’t have haste and won’t be returned to its owner’s hand.

**Atarka Ability Word: Formidable**


The Atarka clan is red and green. To her followers, Atarka is the ideal draconic embodiment of savagery.


Formidable is a new ability word that appears in italics at the beginning of abilities that improve if creatures you control have total power 8 or greater. (An ability word has no rules meaning.)


![](https://media.wizards.com/2015/dftyuvbd564776rvf/en_ZluAaiwZMF.png)



> 
>   
> 
> Atarka Beastbreaker  
> 
> 1G  
> 
> Creature — Human Warrior  
> 
> 2/2  
> *Formidable* — 4G: Atarka Beastbreaker gets +4/+4 until end of turn. Activate this ability only if creatures you control have total power 8 or greater.
>

> 
> Trample  
> *Formidable* — Whenever Sabertooth Outrider attacks, if creatures you control have total power 8 or greater, Sabertooth Outrider gains first strike until end of turn.
> 
> 
> 


* If you control a creature with power less than 0, use its actual power when calculating the total power of creatures you control. For example, if you control three creatures with powers 4, 5, and -2, the total power of creatures you control is 7.
* Some formidable abilities are activated abilities that require creatures you control to have total power 8 or greater. Once you activate these abilities, it doesn’t matter what happens to the total power of creatures you control.
* Other formidable abilities are triggered abilities with an “intervening ‘if’” clause. Such abilities check the total power of creatures you control twice: once at the appropriate time to see if the ability will trigger, and again as the ability tries to resolve. If, at that time, the total power of creatures you control is no longer 8 or greater, the ability will have no effect.

**New Keyword Variant: Megamorph**


Magic rooted in deception and concealment is used throughout Tarkir. Megamorph is a new variant of morph that allows creatures to be cast face down, hiding their true identities.


![](https://media.wizards.com/2015/dftyuvbd564776rvf/en_asbSnXZpIi.png)



> 
>   
>

> Creature — Dragon  
> 
> 3/3  
> 
> Flying, lifelink  
> 
> Megamorph 5WW *(You may cast this card face down as a 2/2 creature for 3. Turn it face up any time for its megamorph cost and put a +1/+1 counter on it.)*  
> 
> When Shieldhide Dragon is turned face up, put a +1/+1 counter on each other Dragon creature you control.
> 
> 
> 


The official rules for morph and megamorph are as follows:


702.36. Morph


702.36a Morph is a static ability that functions in any zone from which you could play the card it’s on, and the morph effect works any time the card is face down. “Morph [cost]” means “You may cast this card as a 2/2 face-down creature with no text, no name, no subtypes, and no mana cost by paying 3 rather than paying its mana cost.” (See rule 707, “Face-Down Spells and Permanents.”)


702.36b To cast a card using its morph ability, turn it face down. It becomes a 2/2 face-down creature card with no text, no name, no subtypes, and no mana cost. Any effects or prohibitions that would apply to casting a card with these characteristics (and not the face-up card’s characteristics) are applied to casting this card. These values are the copiable values of that object’s characteristics. (See rule 613, “Interaction of Continuous Effects,” and rule 706, “Copying Objects.”) Put it onto the stack (as a face-down spell with the same characteristics), and pay 3 rather than pay its mana cost. This follows the rules for paying alternative costs. You can use a morph ability to cast a card from any zone from which you could normally play it. When the spell resolves, it enters the battlefield with the same characteristics the spell had. The morph effect applies to the face-down object wherever it is, and it ends when the permanent is turned face up.


702.36c You can’t cast a card face down if it doesn’t have a morph ability.


702.36d Any time you have priority, you may turn a face-down permanent you control face up. This is a special action; it doesn’t use the stack (see rule 115). To do this, show all players what the permanent’s morph cost would be if it were face up, pay that cost, then turn the permanent face up. (If the permanent wouldn’t have a morph cost if it were face up, it can’t be turned face up this way.) The morph effect on it ends, and it regains its normal characteristics. Any abilities relating to the permanent entering the battlefield don’t trigger when it’s turned face up and don’t have any effect, because the permanent has already entered the battlefield.


702.36e Megamorph is a variant of the morph ability. “Megamorph [cost]” means “You may cast this card as a 2/2 face-down creature with no text, no name, no subtypes, and no mana cost by paying 3 rather than paying its mana cost” and “As this permanent is turned face up, put a +1/+1 counter on it if its megamorph cost was paid to turn it face up.” A megamorph cost is a morph cost.


702.36f See rule 707, “Face-Down Spells and Permanents,” for more information on how to cast cards with a morph ability.


* Turning a face-down creature with megamorph face up and putting a +1/+1 counter on it is a special action. It doesn’t use the stack and can’t be responded to.
* If a face-down creature with megamorph is turned face up some other way (for example, if you manifest a card with megamorph and then pay its mana cost to turn it face up), you won’t put a +1/+1 counter on it.
* With the exception of putting a +1/+1 counter on the creature as it turns face up, megamorph functions the same way morph does. The following bullet points originally appeared in the *Khans of Tarkir* Release Notes for the morph ability and apply to megamorph as well.
* Morph lets you cast a card face down by paying 3, and lets you turn the face-down permanent face up any time you have priority by paying its morph cost.
* The face-down spell has no mana cost and has a converted mana cost of 0. When you cast a face-down spell, put it on the stack face down so no other player knows what it is, and pay 3. This is an alternative cost.
* When the spell resolves, it enters the battlefield as a 2/2 creature with no name, mana cost, creature types, or abilities. It’s colorless and has a converted mana cost of 0. Other effects that apply to the creature can still grant it any of these characteristics.
* Any time you have priority, you may turn the face-down creature face up by revealing what its morph cost is and paying that cost. This is a special action. It doesn’t use the stack and can’t be responded to. Only a face-down permanent can be turned face up this way; a face-down spell cannot.
* If a face-down creature loses its abilities, it can’t be turned face up by paying its morph cost because it no longer has morph or a morph cost.
* Because the permanent is on the battlefield both before and after it’s turned face up, turning a permanent face up doesn’t cause any enters-the-battlefield abilities to trigger.
* Because face-down creatures don’t have a name, they can’t have the same name as any other creature, even another face-down creature.
* A permanent that turns face up or face down changes characteristics but is otherwise the same permanent. Spells and abilities that were targeting that permanent, as well as Auras and Equipment that were attached to the permanent, aren’t affected.
* Turning a permanent face up or face down doesn’t change whether that permanent is tapped or untapped.
* At any time, you can look at a face-down spell or permanent you control. You can’t look at face-down spells or permanents you don’t control unless an effect instructs you to do so.
* If a face-down spell leaves the stack and goes to any zone other than the battlefield (if it was countered, for example), you must reveal it. Each graveyard is kept in a single face-up pile.
* If a face-down permanent leaves the battlefield, you must reveal it. You must also reveal all face-down spells and permanents you control if you leave the game or if the game ends.
* You must ensure that your face-down spells and permanents can easily be differentiated from each other. You’re not allowed to mix up the cards that represent them on the battlefield in order to confuse other players. The order they entered the battlefield should remain clear. Common methods for doing this include using markers or dice, or simply placing them in order on the battlefield.

**Cycle: Monuments**


This set includes a cycle of artifacts that can be tapped for one of two colors of mana and can become Dragons.


![](https://media.wizards.com/2015/dftyuvbd564776rvf/en_g0amj5ezMX.png)

> 
> T: Add B or R to your mana pool.  
> 
> 4BR: Kolaghan Monument becomes a 4/4 black and red Dragon artifact creature with flying until end of turn.
> 
> 
> 


* A Monument can’t attack on the turn it enters the battlefield.
* Each Monument is colorless, although the last ability will make each of them two colors until end of turn.
* If a Monument has any +1/+1 counters on it, those counters will remain on the permanent after it stops being a creature. Those counters will have no effect as long as the Monument isn’t a creature, but they will apply again if the Monument later becomes a creature.
* Activating the last ability of a Monument while it’s already a creature will override any effects that set its power or toughness to a specific value. Effects that modify power or toughness without directly setting them to a specific value will continue to apply.



---

**Cycle: Commands**


This set includes a cycle of Commands, modal spells that let you choose two of their four modes.


![](https://media.wizards.com/2015/dftyuvbd564776rvf/en_uQPmh8y5Cz.png)



> 
>   
> 
> Ojutai’s Command  
> 
> 2WU  
> 
> Instant  
> 
> Choose two —
> 
> 
> * Return target creature card with converted mana cost 2 or less from your graveyard to the battlefield.
> * You gain 4 life.
> * Counter target creature spell.
> * Draw a card.
> 



* You choose the two modes as you cast the spell. You must choose two different modes. Once modes are chosen, they can’t be changed.
* You can choose a mode only if you can choose legal targets for that mode. Ignore the targeting requirements for modes that aren’t chosen. For example, you can cast Ojutai’s Command without targeting a creature spell provided you don’t choose the third mode.
* As the spell resolves, follow the instructions of the modes you chose in the order they are printed on the card. For example, if you chose the second and fourth modes of Ojutai’s Command, you would gain 4 life and then draw a card. (The order won’t matter in most cases.)
* If a Command is copied, the effect that creates the copy will usually allow you to choose new targets for the copy, but you can’t choose new modes.
* If all targets for the chosen modes become illegal before the Command resolves, the spell will be countered and none of its effects will happen. If at least one target is still legal, the spell will resolve but will have no effect on any illegal targets.

**Cycle: “Dragon bonus” cards**


This set includes several cards that improve if you reveal a Dragon card in your hand as an additional cost to cast them or if you controlled a Dragon as you cast them.


![](https://media.wizards.com/2015/dftyuvbd564776rvf/en_2F07sDVCqn.png)



> 
>   
> 
> Foul-Tongue Invocation  
> 
> 2B  
> 
> Instant  
> 
> As an additional cost to cast Foul-Tongue Invocation, you may reveal a Dragon card from your hand. Target player sacrifices a creature. If you revealed a Dragon card or controlled a Dragon as you cast Foul-Tongue Invocation, you gain 4 life.
> 
> 
> 


* If one of these spells is copied, the controller of the copy will get the “Dragon bonus” only if a Dragon card was revealed as an additional cost. The copy wasn’t cast, so whether you controlled a Dragon won’t matter.
* You can’t reveal more than one Dragon card to multiply the bonus. There is also no additional benefit for both revealing a Dragon card as an additional cost and controlling a Dragon as you cast the spell.
* If you don’t reveal a Dragon card from your hand, you must control a Dragon as you are finished casting the spell to get the bonus. For example, if you lose control of your only Dragon while casting the spell (because, for example, you sacrificed it to activate a mana ability), you won’t get the bonus.

* If Ambuscade Shaman enters the battlefield at the same time as other creatures you control, its ability will trigger for each of those creatures.

* Ancestral Statue’s ability is mandatory. If Ancestral Statue is the only nonland permanent you control when its ability resolves, you must return it to its owner’s hand.
* The triggered ability doesn’t target any permanent. You choose which one to return as the ability resolves. No player can respond to this choice once the ability starts resolving.

> 
> 
> 


* The player who controlled Arashin Sovereign when it died chooses whether to put it on the top or bottom of its owner’s library. The player may also choose to leave Arashin Sovereign in the graveyard. This choice is made as the ability resolves.
* Arashin Sovereign will be put on the top or bottom of that library only if it’s still in the graveyard when its ability resolves. If it leaves the graveyard before that point, it will stay in whatever zone it’s in, even if it’s returned to the graveyard before the ability resolves.

* For example, a 2/3 creature will assign 3 combat damage rather than 2.
* The first ability doesn’t actually change any creature’s power. It changes only the value of the combat damage it assigns. All other rules and effects that check power or toughness use the real values.

* The token creatures all enter the battlefield at the same time.
* A token that enters the battlefield as a copy of a face-down creature is a face-up colorless 2/2 creature with no name, abilities, or creature types.
* Each token copies exactly what was printed on the original creature and nothing else (unless that permanent is copying something else or is a token; see below). It doesn’t copy whether that creature is tapped or untapped, whether it has any counters on it or Auras and Equipment attached to it, or any non-copy effects that have changed its power, toughness, types, color, and so on.
* If the copied creature has X in its mana cost, X is considered to be zero.
* If the copied creature is copying something else, then the token enters the battlefield as whatever that creature copied.
* If the copied creature is a token, the token created by Clone Legion copies the original characteristics of that token as stated by the effect that put the token onto the battlefield.
* Any enters-the-battlefield abilities of the copied creature will trigger when the token enters the battlefield. Any “as [this permanent] enters the battlefield” or “[this permanent] enters the battlefield with” abilities of the copied creature will also work.
* Remember that if you control more than one legendary permanent with the same name, you’ll choose one to remain on the battlefield and put the rest into their owners’ graveyards.

* The target creature will lose all other colors and creature types and be blue, a Dragon, and an Illusion. It will retain any other types it may have had, such as artifact.
* The target creature will lose any abilities it may have gained prior to Dance of the Skywise resolving. Notably, if the creature is a face-down creature with morph or megamorph, you can’t turn it face up, as it wouldn’t have a morph or megamorph cost when face up (because it’s lost all abilities other than flying).
* After Dance of the Skywise resolves, the creature can gain abilities as normal.
* Dance of the Skywise overrides all previous effects that set the creature’s power or toughness to specific values. However, effects that set its power or toughness to specific values that start to apply after Dance of the Skywise resolves will override this effect.

* If you choose the second mode, and if a permanent you control is being targeted by a spell when Display of Dominance resolves, nothing happens right away. When that spell would resolve, its color is checked. If it’s blue or black, that permanent will be an illegal target for that spell and won’t be affected by it. If all that spell’s targets have become illegal by the time it would resolve, it’s countered.
* If you choose the second mode, no new blue or black spell may be cast by an opponent that turn targeting a permanent you control after Display of Dominance resolves.
* If you choose the second mode, Display of Dominance will affect any permanent you happen to control at any point during the rest of the turn, not just permanents you control as it resolves. That’s because it doesn’t grant an ability to those permanents; rather, it affects the game rules and states something that’s now true about those permanents.
* Keep in mind that an Aura spell targets the permanent it will enchant (but an Aura on the battlefield doesn’t target the permanent it’s attached to).
* Permanents you control may be the targets of abilities from blue or black sources controlled by your opponents.

* If multiple creatures enter the battlefield under an opponent’s control at the same time, Illusory Gains will trigger for each of them. You may put these abilities on the stack in any order. As each resolves, you’ll briefly gain control of the associated creature. The last one to resolve determines which one you’ll ultimately control.

* If there are no instant or sorcery cards in your graveyard as Living Lore enters the battlefield, it will enter the battlefield as a 0/0 creature and be put into its owner’s graveyard due to having 0 toughness.
* If Living Lore leaves the battlefield, the ability that defines its power and toughness will lose track of the exiled card. Its power and toughness are 0 in other zones.
* Similarly, if the exiled card somehow leaves exile while Living Lore is on the battlefield, Living Lore will become a 0/0 creature and be put into its owner’s graveyard (unless something else is raising its toughness).
* When casting a card with Living Lore’s last ability, ignore timing restrictions based on the card’s type. Other timing restrictions, such as “Cast [this spell] only during combat,” must be followed.
* If you cast a card “without paying its mana cost,” you can’t pay alternative costs. You can pay additional costs. If the card has mandatory additional costs, you must pay those.

* If a creature affected by Lurking Arynx’s ability can’t legally block it (perhaps because Lurking Arynx has gained flying), that creature can block other attacking creatures or not block at all.
* If, during the declare blockers step, a creature is tapped or is affected by a spell or ability that says it can’t block, it doesn’t block. If there’s a cost associated with having a creature block, its controller isn’t forced to pay that cost, so it doesn’t have to block in that case either.

* Notably, the token won’t be attacking.
* If Mirror Mockery enchants a creature you don’t control, and you are the defending player, you can block with the token.
* The ability that exiles the token will trigger at end of combat no matter what happens to the original creature or to Mirror Mockery.
* If Mirror Mockery is no longer on the battlefield as its triggered ability resolves, its ability makes a copy of the creature it was enchanting when it left the battlefield. If it left the battlefield because it was no longer enchanting a legal creature, it makes a copy of the creature it was most recently enchanting before it left the battlefield.
* If Mirror Mockery’s ability creates multiple tokens (due to an effect such as the one [Doubling Season](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Doubling+Season) creates), all such tokens will be exiled by the delayed triggered ability.
* A token that enters the battlefield as a copy of a face-down creature is a face-up colorless 2/2 creature with no name, abilities, or creature types.
* The token copies exactly what was printed on the original creature and nothing else (unless that permanent is copying something else or is a token; see below). It doesn’t copy whether that creature is tapped or untapped, whether it has any counters on it or Auras and Equipment attached to it, or any non-copy effects that have changed its power, toughness, types, color, and so on.
* If the copied creature has X in its mana cost, X is considered to be zero.
* If the copied creature is copying something else, then the token enters the battlefield as whatever that creature copied.
* If the copied creature is a token, the token created by Mirror Mockery copies the original characteristics of that token as stated by the effect that put the token onto the battlefield.
* Any enters-the-battlefield abilities of the copied creature will trigger when the token enters the battlefield. Any “as [this permanent] enters the battlefield” or “[this permanent] enters the battlefield with” abilities of the copied creature will also work.

* Reduce in Stature overrides all previous effects that set the creature’s power or toughness to specific values. However, effects that set its power or toughness to specific values that start to apply after Reduce in Stature becomes attached to the creature will override this effect.
* Effects that modify the power or toughness of the creature, such as the effects of [Giant Growth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Giant+Growth) or [Honor of the Pure](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Honor+of+the+Pure), will apply to it no matter when they started to take effect. The same is true for counters that change the creature’s power or toughness (such as +1/+1 counters) and effects that switch its power and toughness.

* The first ability of Shaman of Forgotten Ways is a mana ability. It doesn’t use the stack and can’t be responded to.
* The mana produced by Shaman of Forgotten Ways can be used to cast face-down creature spells with morph or megamorph.
* Count the number of creatures each player controls when the last ability resolves to determine what number each player’s life total will become.
* For a player’s life total to become a specific number, the player gains or loses the appropriate amount of life. For example, if a player’s life total is 12 and that player controls three creatures as the ability resolves, he or she will lose 9 life. Other effects that interact with lifegain or loss will interact with this effect accordingly.
* If a player controls no creatures as the last ability resolves, his or her life total will become 0, causing that player to lose the game. If all players’ life totals become 0 this way, the game will be a draw.

>

> 


* Face-down creatures have a converted mana cost of 0. If one is exiled by Silkwrap, it will return to the battlefield face up.
* Silkwrap’s ability causes a zone change with a duration, a style of ability that’s somewhat reminiscent of older cards like [Oblivion Ring](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oblivion+Ring). However, unlike [Oblivion Ring](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oblivion+Ring), cards like Silkwrap have a single ability that creates two one-shot effects: one that exiles the creature when the ability resolves, and another that returns the exiled card to the battlefield immediately after Silkwrap leaves the battlefield.
* If Silkwrap leaves the battlefield before its triggered ability resolves, the target creature won’t be exiled.
* Auras attached to the exiled creature will be put into their owners’ graveyards. Equipment attached to the exiled creature will become unattached and remain on the battlefield. Any counters on the exiled creature will cease to exist.
* If a creature token is exiled, it ceases to exist. It won’t be returned to the battlefield.
* The exiled card returns to the battlefield immediately after Silkwrap leaves the battlefield. Nothing happens between the two events, including state-based actions.
* In a multiplayer game, if Silkwrap’s owner leaves the game, the exiled card will return to the battlefield. Because the one-shot effect that returns the card isn’t an ability that goes on the stack, it won’t cease to exist along with the leaving player’s spells and abilities on the stack.

* An “attacking creature” is one that has been declared as an attacker that combat, or one that was put onto the battlefield attacking this combat. Unless that creature leaves combat, it continues to be an attacking creature through the end of combat step, even if the player it was attacking has left the game, or the planeswalker it was attacking has left the battlefield.
