 Brian David-Marshall is a New York–based game designer who has been involved with Magic since 1994, when he started organizing tournaments and ran a Manhattan game store. Since then, he has been a judge, a player, and one of the longest-tenured columnists on DailyMTG.com, as he enters his second decade writing for the site. He is also the Pro Tour Historian and one of the commentators for the Pro Tour. 






*Editor's note: The globe-trotting lifestyle of a **Magic** coverage writer has finally caught up with Brian David-Marshall...something about a long flight from New Jersey to Osaka and an unfriendly power outlet forming an unholy conspiracy to keep you, our gentle readers, from seeing his latest reports from the world of competitve **Magic**. If you still need your fix of BDM for the week, we suggest you check out his [coverage of Japan Nationals](/en/events/coverage/morofuji-oiso-shimura-form-team-japan). Brian's column will return next week when he unveils the fifth and final member of the **Magic** Pro Tour Hall of Fame. In the meantime, here's a pre-preview from* Ravnica: City of Guilds *that we thought you might enjoy.*
