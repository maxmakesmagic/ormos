As [mentioned before](/en/articles/archive/kami-energy-objects-2004-09-07) on **magicthegathering.com**, kami creatures in the Kamigawa block all have floating "energy objects" in their art, as a visual cue that they belong to the spirit world.

What's the origin of that visual cue? Early in Kamigawa world-building, concept illustrator [Ittoku](http://gatherer.wizards.com/default.asp?term=ittoku&fields=%7Cartist&format=Allsets&color=All&output=summary&sort=name&first=1) produced this sketch below. Note the floating heads along the right-hand side.

As Brady Dommermuth [reports](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/askwizards/0305) in today's Ask Wizards, that sketch became the inspiration for [Myojin of Cleansing Fire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Myojin+of+Cleansing+Fire) *and* the energy objects in general.
