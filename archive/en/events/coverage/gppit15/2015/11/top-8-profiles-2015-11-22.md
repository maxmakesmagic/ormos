**Previous Magic Accomplishments:** Top 8 appearance at a StarCityGames Open


**What did you play this weekend and why?** [Splinter Twin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Splinter+Twin). I like being reactive but having a quick win in Modern.


**What was the best card in your main deck and why?** [Twisted Image](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Twisted+Image) was surprisingly strong. I liked only having one [Cryptic Command](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cryptic+Command).

How did that go for you?** [Doran, the Siege Tower](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Doran%2C+the+Siege+Tower) Abzan.
