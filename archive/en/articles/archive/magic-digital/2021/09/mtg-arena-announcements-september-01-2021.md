Bug Fixing Continues
====================


Last Tuesday we delivered a major change to the backend infrastructure of *MTG Arena*. While this change gives us a stronger foundation to build upon, the last week has been more disruptive for players than we wanted, and we apologize for that. We’re working to identify and address issues as they arise, prioritizing server stability and major player-impacting bugs over other, smaller issues, but as we’ve seen with the matchmaking issues last Friday, the unplanned downtime Tuesday, and the short notice for the planned downtime during tomorrow’s release, we’re still not where we need to be.


Tomorrow’s update will help prevent unexpected stability problems going forward and includes fixes for several issues that have been affecting players recently, but we’re not able to fit every outstanding fix into this release. In addition, it is possible that new issues will arise with millions of player interactions under full system load. Over the coming days and weeks, we’ll continue working diligently to address high impact issues as quickly as we can and minimize their effect on players’ experiences.


Because of some of the uncertainty around our current issues and stability, however, we are actively evaluating our upcoming event and release calendar on a daily basis so we can adjust to emergent issues in a timely manner. Reacting to problems may mean that we need to make more significant changes to upcoming events than normal, though if that happens, we'll promptly inform players if an event needs to be rescheduled or canceled.


Thank you all for your patience during this time, and we look forward to correcting issues so we can all focus on building decks and battling, particularly with *Innistrad: Midnight Hunt* just around the corner.


*Jumpstart: Historic Horizons* Now Live!

Yargle Day Event Friday, September 3
====================================


This Friday is September 3, which means it's time to celebrate everyone's favorite 9/3 Frog Spirit, Yargle, with a one-day event!



![Yargle, Glutton of Urborg](https://media.wizards.com/2018/images/daily/cardart_DAR_Yargle-Glutton-of-Urborg.jpg)[Yargle, Glutton of Urborg](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Yargle%2C+Glutton+of+Urborg) | Art by [Jehan Choo](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?action=advanced&output=spoiler&method=visual&artist=+%5B%22Jehan%20Choo%22%5D)
Yar-Kul was an ambitious lieutenant to Demonlord Belzenlok—a bit too ambitious, as it turned out. As punishment for his impudence, the demonlord transformed him into a maggot. Said maggot became a snack for an unwitting frog, which grew and grew (and, one might assume, suffered infernal indigestion) until the ravenous spirit Yargle refluxed into existence.


In this year's event, play with preconstructed Historic Brawl decks featuring [Yargle, Glutton of Urborg](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Yargle%2C+Glutton+of+Urborg) and a few friends as commanders. Of course, it *is* Yargle's day, so the rules might be a little . . . lopsided . . .


**Format**: Preconstructed Historic Brawl


**Entry fee**: None!


**Event date**: September 3, 2021


**Rewards**:


* 1 win: 900 XP
* 2 wins: 300 XP
