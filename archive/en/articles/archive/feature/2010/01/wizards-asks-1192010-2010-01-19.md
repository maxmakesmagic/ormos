*When was your first Prerelease, and what happened?*

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/mtgcom/authorpics/authorpic_kellydigges.jpg)**Kelly Digges:** My first ever Prerelease was *Tempest*, way, way, way back in 1997. My friend Chris's dad played **Magic**, and he offered to drive a bunch of us three hours to Chicago for the Prerelease, us all being too young to drive.

We drove up there very late at night, cased the joint to make sure we knew where we were going in the morning, and spent a short night in a hotel that was, on reflection, even seedier than I realized at the time.

When we got there in the morning, bleary-eyed but excited, I got a DCI number and picked up my promo copy of [Dirtcowl Wurm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dirtcowl+Wurm). (Foils didn't exist yet, but it had a fancy gold stamp on it.)

There were more people in that hall than I had ever seen playing **Magic** in one place. I have no memory of building my Sealed Deck, and I'm pretty sure I didn't win a game all day, but the fire was lit—for my entire **Magic**-playing life, missing a Prerelease was not an option if it could possibly be avoided.
