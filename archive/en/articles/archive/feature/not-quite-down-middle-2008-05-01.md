Not Quite Down the Middle

Michael Flores is the author of Deckade and The Official Miser's Guide; the designer of numerous State, Regional, Grand Prix, National, and Pro Tour–winning decks; and the onetime editor-in-chief of The Magic Dojo. He'd claim allegiance to Dimir (if such a Guild existed)… but instead will just shrug "Simic." 






So where do we begin? The beginning of course!


The first really legitimate victory for a hybrid mana cost belongs to Katsu Mori and his [Selesnya Guildmage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Selesnya+Guildmage)s. Of the first crop of hybrid mana cards, [Selesnya Guildmage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Selesnya+Guildmage) was the *first*, and I think ended up in first position, ultimately, as well.


[Selesnya Guildmage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Selesnya+Guildmage) was a one-man army. It was the kind of card you could peel in a topdeck situation, after a [Wrath of God](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wrath+of+God) or two had been spent, and could go on to dominate a control player like a [Lin Sivvi, Defiant Hero](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Lin%2BSivvi%252C%2BDefiant%2BHero) of old stuffed up your sleeve. If not for the next great hybrid card from the first crop, I'd say that [Selesnya Guildmage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Selesnya+Guildmage) was the best of the transformative hybrids, too. Who can forget how Billy Moreno sidestepped the "my dad is bigger than your dad" wars of Honolulu, when one man would go [Loxodon Hierarch](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Loxodon+Hierarch), the next would go [Rumbling Slum](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rumbling+Slum), and the next after that would slam down [Hunted Wumpus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hunted+Wumpus) (all while the [Ghost Council of Orzhova](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Ghost%2BCouncil%2Bof%2BOrzhova) players rubbed their oily hands together like hungry flies before a rotting husk of left-out watermelon)? Billy actually *downgraded* his main deck offense a little so that he could flip Zoo into [Glare of Subdual](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glare+of+Subdual), then tapped everybody, tapped Hierarch, tapped [Rumbling Slum](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rumbling+Slum) (ha!), tapped Wumpus (ha ha!), even ended up tapping [Ghost Council of Orzhova](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Ghost%2BCouncil%2Bof%2BOrzhova) on his way to the virtual Top 8 in the last round.


Of the *Ravnica* block hybrid mana cards, [Selesnya Guildmage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Selesnya+Guildmage) was taps... err... *tops.*


Of course you'll have your dissenters. Each and every one would vote for the so-called Cap'n Tickles, [Giant Solifuge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Giant+Solifuge).


![Selesnya Guildmage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Selesnya+Guildmage)[Giant Solifuge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Giant+Solifuge) won the *next* Pro Tour, in the hands of Price is Right human pinball and lovable lush Mark Herberholz. Transformation advocates will quickly point out that in the same Top 8, Osyp Lebedowicz snuck the Solifuges into the sideboard of his blue-red UrzaTron control deck, *which wasn't even green.*
Yes, yes, [Giant Solifuge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Giant+Solifuge) was good—very good—and more than once, but spotty main deck positioning and a very real toughness liability when played in the abstract kept it from skittering into that top spot. Good show, though; good shows.


As for the rest, here's how I have them:


#3. [Debtors' Knell](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Debtors%27+Knell)  
 #4. [Dovescape](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dovescape)


This was a rough pick. [Dovescape](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dovescape) was quite solid this year in the Extended fighting, an important Lego in the plastic palace that was built around [Enduring Ideal](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Enduring+Ideal). However that is more or less *all* [Dovescape](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dovescape) has ever been. [Debtors' Knell](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Debtors%27+Knell) has been a minority inclusion in Solar Flare, the top end of many a ponderous attrition deck, and has even played a little Ideal itself.


Most of the rest of the first crop of hybrid cards, by this writer's accounting anyway, were Guildmages. Five, [Rakdos Guildmage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rakdos+Guildmage); Six, [Azorius Guildmage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Azorius+Guildmage); Seven, [Gleancrawler](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gleancrawler) (Yes! Really! Wait for it...); Eight, [Shadow of Doubt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shadow+of+Doubt); Nine, [Simic Guildmage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Simic+Guildmage); Ten, [Gruul Guildmage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gruul+Guildmage).


People love a Top 10 list. 


Hybrid mana was exciting when it first appeared, but as you can see (go back and scour [*Ravnica*](http://ww2.wizards.com/Gatherer/index.aspx?term=/&Field_Cost=on&setfilter=Ravnica%20Block&colorfilter=Multi-Color) on [Gatherer](http://ww2.wizards.com/gatherer/) yourself if you don't believe me), the actual tournament bombs thinned quickly. [Rakdos Guildmage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rakdos+Guildmage) was a legitimate monster, did some damage. [Azorius Guildmage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Azorius+Guildmage) peppered very good sideboards hither and thither. [Gleancrawler](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gleancrawler) was the source of more than one good story, playing out of supposed position, utilizing that unique special ability in unexpected ways to create unexpected value. [Shadow of Doubt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shadow+of+Doubt) was never, in practice, as good as it seemed like it should have been in a world full of [Sakura-Tribe Elder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sakura-Tribe+Elder)s, [Gifts Ungiven](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gifts+Ungiven), etc., and so on.


Fast forward a few years, there is no shortage of monster hybrid cards. 


Yes, people love a Top 10 list. 


For *Ravnica*, it was hard to find ten cards that were really worth talking about. One or two or four, *for sure!* Ten was harder. For *Shadowmoor*, it was impossible to even *cut* to ten!


In no particular order (save alphabet):


**[Demigod of Revenge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Demigod+of+Revenge)**


![Demigod of Revenge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Demigod+of+Revenge)
There is a reason this card was spoiled so early. It sparked so many conversations, so many heated rules disputes. The fact is, [Demigod of Revenge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Demigod+of+Revenge) is just a flat-out awesome finisher. It is better built for Extended than [Rorix Bladewing](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rorix+Bladewing) ever was—red *or* black big cheats—and has a secondary ability that is just dumbfounding. 


[Demigod of Revenge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Demigod+of+Revenge) is the young Shaquille O'Neal of *Shadowmoor*. This card is a card that will just come out and crack backboards and hang above the metagame, legs dangling / swinging, with every lesser slice of cardboard, every yellow-striped pretender Magician terrified of what will happen when it drops down and touches table. 


[Demigod of Revenge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Demigod+of+Revenge) is perfectly packaged for a fast offense with [Seething Song](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seething+Song), but has a built-in final phase of the game, where it acts like a hellbent [Demonfire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Demonfire) for 5, 10, or even 15 damage.


*And* it is probably a hell of a blue-black card, too.


**[Everlasting Torment](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Everlasting+Torment)**


![Everlasting Torment](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Everlasting+Torment)
This card is not sexy. Yet sexy does not always lead us to the path to victory. Speaking of three-mana black (more or less) enchantments, as there ever been an uglier deck than Dennis Bentley's black-red [Necropotence](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Necropotence) deck from U.S. Nationals 1996?

Has there?


[City of Brass](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=City+of+Brass) in [Necropotence](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Necropotence)... It's just disgusting. Three copies of [Necropotence](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Necropotence) only. No way to get rid of [Necropotence](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Necropotence) once you're stuck with it. Twelve years later I still don't understand that sideboard. No [Pyroblast](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyroblast)s to speak of despite a Top 8 painted blue with anti-[Necropotence](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Necropotence)[Stasis](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stasis) decks... Did I mention [City of Brass](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=City+of+Brass) yet? 


Yet... This ugly, hideous, cumbersome, and utterly versatile deck won the U.S. National Championships through a Top 4 littered with then-top theorist George Baxter and a pair of eventual Pro Tour winners in Mike Long and Matt Place (mana-stifling anti-[Necropotence](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Necropotence) decks all around), main deck [Dystopia](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dystopia) and all.


So... [Everlasting Torment](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Everlasting+Torment). It doesn't actually finish off the opponent the way [Sulfuric Vortex](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sulfuric+Vortex) did... but then again, it doesn't demand the use of a separate [Flaring Pain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flaring+Pain), either. It will be interesting to see how this child of Forsaken Wastes and the aforementioned Vortex fits into wider formats with more options at that mana point, but in Standard I just don't see how a [Spark Elemental](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spark+Elemental) deck can compete with a sideboarded [Kitchen Finks](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kitchen+Finks) without it.


**[Firespout](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Firespout)**


![Firespout](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Firespout)
This card is just all around awesome, hell on Faeries at the same time that it is big problems for Kithkin, Goblin tokens, whatever, on the ground. Unlike many powerful red and green global effects, [Firespout](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Firespout) doesn't hurt you, which is basically exactly what you want in a defensive spell. That combined with an extra point of damage makes the cost very palatable for those capable of producing both colors of mana.


**[Fracturing Gust](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fracturing+Gust)**


![Fracturing Gust](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Fracturing+Gust)
You'll have to wait the better part of a year to see this card really clean house, but when you do, it will be murder and a new lease on life at the same time. Extended, you might be looking at the next [Ancient Grudge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ancient+Grudge)-level sideboard spell. Live through the early [Arcbound Ravager](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arcbound+Ravager), fight through the snap-click [Dovescape](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dovescape), and you have a mess and more, and a tremendous, multidimensional profit on your hands.


**[Fulminator Mage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fulminator+Mage)**


![Fulminator Mage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Fulminator+Mage)
If possible, I now think more highly of this card than I did when I wrote the [preview article](/en/articles/archive/end-debate-2008-04-03) a few weeks ago. 


I now believe that [Fulminator Mage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fulminator+Mage) will be more of a black card in practice, whereas I wrote the preview based largely on Red Deck speculation. A lot of pundits think of [Fulminator Mage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fulminator+Mage) as either a limited [Stone Rain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stone+Rain) (mediocre or worse on three) or a [Grey Ogre](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grey+Ogre) (Constructed unplayable at three)... but when laced together in the right format, this card could be the centerpiece of a tournament spoiler, if not winner.


**[Guttural Response](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Guttural+Response)**


![Guttural Response](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Guttural+Response)
This card is destined to be hands-down one of the most heavily played sideboard cards in recent memory. It basically does *to* blue what blue does to everyone else, except more cheaply. 


**[Kitchen Finks](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kitchen+Finks)**


![Kitchen Finks](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Kitchen+Finks)
This card is destined to be hands-down one of the most heavily played sideboard cards in recent memory. Um... *too?* Scouting reports from some sectors have [Kitchen Finks](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kitchen+Finks) as main deck playable. It's [Loxodon Hierarch](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Loxodon+Hierarch) (for one less)! It has persist! Persist is powerful! All true. I still don't see this main deck unless the format as a whole shifts to Red Burn or some other similarly beatable beatdown, *except* that [Kitchen Finks](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kitchen+Finks) is (kind of) in the same colors as [Momentary Blink](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Momentary+Blink), which makes the persist all the more devastating when it is devastating.


**[Murderous Redcap](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Murderous+Redcap)**


![Murderous Redcap](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Murderous+Redcap)
I'm not sure Murderous Radcap is actually better than the legendary [Flametongue Kavu](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flametongue+Kavu), which wiped once-dominant finishers like [Blinding Angel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blinding+Angel) right off the metagame map, but it can split damage between multiple targets (by dying and returning), is a more fearless blocker once it is in play, and can go straight to the face when there is no creature in play... so maybe it is.


[Murderous Redcap](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Murderous+Redcap) is yet another synergistic weapon that, like often middling cards such as [Mogg War Marshal](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mogg+War+Marshal) or [Keldon Marauders](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Keldon+Marauders), can be positioned alongside [Greater Gargadon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Greater+Gargadon) to devastating aggregate effect. Like fellow standout [Kitchen Finks](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kitchen+Finks), it has persist. It can be played without a single red mana. It is a Goblin... and an Assassin!


**[Oona, Queen of the Fae](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oona%2C+Queen+of+the+Fae)**


![Oona, Queen of the Fae](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Oona%2C+Queen+of+the+Fae)
Oona is flying right around the [Demigod of Revenge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Demigod+of+Revenge) from where I'm sitting. Pat Chapin actually made fun of me last week. He liked the persist guys; I liked the big guys. "I like [Flametongue Kavu](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flametongue+Kavu) and [Loxodon Hierarch](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Loxodon+Hierarch)," he said. "... You can't really think that every great card is another Rorix or Akroma, can you?" To me, Oona is like [Meloku the Clouded Mirror](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Meloku%2Bthe%2BClouded%2BMirror)'s engine riding around in [Keiga, the Tide Star](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Keiga%252C%2Bthe%2BTide%2BStar)'s chassis. What more could you want from a giant blue creature? She hits like a Dragon, challenges the attack, and takes notes while she recruits the second string. Oona is offense, defense, information, and speed all in one.


**[Oversoul of Dusk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oversoul+of+Dusk)**


![Oversoul of Dusk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Oversoul+of+Dusk)
Is [Oversoul of Dusk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oversoul+of+Dusk) the realization of everything Jamie Wakefield ever lobbied for? It's green! He liked green-white as well. It's absolutely huge, a 5/5 for five mana, cheaper than a Dragon for Dragon-sized stats. Well, it doesn't trample. Does it have to? Very little can realistically block it, certainly not a [Bitterblossom](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bitterblossom) token. It cannot be stolen by [Sower of Temptation](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sower+of+Temptation), nor smothered by [Shriekmaw](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shriekmaw). This creature seems very good.


Once upon a time there was a whole school of decks based on "untouchable" creatures. In the Dallas Juniors, numerous players went for "untouchable" strategies based around creatures that could not be targeted by spells or effects (a fair number "cheated" and included [Wildfire Emissary](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wildfire+Emissary), who could not be targeted by [Swords to Plowshares](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swords+to+Plowshares)). [Oversoul of Dusk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oversoul+of+Dusk) could be the anchor to a modern "untouchable" Standard deck. To begin with, [Troll Ascetic](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Troll+Ascetic) is many times better than [Jolrael's Centaur](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jolrael%27s+Centaur). If the 1996 Juniors could cheat with the Plow-proof Emissary, why can't a modern Magician go with the infinitely more impressive [Chameleon Colossus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chameleon+Colossus)? [Quagnoth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Quagnoth)?


Or, you could just lay the Oversoul down in a generally good green deck, not part of any particular team other than *winning squad.*


**[Swans of Bryn Argoll](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swans+of+Bryn+Argoll)**


![Swans of Bryn Argoll](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Swans+of+Bryn+Argoll)
While a creature with the Swans' stats would probably make the grade in some formats, the reason this has actually hit the short list is a particular combination of cards. In case you haven't heard of it, the combo is [Seismic Assault](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seismic+Assault) + [Swans of Bryn Argoll](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swans+of+Bryn+Argoll) (it works best if you have a [Dakmor Salvage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dakmor+Salvage) in your hand). Just discard a land (your Salvage) to damage your Bird Spirit. That damage is prevented; draw two; with the Salvage, you can always draw a land and net simultaneously; without the Salvage, you can presumably dig *to* the Salvage. Therefore the three together allow you to draw your own deck... With all those cards, it should be easy to kill the opponent with [Seismic Assault](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seismic+Assault).


**[Tattermunge Maniac](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tattermunge+Maniac)**


![Tattermunge Maniac](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Tattermunge+Maniac)
Still great. 


Still TBD.


**[Vexing Shusher](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vexing+Shusher)**


![Vexing Shusher](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Vexing+Shusher)
BDM has a theory that R&D has peppered *Shadowmoor* with answers for [Counterbalance](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterbalance). He initially cited [Flame Javelin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flame+Javelin), the [Char](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Char) the costs six, but really only costs three, to his argument (difficult to counter with [Counterbalance](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterbalance)), but quickly incorporated [Vexing Shusher](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vexing+Shusher). [Vexing Shusher](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vexing+Shusher) is going to have an amazing career. It will go in beatdown decks. It will go in combo decks. Either inclusion will prove memorable, quick, and frustrating.


**[Wilt-Leaf Liege](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wilt-Leaf+Liege)**


![Wilt-Leaf Liege](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Wilt-Leaf+Liege)
This creature is just all kinds of awesome. Combining the popular [Sand Golem](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sand+Golem) with the competitive body of [Loxodon Hierarch](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Loxodon+Hierarch), [Wilt-Leaf Liege](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wilt-Leaf+Liege) threatens to prove a point... Just how big can [Kitchen Finks](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kitchen+Finks) get? What about the second time around? 


[Wilt-Leaf Liege](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wilt-Leaf+Liege) might be so good that it re-writes how Elf decks get made in Standard, gravitating away from the removal of black to the sheer ferocity of the white combination. The cool thing about [Wilt-Leaf Liege](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wilt-Leaf+Liege) is that despite its color commitment, you are not committed to green, or white, or anything. I don't really see it being played off-color, but no matter what, this is a fair [Dodecapod](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dodecapod).


So, hybrid mana... Still exciting, more exciting than ever. The new cards in *Shadowmoor* are phenomenally quick, powerful, and strategically frustrating. I can't wait, either.
