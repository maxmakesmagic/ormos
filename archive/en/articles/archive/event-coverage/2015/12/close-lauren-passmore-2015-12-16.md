Lauren Passmore (LP): Denver, CO


S: How long have you been playing?


LP: 2 years


S: How long have you been playing competitively?


LP: 1 year, 4 months


S: What are your best tournament accomplishments?


LP: I was a participant in the 2000 Women's Invitational and I've made two top 8's in Pro Tour Qualifiers.


S: What are you playing and why?


LP: I decided to play Ponza/Wildfire with Scoria Cat (the new Orgg) from Prophecy, because I thought that there would be a lot of Stompy and Rebels. The other deck I really considered playing is Tangle Stompy, but I found that I didn't get the amazing draws that other players would get with that deck.


S: What's your favorite card?


LP: Alabaster Dragon from Portal - The art is amazing, and I really love dragons. I started playing with Portal cards, so the "Dragon" was the first card I really wanted to collect. I only have three of them, they're fairly hard to find.


S: What's your favorite format?


LP: Block constructed - I've been focusing a lot on the PTQ format right now, and not spending a lot of time on Standard.


S: What's your favorite card mechanic?


LP: spikes 


S: What's your favorite movie?


LP: The English Patient, because I'm a huge romantic at heart.


S: What's your favorite food?


LP: pizza
