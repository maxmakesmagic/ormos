Spirit Flames: Of Kannushi and Garami

What do I do with a week off from writing? Type an article of twice normal length, of course! (Sorry Scott)


Based on the Message Boards commentary from [my last article](/en/articles/archive/building-budget/interlude-boab-smackdown-2005-06-27), I was sure either Truth Seekers or Soratami's Wisdom would win the precon evolution poll. However, much to my surprise:




| **Which deck is JMS going to play and change next?** |
| Spirit Flames | 2347 | 29.9% |
| Truth Seekers | 1966 | 25.0% |
| Soratami's Wisdom | 1864 | 23.7% |
| Critical Mass | 1672 | 21.3% |
| **Total** | **7849** | **100.0%** |

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/global/images/magic_expansion_sok_td3LargePic_en.jpg)That's right, the focus of the next three weeks will be on the otherworldly aggression of Spirit Flames (apparently the Spirit Flames fans aren't Boards posters). It's nice to know that Green finally received some love from all of you voter-types. This will be the first time I've seriously dealt with Spirit and Arcane interactions, too, which should be fun.


It's been over a month since my last foray, so for those of you unfamiliar with my preconstructed deck approach, here are the Guidelines:


1. Start with a preconstructed deck, unedited, and play it.
2. Don't make changes until playing the deck in at least five games.
3. Change no more than five cards at a time.
4. Build a respectable deck that's fun to play.
5. Build an affordable deck.

I [strayed from this formula](/en/articles/archive/building-budget/rat%E2%80%99s-nest-many-flavors-rat-2005-06-06) slightly with Rat's Nest, coming into the experience ready to expand a minor theme rather than stick to the deck's core themes. This turned out well (being not only the favorite deck in polls but also the winner of the first BOAB Smackdown!), but I'm not sure how much this was the Rat-ness of the deck versus the minor theme bit. With Spirit Flames I'm going to be more open... If the major themes are fun to play and make an interesting deck then I'll stick with them, and if a minor theme rears its head that's cool I'll run with it. It's an experiment of openness to whatever comes. I'm going zen, baby.


My primary goals for these precon evolutions are to have fun and explore the art of budget deckbuilding. That means the journey is as much a part of the experience as the final decklist (see? zen!). If you disagree with my individual card choices or the direction in which I take the deck, that's great... use your energy to build your own deck the way you want to build it. Even better, post your ideas on the Message Boards so everyone else can benefit from your wisdom.


### Spirit Flames First Takes


I've been waiting for this day for a long, long time. In fact, I've been keeping myself from peeking too much at the *Saviors of Kamigawa* preconstructed lists because I wanted to start off with a sense of wonder. Here is what I found when I cracked open the Spirit Flames deck, sorted by card type, number, and mana cost:

![](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Forest)


















I gotta tell you, this deck looks bizarre to me. There are all sorts of things going on and I can't tell if it's meant to be an aggressive deck or a midgame deck. It seems to be a beatdown deck with very few beatdown creatures and a lot of utility. Let me see if I can better organize my first impressions into a few core categories. Keep in mind that these are first impressions only, without a single game under my belt.


*1) Deck Themes*: When I first look at a deck, I find it helpful to identify the major and minor themes to understand what the deck is all about. Each of these themes, in my mind, are pulling on the deck and wanting to make it into something else. As I said, Spirit Flames happens to be a deck with themes aplenty. This makes it a deck ripe for taking in incredibly different sorts of directions. The themes, as I see them, are:


* ![Promised Kannushi](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Promised+Kannushi)

 Major theme: Spirits. More than anything, Spirit Flames seems to be about playing creatures with the creature type Spirit and smashing face. Well, “smashing face” may be an exaggeration since some of the Spirits are small, some big, and some utility-based. All of them tend to be on the aggressive side, though, and it appears that if the deck is going to win, it's going to win through Spirit-induced damage. The deck has twenty-five creatures, twenty-two of which are Spirits. Indeed, the only non-Spirit is [Promised Kannushi](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Promised+Kannushi), who interacts with Spirits. Don't forget about [Devouring Rage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Devouring+Rage) and [Unchecked Growth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Unchecked+Growth), which also care about the deck's creature type.
* Major theme: Arcane. Where there are Spirits, there are often arcane cards to make them feel good about it. Every single card that isn't a creature or a land has the arcane subtype. What's interesting is that only two of them--a single copy each of [Kodama's Might](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kodama%27s+Might) and [Glacial Ray](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glacial+Ray)--have splice onto arcane. Instead of splicing, the arcane part of the deck is meant to fuel cards like [Petalmane Baku](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Petalmane+Baku), [Elder Pine of Jukai](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elder+Pine+of+Jukai), and [Briarknit Kami](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Briarknit+Kami) ([Glitterfang](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glitterfang), incidentally, is a cute trick with these cards as well). That's an interesting tweak to how arcane cards are usually used, and emphasizes the importance of the Spirit theme.
* Minor theme: Channel. Spirit Flames is the deck showcasing Saviors of Kamigawa's channel mechanic. Both rares in the deck have it (and are the two scariest cards with channel in Saviors), as do [Shinen of Life's Roar](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shinen+of+Life%27s+Roar), [Ghost-Lit Raider](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ghost-Lit+Raider), and [Ghost-Lit Nourisher](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ghost-Lit+Nourisher). Note that these three cards focus primarily on combat, which underscores that the deck wants to win via combat damage.
* ![Forked-Branch Garami](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Forked-Branch+Garami)

 Minor theme: Graveyard tricks. Soulshift is the obvious culprit here, and let me just say that I'm already in love with [Promised Kannushi](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Promised+Kannushi) and [Forked-Branch Garami](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forked-Branch+Garami). [Hana Kami](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hana+Kami) is another card that cares about the graveyard, and also happens to come back via soulshift. Keen!
* Minor theme: Creature pumping. The critters in Spirit Flames aren't particularly big. They have plenty of ways to get there, though, thanks to [Kodama's Might](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kodama%27s+Might), [Ghost-Lit Nourisher](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ghost-Lit+Nourisher), [Inner Calm, Outer Strength](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inner+Calm%2C+Outer+Strength), [Devouring Rage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Devouring+Rage), [Unchecked Growth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Unchecked+Growth), [Briarknit Kami](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Briarknit+Kami), and [Strength of Cedars](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Strength+of+Cedars). That's a lot of cards to dedicate to creature-pumping.
* Minor theme: Burn. The deck doesn't have a lot of cards that can affect opponents directly, but it does have plenty of ways to remove blockers via [Frostling](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Frostling), [Glacial Ray](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glacial+Ray), [Ghost-Lit Raider](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ghost-Lit+Raider), and [Crushing Pain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crushing+Pain).
* Minor theme: Mana acceleration. It's not over the top, and the deck doesn't rely on the best mana acceleration in *Kamigawa* Block: [Sakura-Tribe Elder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sakura-Tribe+Elder) and [Kodama's Reach](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kodama%27s+Reach). Instead, it uses [Petalmane Baku](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Petalmane+Baku) and [Elder Pine of Jukai](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elder+Pine+of+Jukai) as a way of hoarding mana. [Strength of Cedars](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Strength+of+Cedars) sort of falls into this theme as well.
* There are a few truly minor themes, as well, including splice, wisdom (“hand-size matters”), and board-sweepers.

Like I said, a lot is happening in the deck. It's basically a Spirit deck with a lot of subthemes. I can almost guarantee that some of these themes will wither to nothingness as others rise in prominence over the next three weeks.


*2) Mana*: The deck's manacurve is odd because it has a lot of aggressive, low-end cards like [Frostling](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Frostling) and [Glitterfang](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glitterfang) while also loading up on five-mana cards as well. Basically the deck has one, three, and five mana cards without a lot else. Twenty-four land seems about right, and it's nice that the deck can run on five mana alone while still making use of a lot more mana thanks to Arashi and Jiwari. Still, that's a pretty top-heavy deck that either needs to load up on more quick mana sources or reduce the number of high-end cards.


One other point of concern in Spirit Flames is the number of double-green ([Forked-Branch Garami](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forked-Branch+Garami), [Rending Vines](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rending+Vines), [Briarknit Kami](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Briarknit+Kami), and especially [Arashi, the Sky Asunder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arashi%2C+the+Sky+Asunder)) in a relatively mana-balanced deck. The three red of [Jiwari, the Earth Aflame](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jiwari%2C+the+Earth+Aflame)'s channel cost isn't very pretty, either. As most people know, I tend to default to single-mana cards in two-color decks as a way of maximizing the deck's reliability. As it is, it looks like Spirit Flames is just asking for mana problems.


*3) Consistency*: All preconstructed decks suffer from a lack of consistency. Simple math says that if you use a sixty card deck, you want the maximum number (four) of your best or key cards so you have the highest probability of drawing them. Precons, however, try to showcase a broad array of new cards and thus rarely have four copies of anything. Spirit Flames happens to be less consistent than even most precons. It has three copies of [Promised Kannushi](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Promised+Kannushi), and everything else is one or two copies. The cards all have different abilities and stats, too, which makes it look like the deck was built to show off lots of cute tricks. I would say consistency is Spirit Flames' weakest attribute, by far.


*4) Power*: On the plus side, both of Spirit Flames' rares are highly playable and can be massively game-changing. Board-sweeping effects are the sort of thing that budget players don't often get to use, so having two is pretty great. Arashi and Jiwari also happen to be Spirits with channel, thus it's likely that they will stick around through the deck's various incarnations because of how closely they tie with the deck's central themes.


The rest of the deck is more mixed. As always with precons, there are some real stinker cards in there and some imminently Constructed-worthy ones. What is probably most noticeable from a power perspective are those cards that fit the deck's main themes but aren't in the deck. Where is [Kodama's Reach](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kodama%27s+Reach)? [Hearth Kami](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hearth+Kami)? [Gnarled Mass](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gnarled+Mass)? Only one [Frostling](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Frostling), [Glacial Ray](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glacial+Ray), and [Hana Kami](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hana+Kami)? For an aggressive Spirits deck, these holes feel pretty gaping.


*5) Fun*: I'm not sure why, but almost all “tribal” decks built around a central creature type tend to be pretty fun. Certainly the many interactions in the deck between arcane cards triggering Spirits, Spirits dying for some effect and then coming back via soulshift, and the uncounterable combat tricks of channel (plus soulshift) all sound fun. Making medium sized creatures obscenely big to smash face is pretty keen. The deck is sort of randomly fun, too, as I'm pretty sure no two games will feel quite the same. As a final point in its favor, I love the two rares, [Promised Kannushi](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Promised+Kannushi), and [Forked-Branch Garami](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forked-Branch+Garami) and anticipate them being the soul (pardon the pun) of whatever deck I build.


Those are first impressions. Let's test some of my observations by actually playing the thing.


But first: One of the things I really regret about my last article is forgetting to include a poll about the format of my new deck. I had assumed it would be Standard (my favorite format), but then I realized that a) people might be sick of Standard decks after Regionals, and b) we've finally rounded out the full *Kamigawa* block with Saviors. So do you want a *Kamigawa* Block deck or has Regionals actually *heightened* your interest in Standard? You'll get to decide. Examine my next ten games (in which I'll alternate formats) closely, then vote in the poll at the end of the article.


### Playing With Spirit Flames


 



![Nezumi Graverobber](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Nezumi+Graverobber)

It's always fun to theorize about a deck, but it's even more fun to actually see those theories in action. Time to spend some time in the Casual Decks room of ***Magic** Online*.

*Game 1 (Standard): Monoblack Aggro*


This was a great first game because it lasted a long time and thus gave me a chance to see a lot of my new deck. There was no way that I should have been able to get my opponent down to three life, though. Dude had [Nezumi Graverobber](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nezumi+Graverobber), which is a terrible, terrible card for Spirit Flames to deal with. Dude had four [Nekrataal](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nekrataal). Dude had four [Dark Banishing](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dark+Banishing). Dude had four [Echoing Decay](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Echoing+Decay). Dude had [Gravedigger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gravedigger). Dude had [Wicked Akuba](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wicked+Akuba). Dude had [Bonesplitter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bonesplitter). Dude even had [Bog Imp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bog+Imp). So what happened? I started out with [Promised Kannushi](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Promised+Kannushi) (love him) and a hand full of channel guys. I found more than enough mana to play out my creatures despite the fact that my opponent kept killing them. I cleared the board with [Jiwari, the Earth Aflame](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jiwari%2C+the+Earth+Aflame). I did incredibly sick graveyard things with a second Kannushi, [Ghost-Lit Nourisher](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ghost-Lit+Nourisher), [Forked-Branch Garami](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forked-Branch+Garami) (love him too), and [Burr Grafter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Burr+Grafter). My lone [Hana Kami](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hana+Kami) tried to break through and deal the last points of damage, but his Graverobber (brought back via [Gravedigger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gravedigger)) and creature removal were too much for me. It was a close game, though, which made me immensely happy. What I realized is that Spirit Flames is, above all else, stubborn.


*Game 2 (KBC): Black/Green Shirei deck*


 



![Shirei, Shizo's Caretaker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Shirei%2C+Shizo%27s+Caretaker)

A nice opponent with a cool deck. He used [Hana Kami](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hana+Kami), [Bile Urchin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bile+Urchin), and [Sakura-Tribe Elder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sakura-Tribe+Elder) to go along with [Shirei, Shizo's Caretaker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shirei%2C+Shizo%27s+Caretaker). I got a first-turn [Glitterfang](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glitterfang) and did some damage with him (via creature pumpers) while my opponent set up. It took me a while to find five mana to play [Briarknit Kami](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Briarknit+Kami), then I played [Kami of the Tended Garden](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kami+of+the+Tended+Garden) and [Glitterfang](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glitterfang) to start making big creatures. It didn't matter a whit, though, since my opponent now had one-power blockers and Shirei. The game ended more quickly--but also with a fun bang--when he played [Measure of Wickedness](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Measure+of+Wickedness) to finish me off. After the Measure went off and my opponent won at eight life, he showed me a hand of two more Measures and [Kokusho, the Evening Star](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kokusho%2C+the+Evening+Star). Okay, I wasn't going to win that game no matter what I drew.

*Game 3 (Standard): Monowhite Samurai*


We played a game in which I had a hand with two land. Then I never saw another as he beat me down with two [Kitsune Blademaster](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kitsune+Blademaster)s, a [Mothrider Samurai](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mothrider+Samurai), and a [Konda's Hatamoto](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Konda%27s+Hatamoto). It wasn't much fun for either of us so we decided to play again.


The second game I stalled again at two land, but at least had [Promised Kannushi](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Promised+Kannushi) and [Shinen of Life's Roar](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shinen+of+Life%27s+Roar). Thankfully my opponent was creature-shy until the third turn when [Kitsune Blademaster](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kitsune+Blademaster) showed up, then [Opal-Eye, Konda's Yojimbo](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Opal-Eye%2C+Konda%27s+Yojimbo). At this point I had found more land. He attacked with the Blademaster and I killed Opal-Eye with [Unchecked Growth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Unchecked+Growth) on my Shinen. After that we went back and forth, him eating into my life while I channeled [Ghost-Lit Raider](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ghost-Lit+Raider) and used soulshift repeatedly to start picking off his creatures. He attacked with two [Konda's Hatamoto](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Konda%27s+Hatamoto) to bring me to one life, then played another Blademaster. Then, in the game's deciding turn, I cleared the board with [Jiwari, the Earth Aflame](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jiwari%2C+the+Earth+Aflame). Now I could start rebuilding. I had finally drawn land at this point, too. So I played [Glitterfang](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glitterfang) and [Forked-Branch Garami](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forked-Branch+Garami). Then I played [Elder Pine of Jukai](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elder+Pine+of+Jukai) and my [Glitterfang](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glitterfang). My opponent put [Heart of Light](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Heart+of+Light) on my Garami, but on my next attack I spliced [Glacial Ray](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glacial+Ray) onto [Devouring Rage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Devouring+Rage) for thirteen fatal damage. Neat!


*Game 4 (KBC): Black/Green Arcane*


 



![Sink into Takenuma](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Sink+into+Takenuma)

I had a pretty good start with [Hana Kami](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hana+Kami), [Inner Calm, Outer Strength](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inner+Calm%2C+Outer+Strength), and [Burr Grafter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Burr+Grafter). He put up a small defense, but mostly he accelerated his land with [Kodama's Might](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kodama%27s+Might), then made me discard a lot with [Sink into Takenuma](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sink+into+Takenuma). I used [Ghost-Lit Nourisher](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ghost-Lit+Nourisher), then [Burr Grafter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Burr+Grafter) (getting back my Nourisher), on my [Hana Kami](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hana+Kami) to bring him to six, but two big [Swallowing Plague](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swallowing+Plague)s brought him back up to sixteen. I dropped [Kami of the Tended Garden](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kami+of+the+Tended+Garden) to start attacking. The Kami went all the way, even though I couldn't cast all of my green cards in hand because he tied up my one Forest. My opponent finally found [Sensei's Divining Top](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sensei%27s+Divining+Top), revealing three land, and conceded at one life.

*Game 5 (Standard): Black/Blue/Green Gifts deck*


Okay, so his deck had [Gifts Ungiven](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gifts+Ungiven), [Kokusho, the Evening Star](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kokusho%2C+the+Evening+Star), [Hana Kami](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hana+Kami), [Soulless Revival](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soulless+Revival), [Meloku the Clouded Mirror](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Meloku+the+Clouded+Mirror), [Umezawa's Jitte](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Umezawa%27s+Jitte), [Cranial Extraction](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cranial+Extraction), [Time of Need](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Time+of+Need), and [Sensei's Divining Top](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sensei%27s+Divining+Top), among other things. Since this is a Regionals archetype, I did give him a bit of a hard time for playing in the Casual room. So he blew me out of the water, right?


Nope.


You mean I won??


Nope. Let's not get crazy, here.


I'm really loving the weird synergies in this deck. At one point I attacked with a [Hana Kami](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hana+Kami) and [Venerable Kumo](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Venerable+Kumo). I spliced a [Glacial Ray](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glacial+Ray) onto [Inner Calm, Outer Strength](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inner+Calm%2C+Outer+Strength) to kill my opponent's [Hana Kami](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hana+Kami), then sacrificed my [Hana Kami](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hana+Kami) to get back [Inner Calm, Outer Strength](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inner+Calm%2C+Outer+Strength) and play it again on my Kumo. When my Kumo died two turns later, it brought back my [Hana Kami](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hana+Kami) to perform a similar trick on [Briarknit Kami](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Briarknit+Kami). In fact, my opponent's [Cranial Extraction](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cranial+Extraction) was for [Hana Kami](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hana+Kami) and he laughed when he saw that I only had one and that I was playing a preconstructed deck. Anyway, my opponent killed Kokusho *twice*, and we still managed to get to a point where I had two beefy ground attackers (4/4 [Briarknit Kami](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Briarknit+Kami) and 4/4 [Frostling](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Frostling)) and he had Kokusho, Meloku, and two 1/1 tokens. Here's the kicker: We were both at two life! As I untapped, I realized that if I drew either of my [Unchecked Growth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Unchecked+Growth)s, I win. If I drew my lone [Arashi, the Sky Asunder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arashi%2C+the+Sky+Asunder), I win. If I drew [Burr Grafter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Burr+Grafter) to return


Hana Kami


to return [Glacial Ray](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glacial+Ray), I win. It's just crazy that I had such a good chance of winning against his deck. What I drew was [Crushing Pain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crushing+Pain), wishing it was a [Glacial Ray](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glacial+Ray) (in which case I also would have won).

### The Kannushi-Garami Gambit


2-3 is a pretty mediocre start. Look at what I faced and how close my losses were, though, and I think that's pretty darned impressive. Even better, it's not like I was mowing through mana-shy opponents. The games went long. I used my many graveyard tricks to keep my opponents off balance. Howdy boy, I *like* this deck!


Still, there are some cards that simply have to go...


*OUT*: 2 [Crushing Pain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crushing+Pain)


 



![Crushing Pain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Crushing+Pain)

It seems that I drew one of my two [Crushing Pain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crushing+Pain)s in every single game. Twice I used them as discard fodder when my opponent forced me to discard and I was happy to get rid of them. The other two times it killed something, but only after I had lost a creature. I hate two-for-one trades, and I had to work so hard to set up a situation in which [Crushing Pain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crushing+Pain) would be useful that it was laughable. Six damage for two mana looks like a sweet deal, but the fact that [Crushing Pain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crushing+Pain) can't target players and relies on damage already dealt makes it extremely bad. Look at [Glacial Ray](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glacial+Ray) and [Magma Jet](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Magma+Jet) for the same cost, and you can see how much [Crushing Pain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crushing+Pain) suffers in terms of power level.

*OUT*: 1 [Venerable Kumo](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Venerable+Kumo)


I think all you need to do to realize that [Venerable Kumo](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Venerable+Kumo) has no place outside of a Limited environment is compare it with [Forked-Branch Garami](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forked-Branch+Garami). Both are five mana. With the Kumo I get two less power, one less toughness, one less soulshift 4, and an ability to block fliers. Is the ability to block fliers worth all of those negatives? Not on your life. I may like [writing about](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=magic/sok/ayumi) [Venerable Kumo](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Venerable+Kumo), but in practice it's grossly underpowered for my deck. Oh, yeah... for comparison, [Arashi, the Sky Asunder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arashi%2C+the+Sky+Asunder) costs five mana, too.


*OUT*: 2 [Petalmane Baku](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Petalmane+Baku)


I still think that [Petalmane Baku](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Petalmane+Baku) might be a reasonable choice for a five-color *Kamigawa* Block Spirits deck. Maybe. It's silly to rely on its mana-fixing or acceleration, though, because of how inconsistent it is. [Petalmane Baku](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Petalmane+Baku) is almost never going to speed me to a Turn 3 [Briarknit Kami](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Briarknit+Kami), for example. That means it's a 1/2 for two mana. I'm pretty sure I would rather have Zuberas for those stats. Even better, I would rather pay one more mana for [Kodama's Reach](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kodama%27s+Reach) or the same mana for the non-Spirit [Sakura-Tribe Elder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sakura-Tribe+Elder).


*IN*: 3 [Glacial Ray](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glacial+Ray)


 



![Glacial Ray](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Glacial+Ray)

At first I was going to make an even swap for [Crushing Pain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crushing+Pain) and add two [Glacial Ray](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glacial+Ray). That's silly, though. [Glacial Ray](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glacial+Ray) is probably the best arcane card around, and I can't envision a deck with a) [Hana Kami](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hana+Kami) in it, or b) Mountains relying on Spirit/arcane interactions without a full load of [Glacial Ray](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glacial+Ray)s. I might as well pull off the band-aid all at once and add them now. Look over Game 5 to understand why [Glacial Ray](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glacial+Ray) is good, or just check out my [*Kamigawa* Commons Review](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/daily/jm99)[. For this deck, in particular, [Glacial Ray](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glacial+Ray) helps kill two of Spirit Flames' enemies: [Nezumi Graverobber](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nezumi+Graverobber) and [Samurai of the Pale Curtain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Samurai+of+the+Pale+Curtain).

*IN*: 1 [Promised Kannushi](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Promised+Kannushi)


At this point, I think [Hana Kami](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hana+Kami) is probably a more vital one-mana card in the deck than [Promised Kannushi](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Promised+Kannushi). So why add the Kannushi and not [Hana Kami](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hana+Kami)? Mostly because one of the things I did with [Ratimation](/en/articles/archive/building-budget/rats-nest-ratimation-2005-05-16) was start by creating a nucleus I liked and building from there. As great as [Hana Kami](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hana+Kami) is, my two favorite cards in the deck are the Kannushi and [Forked-Branch Garami](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forked-Branch+Garami). I only need one copy here to come up to four copies, which makes my deck more consistent and helps make my dreams of recycling five-mana Spirits a reality.


*IN*: 1 [Forked-Branch Garami](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forked-Branch+Garami)


Speaking of five mana Spirits, I think [Forked-Branch Garami](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forked-Branch+Garami) is the bee's knees (if anyone knows the origin of this saying, by the way, please post it on the Message Boards). It has such a cool, unique effect (double soulshift) attached to a respectable body for its cost. Add all of the [Ghost-Lit Raider](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ghost-Lit+Raider), [Ghost-Lit Nourisher](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ghost-Lit+Nourisher), [Frostling](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Frostling), [Burr Grafter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Burr+Grafter), [Hana Kami](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hana+Kami), [Shinen of Life's Roar](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shinen+of+Life%27s+Roar) craziness that can ensue with the Garami on the table and I'm pretty sure I want four copies. I've only taken out five cards from the deck, though, and that means I can only add a single copy right now. I would be flabbergasted if a fourth copy doesn't appear in the next round of changes.


My deck now looks like this:

![](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Forest)


















The good news is that after only one round of changes, I already have a deck in which I don't really hate any of the cards. It still looks like a mess, though, which is why I need to play some more games.


*Game 6 (KBC): Black/Green Legends*


 



![Ghost-Lit Nourisher](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Ghost-Lit+Nourisher)

My opponent played out some land while I got two [Promised Kannushi](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Promised+Kannushi). He used [Cranial Extraction](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cranial+Extraction) to get all four of my [Glacial Ray](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glacial+Ray)s (wow... he's good!), then I used [Unchecked Growth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Unchecked+Growth) to try and kill him before he could cast the [Kodama of the North Tree](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kodama+of+the+North+Tree) he fetched via [Time of Need](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Time+of+Need). [Ghost-Lit Raider](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ghost-Lit+Raider), [Ghost-Lit Nourisher](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ghost-Lit+Nourisher), and [Ghost-Lit Raider](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ghost-Lit+Raider) all came onto the table, each dying to let my Kannushi get through on the attack. I was stuck on three mana the rest of the game, while he used another [Time of Need](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Time+of+Need) to get [Kokusho, the Evening Star](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kokusho%2C+the+Evening+Star). Here is the frustrating thing: With four mana, I could have cast the [Burr Grafter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Burr+Grafter)s in hand, which would have given me lethal damage and returned the [Ghost-Lit Nourisher](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ghost-Lit+Nourisher) to hand to be used. An [Unchecked Growth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Unchecked+Growth) or [Inner Calm, Outer Strength](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inner+Calm%2C+Outer+Strength) would have also won me the game. Instead, my opponent won at four life by sending both legends at me and then using [Hero's Demise](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hero%27s+Demise) on his own Kokusho.

Game 7 (Standard): Black/Blue Ninjas


time\_bomb had been stalking me for about two weeks, watching almost every game I played over that time. He finally asked me to play, using what he called a modified [Nate Heiss Ninja deck](/en/articles/archive/building-budget/secret-sword-2005-03-18). I cast an early [Shinen of Life's Roar](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shinen+of+Life%27s+Roar), and time\_bomb was forced to hard-cast a [Ninja of the Deep Hours](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ninja+of+the+Deep+Hours). [Glacial Ray](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glacial+Ray) killed his Ninja, then I killed a second with my Shinen and [Burr Grafter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Burr+Grafter). I played [Arashi, the Sky Asunder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arashi%2C+the+Sky+Asunder). [Nekrataal](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nekrataal) killed my Arashi, but I killed his [Nekrataal](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nekrataal) with my Shinen plus [Unchecked Growth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Unchecked+Growth). time\_bomb then played [Ink-Eyes, Servant of Oni](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ink-Eyes%2C+Servant+of+Oni) and the game seemed a lot more bleak. Luckily I found a [Promised Kannushi](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Promised+Kannushi), which died to bring back Arashi. This was significant because he had played [Phantom Wings](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phantom+Wings) on his Ink-Eyes. Arashi held off the regenerating Ninja and we played a stalemate for a long time. Eventually I played [Kami of the Tended Garden](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kami+of+the+Tended+Garden), time\_bomb cast [Walker of Secret Ways](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Walker+of+Secret+Ways) and [Okiba-Gang Shinobi](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Okiba-Gang+Shinobi). I untapped, paid mana for my Kami, channeled [Jiwari, the Earth Aflame](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jiwari%2C+the+Earth+Aflame) to clear everything but the tapped Ink-Eyes, then attacked and channeled [Ghost-Lit Nourisher](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ghost-Lit+Nourisher) for lethal damage. Neat.


*Game 8 (KBC): Monoblue Ninjas*


This was a frustrating game. Not only did my opponent play incredibly slow, I was again mana-shy and stuck on a single Forest with a host of double-green cards in hand. My [Shinen of Life's Roar](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shinen+of+Life%27s+Roar) did some early damage, helped along by [Burr Grafter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Burr+Grafter). But my opponent had [Soratami Cloudskater](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soratami+Cloudskater) with [Umezawa's Jitte](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Umezawa%27s+Jitte), then [Ninja of the Deep Hours](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ninja+of+the+Deep+Hours), then [Higure, the Still Wind](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Higure%2C+the+Still+Wind), then two [Mistblade Shinobi](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mistblade+Shinobi). I got him to eight life with a [Kami of the Tended Garden](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kami+of+the+Tended+Garden) (locking up my one source of green mana), but the Jitte did its work and I died pretty quickly. These mana issues are driving me nuts.


*Game 9 (Standard): Five-color Cogs*


 



![Auriok Salvagers](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Auriok+Salvagers)

I would love to say I had a fighting chance at some point in this game, but I once again faced a manascrewed start with only Forests to my name and red cards in hand. My opponent, meanwhile, got [Trinket Mage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Trinket+Mage) (for [Aether Spellbomb](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aether+Spellbomb)), [Kodama's Reach](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kodama%27s+Reach), [Eternal Witness](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eternal+Witness) (for Reach), replayed [Kodama's Reach](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kodama%27s+Reach), etc. etc. until he had a bazillion land, [Auriok Salvagers](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Auriok+Salvagers), [Aether Spellbomb](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aether+Spellbomb), [Necrogen Spellbomb](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Necrogen+Spellbomb), [Conjurer's Bauble](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Conjurer%27s+Bauble), two Witnesses, and the killer: [Scrabbling Claws](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scrabbling+Claws). By the time I drew and played a Mountain, it was too late. I had three turns in a row where I could play the cards he tried to make me discard from the [Necrogen Spellbomb](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Necrogen+Spellbomb) (two [Ghost-Lit Raider](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ghost-Lit+Raider)s and a [Glacial Ray](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glacial+Ray)), but my opponent could just bounce whatever I targeted and start again the next turn. When he found a [Sunbeam Spellbomb](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sunbeam+Spellbomb) to start letting his life climb, I conceded at twelve life. For the second game in a row, [Devouring Rage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Devouring+Rage) looked silly sitting in my hand.

*Game 10 (KBC): Black/Blue Wisdom deck*


His deck was cool, using the blue and black Honden, [Gnat Miser](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gnat+Miser), [Locust Miser](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Locust+Miser), and some other discard and card-drawing to go along with [Soramaro, First to Dream](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soramaro%2C+First+to+Dream) as a finisher. He put down a couple of [Minamo Scrollkeeper](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Minamo+Scrollkeeper)s on defense while I got out a quick [Promised Kannushi](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Promised+Kannushi) and [Elder Pine of Jukai](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elder+Pine+of+Jukai). For the first time, I realized the synergy between Elder Pine and [Inner Calm, Outer Strength](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inner+Calm%2C+Outer+Strength), which ballooned my Spirit to 9/8 for three mana. After that my opponent was on the defensive, even though he had a 4/4 Soramaro and [Honden of Seeing Winds](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Honden+of+Seeing+Winds) on the table. I channeled [Ghost-Lit Raider](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ghost-Lit+Raider) to kill his legend, then used [Glacial Ray](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glacial+Ray) on a [Gnat Miser](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gnat+Miser) to keep the beats coming. My opponent was able to muster one token defender, but I recycled [Hana Kami](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hana+Kami) for my [Glacial Ray](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glacial+Ray) to end the game.


Time for some more changes.


*IN*: 4 [Kodama's Reach](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kodama%27s+Reach)


 



![Kodama's Reach](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Kodama%27s+Reach)

I wasn't kidding when I said I was sick of the deck's mana issues. Spirit Flames relies on too many cool five-mana Spirits--namely [Forked-Branch Garami](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forked-Branch+Garami), Arashi, and Jiwari--to stall on three or four mana repeatedly. I also seem to find Forests when I need Mountains and vice-versa. Two [Elder Pine of Jukai](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elder+Pine+of+Jukai) aren't near enough to compensate for the deck's wonky mana, and they don't accelerate my mana so much as they ensure I don't miss a land drop. [Kodama's Reach](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kodama%27s+Reach) should solve most of my issues, allowing almost automatically for five mana on Turn 4 once cast. It's also arcane, which should make some of the cards in the deck happy.

The question becomes what to take out to make room for my rather drastic mana move...


*OUT*: 1 [Devouring Rage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Devouring+Rage)


[Devouring Rage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Devouring+Rage) is super cool when it works. The problem is that it has only worked once (Game 3) and sat uselessly in hand three times as often. I like the intent of the card, which is to beef up my creatures while allowing for a way to sacrifice soulshift Spirits. In practice, though, I would rather have another five-mana Spirit or something always useful like [Kodama's Reach](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kodama%27s+Reach). I can see a way to take the deck in which [Devouring Rage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Devouring+Rage) remains the finisher, but it's not the deck I'm going to build.


*OUT*: 2 [Inner Calm, Outer Strength](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inner+Calm%2C+Outer+Strength)


Tricks with [Elder Pine of Jukai](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elder+Pine+of+Jukai) aside, this card is almost never as good as [Unchecked Growth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Unchecked+Growth). Even though I will sometimes get more than a +4/+4 out of it (although not often), the effect of trample on [Unchecked Growth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Unchecked+Growth) is huge. Right now I think the deck has too many creature pumpers and not enough everything else, so it's time for me to start trimming the numbers a little. [Strength of Cedars](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Strength+of+Cedars) currently remains a nice “wow that creature just became enormous” finisher, while [Unchecked Growth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Unchecked+Growth) and [Kodama's Might](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kodama%27s+Might) are vying for which is the most solid card for my deck. [Inner Calm, Outer Strength](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inner+Calm%2C+Outer+Strength) suffers in comparison to all three, unfortunately, at least in a green/red Spirits deck.


*OUT*: 1 [Glitterfang](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glitterfang)


 



![Glitterfang](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Glitterfang)

It's hard not to like [Glitterfang](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glitterfang). It looks strictly worse than Raging Goblin until you combine it with things like [Briarknit Kami](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Briarknit+Kami), [Elder Pine of Jukai](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elder+Pine+of+Jukai), and... and... well, a bunch of cards that aren't in my deck. In fact, I'm about to drop [Briarknit Kami](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Briarknit+Kami). So while he's super spiffy in other decks, I've managed to whittle [Glitterfang](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glitterfang)'s usefulness to almost zero after this round of changes. If I'm not going to take full advantage of Spirit-triggers, then [Frostling](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Frostling) or [Hana Kami](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hana+Kami) are much better one-mana Spirits.

*IN*: 1 [Forked-Branch Garami](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forked-Branch+Garami)


As I said earlier, I want the nucleus of my deck to be four [Promised Kannushi](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Promised+Kannushi) and four [Forked-Branch Garami](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forked-Branch+Garami). Apparently, if you didn't realize it with Ratimation, I love graveyard animation. The fact that I can have a graveyard-focused deck outside of black is fun, too. This probably signals that Spirits and soulshift will be the two core themes of the deck I'm building, with everything else taking a backseat.


*OUT*: 1 [Briarknit Kami](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Briarknit+Kami)


Unfortunately, adding a fourth Garami means I have a crowding at the top of my deck's manacurve. I actually like [Briarknit Kami](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Briarknit+Kami) quite a bit, but I've found it to be too slow in an already slow deck. The biggest indictment, I think, is that I have never wanted to return it to my hand after a [Promised Kannushi](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Promised+Kannushi) dies, preferring instead to focus on Arashi, Jiwari, or a Garami. That's pretty telling, and what it tells me is that [Briarknit Kami](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Briarknit+Kami)'s slot is better used for an additional copy of one of these Spirits.


These changes lead me to want to make one more quick change...


*OUT*: 1 Mountain  
*IN*: 1 Forest


I've switched the ratio of green-to-red cards slightly, but more importantly I've put pressure on drawing green mana via [Kodama's Reach](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kodama%27s+Reach). As a result, I want a different balance between my Forests and Mountains. Given the randomness of the deck and the changes that are sure to come, I imagine the land ratio will bounce around a bit.

That's where I'll pick up next week. So far all of the changes I've made have stayed in *Kamigawa* Block. The deck still has a long way to go, but before I can contemplate the next changes I need to know which format the deck is supposed to play. As a result, it's now time for you to look over my ten games and choose. Speak your mind (and of course try to convince others on the Boards), and I'll get to it next Monday.
