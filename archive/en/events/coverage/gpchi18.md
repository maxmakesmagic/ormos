Day 2 Coverage



2,471 challengers arrived in Chiba, but at the end of eighteen rounds, only one stood tall. Guillem Salvador Arnal not only earned himself a Grand Prix title in his first Grand Prix Top 8, but he also became the first Spanish player ever to win a Japanese Grand Prix! To make things even more impressive, he did so by going 6-0 in the Top 8, sweeping things up with a perfect record!


Ousting out the competition with his Red-White deck, he had to get past Chen Yang in the quarterfinals and Ryohei Kobayashi in the semifinals, before defeating three-time Grand Prix Top 8 competitor Keita Kawasaki in the finals to clinch the trophy.


Rounding off the Top 8 were semifinalist Zhi Yimin - playing in his third Top 8 - as well as quarterfinalists Genta Hagiwara, Kabuki Yashiro, and Naoya Nanba. Once again, hearty congratulations to Guillem Salvador Arnal for winning Grand Prix Chiba 2018 and making all of Spain very proud indeed!

Today, 2,471 challengers converged in Chiba to also try their hand at *Core Set 2019* Limited, their eyes set on the ultimate prize of a gleaming trophy for their mantle.
