Both players are playing in their first Grand Prix Top 8 and were clearly very excited to qualify for Pro Tour Fate Reforged. Zhang Meng Qiu is one of the best from Hong Kong, while Yu Yin has a National Champion title under his belt. After a little friendly banter, both players commenced their match.


Game 1
======



 Zhang opened with [Heir of the Wilds](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Heir+of+the+Wilds) and used [Debilitating Injury](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Debilitating+Injury) to kill an opposing [Mardu Hateblade](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mardu+Hateblade). He refilled his hand and filled his graveyard with [Bitter Revelation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bitter+Revelation). [Scout the Borders](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scout+the+Borders) added five additional cards to his graveyard, allowing him to cast [Hooting Mandrills](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hooting+Mandrills) (for the bargain price of 2 mana) on Turn 5.




 Yu could only manage [Disowned Ancestor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Disowned+Ancestor) and a morph, but he buffed his army with [Abzan Ascendancy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Abzan+Ascendancy). It looked like he was trailing behind, until he added [Siege Rhino](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Siege+Rhino) to the board.




 Zhang tried to find a solution with a second [Bitter Revelation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bitter+Revelation), and it seemed like he was in trouble. [Deprive](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deprive)d of any blue mana, it seemed like he was unable to deploy some of the powerful spells in his hand. He found [Murderous Cut](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Murderous+Cut) to deal with the rhino, but [Ivorytusk Fortress](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ivorytusk+Fortress) was too much for Zhang to handle and he bowed down to the mighty elephant.





*Yu Yin wields the power of [Abzan Ascendancy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Abzan+Ascendancy) and [Ivorytusk Fortress](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ivorytusk+Fortress).*
