![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gpmel02/a863.jpg)Milton drafted a solid W/B deck featuring [Akroma's Vengeance](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Akroma%27s+Vengeance), Tristan had drafted a seemingly W/R deck but ended up with so much lot white including [Jareth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jareth) and [Aven Brigadier](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aven+Brigadier) that he played mono white.

### Game 1

Milton started fast with a turn 2 [Wretched Anurid](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wretched+Anurid) backed up with a morph. Tristan countered with a turn 2 [Whipcorder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Whipcorder) enchanted with [Crown of Awe](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crown+of+Awe). Milton stayed the aggressor with a [Screeching Buzzard](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Screeching+Buzzard) despite his Anurid suffering from [Sandskin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sandskin). A crucial play came when Milton's morph enchanted with [Crown of Suspicion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crown+of+Suspicion) was blocked by Tristan's [Daunting Defender](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Daunting+Defender). Milton morphed up a [Daru Lancer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Daru+Lancer), crushing the defender. Tristan untapped and dropped his bomb, [Jareth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jareth). Milton, after attacking and putting Tristan to 5, cast HIS bomb, [Akroma's Vengeance](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Akroma%27s+Vengeance), clearing the board. Tristan was out of gas, while Milton [Aphetto Dredging](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aphetto+Dredging)-ed up a [Nantuko Husk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nantuko+Husk) and the Anurid and casting a [Whipcorder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Whipcorder). Tristan's medic wasn't enough and he conceded.

Game 2 

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gpmel02/a864.jpg)Tristan played first, but once again Milton was the aggressor with [Glory Seeker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glory+Seeker), [Battlefield Medic](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Battlefield+Medic) and [Screeching Buzzard](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Screeching+Buzzard). Tristan made two [Gustcloak Harrier](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gustcloak+Harrier)s but could not block due to the medic and was forced to race. Milton kept up the pressure with [Boneknitter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Boneknitter) and a morph, while Tristan used [Pearlspear Courier](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pearlspear+Courier) to make his harrier a [Serra Angel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Serra+Angel). Milton seemed to have the edge when Tristan blocked his [Glory Seeker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glory+Seeker) with the 4/4 harrier. Milton let the seeker die and then cast [Crown of Suspicion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crown+of+Suspicion) on the [Pearlspear Courier](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pearlspear+Courier), killing it and reducing the harrier back to 2/2, which then also died. Tristan was outnumbered and low on life, but refused to yield and kept racing with the harrier while making a [Grassland Crusader](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grassland+Crusader). Milton's buzzard and a newly cast [Severed Legion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Severed+Legion) put Tristan on 3 life, while Milton was on 8 from the harrier. Tristan was facing almost certain death next turn. He untapped and attacked with harrier, pumping it with the crusader, [Piety Charm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Piety+Charm)ing it and casting [Inspirit](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inspirit) on it to deal exactly 8 damage to Milton for the kill.

### Game 3

Milton played but started slower with a [Severed Legion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Severed+Legion) and morph. Tristan looked in good shape with [Whipcorder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Whipcorder), Harrier and [Pearlspear Courier](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pearlspear+Courier). Milton stalled on three land and cast a wretched Anurid and [Shepherd of Rot](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shepherd+of+Rot), after having the legion killed by a [Unified Strike](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Unified+Strike). Milton was taking some serious damage from a 4/4 harrier and his own Anurid. Tristan was in a comfortable position, choosing to take three from the Anurid each turn rather than blocking with his 4/4 harrier. When Milton's [Profane Prayers](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Profane+Prayers) on the courier was countered by Tristan's [Piety Charm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Piety+Charm), the game was nearing its end as Milton was forced to start chump blocking with the shepherd. Milton died on five land with [Akroma's Vengeance](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Akroma%27s+Vengeance) in hand when Tristan tapped Milton's [Screeching Buzzard](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Screeching+Buzzard) and fly in for the win with the 4/4 [Gustcloak Harrier](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gustcloak+Harrier).

**Final result:** Tristan 2-1.
