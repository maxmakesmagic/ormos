*Fate Reforged* [Prerelease Events](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/fate-reforged-prerelease-and-release-events-2014-01-12#prerelease) (which ran last week) and [Release Events](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/fate-reforged-prerelease-and-release-events-2014-01-12#release) (available now through February 18) gave each participant five cards from the Ugin’s Fate boosters. Different events are awarding different cards. We’re saving Ugin himself for the future, but the rest of the alternate art promos are available through these events!
