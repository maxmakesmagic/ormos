"How do I improve at *Magic*?"


This is one of the most common questions I'm asked while streaming. Fortunately, our community is filled with passionate players who spend their time creating mountains of content serving this very purpose.


Listening to podcasts is, I believe, a great way to improve your game. They're easy to consume and you can listen anywhere. Below are five of the best podcasts for taking your game to the next level.




---

Limited Resources
=================


Likely the most popular *Magic* podcast, Limited Resources (LR) exists for the purpose of improving its listeners' *Magic* skills, specifically in Limited. LR breaks down *Magic* concepts into lessons you can internalize and apply at FNM and local tournaments.


LR is cohosted by Marshall Sutcliffe and Luis Scott-Vargas. Marshall, one of the original cohosts of the show, is a longtime *Magic* player and Draft aficionado. Marshall does live video commentary at Grand Prix and Pro Tours and writes Limited [articles for DailyMTG](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/152186). Luis is a Hall of Famer and Pro Tour Champion. After years of encouraging people to play seven-drops, he's come around to dispensing great Draft advice on LR.


The most popular episodes on LR are its set reviews. With the release of each new set, the hosts will discuss every card in the set and give it a grade based on how good they expect it to be. This episode is 3–4 hours long, and it serves as a great primer for those who want to have a leg up at Prereleases. Other content you can expect from LR includes its level-up episodes. In these, the hosts will distill complex *Magic* skills and boil them down into basic takeaways. The subjects range from how to effectively use removal all the way to attacking and blocking in Limited.


LR is a weekly podcast with a new episode released every Thursday. To listen to LR, [click here](http://lrcast.com/).


Top Level Podcast
=================


Top Level Podcast (TLP) is cohosted by Patrick Chapin and Michael Flores. The two are known for being some of the best deck builders in the history of the game. Each episode focuses on a specific card, which Patrick and Mike will break down to the nitty-gritty.


Patrick "The Innovator" Chapin is a member of the Pro Tour Hall of Fame and a Pro Tour Champion. He's also the author of *Next Level Magic* and *Next Level Deckbuilding*. Michael Flores is known in the community as a strategy writer for StarCityGames.com and the designer of many tournament-winning decks.


In each episode, Patrick and Michael will select a couple of cards in Standard and discuss why they think they're good or bad in the format. This can include discussions of cards that should be seeing more play than they are, or cards that are overhyped and should die down soon.


Accompanying the discussion of specific cards, the hosts will go into deep analysis of popular decks in the metagame, and how the cards fit into those decks. This in-depth look at how elite players break down cards, decks, and matchups gives the listeners of TLP the tools to better approach any Constructed format.

The Command Zone
================


The Command Zone is your resource for all things Commander. The hosts of the show, Jimmy Wong and Josh Lee Kwai, are longtime *Magic* players with a specific focus on multiplayer formats.


The Command Zone's focus is not just strategy—it covers all aspects of multiplayer *Magic*. The hosts dive deep into everything from deck building to managing table politics.


You can expect to see set reviews, speculation on how new cards from upcoming sets will affect the Commander metagame, discussion of rules and card interactions, and ideas for how to build your next deck.


The Command Zone comes out on a weekly basis, and you can [find the episodes here](http://www.rocketjump.com/podcasts/#thecommandzone).


Constructed Resources
=====================


The sister podcast to Limited Resources, Constructed Resources (CR) is hosted by Marshall Sutcliffe and *Magic* Hall of Famer Eric Froehlich. The structure of the show is similar to LR, except the focus is on Constructed *Magic*.


At CR, you'll get the same kind of set reviews that you would with LR, except the hosts will only cover cards that are likely to see Constructed play. CR also releases level-up episodes covering sideboarding, keeping versus mulliganing, and more.


You can learn more about CR and [listen to the episodes here](http://www.crcast.com/).


Allied Strategies
=================


Hosted by Tristan Killeen, Neal Oliver, and Ben Weitz, Allied Strategies focuses on both Limited and Constructed *Magic*.


Because the hosts of this podcast are also *Magic* grinders, you'll hear interesting stories of life on the road. They'll give you the inside scoop on their Pro Tour testing, how they approach Limited formats, and how their approach changes over time. In addition, they analyze deck performance, discuss deck tuning strategies, and provide in-depth card evaluation.


Allied Strategies is released weekly, and you can [learn more about it here](https://alliedstrategiespodcast.wordpress.com/).
