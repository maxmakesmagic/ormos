 A longtime member of the Pro Tour and Grand Prix coverage staff, Nate Price now works making beautiful words for all of you lovely people as the community manager for organized play. When not covering events, he lords over the @MagicProTour Twitter account, ruling with an iron fist. 






Those of you tuning in to [twitch.tv/magic](http://www.twitch.tv/magic) this weekend for Pro Tour *Fate Reforged* might notice a slight difference from the experience we've offered at past Pro Tours: we have decided to disable our Twitch chat for this event.



As *Magic* has grown, so has our viewing audience, making moderation of our ever-growing audience increasingly more important. In order to ensure that we continue to provide our community with the best family-friendly experience possible, we've decided to disable our chat and look for other viable alternatives to maintain the engagement with our audience that Twitch chat is supposed to enable.



To ensure that we are able to deliver the high level of viewer engagement that we strive for, we're providing an alternative engagement platform to viewers at home: CoverItLive. CoverItLive offers our audience the opportunity to participate in a fully-moderated chatroom, complete with community-driven features, opportunities to directly engage with the coverage, and a greater ability to have your voice heard.



CoverItLive allows us to introduce many interactive elements to our coverage experience that we hope viewers at home will enjoy, including:



* AMAs with members of R&D, players, and Wizards of the Coast staff members
* Interactive video segments, such as the "So What Now" drafting segment
* Opportunities to help decide the Feature Match seen on video
* Various polls, Q&A segments, and other community-driven content


CoverItLive is easily accessible from the [Pro Tour *Fate Reforged* coverage page](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/ptfrf). All you have to do is scroll down past the video stream to the CoverItLive chat prompt and input a screen name, and then you're free to join in the conversation, vote on polls, and have your say!



We'll continue to provide the same high-quality video production expected from the Pro Tour, and hope that the adoption of CoverItLive will allow even greater engagement with our audience. As we continue to evaluate this change, Twitch chat will still be enabled for Grand Prix coverage.



We hope you enjoy the Pro Tour and look forward to interacting with you all via CoverItLive all weekend long!
