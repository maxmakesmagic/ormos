We have a new No. 1 at the home of the *Magic* Top 25 Pro Rankings, and that new No. 1 is Eric Froehlich. Although he didn't quite make it to the Top 8 of Pro Tour *Dragons of Tarkir*, his excellent finish nudges him ahead of long-time leader Owen Turtenwald, who slips to No. 2. Sam Black was always just behind the curve for Top 8 in Brussels, but he still secured a ton of points, which catapults him from No. 9 last week to No. 3 this week. Also joining Black with a six-spot boost is Seth Manfield, who now joins the Top 10 at No. 7.



Those two still weren't the biggest gainers this week, though. That accolade belongs to Josh Utter-Leyton, whose excellent performance sees him move up nine, from No. 23 to No. 14. Five new entries joined the rankings as a result of their Brussels performances. The highest is a notable Standard mind, Brad Nelson, and it is no surprise to see him entering at No. 16. Craig Wescoe narrowly missed out on the Top 8—his 12-4 record was tied for 8th spot in Brussels—and he enters at No. 18, just ahead of two players who *did* make it all the way to Sunday, Ondrej Strasky of the Czech Republic (No. 19) and Shota Yasooka of Japan (No. 20). Meanwhile, Hall of Famer Jelger Wiegersma joins the rankings in the precarious No. 25 spot. With limited opportunities to play, he may not be with us for long, but there's always the chance of another strong Pro Tour finish at Vancouver when PT *Origins* rolls around.



So, six up, twelve down, two no change, and five new entries. That's the whirlwind guide to the *Magic* Top 25 Pro Rankings. Join us again next week for more!
