As the prefecture neighbors the Korean peninsula to the continent of China with a strait in between, it was the first place to touch the continental culture in Japan. Ever since the Government-General of Kyushu was set up in the place known as Dazaifu in the 7th century, Fukuoka has grown as the hub of the Kyushu district.

Fukuoka City, blessed with a mild climate and a seaside location, is situated close to the Asian continent. Since ancient times the city has flourished as a crossroads of international exchange. Fukuoka offers the visitor a warm welcome and a refreshing atmosphere.

Fukuoka City has taken advantage of the beauty of nature and the lessons of history in its search for the urban ideal. As one of the liveliest cities in Japan, Fukuoka makes an ideal base for international conferences and tourism.

As the prefecture neighbors the Korean peninsula to the continent of China with a strait in between, Fukuoka was the first place to touch the continental culture in Japan. Ever since the Government-General of Kyushu was set up in the place known as Dazaifu in the 7th century, Fukuoka has grown as the hub of the Kyushu district.

Being a shrine sacred to the god of learning, the Tenmangu is visited by many people, students seeking luck in their entrance examinations mostly, all the year round. Also, the prefecture has the Senbutsu Shonyudo, a limestone cavern with beautiful stalagmite and stone pillars known for the discovery of fossil remains of Naumann elements, and other places of natural beauty. In addition, there are theme parks worth visiting, such as the Space World showing what is envisioned as near-futuristic cities in space and on earth.

The city of Fukuoka, also known by it other tradition name Hakata, is not only the center of administration and economy in the Kyushu district but a terminal at which air routes and railroads converge. There, Hakata Dontaku, a livelyport festival that is staged every spring, is a spectacle. Highlighted with a parade of painted children, men and women in fancy costume and on decorated vehicles and posture-dancing people through the streets, this event draws more than 300 groups and about 25,000 citizens, plus more than 2 million spectators.
