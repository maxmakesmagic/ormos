It's cool new tournaments and formats week here on "Decks of the Week!" To kick things off, we update the Cruise Qualifier tournament Top 8s. For those who haven't heard, the **Magic** Cruise is a special opportunity put together by Legion Events. It features a cruise vacation filled with **Magic** including a PTQ on board the ship, a *Conflux* release event, special **Magic** V.I.P.s, R&D panels, and so much more. You can read more about it [at the official Legion Events page](/en/events/coverage/magic-cruise-qualifying-season-top-8-decklists). To find a qualifier tournament near you, which awards a free cruise to the winner, check out Legion Event's [official Cruise Qualifier schedule](http://www.legionevents.com/cruise/CruiseQualifier.htm) (the cruise is open to all; you don't have to win a qualifier to participate). And of course, the Standard lists from the Cruise Qualifiers are a perfect way to get your feet wet before the upcoming [State Championships](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/magazine/article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/news/10092008). Find out where yours is located at [MTGChamps.com](http://www.mtgchamps.com/).


Of course, what would Decks of the Week be without a PTQ update? The Kyoto qualifying season is well underway, and results keep pouring in from all over the nation. We've got your official update on who won and with what draft strategy all here for convenient perusal!


Finally, we'll wrap things up with the usual Premier Events rundown on **Magic Online**. As an exciting bonus for this week (as if even *more* Standard lists to ogle over wasn't enough!) we're giving you the Top 8 lists from the *Shards of Alara* Release Events. Of course, it's not too late for you to join in on the fun! Queues are firing off around the clock, so [what are you waiting for](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=magic/digital/magiconline.aspx)?
