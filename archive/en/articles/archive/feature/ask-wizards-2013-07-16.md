 **Q: How do I reset my password for the Planeswalker Points website? I have to have a new computer-generated password sent to my email every time I want to log into my account. â€”Jed L.**

Hi Jed!


To change your Planeswalker Points password, you need to navigate over to the [DCI Personal Information Center](https://webapp.wizards.com/login.aspx?target=personal), which looks like this:

Use your DCI number and your current password (the computer-generated one) to log in. That'll take you to your DCI personal page, which will look something like this:

Click on "Change Password" in the My Links table and there you go. You'll have to type in your current password once more, but then you'll be able to set whatever password you like. That will then be the password not only for your DCI page, but also for [PlaneswalkerPoints.com](http://www.wizards.com/magic/planeswalkerpoints).
