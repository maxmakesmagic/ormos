It's about time we took a look at the *Fate Reforged* packaging and all of the veiled secrets those images contain, don't you think?


Hints abound as we look at the wrappers, boxes, and containers that hold all of those sweet, sweet *Fate Reforged* cards. Let's start, as always, with the booster packs you'll be gleefully ripping open very soon.


Boosters
========


First up we have our boy, the colorless dragon you all know and love and saw on [Christmas Day](/node/321776).

Next up is some packaging featuring the art on a card that was revealed earlier this week by the [European Community Team](https://www.facebook.com/MagicTheGathering?fref=nf), Temporal Trespass.

Finally we have this…well…I'm not even sure what this thing is. Whatever it is, it looks ugly. And mean.

And all of them are going to come in booster boxes that look a bit like this:

Fat Pack
========


As we often do, we'll also be selling Fat Packs with *Fate Reforged*, giving you an opportunity to pick up a pretty epic-looking box containing nine booster packs and a Spindown™ life counter.

Clash Pack
==========


Finally, *Fate Reforged* also features the return of Clash Packs! These customizable decks meant to be played against one another or combined are fun and popular additions to the lineup. We're going to hide the cards on the front until the week after preview season, but trust me, they're pretty spicy!

You'll be able to get all of these when *Fate Reforged* releases at a store near you on January 23, 2015. Choose your fate.
