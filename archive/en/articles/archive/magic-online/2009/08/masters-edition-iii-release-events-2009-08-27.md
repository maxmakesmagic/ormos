We do not recognize "I and a friend jointly own the account," "It's my brother's account but he gave it to me," or similar. The only exception is an adult may authorize a single dependent child age 13-17 to play on an account that adult has purchased.


A list of all players that have qualified for the *Masters Edition III* Championship will be maintained on the Wizards of the Coast web site. Players will be registered into the championship after the downtime on Wednesday, September 16. It will be the player's responsibility to make sure that they have been properly entered into this event and are able to join it PRIOR to the start of the Championship. If a player is qualified and is unable to join the championship, they will need to contact customer service for assistance.
