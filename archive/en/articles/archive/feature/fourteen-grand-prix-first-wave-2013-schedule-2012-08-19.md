The first season of Grand Prix play next year showcases fourteen events visiting ten countries over the first three months. The new season opens as 2012 closes out, with Indianapolis, Indiana, hosting the opening Grand Prix of the 2013 season just before Christmas.

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/grandprix_300.jpg)Once the calendar turns to January, Grand Prix will visit Denver, Colorado; Atlantic City, New Jersey; Singapore; Bilbao, Spain; and Sydney, Australia. February cities include London; Quebec City, Canada; and Charlotte, North Carolina. Grand Prix Quebec City takes place the week after Pro Tour *Gatecrash* in Montreal.

The season closes out in March with visits to Yokohama, Japan; Verona, Italy, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil; San Diego, California; and Utrecht, Netherlands. 

Formats for these Grand Prix will be announced in the coming months, as well as the other Grand Prix in 2013.
