*Jump In!* Happening Now
========================


If you enjoyed *Jumpstart*, you'll love *Innistrad: Midnight Hunt* *Jump In!* that's happening right now. Select two themed packets of Standard-legal cards, and then try out playstyles in the Standard format without a heavy focus on deckbuilding—just jump in and play!


New players, *Jump In!* is a fun next step as you build your play experience, card knowledge, and your collection of cards. Add Standard-legal cards to your collection while mastering them in live matches.
