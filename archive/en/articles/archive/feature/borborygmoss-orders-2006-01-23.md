[Borborygmos](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Borborygmos) (sound it out -- it's quite pronounceable, and actually rather fun to say), a cyclops the size of some of Ravnica's tallest towers, is the Gruul guild leader. He holds court over Gruul's motley clans and smashes foes with a maul made from a slab of masonry tangled in the roots of its tree-trunk handle.

Check out his improvised metal bracer on his left arm: it's constructed from dozens of scavenged shields, some marked with the signets of other guilds.


In [Borborygmos](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Borborygmos)'s flavor text, fellow legend [Teysa, Orzhov Scion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Teysa%2C+Orzhov+Scion) weighs in with a snarky comment about the Gruul clanlord:



> *“It’s easy to see why those Gruul dirtbags follow him—the only orders he gives are ‘Crush them!’ and ‘We eat!’”

Note that on the Gruul's uncounterable [Pillage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pillage)-variant, [Wreak Havoc](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wreak+Havoc), our cyclops friend does indeed deliver one of those orders:
