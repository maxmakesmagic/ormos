*What nicknames do you have for cards that you think should catch on?*

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/mtgcom/authorpics/authorpic_kellydigges.jpg)**Kelly Digges:** I've got a couple that need no explanation, most of them simple but hilarious misreadings like [Flavor of the Overbeing](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Favor+of+the+Overbeing), [Orzhov Enthusiast](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Orzhov+Euthanist), or my personal favorite, [Bacon of Immortality](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Beacon+of+Immortality).

A friend of mine, though, introduced us all to an unlikely nickname for an unlikely savior. His early Limited experiences with [Hovermyr](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hovermyr) were extremely positive—it just did everything he needed a card to do in those particular games—and so he took to referring to it as Hero Myr.

We quickly realized that [Hovermyr](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hovermyr) can be easily anagrammed into [Hero Myr V](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hovermyr), which sounds like an anime or something. Our social circle has since referred to that card, and occasionally each other, as [Hero Myr V](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hovermyr).

More recently, the little Myr that could was joined on Hero Squad by a new partner: the extraterrestrial space ranger [Moon Hero N](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Moon+Heron).
