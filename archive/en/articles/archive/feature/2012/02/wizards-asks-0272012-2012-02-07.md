Quick rundown of my picks:


> 
> * [Garruk Relentless](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Garruk+Relentless) might be the most powerful planeswalker in Standard; it is also one of the easiest to cast and fits in with aggro and control plans.
> * [Primeval Titan](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Primeval+Titan) has been the defining fatty for the entire time it's been around and I don't expect that to change now.
> * People love Titans and discounts and breaking the color pie—[Phyrexian Metamorph](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phyrexian+Metamorph) does all three while answering [Thrun, the Last Troll](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thrun%2C+the+Last+Troll) and comboing well with [Birthing Pod](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Birthing+Pod).
> * Admittedly, [Snapcaster Mage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snapcaster+Mage) is much better in older formats with [Brainstorm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brainstorm) and [Ancestral Recall](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ancestral+Recall) to flashback; that doesn't mean it can't be the most powerful card in Standard.
> * [Seachrome Coast](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seachrome+Coast), [Mana Leak](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak), and [Ponder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ponder) are along for the ride in [Snapcaster Mage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snapcaster+Mage)– and [Delver of Secrets](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Delver+of+Secrets)–powered decks. Of course, [Mana Leak](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak) and [Ponder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ponder) get played in the controlling blue decks as well.
> * There are other enchantment options, but [Honor of the Pure](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Honor+of+the+Pure) is the only one that is always a four-of in the decks it's in.
> * Various swords, pikes, and living weapons are the high-profile artifact options, but [Sphere of the Suns](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sphere+of+the+Suns) is a key cog in blue-based control decks and green-based ramp decks.
> * Finally, Patrick Chapin himself informed me that he hasn't lost a Standard match in three years, so that seemed like an easy pick.
