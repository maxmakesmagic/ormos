The Pro Tour Hall of Fame elect, multiple Grand Prix and Pro Tour Top 8 player – winning Pro Tour Amsterdam in 2010 and Grand Prix San Jose (with his teammates Matt Sperling and David Williams) and Mexico City in 2012 – is undoubtedly one of the game's greats. With his career and successes spanning both Limited and Constructed formats, his understanding and approach to the game is insightful and entertaining."

There are a handful of players the caliber of Paul Rietzl. The Pro Tour Hall of Fame elect, multiple Grand Prix and Pro Tour Top 8 player – winning Pro Tour Amsterdam in 2010 and Grand Prix San Jose (with his teammates Matt Sperling and David Williams) and Mexico City in 2012 – is undoubtedly one of the game's greats. With his career and successes spanning both Limited and Constructed formats, his understanding and approach to the game is insightful and entertaining.





*Pro Tour Hall of Fame elect and 13th-ranked Paul Rietzl is one of the game's greatest players.*
