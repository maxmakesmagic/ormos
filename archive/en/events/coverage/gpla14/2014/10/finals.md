Red-Green Monsters against Mono-Red Sligh—who would have thought that would be our finals today? But it was. Everyone at the tournament was ready for Jeskai and Abzan decks, and the players with innovative or under-the-radar decks came out on top. Ulanov and Scheid were among them, and after a long road to the finals, they now get to play one final match to claim the title, the bragging rights, and the trophy.



**The Players**



Ulanov, a 27-year-old software engineer from Russia who has been living in the U.S., is the slightly more experienced player in the finals, having several StarCityGames Open Top 8s to his name. Daniel Scheid, a 23-year old courier from California, merely listed "2nd at several FNM" as his previous high-water mark. Despite, slight experience differences, making it to the finals of a Grand Prix has been a break-out finish for both players.



**The Decks and Matchup**




 Scheid's red-green deck contains [Polukranos, World Eater](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Polukranos%2C+World+Eater); [Nykthos, Shrine to Nyx](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nykthos%2C+Shrine+to+Nyx); and [Hornet Queen](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hornet+Queen), but doesn't have four copies of any of them. So he's not all-in on the devotion plan. Instead, he has four copies of [Stormbreath Dragon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stormbreath+Dragon), allowing him to win games by ramping into big flyers.




 Ulanov's mono-red deck features heavy hitters like [Monastery Swiftspear](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Monastery+Swiftspear) and [Goblin Rabblemaster](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Rabblemaster), backed up by cards like [Hammerhand](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hammerhand) and [Stoke the Flames](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stoke+the+Flames) that can clear away the blockers. His deck can be blazingly fast, but can have trouble beating the more powerful cards from the green deck if a game goes long.




**Game 1**




 Scheid had a great hand with [Elvish Mystic](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elvish+Mystic) and [Sylvan Caryatid](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sylvan+Caryatid), while Ulanov did not curve out as well: He had [Monastery Swiftspear](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Monastery+Swiftspear) on turn one and merely a [Dragon Mantle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragon+Mantle) and a shrug on turn two, missing his second land drop.
