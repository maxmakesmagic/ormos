**Returning Mechanic: Double-Faced Cards**


Double-faced cards originally appeared in the *Innistrad* block, and they return in the *Shadows over Innistrad* set. Instead of the typical card face and *Magic* card back, double-faced cards have two faces: a front face and a back face. The front face has a sun symbol in its upper left corner. The back face has a moon symbol in its upper left corner. Other than distinguishing one face from the other, these symbols have no effect on gameplay.

Though most of the rules governing double-faced cards haven't changed, you can find a few minor revisions in the section titled "[Rules Changes: Double-Faced Cards](#doublefaced)." The following rules have remained the same:


* Each face of a double-faced card has its own set of characteristics: name, types, subtypes, abilities, and so on. While a double-faced card is on the battlefield, consider only the characteristics of the face that's currently up. The other set of characteristics is ignored.
* While a double-faced card isn't on the battlefield, consider only the characteristics of its front face. For example, the above card has only the characteristics of [Aberrant Researcher](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aberrant+Researcher) in the graveyard, even if it was [Perfected Form](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Perfected+Form) on the battlefield before it was put into the graveyard.
* The converted mana cost of a double-faced card not on the battlefield is the converted mana cost of its front face.
* The back face of a double-faced card may have a color indicator that defines its color. For example, [Perfected Form](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Perfected+Form) is a blue permanent.
* The back face of a double-faced card can't be cast.
* A double-faced card enters the battlefield with its front face up by default, unless a spell or ability instructs you to put it onto the battlefield transformed, in which case it enters with its back face up.
* Transforming a permanent doesn't affect any Auras or Equipment attached to that permanent. Similarly, any counters on the permanent will remain on that permanent after it transforms. Any continuous effects from a resolved spell or ability will continue to affect it.
* Damage marked on a double-faced permanent will stay marked on that permanent after it transforms.



---

**Rules Changes: Double-Faced Cards**


There are three new rules that affect how double-faced cards work.


202.3b The converted mana cost of a double-faced permanent's back face is calculated as though it had the mana cost of its front face. This is a change from previous rules. If a permanent is copying the back face of a double-faced card (even if the card representing that copy is itself a double-faced card), the converted mana cost of that permanent is 0.


* For example, [Krallenhorde Howler](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Krallenhorde+Howler) is the back face of [Duskwatch Recruiter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duskwatch+Recruiter), which has mana cost 1G. [Krallenhorde Howler](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Krallenhorde+Howler)'s converted mana cost is 2.
* A creature that's a copy of [Krallenhorde Howler](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Krallenhorde+Howler) will have converted mana cost 0. Note that a creature that's a copy of [Duskwatch Recruiter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duskwatch+Recruiter) also has mana cost 1G, and thus has converted mana cost 2.

711.7a If a player is instructed to put a non-double-faced card onto the battlefield transformed, that card stays in its current zone. This is a change from previous rules.


* For example, say a card that isn't a double-faced card (such as [Altered Ego](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Altered+Ego)) is a copy of a card with an ability that may return it to the battlefield transformed (such as [Accursed Witch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Accursed+Witch)). When that copy dies, the triggered ability that tries to return it to the battlefield transformed will have no effect. The card will remain in its owner's graveyard.

701.25e If an activated ability of a permanent tries to transform that permanent, the permanent transforms only if it hasn't transformed since the ability was put onto the stack. The same is true for triggered abilities of a permanent that aren't delayed triggered abilities. If a delayed triggered ability of a permanent tries to transform that permanent, the permanent transforms only if it hasn't transformed since that delayed triggered ability was created.


* For example, if you choose to activate the ability of [Elusive Tormentor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elusive+Tormentor) (a creature with the ability "1, Discard a card: Transform [Elusive Tormentor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elusive+Tormentor)") four times in response to one another, the first ability to resolve will cause it to transform and the other three instances of the ability will have no effect.



---

**Game Supplement: Checklist Cards**


It's important that the cards in your deck be indistinguishable from one another. To accomplish this with double-faced cards, you can use the checklist cards found in some *Shadows over Innistrad* booster packs. A checklist card acts as a substitute for a double-faced card in hidden zones or wherever its identity is concealed (such as in exile if it's exiled face down). Using checklist cards is optional, but in tournaments, players with double-faced cards must use either checklist cards or opaque card sleeves (or both).


* There are two checklist cards for the double-faced cards in *Shadows over Innistrad*: one for common and uncommon cards and one for rare and mythic rare cards. You'll need the correct checklist cards for the double-faced cards you wish to play.
* You must have the actual double-faced card the checklist card is representing with you. The double-faced card should be kept apart from the rest of the deck and your sideboard.
* A checklist card can't be included in a deck except when it's being used to represent a double-faced card.
* You must clearly mark exactly one circle on the checklist card to indicate which double-faced card it represents.
* During the game, a checklist card is considered to be the double-faced card it represents.
* If a checklist card enters a public zone (the battlefield, the graveyard, the stack, or exile unless it's exiled face down), use the actual double-faced card and set the checklist card aside. If the double-faced card is put into a hidden zone (your hand or library), use the checklist card again.
* If a double-faced card is exiled face down or put onto the battlefield face down, keep its identity hidden by using the face-down checklist card or opaque card sleeves (or both).



---

**Returning Theme: Double-Faced Werewolves**


With Avacyn's Cursemute weakening, Innistrad faces the reemergence of vicious werewolves. Each Werewolf creature in the *Shadows over* *Innistrad* set is a double-faced card. Each front face has the same triggered ability that may transform it. Similarly, each back face has the same triggered ability that may transform it back.

> 


* These abilities look at the entire previous turn, even if the Werewolf with that ability wasn't on the battlefield for some or all of that turn.
* To trigger the back face's transform ability, a single player must have cast two or more spells during the previous turn. If multiple players each cast just one spell during the previous turn, the ability won't trigger.



---

**New Keyword Ability: Skulk**


Skulk is a new keyword for insidious creatures that creep by unseen.


702.117. Skulk


702.117a Skulk is an evasion ability.


702.117b A creature with skulk can't be blocked by creatures with greater power. (See rule 509, "Declare Blockers Step.")


702.117c Multiple instances of skulk on the same creature are redundant.


* Skulk matters only as blockers are chosen. Modifying either creature's power after blockers are chosen won't cause the attacking creature to become unblocked.
* If you cause a creature to have 0 power or less, use the actual value (which may be negative) to determine whether it can block or be blocked. A creature with skulk and 0 or less power most likely won't be blocked, but it won't deal combat damage and won't trigger any abilities that trigger when combat damage is dealt.



---

**Returning Keyword Ability: Madness**


Madness is a keyword ability that previously appeared in the *Odyssey* and *Time Spiral* blocks that lets you benefit from discarding cards. The rules for madness have changed slightly since its last appearance; see "[Rules Changes: Madness](#madness)" below.


![](https://media.wizards.com/2016/aksdjciawolkcc0_soi/en_Uo24yZGE3R.png)



> 
> Just the Wind  
> 
> 1U  
> 
> Instant  
> 
> Return target creature to its owner's hand.  
> 
> Madness U *(If you discard this card, discard it into exile. When you do, cast it for its madness cost or put it into your graveyard.)*
> 
> 
> 


The official rules for madness are as follows:


702.34. Madness


702.34a Madness is a keyword that represents two abilities. The first is a static ability that functions while the card with madness is in a player's hand. The second is a triggered ability that functions when the first ability is applied. "Madness [cost]" means "If a player would discard this card, that player discards it, but exiles it instead of putting it into his or her graveyard" and "When this card is exiled this way, its owner may cast it by paying [cost] rather than paying its mana cost. If that player doesn't, he or she puts this card into his or her graveyard."


702.34b Casting a spell using its madness ability follows the rules for paying alternative costs in rules 601.2b and 601.2f–h.


* Cards are discarded in a *Magic* game only from a player's hand. Effects that put cards from a player's library into that player's graveyard do not cause those cards to be discarded.
* A spell cast for its madness cost is put onto the stack like any other spell. It can be countered, copied, and so on. As it resolves, it's put onto the battlefield if it's a permanent card or into its owner's graveyard if it's an instant or sorcery card.
* Casting a spell for its madness cost doesn't change its mana cost or its converted mana cost. You just pay the madness cost instead.
* Effects that cause you to pay more or less for a spell will cause you to pay that much more or less for its madness cost, too.
* Madness works independently of why you're discarding the card. You could discard it to pay a cost, because a spell or ability tells you to, or even because you have too many cards in your hand at the end of your turn. You can't discard a card with madness just because you want to, though.
* When you cast a card with madness, it was still discarded. If it was discarded to pay a cost, that cost is still paid. Abilities that trigger when a card is discarded will still trigger.
* If you choose not to cast a card with madness when the madness triggered ability resolves, it's put into your graveyard. You don't get another chance to cast it later.
* If you discard a card with madness to pay the cost of a spell or activated ability, that card's madness trigger (and the spell that card becomes, if you choose to cast it) will resolve before the spell or ability the discard paid for.
* If you discard a card with madness while resolving a spell or ability, it moves immediately to exile. Continue resolving that spell or ability—the card is not in your graveyard at this time. Its madness trigger will be placed onto the stack once that spell or ability has completely resolved.



---

**Rules Changes: Madness**


When madness last appeared in the *Time Spiral* block, you could choose to discard a card with madness to the graveyard as normal. Now, you must discard the card into exile, and the card will be put into your graveyard if you don't cast it as the madness triggered ability resolves. The only choice you have to make is whether or not to cast it as the madness trigger resolves.


* If you discard a card with madness while resolving the ability of [Jace, Vryn's Prodigy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace%2C+Vryn%27s+Prodigy) from the *Magic Origins* set, you'll need to already have five other cards in your graveyard to satisfy that ability's condition. You can't choose to put the card directly into your graveyard to satisfy it.



---

**New Ability Word: Delirium**


The graveyard continues to represent the macabre themes of Innistrad in the *Shadows over Innistrad* set. Delirium is a new ability word indicating abilities that are enabled by having four or more card types among the cards in your graveyard. An ability word appears in italics and has no rules meaning.


![](https://media.wizards.com/2016/aksdjciawolkcc0_soi/en_Kip8suq3yM.png)



> 
> Paranoid Parish-Blade  
> 
> 2W  
> 
> Creature — Human Soldier  
> 
> 3/2  
> *Delirium* — [Paranoid Parish-Blade](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Paranoid+Parish-Blade) gets +1/+0 and has first strike as long as there are four or more card types among cards in your graveyard.
> 
> 
> 


* The card types in *Magic* are artifact, creature, enchantment, instant, land, planeswalker, sorcery, and tribal (a card type that appears on some older cards). Supertypes (such as legendary and basic) and subtypes (such as Human and Equipment) are not counted.
* The number of card types matters, not the number of cards. For example, [Wicker Witch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wicker+Witch) (an artifact creature) along with [Catalog](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Catalog) (an instant) and [Chaplain's Blessing](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chaplain%27s+Blessing) (a sorcery) will enable delirium.
* Because you consider only the characteristics of a double-faced card's front face while it's not on the battlefield, the types of its back face won't be counted for delirium.
* Some delirium abilities that appear on instants and sorceries use the word "instead." These spells have an upgraded effect when they resolve if there are four or more card types among cards in your graveyard. They check that number only while they're resolving and don't count themselves, since they aren't in your graveyard yet. You only get the upgraded effect, not both effects.
* Some delirium abilities are activated abilities of permanents. To activate such an ability, there must be four or more card types among cards in your graveyard. The number of card types is not rechecked as the ability resolves.
* Most triggered delirium abilities use an intervening "if" clause. There must be four or more card types among cards in your graveyard in order for these abilities to trigger, otherwise they never trigger at all. There's no way to have the ability trigger if there aren't enough card types, even if you intend to raise that number in response to the triggered ability. The number of card types is checked again as the trigger resolves, and if it has become too low somehow, the ability does nothing. If which card types are in your graveyard changes but the quantity of card types stays the same (or increases), then the delirium triggered ability will still resolve.
* In some rare cases, you can have a token or a copy of a spell in your graveyard at the moment that an object's delirium ability counts the card types among cards in your graveyard, before that token or copy ceases to exist. Because tokens and copies of spells are not cards, even if they are copies of cards, their types will never be counted.



---

**New Keyword Action: Investigate**


Innistrad is descending into insanity—what could be causing it? If you want to discover the truth, you can use investigate, a new keyword action, to dig deeper into the mysteries.


The official rules for investigate are as follows:


701.33. Investigate


701.33a "Investigate" means "Put a colorless Clue artifact token onto the battlefield. It has ‘2, Sacrifice this artifact: Draw a card.'"


* The token is named Clue and has the artifact subtype Clue. Clue isn't a creature type.
* The tokens are normal artifacts. For example, they can be sacrificed to cast [Angelic Purge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Angelic+Purge) or targeted by [Root Out](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Root+Out).
* If you sacrifice a Clue for another card's cost or effect, such as that of [Angelic Purge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Angelic+Purge) or [Tamiyo's Journal](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tamiyo%27s+Journal), you can't also pay 2 and sacrifice it to draw a card.
* Some triggered abilities trigger whenever you sacrifice a Clue. These abilities trigger independently of why you sacrificed that Clue.
* Some spells that instruct you to investigate require targets. You can't cast a spell without choosing legal targets. If all of those targets become illegal, the spell is countered and you won't investigate.



---

**Cycle: *Shadows over Innistrad* "Dual Lands"**


*Shadows over Innistrad* introduces a cycle of five rare nonbasic lands that enter the battlefield tapped unless you reveal a certain type of land card from your hand.


![](https://media.wizards.com/2016/aksdjciawolkcc0_soi/en_oa1kwVjKM6.png)



> 
> Port Town  
> 
> Land  
> 
> As [Port Town](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Port+Town) enters the battlefield, you may reveal a Plains or Island card from your hand. If you don't, [Port Town](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Port+Town) enters the battlefield tapped.  
> 
> T: Add W or U to your mana pool.
> 
> 
> 


* You may reveal any land card with either or both of the appropriate subtypes. It doesn't have to be a basic land. For example, you could reveal [Canopy Vista](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Canopy+Vista) from the *Battle for Zendikar* set to satisfy the ability of [Port Town](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Port+Town).
* Lands don't have a subtype just because they can produce mana of the corresponding color. For example, [Port Town](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Port+Town) itself is neither a Plains nor an Island, even though it produces white and blue mana, so you can't reveal one to satisfy the ability of another.
* If a land card with an appropriate subtype is entering the battlefield from your hand at the same time as one of these dual lands, you may reveal that land to have the dual land enter untapped.
* If an effect instructs you to put one of these lands onto the battlefield tapped, the land will still enter the battlefield tapped even if you reveal a land card from your hand.

* [Accursed Witch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Accursed+Witch)'s first ability affects all spells cast by your opponents that target it, including Aura spells and spells that have additional targets. It doesn't affect abilities. The same is true with respect to [Infectious Curse](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Infectious+Curse)'s ability and spells you cast that target the enchanted player.
* If an effect causes [Accursed Witch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Accursed+Witch) to transform on the battlefield, rather than leaving it and returning transformed, then [Infectious Curse](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Infectious+Curse) doesn't become attached to any player and is put into your graveyard. This won't cause abilities that trigger when a creature leaves the battlefield to trigger.

* [Altered Ego](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Altered+Ego) copies exactly what was printed on the original creature (unless that creature is copying something else or is a token; see below). It doesn't copy whether that creature is tapped or untapped, whether it has any counters on it or any Auras and Equipment attached to it, or any non-copy effects that have changed its power, toughness, types, color, or so on.
* If you copy a double-faced creature, [Altered Ego](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Altered+Ego) will be a copy of the face that's up when [Altered Ego](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Altered+Ego) enters the battlefield. Because [Altered Ego](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Altered+Ego) is not a double-faced card, it won't be able to transform. If an effect instructs you to return it to the battlefield transformed when it leaves the battlefield, it won't return and will remain in its new zone.
* If the chosen creature has X in its mana cost, that X is considered to be 0. The value of X in [Altered Ego](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Altered+Ego)'s last ability will be whatever value was chosen for X while casting [Altered Ego](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Altered+Ego).
* If the chosen creature is copying something else (for example, if the chosen creature is another [Altered Ego](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Altered+Ego)), then your [Altered Ego](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Altered+Ego) enters the battlefield as whatever the chosen creature copied.
* If the chosen creature is a token, [Altered Ego](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Altered+Ego) copies the original characteristics of that token as stated by the effect that put the token onto the battlefield. [Altered Ego](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Altered+Ego) isn't a token.
* Any enters-the-battlefield abilities of the copied creature will trigger when [Altered Ego](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Altered+Ego) enters the battlefield. Any "as [this creature] enters the battlefield" or "[this creature] enters the battlefield with" abilities of the chosen creature will also work.
* If [Altered Ego](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Altered+Ego) somehow enters the battlefield at the same time as another creature, [Altered Ego](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Altered+Ego) can't become a copy of that creature. You may only choose a creature that's already on the battlefield.
* You can choose not to copy anything. In that case, [Altered Ego](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Altered+Ego) enters the battlefield as a 0/0 creature, and is probably put into the graveyard immediately. It won't have +1/+1 counters placed on it by its ability.
* X can be 0. [Altered Ego](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Altered+Ego) won't enter with any additional +1/+1 counters, and it will just be a copy of the chosen creature.

* The "planeswalker uniqueness rule" looks for planeswalkers that share a planeswalker type. If you control [Arlinn Kord](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arlinn+Kord) and [Arlinn, Embraced by the Moon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arlinn%2C+Embraced+by+the+Moon) at the same time, you'll choose one to put into its owner's graveyard.
* [Arlinn Kord](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arlinn+Kord) is not a Werewolf card; that is, she doesn't have the creature type Werewolf. Spells and abilities that refer to Werewolf cards or Werewolves don't apply to Arlinn.
* You can activate the first ability of [Arlinn Kord](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arlinn+Kord) without any targets just to add a loyalty counter to her.
* When the ability that transforms [Arlinn Kord](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arlinn+Kord) into [Arlinn, Embraced by the Moon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arlinn%2C+Embraced+by+the+Moon) (or vice versa) resolves, the number of loyalty counters on her doesn't change.
* You can't activate [Arlinn Kord](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arlinn+Kord)'s second ability and, after she transforms, activate a loyalty ability of [Arlinn, Embraced by the Moon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arlinn%2C+Embraced+by+the+Moon) during that turn (or vice versa).
* The set of creatures affected by the first ability of [Arlinn, Embraced by the Moon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arlinn%2C+Embraced+by+the+Moon) is determined as the ability resolves. Creatures you begin to control later in the turn won't get +1/+1 or gain trample.
* The emblem grants the activated ability to your creatures. Use the power of the creature as the activated ability resolves to determine how much damage is dealt. If the creature isn't on the battlefield at that time, use its power as it last existed on the battlefield. Note that this works differently than the fight keyword action, which requires both creatures to be on the battlefield for any damage to be dealt.

* The upkeep step is before the draw step, after the untap step. [Asylum Visitor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Asylum+Visitor)'s first ability will trigger and resolve before the active player draws a card in his or her draw step if that player has no cards in hand.
* [Asylum Visitor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Asylum+Visitor)'s triggered ability checks the active player's hand as the upkeep begins and as the trigger resolves. If that player has a card in hand as it resolves, you won't draw a card or lose 1 life. Notably, if you control multiple [Asylum Visitor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Asylum+Visitor)s during your upkeep, whichever one's first ability resolves first will stop the other's first ability from having any effect unless you have a way to get the card you drew out of your hand before it resolves.
* On an opponent's turn, triggered abilities you control will resolve before any triggered abilities of permanents that opponent controls if they trigger at the same time. This means that if you and your opponent each control an [Asylum Visitor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Asylum+Visitor) during your opponent's upkeep, and he or she has no cards in hand, you'll always draw a card before your opponent has a card in his or her hand.

* If [Brain in a Jar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brain+in+a+Jar) leaves the battlefield before its first ability resolves, use the number of counters on it at the moment it left to determine what spell you may cast.

> 
> 
> 


* When a spell or ability instructs each player to discard a card, starting with the player whose turn it is and proceeding in turn order, each player selects a card from his or her hand without revealing it, sets it aside, and then all of those cards are revealed and discarded at once.
* The card types that may be shared for [Creeping Dread](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Creeping+Dread)'s ability are artifact, creature, enchantment, instant, land, planeswalker, sorcery, and tribal (a card type that appears on some older cards). Supertypes (such as legendary and basic) and subtypes (such as Human and Equipment) are not counted.
* If a player has no cards in hand, that player doesn't discard a card while everyone else does. If you didn't discard a card, no player can have discarded a card that shares a card type with the card you discarded, so no player loses 3 life.
* If an opponent discards a card that shares two card types with the card you discarded, such as an artifact creature, that player still only loses 3 life.
* Because you consider only the characteristics of a double-faced card's front face while it's not on the battlefield, a double-faced card with different card types among its faces (such as [Skin Invasion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skin+Invasion)) only compares its front face to the other discarded cards.

* A permanent transforms into a non-Human creature if it transforms and is a creature without the creature type Human after transforming, regardless of whether it was a Human creature (or a creature at all) before it transformed.

Only creatures with that name are exiled by [Declaration in Stone](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Declaration+in+Stone).
* A face-down creature, such as one cast with a megamorph ability from the *Dragons of Tarkir* set, has no name and can't share a name with any other creatures.

* If you discard a Vampire creature card that already has a madness ability, you'll choose which madness ability exiles it. You may choose either the one it normally has or the one it gains from [Falkenrath Gorger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Falkenrath+Gorger).

* If a source deals damage to you and/or one or more permanents you control at the same time, [Flameblade Angel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flameblade+Angel)'s last ability will trigger that many times.

* Note that the last ability is optional. Say two players each control a [Flameblade Angel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flameblade+Angel), and a source controlled by the first player deals damage to the second player or a permanent he or she controls. The resulting triggered ability may deal damage to the first player, causing the ability of that player's [Flameblade Angel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flameblade+Angel) to trigger. That ability may deal damage to the second player, and so on. This cycle will repeat until the game ends or one player declines to use the ability, putting an end to the carnage.

* [Geistblast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Geistblast)'s ability can copy any instant or sorcery spell, not just one with targets.
* When [Geistblast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Geistblast)'s ability resolves, it creates a copy of the instant or sorcery spell. The copy is created on the stack, so it's not "cast." Abilities that trigger when a player casts a spell won't trigger. The copy will then resolve like a normal spell, before the original spell resolves but after players get a chance to cast spells and activate abilities.
* The copy will have the same targets as the spell it's copying unless you choose new ones. You may change any number of the targets, including all of them or none of them. If, for one of the targets, you can't choose a new legal target, then it remains unchanged (even if the current target is illegal).
* If the spell being copied is modal (that is, it says "Choose one —" or the like), the copy will have the same mode. You can't choose a different one.
* If the spell being copied has an X whose value was determined as it was cast (like [Avacyn's Judgment](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Avacyn%27s+Judgment)'s madness cost has), the copy will have the same value of X.
* If the spell has damage divided as it was cast (also like [Avacyn's Judgment](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Avacyn%27s+Judgment)), the division can't be changed (although the targets receiving that damage still can).
* If an alternative cost was paid for the spell, such as its madness cost or surge cost, the same alternative cost is considered to have been paid for the copy.

* Odric's ability triggers at the beginning of each combat, not just combat on your turn, whether or not any creatures you control have any of the listed abilities. If a creature gains one of the listed abilities before Odric's triggered ability resolves, perhaps due to another ability that triggered at the beginning of combat, then creatures you control will gain that ability.
* The set of creatures affected by Odric's ability and how they are affected is determined as the ability resolves. Creatures you begin to control later in the turn won't gain any abilities or cause creatures to gain new abilities, and the abilities gained won't change even if every creature that normally had the abilities leaves the battlefield.
* Multiple instances of any of the abilities Odric can grant your creatures are redundant.

* The set of creatures affected by [Tenacity](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tenacity) is determined as the spell resolves. Creatures you begin to control later in the turn won't get +1/+1 or gain lifelink.

You must have controlled [Town Gossipmonger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Town+Gossipmonger) continuously since the beginning of your most recent turn, however.
* [Incited Rabble](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Incited+Rabble)'s controller still chooses which player or planeswalker it attacks.
* If, during its controller's declare attackers step, [Incited Rabble](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Incited+Rabble) is tapped or is affected by a spell or ability that says it can't attack, then it doesn't attack. If there's a cost associated with having [Incited Rabble](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Incited+Rabble) attack, its controller isn't forced to pay that cost, so it doesn't have to attack in that case either. Note that transforming [Town Gossipmonger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Town+Gossipmonger) won't untap it.
