Building with the Gods

 Quinn has been fascinated with Magic ever since Revised Edition. When he is not spending time with his lovely wife and amazing son, he's constantly brewing decks for, playing, and writing about Magic.

So, you've just cracked opened a booster pack of *Hour of Devastation* and you opened one of the new Gods. You are excited about getting one of these mythic rares, but you aren't sure where to start. What options do you have for deck building around these intriguing yet complex cards?


We'll look at our options, but to talk about the new, we need to talk about the old.


Old Gods, Meet the New Gods
===========================


The Gods from *Amonkhet* are simpler to build with. With casting costs of three to four, they can easily be cast along the early game curve. Each is priced to move, with power/toughness at or well above what you'd expect to get for a creature at an equivalent cost. The real challenge for deck builders is determining how to satisfy a God's restrictions on attacking and blocking.


Each God also has an activated ability that supplements the theme of that restriction. These abilities are good, but none of them are instantly game-breaking.


The *Amonkhet* Gods fit into a game plan your deck already has, but they don't represent the deck's focus.


Enter the new Gods.


In *Hour of Devastation*, the Bolas-colored (combinations of blue, black, and red) Gods don't play by the rules of their predecessors. First, they are higher up the curve; two have casting costs of five mana, and one has a casting cost of six mana! Being this costly changes what we expect from a card. At three or four mana, a card can simply contribute to our game plan; at five or six mana, the card needs to change the game or be a victory condition on its own.


The new Gods deliver on this front. While they are not indestructible, their ability to move from a graveyard to your hand means they are persistent. While the power and toughness rate is less pronounced on these Gods, their triggered abilities can dominate a game on some front. But that power doesn't come free—you must build around it. You won't even have these cards for five to six turns, so you'll need a plan to get there that also sets you up to maximize putting a God on the table.


Each of Nicol Bolas's Gods rewards different plans and schemes. Let's explore them.


The Scorpion God
================


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&multiverseid=430835)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=430835)
[The Scorpion God](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=430835) has the highest power of all the new Gods. Getting a 6/5 that's hard to kill is a good start, but it gets more exciting when we get to the triggered ability.


Drawing cards from creatures dying is great. There is no restriction on whose creatures need to die, so it works for creatures you kill and creatures of your own that die. Imagine casting an [Unlicensed Disintegration](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Unlicensed+Disintegration), dealing 3 damage to an opponent, and drawing a card.


The value comes at a price in the form of -1/-1 counters. You need to get those counters on creatures before they die to draw from them. [The Scorpion God](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=430835)'s activated ability allows you to put a counter on a creature, but building a deck with this God implies you want to play with other counter-making cards as well.


What do we have for support?


Red provides strong support using burn and [Soul-Scar Mage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soul-Scar+Mage).


* [![Soul-Scar Mage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Soul-Scar+Mage)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soul-Scar+Mage)

[Soul-Scar Mage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soul-Scar+Mage) turns all your burn spells into -1/-1 spells. Not only that, the [Soul-Scar Mage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soul-Scar+Mage) gets pumped from the spell, too! [Soul-Scar Mage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soul-Scar+Mage) provides powerful early-game plays that connect right into casting [The Scorpion God](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=430835). With both cards on the board, your burn becomes self-replacing, which is a great place to be!


Black supports the God with creatures . . .

* [![Defiant Greatmaw](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Defiant+Greatmaw)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Defiant+Greatmaw)

These cards suggest several possibilities for deck building, but my preference is a black-red-green "good stuff" deck. Green brings mana acceleration and big creatures, while black and red provide counters, discard, and removal. [Hapatra, Vizier of Poisons](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hapatra%2C+Vizier+of+Poisons) and [Obelisk Spider](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Obelisk+Spider)s give different ways of getting counters on the board without spending mana. [Arlinn Kord](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arlinn+Kord) would work well in this deck, making [The Scorpion God](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=430835) an 8/7 haste vigilance creature when it comes into play!


The Scarab God
==============


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&multiverseid=430834)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=430834)
[The Scarab God](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=430834) is less aggressive than [The Scorpion God](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=430835). A 5/5 for five with nothing else is not special—but we'll accept that for the other abilities we get access to!


[The Scarab God](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=430834)'s triggered ability is powerful, but takes an extra turn after it is cast to get going. It's more appropriate to think about this ability as a result rather than a goal.


What's appealing about [The Scarab God](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=430834) is the activated ability. We pay four mana to bring a creature from any graveyard into play, and that gets overwhelming after only a few activations. Creatures dead in the early game come back with their ability plus an upgrade in stats. We can get 4/4 [Thraben Inspector](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thraben+Inspector)s and [Tireless Tracker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tireless+Tracker)s on our side of the board or steal a [Dread Wanderer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dread+Wanderer) and buff it in the process!


We also can target our graveyard, which means we support a reanimation theme while we are stealing from our opponent. We can load our graveyards using [Champion of Wits](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Champion+of+Wits), [Strategic Planning](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Strategic+Planning), or Tragic Loss. We use [The Scarab God](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=430834); [Liliana, Death's Majesty](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Liliana%2C+Death%27s+Majesty); or [Rise from the Grave](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rise+from+the+Grave) to reanimate cards like [Razaketh, the Foulblooded](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Razaketh%2C+the+Foulblooded); [Unesh, Criosphinx Sovereign](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Unesh%2C+Criosphinx+Sovereign); or [Chaos Maw](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chaos+Maw) for effects, though they may lose power when the God brings them back.


All the reanimation cards discussed turn the cards they bring back into Zombies. This is where [The Scarab God](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=430834)'s triggered ability starts to kick in. You can build a board state turn-by-turn that, if not stopped, increases your card selection and squeezes the life out of your opponent. Even if they sweep the board, anything short of [Descend upon the Sinful](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Descend+upon+the+Sinful) (or another exile effect) will let you get your God back to do it again.


This God seems to encourage more grindy matches; we want to build a deck that plays removal and maybe light countermagic early, building card advantage through creatures. Eventually we come out ahead by generating more use out of those early-game creatures.


One concept that seems viable is a white-blue-black midrange deck. We can utilize the cards we mentioned and along the way include planeswalkers like [Gideon, Ally of Zendikar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gideon%2C+Ally+of+Zendikar) and [Sorin, Grim Nemesis](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sorin%2C+Grim+Nemesis) for further backup.


The Locust God
==============


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&multiverseid=430828)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=430828)
[The Locust God](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=430828) is the most expensive God but has the lowest power and toughness. Its activated ability is only so-so.


But it's triggered ability is the most powerful of the three new Gods by far.


Every time you draw a card, create a 1/1 flier with haste? That sort of unbounded effect is exactly what you want.


The trick is determining how it is you are going to make it work. Six mana is a lot. Worse yet, you have to spend more mana to do something else.


Where the other two Gods seemed to encourage a midrange or control style, [The Locust God](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=430828) seems to push us toward a combo or ramp style of deck. If we are just playing a six-mana creature and not winning immediately with it, we want to play with [Torrential Gearhulk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Torrential+Gearhulk). We want to use [The Locust God](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=430828)'s explosiveness as much as we can.


So, how do we cast [The Locust God](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=430828) and create 20 tokens?


Finding the right engine can be tricky, but after a lot of thought, what I really like is the [New Perspectives](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=New+Perspectives) deck [Ben Friedman](http://www.starcitygames.com/events/coverage/new_perspectives_with_ben_frie.html) used at a StarCityGames.com Invitational.

![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Shefet+Monitor)

















I modified the framework of this deck to use [The Locust God](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=430828) as a main win condition instead of [Approach of the Second Sun](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Approach+of+the+Second+Sun), but the engine remains the same: use [Weirding Wood](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Weirding+Wood) or [Gift of Paradise](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gift+of+Paradise) to ramp into [New Perspectives](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=New+Perspectives), cycle with [Vizier of Tumbling Sands](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vizier+of+Tumbling+Sands) and [Shefet Monitor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shefet+Monitor) to generate mana to cast [The Locust God](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=430828), then cycle a lot. It seems like a tall order, but we've got [Traverse the Ulvenwald](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Traverse+the+Ulvenwald) to find the card and [Shadow of the Grave](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shadow+of+the+Grave) to reuse our cycling cards.
