So, the stage is set. The **Magic** Top 25 Pro Rankings have been lying dormant for several weeks now, with Jérémy Dezani of France a distance ahead of his nearest rivals. All that is about to change, one way or another, because a host of massively influential events are about to take place. The headline game-changer is, of course, Pro Tour *Journey into Nyx*, coming your way from Atlanta, Georgia. With so many Pro Points on the line, you can be certain that seismic shifts are going to create a very different Top 25 two weeks from now.


Before that, though, there's the small matter of a double-header Grand Prix weekend. In Europe, players can test out the *Theros* Block strategies in Limited play. *Journey into Nyx* packs will be opened by the thousands, with a day of Sealed Deck before the cut to Day Two and Draft. Across the Atlantic, Grand Prix Minneapolis will concentrate on the format from the last Pro Tour, Modern. Expect to see Tarmo-Twin, RWU Control, Melira-Pod, and an Greatest Hits of efficient cards from the last decade.


But which of our Top 25 will be playing this weekend? Some Europeans are planning on travelling early to the US. Others believe their best chance of Pro Tour success is to skip this GP weekend entirely and hunker down with their Pro Tour testing teams. That could leave the way clear for someone to make a move, and gain a few places, before the inevitable upheaval in Atlanta.


Next week, we'll see exactly who sneaked in a few extra points ahead of the big show, so join us then for more from the **Magic** Top 25 Pro Rankings.
