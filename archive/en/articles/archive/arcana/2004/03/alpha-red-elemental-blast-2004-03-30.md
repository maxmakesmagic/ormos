Here's an "Alpha Oops" that ended up not being so.

In *Alpha*, **[Red Elemental Blast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Red+Elemental+Blast)** was mistakenly labeled an instant instead of an interrupt. 

![Red Elemental Blast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Red+Elemental+Blast)*[Red Elemental Blast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Red+Elemental+Blast)  
from Limited Edition Alpha*According to the rules at that time, that would have prevented it from actually countering spells!

It was changed to an interrupt when it was reprinted in *[Red Elemental Blast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Red%2BElemental%2BBlast)*, *[Red Elemental Blast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Red%2BElemental%2BBlast)*, *[Red Elemental Blast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Red%2BElemental%2BBlast)* and *[Red Elemental Blast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Red%2BElemental%2BBlast)*, but after the *Sixth Edition* rules changes, [Red Elemental Blast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Red+Elemental+Blast)'s Oracle text was *really* changed to "instant," along with all the other interrupts. As rules gurus are fond of saying: all's well that gets its Oracle text errata'ed well.
