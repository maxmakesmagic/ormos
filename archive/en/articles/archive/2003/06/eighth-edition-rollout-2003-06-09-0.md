Here at MagicTheGathering.com, we want to constantly provide all of you with the latest inside info about **Magic: The Gathering**. The “*Eighth Edition* Rollout” continues this fine tradition. Over the next three weeks we will be letting you know all the cards in the upcoming Core Set (better known to all of you as *Eighth Edition*) so that you'll know what to start trading for and so you can get a head start on playtesting decks for the new Standard (and Extended) environments. Here’s how it’s going to work:


To celebrate **Magic**’s tenth anniversary, Wizards of the Coast wanted to do something special with *Eighth Edition*. After much brainstorming, we came up with the following idea: *Eighth Edition* contains at least one new card (meaning a card never before printed in a Core Set) from every **Magic** expansion ever produced by Wizards (with the sole exception of *Unglued*).


Over the next three weeks, for six days a week, we’ll be revealing the contents of *Eighth Edition* two expansions at a time. We will be starting with *Scourge* and working our way back chronologically to Alpha. Enjoy!
