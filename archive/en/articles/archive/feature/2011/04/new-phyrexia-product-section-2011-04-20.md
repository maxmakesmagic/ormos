Did you read Monday's article about the mechanics in *New Phyrexia*? It was really good! It contained an overview of all the key mechanics in *New Phyrexia* and even provided a bunch of preview cards to illustrate its point. But if you missed it, what's to be done?

Why, the [*New Phyrexia* Product Section](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/tcg/Products.aspx?x=mtg/tcg/products/newphyrexia), of course! Not only does it have an informative Product Information page, it's got a permanent link to the Mechanics article right there. And the Card Image Gallery is a constantly-updated archive of all *New Phyrexia* cards that have been officially previewed!

The [*New Phyrexia* Product Section](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/tcg/Products.aspx?x=mtg/tcg/products/newphyrexia). Won't you?
