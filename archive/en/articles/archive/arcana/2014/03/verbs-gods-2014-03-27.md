It's God Week here at DailyMTG, so let's look at the Gods of—wait... [we've already done that](/en/articles/archive/borns-gods-2014-03-24-0). Fortunately, the gods of *Theros* interact with the plane directly[1](#1), which is reflected in several *Theros*[2](#2) and *Born of the Gods* cards. So let's look at the art from *those* cards!

 1: Yes, "God-Favored" is an adjective, not a verb. "Parts of Speech of the Gods" just isn't as compelling a title.  [(return)](#b) 



 2: No, this entire Arcana wasn't just to feature the awesome Elspeth art on [Gods Willing](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gods+Willing). Except it totally was. [(return)](#b)
