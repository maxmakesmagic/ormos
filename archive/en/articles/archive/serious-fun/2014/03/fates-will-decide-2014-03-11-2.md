 Bruce's games invariably involve several friends, crazy plays, and many laughs. Bruce believes that if anyone at your table isn't having fun, then you are doing it wrong. 






The Fates have been particularly cruel to you. 

 You played four games that night with your new deck and never once drew [Fated Infatuation](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fated+Infatuation). Your choice was irrelevant. The Fates despise you and your belief that your choices are relevant.
