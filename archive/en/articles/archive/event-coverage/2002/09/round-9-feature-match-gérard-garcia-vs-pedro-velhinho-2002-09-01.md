Gérard Garcia of France and Pedro Velhinho of Portugal. Garcia has a previous Pro Tour appearance at New Orleans. The Frenchman is running a black-blue Braids beatdown deck and his disruption should give him an advantage against Velhinho's slower black control deck.

Garcia went first and a turn two [Mesmeric Fiend](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mesmeric+Fiend) revealed Velhinho had kept a two land hand with expensive spells like [Mirari](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mirari) and [Haunting Echoes](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Haunting+Echoes). There was also a [Nantuko Shade](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nantuko+Shade) and [Innocent Blood](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Innocent+Blood). Garcia took the Blood. From there he quickly took control of the game by casting [Shadowmage Infiltrator](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shadowmage+Infiltrator) and turn four [Braids](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Braids).

Velhinho tried to race with two [Nantuko Shade](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nantuko+Shade)s but one died to Edict and he was forced to sacrifice the second to [Braids](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Braids). A [Rancid Earth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rancid+Earth) on one of the Portuguese player's swamps put him under a [Braids](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Braids) lock and he conceded soon afterwards.

Garcia 1-0 Velhinho

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gplon02/935.jpg)Velhinho started with a turn 1 [Cabal Therapy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cabal+Therapy) and hit, taking [Chainer's Edict](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chainer%27s+Edict). He followed it up with a [Mesmeric Fiend](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mesmeric+Fiend), taking Garcia's fiend and leaving him with Infiltrator, Braids and [Aether Burst](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aether+Burst).

Garcia passed his third turn and Velhinho destroyed his only blue source with [Rancid Earth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rancid+Earth). This allowed Garcia to return the Fiend with [Aether Burst](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aether+Burst) and then steal it with his own.

Velhinho tutored, which gave Garcia an opportunity to gain an edge in the game with [Braids](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Braids). She ended up being just an [Avalanche Riders](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Avalanche+Riders) as Velhinho killed both his guys with [Innocent Blood](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Innocent+Blood) and [Chainer's Edict](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chainer%27s+Edict).

Garcia kept coming at the Portuguese player as he started drawing cards off an Infiltrator and got an [Ichorid](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ichorid) going.

A [Mutilate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mutilate) cleared the board and Velhinho combined [Cabal Therapy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cabal+Therapy) with [Mesmeric Fiend](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mesmeric+Fiend) to remove a second Infiltrator from Garcia's hand. Garcia pulled a Fiend and revealed Velhinho had an answer to the [Ichorid](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ichorid) in [Haunting Echoes](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Haunting+Echoes) but was shy a land of casting it. He found a land but had to lay a [Nantuko Shade](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nantuko+Shade) instead to match Garcia's.

At seven life Velhinho was in real trouble. His own Shade was forced to chump block Garcia's but he was down to 3 and facing down Shade, Fiend and an [Ichorid](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ichorid) he could do nothing about. He looked at another card and then offered his hand.

Gérard Garcia beat Pedro Velhinho 2-0
