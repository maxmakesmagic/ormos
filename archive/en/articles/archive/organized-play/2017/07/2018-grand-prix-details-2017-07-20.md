The first six months of Grand Prix feature a heavy dose of team events, with some notable standouts.


Teams
=====


Teams are a big part of the first half of 2018. Pro Tour 25th Anniversary will be seeded heavily by team-format Grand Prix running from January 8 through May 27. This means that any team-format Grand Prix during that time will qualify the Top 4 teams for Pro Tour 25th Anniversary, while the individual-format Grand Prix run during those windows will qualify for other Pro Tours. The exact Pro Tour that each individual-format Grand Prix feeds is being finalized, but note that every team-format event listed on this schedule qualifies the Top 4 for Pro Tour 25th Anniversary.


To help support our team focus in 2018, CFB Events has ensured that there is at least one team event in every region during this time, with a mixture of Team Limited, Team Constructed, and Team Unified Modern across these events.


Seattle, Birmingham, and Las Vegas
==================================


There are three standout cities on this schedule, and it's because they have two main events on the same weekend. Grand Prix weekend in Las Vegas proved to be a huge success, and a great test run for CFB Events to see what they could do with multiple main events in one weekend. The idea worked so well that they're bringing these weekends back in 2018, with five double Grand Prix stops throughout the year in key cities in North America, Europe, and Japan!


For the first half of 2018, the double Grand Prix will make a stop in Seattle, Birmingham, and Las Vegas. Seattle's Grand Prix main events will take place at the Washington State Convention Center April 5–8, 2018, featuring Legacy and Standard main events for players to enjoy. Birmingham's double GP weekend is May 10-13, 2018, hosted at teh National Exhibition Centre (The NEC) also featuring Legacy and Standard main events.


Finally, for the first half of 2018, Las Vegas will be a double-header with Modern and Limited main events, taking place at the Las Vegas Convention Center June 14-17, 2018. It's going to be a weekend you won't want to miss!


There are still two more double-main-event Grand Prix weekends for 2018, one in North America and one in Japan, which will be announced later in the year.


The Rest of 2018
