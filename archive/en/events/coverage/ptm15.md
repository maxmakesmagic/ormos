SUNDAY COVERAGE
---------------


In a weekend of twists and turns in pursuit of Pro Tour Players Club levels and Worlds week slots, it was Slovakian Ivan Floch who went the distance. And for Floch, it was a long time coming.


Coming into this event with 167 Pro Points, Ivan Floch also had a solid career record in Pro Tour matches. There was just one thing that was truly eluding him: a Pro Tour Top 8. With this weekend, Ivan Floch was able to finally play on the Pro Tour Sunday stage.


However, Floch didn't stop there. Armed with his White-Blue Control deck - emphasizing excess sweepers like Planar Cleansing with Quicken - Floch went on to dispatch Matthew Sperling's White-Red Burn deck 2-0 in the Quarterfinals. After that, he overcame No. 5 Ranked Player Owen Turtenwald's White-Black Midrange deck in the Semifinals 2-1. And then it all came down to the finals against Jackson Cunningham's White-Green Aggro deck, where Archangel of Thune combined with a pair of Nyx-Fleece Rams, allowing Floch to finish off Cunningham 3-2 in the final match of the Pro Tour.

Pro Tour *Magic 2015* featured a bevy of key stories, including who qualifies for the 2014 World *Magic* Cup and World Championship. For Floch, the event not only earned him his first Pro Tour Top 8 *and* win, but also ensured his appearance both of these events. Congratulations once again to Ivan Floch, World *Magic* Cup champions, and the twenty-four players who have now locked up seats at this year's World Championship.

SATURDAY COVERAGE
-----------------


A neck-and-neck final round of standings has brought a contingency of the 2013-2014 Premier Play Season's top performing players back into the Sunday spotlight. Patrick Cox, Yuuki Ichikawa, No. 20 Ranked Player William Jensen, Ivan Floch, Matthew Sperling, Pierre Mondon, Jackson Cunningham, and No. 5 Ranked Player Owen Turtenwald will all be competing for the title of Pro Tour *Magic 2015* champion tomorrow.


Coming in at 9th place was No. 2 Ranked Player Jeremy Dezani. While the near-miss of the Top 8 for this event may be seen as a heart-breaker, the number of Pro Points that Dezani earned with his finish locks him as the 2013-2014 Player of the Year with an unprecedented *86 Pro Points*.


Tune in tomorrow at 9 a.m. PT/ 5 p.m. GMT to see the exciting conclusion to this weekend, the World Championship race, and the World *Magic* Cup captaincy race!
