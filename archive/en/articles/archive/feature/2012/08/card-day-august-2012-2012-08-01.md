**Korozda Guildmage** – *Return to Ravnica* uncommon. The guildmages return in *Return to Ravnica*, but this time they're all new names and new mechanics. Also, you'll see that these guildmages don't have hybrid mana, and instead require one of each of the guild's mana colors. Colloquially they were sometimes called *gold*-mages in R&D.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/features/feat210_izzetcharm_5ozsxiwmed_en.jpg)  
**Izzet Charm** – *Return to Ravnica* uncommon. Charms are most recently remembered from the Alara block. They were so successful and well received there that they were brought into Ravnica, thus giving every guild their own charm. You can use the Izzet charm in *Duel Decks: Izzet vs Golgari*.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/features/feat210_dregmangler_9o1t3wycvq_en.jpg)  
**Dreg Mangler** – *Return to Ravnica* uncommon. Dreg Mangler is a three-mana 3/3 with haste and it doesn't require any red Mana; that's notable right there. Additionally it features the Golgari mechanic of "scavenge." Each guild mechanic in *Return to Ravnica* was designed with the original *Ravnica* mechanics in mind, scavenge plays quite nicely with dredge, both of which are used in the Golgari duel deck.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/features/feat210_streetspasm_4563lkoj35_en.jpg)  
**Street Spasm** – *Return to Ravnica* uncommon. As the first reveal of the new Izzet mechanic "overload," Street Spasm is in *Duel Decks: Izzet vs Golgari*. Overload was first introduced by Ken Nagle in the Great Designer Search, which he then called "dispersion." Ken led development on *Return to Ravnica* and thus was able to get "dispersion" in as the Izzet mechanic.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/features/feat210_jarad_1gtgrwcdsi_en.jpg)  
**Jarad, Golgari Lich Lord** – *Return to Ravnica* rare. Jarad was the first new card revealed in *Return to Ravnica.* He is the new Golgari guild leader and one of the two premium foil cards in the *Duel Decks: Izzet vs Golgari*. He will also be only the third Zombie Elf to ever be printed, joining [Glissa, the Traitor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glissa%2C+the+Traitor) and [Llanowar Dead](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Llanowar+Dead).





![Desert](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Desert)**[Desert](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Desert)** – *From the Vault: Realms* rare. In *Alpha* and *Beta*, all the nonbasic lands were rare. However, Arabian Nights brought the first common nonbasic land into existence in the form of [Desert](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Desert). We don't have the record of the entire decision-making process of making it a common, but presumably the fact that deserts are, well, all over the setting, figured in.
 


![244672](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&multiverseid=244672)**[Kresh the Bloodbraided](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=244672)** – *From the Vault: Legends* rare. Kresh's braids are tokens of success in the hunt, and he has more than anyone. Although he is not the leader of his tribe, he is universally recognized as the greatest human warrior alive.
 


![212639](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&multiverseid=212639)**[Ivory Tower](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=212639)** – *From the Vault: Relics* rare. Life gain no good in constructed? [Ivory Tower](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ivory+Tower) appeared in the finals of the World Championships three years in a row. Zak Dolan had one in his winning deck in 1994, and Marc Hernandez and Mark Justice finished second in '95 and '96 respectively with the Tower. 
 


![194977](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&multiverseid=194977)**[Necropotence](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=194977)** – *From the Vault: Exiled* rare. [Necropotence](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Necropotence) dominated tournament **Magic** almost from the day Ice Age came out, leading to the "Black Summer" of 1996. In 1999, combo decks like High Tide and Academy ruled the landscape to the point where [Necropotence](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Necropotence) wasn't in any decks. At that point, Chris Pikula made the famous suggestion, "Ban everything until Necro is good, then ban Necro". And that's pretty much what happened.
 


![178016](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&multiverseid=178016)**[Form of the Dragon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=178016)** – *From the Vault: Dragons* rare. The “Moat-like” effect of this card would normally be associated with white, but for flavor reasons the ability was allowed on this red card as a rare exception. 
 


![73935](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&multiverseid=73935)**["Ach! Hans, Run!"](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=73935)** – *Unhinged* rare. The name ["Ach! Hans, Run!"](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=%22Ach%21+Hans%2C+Run%21%22) is from [Lhurgoyf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lhurgoyf), where it's the last words of [Saffi Eriksdotter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Saffi+Eriksdotter). Hans is quoted on [Saffi's card](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Saffi%27s+card) and also on [Revenant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Revenant).
 


![10731](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&multiverseid=10731)**[Riding the Dilu Horse](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=10731)** – *Portal Three Kingdoms* rare. [Riding the Dilu Horse](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Riding+the+Dilu+Horse) is a reference to Dilu, the horse belonging to [Liu Bei, Lord of Shu](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Liu+Bei%2C+Lord+of+Shu). It was said to bear a curse that would harm its rider, but it seems like +2/+2 and horsemanship are something most people would be okay with.
 


![Watercourser](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Watercourser)**[Watercourser](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Watercourser)** – ***Magic** 2013* common. The Elemental in the art for [Watercourser](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Watercourser) is not flying. It's rising up out of the river in response to the rain!
 


![Fencer Clique](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Fencer+Clique)**[Fencer Clique](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fencer+Clique)** – *Morningtide* common. *Morningtide* was a set where what mattered was class, rather than race. So while [Fencer Clique](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fencer+Clique) and [Vendilion Clique](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vendilion+Clique) were both Faeries, it was more important that one was a Wizard and the other was a Soldier.
 


![Goblin Sharpshooter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Goblin+Sharpshooter)**[Goblin Sharpshooter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Sharpshooter)** – *Onslaught* rare. Richard Garfield's original concept for [Goblin Sharpshooter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Sharpshooter) was "Goblin Gatling Gunner," a goblin with a clunky, crank-powered gun he couldn't control. The whole story behind the card was told [in this Latest Developments article](/en/articles/archive/latest-developments/goblins-guns-2002-10-11) ten years ago by Randy Buehler.
 


![289098](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&multiverseid=289098)**[Index](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=289098)** – ***Magic** 2013* common. The ***Magic** 2013* version of [Index](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=289098) has the same art and printed rules text as every other version of the card (it was printed in [*Apocalypse*](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=25969), [*Eighth Edition*](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=45259), and [*Ninth Edition*](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=94912)). But the flavor text has changed, possibly because the original version referenced both Mercadia and mercenaries, neither of which are in ***Magic** 2013*.
 


![83620](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&multiverseid=83620)**[Fiery Conclusion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=83620)** – *Ravnica: City of Guilds* common. Single-color cards in *Ravnica* block could belong to any guild that contains that color. This is demonstrated by the flavor text on [Fiery Conclusion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=83620), which describes the same effect from the point of view of three different red-aligned guilds.
 


![Introductions Are in Order](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Introductions+Are+in+Order)**[Introductions Are in Order](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Introductions+Are+in+Order)** – *Archenemy* scheme. It is on purpose that the creature at the center of [Introductions Are in Order](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Introductions+Are+in+Order) can't be made out clearly. This way, it could be anything! Well, anything with a pincer, anyway, if you believe the flavor text.
 


![Kessig Malcontents](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Kessig+Malcontents)**[Kessig Malcontents](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kessig+Malcontents)** – *Avacyn Restored* uncommon. Originally, [Kessig Malcontents](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kessig+Malcontents) was only about a single malcontent, but the mob-like art and ability lent themselves to pluralization.
 


![Cloud Cover](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Cloud+Cover)**[Cloud Cover](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloud+Cover)** – *Planeshift* rare. [Cloud Cover](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloud+Cover) has been around for a long time, and it's always seemed ripe for some kind of crazy combo. Possibly in combination with [Azorius Aethermage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Azorius+Aethermage), right? But it never really broke through.
 


![107375](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&multiverseid=107375)**[Research // Development](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=107375)** – *Dissension* rare. When R&D wanted to print a card called "[Research and Development](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=107375)", **Magic** Brand objected, saying no other department got to have its name on a card. R&D countered with the *Urza's Saga* card [Brand](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brand), and won.
 


![121238](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&multiverseid=121238)**[Perilous Research](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=121238)** – *Coldsnap* uncommon. The flavor text for [Perilous Research](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=121238) refers to the fall of the [School of the Unseen](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=School+of+the+Unseen), originally seen in *Alliances* as a place where mages were hiding from the world. Apparently the world found them.
 


![Boundless Realms](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Boundless+Realms)**[Boundless Realms](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Boundless+Realms)** – ***Magic** 2013* rare. The three doorways in the art for [Boundless Realms](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Boundless+Realms) lead to three different planes. The middle one appears to go out onto a mountaintop!
