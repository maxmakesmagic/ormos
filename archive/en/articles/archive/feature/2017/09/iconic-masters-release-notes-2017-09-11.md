The Release Notes include information concerning the release of a new *Magic: The Gathering* set, as well as a collection of clarifications and rulings involving that set's cards. It's intended to make playing with the new cards more fun by clearing up the common misconceptions and confusion inevitably caused by new mechanics and interactions. As future sets are released, updates to the *Magic* rules may cause some of this information to become outdated. If you can't find the answer you're looking for here, please contact us at [Wizards.com/CustomerService](http://www.wizards.com/CustomerService).


The "General Notes" section includes release information and explains the mechanics and concepts in the set.


The "Card-Specific Notes" section contains answers to the most important, most common, and most confusing questions players might ask about cards in the set. Items in the "Card-Specific Notes" section include full card text for your reference. Not all cards in the set are listed.

GENERAL NOTES

**What is Iconic Masters?**


*Iconic Masters* offers players a tour through some of the most powerful cards in over 23 years of *Magic* history. The set brings an array of massive Angels, Sphinxes, Demons, Dragons, and Hydras alongside some of our favorite and most memorable spells, many featuring new artwork. *Iconic Masters* is designed to provide an exciting and unique Limited experience with cards that have never been drafted together.


**Release Information**


The *Iconic Masters* set contains 249 cards (101 common, 80 uncommon, 53 rare, and 15 mythic rare).


Release date: November 17, 2017


Go to [Wizards.com/Locator](http://www.wizards.com/locator) to find an event or store near you.


**Format Legality**


All cards in the *Iconic Masters* set are legal in the two "Eternal" formats, Legacy and Vintage. Inclusion in the *Iconic Masters* set doesn't change what other formats a card is legal in.


Go to [Magic.Wizards.com/Rules](http://magic.wizards.com/rules) for a complete list of formats and permitted card sets.




---

Returning Mechanics
===================


All cards in the *Iconic Masters* set have previously appeared in other *Magic* sets. Accordingly, several keywords and other mechanics make their return. None of the rules regarding these mechanics have changed since they last appeared.




---

**Outlast**


First featured in the *Khans of Tarkir* set, the outlast keyword lets some creatures take time preparing to be even better at combat later.


![](https://media.wizards.com/2017/ima/en_UXBIb859NO.png)


Abzan Falconer  

2W  

Creature — Human Soldier  

2/3  

Outlast W *(W, T: Put a +1/+1 counter on this creature. Outlast only as a sorcery.)*  

Each creature you control with a +1/+1 counter on it has flying.


* The cost to activate a creature's outlast ability includes the tap symbol (T). A creature's outlast ability can't be activated unless that creature has been under your control continuously since the beginning of your turn.
* Each creature in this set with outlast also grants an ability to creatures you control with +1/+1 counters on them, including themselves. These counters could come from an outlast ability, but any +1/+1 counter on the creature will count.



---

**Protection**


Protection is an ability that appeared regularly in *Magic* sets in the past. It encompasses four different ways to render a permanent safe from other objects.


![](https://media.wizards.com/2017/ima/en_wh9vOSGsYj.png)


Auriok Champion  

WW  

Creature — Human Cleric  

1/1  

Protection from black and from red  

Whenever another creature enters the battlefield, you may gain 1 life.


* If a permanent has protection from a color, it means four things:
	+ Damage that would be dealt to that permanent by a source of that color is prevented.
	+ Auras and Equipment of that color can't be attached to that permanent.
	+ Creatures of that color can't block that permanent.
	+ That permanent can't be the target of spells of that color or abilities of sources of that color.
* Nothing other than the specified events is prevented or illegal. A creature with protection from white is destroyed by Austere Command, a creature with protection from black will get -1/-1 from Night of Souls' Betrayal, and a creature with protection from red can't ignore the replacement effect of Urabrask the Hidden.
* A permanent gaining protection may cause a spell or ability on the stack to have an illegal target. As a spell or ability tries to resolve, if all its targets are illegal, that spell or ability is countered and none of its effects happen, including effects unrelated to the target. If at least one target is still legal, the spell or ability does as much as it can to the remaining legal targets, and its other effects still happen.
* Some cards grant protection from "a color of your choice." You can't choose "artifact" or "colorless" this way, since those are not colors.



---

**Rebound**


Originally from the *Rise of the Eldrazi* set and appearing most recently in the *Dragons of Tarkir* set, rebound lets you double up on some instants and sorceries—you get the effect once now and once during your next upkeep.


![](https://media.wizards.com/2017/ima/en_UVSe45IPgn.png)


Staggershock  

2R  

Instant  

Staggershock deals 2 damage to target creature or player.  

Rebound *(If you cast this spell from your hand, exile it as it resolves. At the beginning of your next upkeep, you may cast this card from exile without paying its mana cost.)*


* Casting the card again due to the delayed triggered ability is optional. If you choose not to cast the card, or if you can't (perhaps because there are no legal targets available), the card will stay exiled. You won't get another chance to cast it on a future turn.
* If a spell with rebound that you cast from your hand is countered for any reason (either because of another spell or ability or because all its targets are illegal as it tries to resolve), that spell won't resolve and none of its effects will happen, including rebound. The spell will be put into its owner's graveyard and you won't get to cast it again on your next turn.
* At the beginning of your upkeep, all delayed triggered abilities created by rebound effects trigger. You may handle them in any order. If you want to cast a card this way, you do so as part of the resolution of its delayed triggered ability. Timing permissions based on the card's type (if it's a sorcery) are ignored. Other restrictions, such as "Cast [this spell] only during combat," must be followed.
* As long as you cast a spell with rebound from your hand, rebound will work regardless of whether you paid its mana cost or an alternative cost you were permitted to pay.
* If you cast a spell with rebound from any zone other than your hand, rebound will have no effect.
* If a replacement effect (such as the one created by Rest in Peace) would cause a spell with rebound that you cast from your hand to be put somewhere other than into your graveyard as it resolves, you can choose whether to apply the rebound effect or the other effect as the spell resolves.
* Rebound will have no effect on copies of spells because you don't cast them from your hand.
* If you cast a card from exile due to rebound's delayed triggered ability, it will go to its owner's graveyard when it resolves or is countered. It won't go back to exile.



---

**Regenerate**


Regenerate is a returning keyword action from many years of *Magic*'s history that spares a creature from destruction.


![](https://media.wizards.com/2017/ima/en_izdvLYKZ10.png)


Butcher's Glee  

2B  

Instant  

Target creature gets +3/+0 and gains lifelink until end of turn. Regenerate it.


* When you regenerate a permanent, you're creating a replacement effect "shield" to be used later. That effect means "The next time [that permanent] would be destroyed this turn, instead remove all damage marked on it and tap it. If it's an attacking or blocking creature, remove it from combat."
* A permanent can regenerate even if it's already tapped.
* A permanent that regenerates doesn't leave or enter the battlefield. Abilities that trigger on a creature dying or entering the battlefield won't trigger if a creature regenerates.
* Permanents are destroyed by effects that use the word "destroy." Creatures are also destroyed by having lethal damage marked on them. Sacrificing a permanent doesn't destroy it, nor does reducing a creature's toughness to 0.
* If a permanent would be destroyed in two ways at once, one regeneration shield protects it from both. This will happen, for example, if a creature with deathtouch deals damage to another creature that's greater than or equal to that creature's toughness.



---

**Renown**


Renown is a triggered ability from the *Magic Origins* set that rewards your creatures for striking your enemy, granting them prestige in the form of one or more +1/+1 counters.


![](https://media.wizards.com/2017/ima/en_GSZ7O4NBq1.png)


Stalwart Aven  

2W  

Creature — Bird Soldier  

1/3  

Flying  

Renown 1 *(When this creature deals combat damage to a player, if it isn't renowned, put a +1/+1 counter on it and it becomes renowned.)*


* Renown won't trigger when a creature deals combat damage to a planeswalker or another creature. It also won't trigger when a creature deals noncombat damage to a player.
* Being renowned has no inherent benefit. The creature's characteristics remain unchanged, other than the bonus from its new +1/+1 counter.
* If a creature receives a +1/+1 counter from an effect other than its renown ability, it's not renowned yet. Renown will trigger if that creature deals combat damage to a player.



---

**Storm**


If having your spells only once or twice isn't flashy enough to suit you, the storm ability from the *Scourge* and *Time Spiral* sets provides you with a way to copy that spell many more times—once for every other spell anyone's cast this turn.


![](https://media.wizards.com/2017/ima/en_liDsJPGkps.png)


Hunting Pack  

5GG  

Instant  

Create a 4/4 green Beast creature token.  

Storm *(When you cast this spell, copy it for each spell cast before it this turn.)*


* The number of copies you'll make is determined as you cast the spell with storm. Count only the spells cast before you cast that spell, even if those spells were countered or are still on the stack. Spells cast after you cast that spell but before the storm triggered ability resolves don't count.
* Spells cast by any player are counted, not just those cast by the controller of the spell with storm.
* Storm can copy the spell even if that spell is countered before the storm triggered ability resolves.
* The copies are created on the stack, so they're not "cast." Abilities that trigger when a player casts a spell (such as storm itself) won't trigger.
* The copy will have the same targets as the spell it's copying unless you choose new ones. You may change any number of the targets, including all of them or none of them. If, for one of the targets, you can't choose a new legal target, then it remains unchanged (even if the current target is illegal).



---

**Suspend**


The *Time Spiral* block introduced the suspend keyword, letting you take a significant discount on a spell's cost in exchange for not getting it until later.


![](https://media.wizards.com/2017/ima/en_22oKw2ZOrT.png)


Durkwood Baloth  

4GG  

Creature — Beast  

5/5  

Suspend 5—G *(Rather than cast this card from your hand, you may pay G and exile it with five time counters on it. At the beginning of your upkeep, remove a time counter. When the last is removed, cast it without paying its mana cost. It has haste.)*


* You can exile a card in your hand using suspend any time you could cast that card. Consider its card type, any effect that affects when you could cast it (such as flash) and any other effects that could stop you from casting it (such as Meddling Mage's effect) to determine if and when you can do this. Whether you could actually complete all steps in casting the card is irrelevant. For example, you can exile a card with suspend that has no mana cost or that requires a target even if no legal targets are available at that time.
* Exiling a card with suspend isn't casting that card. This action doesn't use the stack and can't be responded to.
* If the spell requires any targets, those targets are chosen when the spell is finally cast, not when it's exiled.
* If the first triggered ability of suspend (the one that removes time counters) is countered, no time counter is removed. The ability will trigger again during the card's owner's next upkeep.
* When the last time counter is removed, the second triggered ability of suspend will trigger. It doesn't matter why the last time counter was removed or what effect removed it.
* If the second triggered ability of suspend (the one that lets you cast the card) is countered, the card can't be cast. It remains exiled with no time counters on it, and it's no longer suspended.
* As the second triggered ability resolves, you must cast the card if able. Timing permissions based on the card's type are ignored.
* If you can't cast the card, perhaps because there are no legal targets available, it remains exiled with no time counters on it, and it's no longer suspended.
* A creature cast using suspend will enter the battlefield with haste. It will have haste until another player gains control of it (or, in some rare cases, gains control of the creature spell itself).



---

**Unleash**


The unleash keyword from the *Return to Ravnica* set lets you make some creatures fiercer and relentlessly aggressive.


![](https://media.wizards.com/2017/ima/en_nejcPpP3vo.png)


Splatter Thug  

2R  

Creature — Human Warrior  

2/2  

First strike  

Unleash *(You may have this creature enter the battlefield with a +1/+1 counter on it. It can't block as long as it has a +1/+1 counter on it.)*


* You make the choice to have the creature with unleash enter the battlefield with a +1/+1 counter or not as it's entering the battlefield. At that point, it's too late for a player to respond to the creature spell by trying to counter it, for example.
* The unleash ability applies no matter where the creature is entering the battlefield from.
* A creature with unleash can't block if it has any +1/+1 counter on it, not just one put on it by the unleash ability.
* Putting a +1/+1 counter on a creature with unleash that's already blocking won't remove it from combat. It will continue to block.



---

CARD-SPECIFIC NOTES
===================


![](https://media.wizards.com/2017/ima/en_tjYOFHNgDU.png)


Abyssal Persecutor  

2BB  

Creature — Demon  

6/6  

Flying, trample  

You can't win the game and your opponents can't lose the game.


* No game effect can cause you to win the game or cause any opponent to lose the game while you control Abyssal Persecutor. It doesn't matter whether an opponent has 0 or less life, an opponent is forced to draw a card while his or her library is empty, an opponent has ten or more poison counters, an opponent is dealt combat damage by Phage the Untouchable, you control Felidar Sovereign and have 40 or more life, or so on. You keep playing.
* Other circumstances can still cause an opponent to lose the game, however. An opponent will lose a game if he or she concedes, if that player is penalized with a Game Loss or a Match Loss during a sanctioned tournament due to a DCI rules infraction, or if that player's *Magic Online* game clock runs out of time.
* Abyssal Persecutor won't preclude an opponent's life total from reaching 0 or less. It will just preclude that player from losing the game as a result.
* If Abyssal Persecutor leaves the battlefield while an opponent has 0 or less life, that opponent will lose the game as a state-based action. No player can respond between the time Abyssal Persecutor leaves the battlefield and the time that player loses the game.
* Even though your opponents can't lose the game, a player can't pay an amount of life that's greater than his or her life total. If a player's life total is 0 or less, that player can't pay life at all, with one exception: a player may always pay 0 life.



---

![](https://media.wizards.com/2017/ima/en_iG9DVArJFI.png)


Aerial Predation  

2G  

Instant  

Destroy target creature with flying. You gain 2 life.


* You must be able to target a creature with flying to cast Aerial Predation.
* If the creature with flying is an illegal target when Aerial Predation tries to resolve, it will be countered and none of its effects will happen. You won't gain 2 life.



---

![](https://media.wizards.com/2017/ima/en_6fCFXV3zt9.png)


Aether Vial  

1  

Artifact  

At the beginning of your upkeep, you may put a charge counter on Aether Vial.  

T: You may put a creature card with converted mana cost equal to the number of charge counters on Aether Vial from your hand onto the battlefield.


* If Aether Vial leaves the battlefield while its second ability is on the stack, use its last known number of charge counters to determine what you may put from your hand onto the battlefield.
* If a card in a player's hand has X in its mana cost, X is considered to be 0.



---

![](https://media.wizards.com/2017/ima/en_hYFKTS00hb.png)


Aetherize  

3U  

Instant  

Return all attacking creatures to their owner's hand.


* An "attacking creature" is one that has been declared as an attacker this combat, or one that was put onto the battlefield attacking this combat. Unless that creature leaves combat, it continues to be an attacking creature through the end of combat step, even if the player it was attacking has left the game, or the planeswalker it was attacking has left combat. There's no such thing as an attacking creature outside of the combat phase.



---

![](https://media.wizards.com/2017/ima/en_Z1akbavYeb.png)


Ajani's Pridemate  

1W  

Creature — Cat Soldier  

2/2  

Whenever you gain life, you may put a +1/+1 counter on Ajani's Pridemate.


* The ability of Ajani's Pridemate triggers just once for each life-gaining event, whether it's 1 life from Auriok Champion or 6 life from Tavern Swindler.
* If Ajani's Pridemate is dealt lethal damage at the same time that you gain life, it won't receive a counter from its ability in time to save it.
* Each creature with lifelink dealing combat damage causes a separate life-gaining event. For example, if two creatures you control with lifelink deal combat damage at the same time, Ajani's Pridemate's ability will trigger twice. However, if a single creature you control with lifelink deals combat damage to multiple creatures, players, and/or planeswalkers at the same time (perhaps because it has trample or was blocked by more than one creature), the ability will trigger only once.



---

![](https://media.wizards.com/2017/ima/en_syxYjsBidm.png)


Amass the Components  

3U  

Sorcery  

Draw three cards, then put a card from your hand on the bottom of your library.


* If you cast Amass the Components with fewer than three cards in your library, you'll draw the remaining cards in your library, put a card from your hand on the bottom of your library, then lose the game for drawing a card from a library with no cards in it the next time state-based actions are performed.



---

![](https://media.wizards.com/2017/ima/en_N76EvF2QcG.png)


Angelic Accord  

3W  

Enchantment  

At the beginning of each end step, if you gained 4 or more life this turn, create a 4/4 white Angel creature token with flying.


* Angelic Accord's ability checks how much life you've gained during the turn, not what your life total is compared to what it was when the turn began. For example, if you start the turn at 10 life, gain 6 life during the turn, then lose 6 life later that turn, the ability will trigger.
* If you haven't gained 4 or more life during the turn when the end step begins, the ability won't trigger at all. Gaining life during the end step won't cause the ability to trigger.



---

![](https://media.wizards.com/2017/ima/en_1sZgcbJr7b.png)


Anger of the Gods  

1RR  

Sorcery  

Anger of the Gods deals 3 damage to each creature. If a creature dealt damage this way would die this turn, exile it instead.


* Creatures don't necessarily have to be dealt lethal damage by Anger of the Gods to be exiled. After being dealt damage, if they would die for any reason that turn, they'll be exiled instead.



---

![](https://media.wizards.com/2017/ima/en_aZc2MzGYq6.png)


Archangel of Thune  

3WW  

Creature — Angel  

3/4  

Flying, lifelink  

Whenever you gain life, put a +1/+1 counter on each creature you control.


* Archangel of Thune's last ability triggers just once for each life-gaining event, whether it's 1 life from Auriok Champion or 6 life from Tavern Swindler.
* If a creature you control is dealt lethal damage at the same time that you gain life, it won't receive a counter from Archangel of Thune's last ability in time to save it.
* Each creature with lifelink dealing combat damage causes a separate life-gaining event. For example, if two creatures you control with lifelink deal combat damage at the same time, Archangel of Thune's last ability will trigger twice. However, if a single creature you control with lifelink deals combat damage to multiple creatures, players, and/or planeswalkers at the same time (perhaps because it has trample or was blocked by more than one creature), the ability will trigger only once.



---

![](https://media.wizards.com/2017/ima/en_7P3Zp8nhOw.png)


Assault Formation  

1G  

Enchantment  

Each creature you control assigns combat damage equal to its toughness rather than its power.  

G: Target creature with defender can attack this turn as though it didn't have defender.  

2G: Creatures you control get +0/+1 until end of turn.


* For example, a 2/3 creature will assign 3 combat damage rather than 2.
* Assault Formation's first ability doesn't actually change any creature's power. It changes only the amount of combat damage it assigns. All other rules and effects that check power or toughness use the real values. For example, Hunt the Weak won't cause a creature to fight with its toughness.



---

![](https://media.wizards.com/2017/ima/en_5SgBMqY6qJ.png)


Austere Command  

4WW  

Sorcery  

Choose two —  

• Destroy all artifacts.  

• Destroy all enchantments.  

• Destroy all creatures with converted mana cost 3 or less.  

• Destroy all creatures with converted mana cost 4 or greater.


* Each of the chosen modes happens sequentially. If a permanent has an ability that triggers whenever it or another permanent is destroyed, it will see permanents destroyed at the same time as it or before it, but not permanents destroyed by later modes.
* If the first and third modes are chosen, an artifact creature with converted mana cost 3 or less will have to be regenerated twice to survive. This is because the modes happen sequentially, and the regeneration "shield" is used up by the first one. (A similar thing happens with most of the other combinations.)
* If a card is exiled "until" another permanent leaves the battlefield, the exiled card returns to the battlefield immediately after that permanent leaves the battlefield during Austere Command's resolution, and it may be destroyed by a later mode.



---

![](https://media.wizards.com/2017/ima/en_3x87NrWAEY.png)


Avacyn, Angel of Hope  

5WWW  

Legendary Creature — Angel  

8/8  

Flying, vigilance, indestructible  

Other permanents you control have indestructible.


* A permanent with indestructible can't be destroyed, but it can still be sacrificed, exiled, put into a graveyard, and so on. Notably, a permanent with indestructible can be put into its owner's graveyard due to the "legend rule."
* Creatures with indestructible still have damage marked on them, even though that damage won't destroy them. If Avacyn leaves the battlefield, creatures that lose indestructible and have lethal damage marked on them will be destroyed.
* A creature with 0 toughness is put into its owner's graveyard even if it has indestructible.
* A planeswalker with indestructible still loses loyalty as it's dealt damage. It is put into its owner's graveyard if its loyalty becomes 0.



---

![](https://media.wizards.com/2017/ima/en_wmH77apRwZ.png)


Azorius Charm  

WU  

Instant  

Choose one —  

• Creatures you control gain lifelink until end of turn.  

• Draw a card.  

• Put target attacking or blocking creature on top of its owner's library.


* Multiple instances of lifelink on the same creature are redundant.



---

![](https://media.wizards.com/2017/ima/en_cSUolUyzoU.png)


Balustrade Spy  

3B  

Creature — Vampire Rogue  

2/3  

Flying  

When Balustrade Spy enters the battlefield, target player reveals cards from the top of his or her library until he or she reveals a land card, then puts those cards into his or her graveyard.


* If the target player has no land cards in his or her library, all cards from that library will be revealed and put into his or her graveyard.



---

![](https://media.wizards.com/2017/ima/en_2sL054gB4z.png)


Benevolent Ancestor  

2W  

Creature — Spirit  

0/4  

Defender  

T: Prevent the next 1 damage that would be dealt to target creature or player this turn.


* If the target creature or player would be dealt damage by multiple sources at once, that player or that creature's controller chooses one of those sources at the time damage would be dealt, and 1 of that damage from that source is prevented.



---

![](https://media.wizards.com/2017/ima/en_VaWWMWPzyR.png)


Bewilder  

2U  

Instant  

Target creature gets -3/-0 until end of turn.  

Draw a card.


* If the creature is an illegal target when Bewilder tries to resolve, it will be countered and none of its effects will happen. You won't draw a card.



---

![](https://media.wizards.com/2017/ima/en_wd61MnfErY.png)


Bladewing's Thrall  

2BB  

Creature — Zombie  

3/3  

Bladewing's Thrall has flying as long as you control a Dragon.  

When a Dragon enters the battlefield, you may return Bladewing's Thrall from your graveyard to the battlefield.


* The second ability of Bladewing's Thrall triggers even if a Dragon enters the battlefield under an opponent's control. The owner of Bladewing's Thrall, not the controller of that Dragon, will control Bladewing's Thrall.



---

![](https://media.wizards.com/2017/ima/en_MZ1wACX3Gp.png)


Blizzard Specter  

2UB  

Snow Creature — Specter  

2/3  

Flying  

Whenever Blizzard Specter deals combat damage to a player, choose one —  

• That player returns a permanent he or she controls to its owner's hand.  

• That player discards a card.


* You choose the mode when you put Blizzard Specter's triggered ability on the stack. Blizzard Specter's second mode may be chosen even if the player's hand is empty.
* If Blizzard Specter's first mode is chosen, the player who was dealt damage chooses the permanent to return to hand when the ability resolves. A permanent with hexproof or protection from black may be chosen this way.



---

![](https://media.wizards.com/2017/ima/en_LdkgTGsw4p.png)


Bogardan Hellkite  

6RR  

Creature — Dragon  

5/5  

Flash  

Flying  

When Bogardan Hellkite enters the battlefield, it deals 5 damage divided as you choose among any number of target creatures and/or players.


* You choose how many targets Bogardan Hellkite's triggered ability has and how the damage is divided as you put the ability onto the stack. Each target must receive at least 1 damage.
* You can't deal damage with Bogardan Hellkite's triggered ability to both a player and a planeswalker that player controls. You also can't deal damage to more than one planeswalker controlled by the same player. If you choose to redirect the damage being dealt to a player to a planeswalker, you must redirect all the damage to a single planeswalker.
* If some of the creatures or players are illegal targets as Bogardan Hellkite's triggered ability tries to resolve, the original division of damage still applies and the damage that would have been dealt to the illegal targets is lost. It won't be dealt instead to a legal target.

* If a permanent spell is chosen as the source of damage, Burrenton Forge-Tender's prevention effect continues to apply for the rest of the turn to the permanent that spell becomes once it has entered the battlefield.

At the beginning of your upkeep, return an instant or sorcery card at random from your graveyard to your hand.  

Whenever you cast an instant or sorcery spell, Charmbreaker Devils gets +4/+0 until end of turn.


* The instant or sorcery card returned to your hand is chosen at random as Charmbreaker Devils's first ability resolves. If any player responds to the ability, that player won't yet know what card will be returned.
* Because the first ability doesn't target the instant or sorcery card, any instants or sorceries put into your graveyard in response to that ability may be returned to your hand.
* All players get to see which card you chose at random as it's returned to your hand.

• Return target permanent to its owner's hand.  

• Tap all creatures your opponents control.  

• Draw a card.


* You choose both modes as you cast Cryptic Command. You must choose two different modes.
* Look at both chosen modes to determine how many targets Cryptic Command has, if any. If it has at least one target, and all its targets are illegal when it tries to resolve, then it will be countered and none of its effects will happen. For example, if you choose the second and fourth modes, and the permanent is an illegal target when Cryptic Command tries to resolve, you won't draw a card.

When Day of the Dragons enters the battlefield, exile all creatures you control. Then create that many 5/5 red Dragon creature tokens with flying.  

When Day of the Dragons leaves the battlefield, sacrifice all Dragons you control. Then return the exiled cards to the battlefield under your control.


* Auras attached to the exiled creatures will be put into their owners' graveyards. Equipment attached to the exiled creatures will become unattached and remain on the battlefield. Any counters on the exiled creatures will cease to exist.
* Token creatures will count to determine how many Dragon tokens you create, but they won't be returned to the battlefield when Day of the Dragons leaves the battlefield.
* If Day of the Dragons leaves the battlefield before its first ability has resolved, its second ability will trigger and you'll sacrifice any Dragons you already control. Then its first ability will resolve and exile your creatures forever, leaving you with that many Dragon tokens.
* All of the nontoken creatures you exiled return to the battlefield when Day of the Dragons leaves the battlefield, even if some or all of the Dragon tokens had already left the battlefield.

Target creature has base power and toughness 1/1 until end of turn.


* Diminish overwrites all previous effects that set the target creature's power and toughness to specific values. Other effects that set its power or toughness to specific values that start to apply after Diminish resolves will overwrite this effect.
* Effects that modify the target creature's power or toughness, such as the effects of Elesh Norn, Grand Cenobite or prowess, will apply to it no matter when they started to take effect. The same is true for counters that change the creature's power or toughness (such as +1/+1 counters).

Draconic Roar  

1R  

Instant  

As an additional cost to cast Draconic Roar, you may reveal a Dragon card from your hand.  

Draconic Roar deals 3 damage to target creature. If you revealed a Dragon card or controlled a Dragon as you cast Draconic Roar, Draconic Roar deals 3 damage to that creature's controller.


* Draconic Roar targets only the creature, not its controller. If that creature becomes an illegal target before Draconic Roar resolves, the spell is countered and none of its effects will occur. No damage is dealt.
* If Draconic Roar is copied, the controller of the target creature will be dealt damage only if a Dragon card was revealed as an additional cost. The copy wasn't cast, so whether you controlled a Dragon won't matter.
* You can't reveal more than one Dragon card to multiply the damage. There is also no additional benefit for both revealing a Dragon card as an additional cost and controlling a Dragon as you cast the spell.
* If you don't reveal a Dragon card from your hand, you must control a Dragon as you are finished casting the spell to get the bonus. For example, if you lose control of your only Dragon while casting the spell (because, for example, you sacrificed it to activate a mana ability), you won't get the bonus.

Dragon Tempest  

1R  

Enchantment  

Whenever a creature with flying enters the battlefield under your control, it gains haste until end of turn.  

Whenever a Dragon enters the battlefield under your control, it deals X damage to target creature or player, where X is the number of Dragons you control.


* The amount of damage dealt by the Dragon that entered the battlefield is based on the number of Dragons you control when the ability resolves.
* If a Dragon entering the battlefield causes Dragon Tempest's second ability to trigger but leaves the battlefield before that ability resolves, that Dragon still deals damage.
* The two abilities aren't mutually exclusive. If a Dragon with flying (which is most of them) enters the battlefield under your control, both abilities will trigger.

Instant  

Electrolyze deals 2 damage divided as you choose among one or two target creatures and/or players.  

Draw a card.


* You divide the damage as you cast Electrolyze, not as it resolves. Each target must be assigned at least 1 damage. In other words, as you cast Electrolyze, you choose whether to have it deal 2 damage to a single target, or deal 1 damage to each of two targets.
* If Electrolyze targets two creatures and one becomes an illegal target, the remaining target is dealt 1 damage, not 2. You'll still draw a card.
* If all chosen targets are illegal as Electrolyze tries to resolve, it will be countered and none of its effects will happen. No damage will be dealt and you won't draw a card.

Fireball  

XR  

Sorcery  

Fireball deals X damage divided evenly, rounded down, among any number of target creatures and/or players.  

Fireball costs 1 more to cast for each target beyond the first.


* For example, if X is 5 and you choose three target creatures, Fireball has a total cost of 7R (even though its mana cost is just 5R and its converted mana cost is 6). If those creatures are all still legal targets as Fireball resolves, it deals 1 damage to each of them.
* You may cast Fireball with zero targets, regardless of the value chosen for X. If you do so, it will not be a targeted spell, and no damage will actually be dealt when it resolves.
* Fireball's damage is divided as Fireball resolves, not as it's cast, because there are no choices involved. The division involves only targets that are still legal as Fireball resolves.
* You can target more than X creatures. However, if the number of legal targets at the time Fireball resolves is greater than X, none of them will be dealt any damage.

Target player sacrifices a creature. If you revealed a Dragon card or controlled a Dragon as you cast Foul-Tongue Invocation, you gain 4 life.


* You may cast Foul-Tongue Invocation targeting a player who controls no creatures. If you qualify for the "Dragon bonus," you'll just gain 4 life.
* Foul-Tongue Invocation targets only the affected player. That player may choose to sacrifice a creature with hexproof or protection from black this way.
* If Foul-Tongue Invocation is copied, the controller of the copy will gain life only if a Dragon card was revealed as an additional cost. The copy wasn't cast, so whether you controlled a Dragon won't matter.

* If you don't reveal a Dragon card from your hand, you must control a Dragon as you are finished casting the spell to get the bonus.

Genesis Hydra enters the battlefield with X +1/+1 counters on it.


* Genesis Hydra's first ability will resolve before Genesis Hydra does. Notably, if you put an Aura card onto the battlefield this way, it can't enchant Genesis Hydra.
* If you have fewer than X cards in your library, you reveal all of them.
* If a card in a player's library has X in its mana cost, X is considered to be 0.
* A nonland permanent card is an artifact, creature, enchantment, or planeswalker card.
* If you put an Aura onto the battlefield this way, you choose what it enchants as it enters the battlefield. This doesn't target any permanent or player, but it must be able to enchant that permanent or player. For example, you could put a green Aura onto the battlefield enchanting a creature with hexproof controlled by an opponent, but not one with protection from green.
* If "the rest" is zero cards, either because X was 0 or because X was 1 and that card was put onto the battlefield, the library is still shuffled.

* If you have fewer than X cards in your library, you reveal all of them.
* If a card in a player's library has X in its mana cost, X is considered to be 0.
* A permanent card is an artifact, creature, enchantment, land, or planeswalker card.
* If a card in your library has no mana symbols in its upper right corner (because it's a land card, for example), its converted mana cost is 0. Such cards can always be put onto the battlefield with Genesis Wave.
* You don't have to put permanent cards revealed this way onto the battlefield if you choose not to, regardless of their converted mana costs.
* All of the permanents put onto the battlefield this way enter at the same time. If any have triggered abilities that trigger on something else entering the battlefield, they'll see each other.

* If Guardian Idol has any +1/+1 counters on it, those counters will remain on it after it stops being a creature. Those counters will have no effect as long as Guardian Idol isn't a creature, but they will apply again if it later becomes a creature.
* Activating the last ability of Guardian Idol while it's already a creature will override any effects that set its power or toughness to a specific value. Effects that modify power or toughness without setting them to a specific value will continue to apply.

* The last ability of Jace's Phantasm constantly monitors each opponent's graveyard to see if the bonus applies. If the stated condition becomes no longer true, the bonus immediately stops applying.
* If Jace's Phantasm is dealt lethal damage at the same time as an opponent's creature, and that creature will become that opponent's tenth card in his or her graveyard, Jace's Phantasm will be destroyed before it gets +4/+4. This is because all creatures that have been dealt lethal damage are destroyed at the same time.
* In a multiplayer game, a single opponent must have ten or more cards in his or her graveyard for the bonus to apply, although this opponent may change over the course of the game. You don't have to pick a single opponent; the ability will monitor each opponent's graveyard.

Jin-Gitaxias, Core Augur  

8UU  

Legendary Creature — Praetor  

5/4  

Flash  

At the beginning of your end step, draw seven cards.  

Each opponent's maximum hand size is reduced by seven.


* If a player has more cards in his or her hand than his or her maximum hand size during the cleanup step of that player's turn, that player discards until he or she has that many cards. A player's maximum hand size isn't checked at any time other than his or her own cleanup step.
* Jin-Gitaxias doesn't affect the maximum hand size of its controller. Because the cleanup step is after the end step, its controller may have to discard some of the cards that were just drawn.
* Unless another spell or ability is affecting your opponent's maximum hand size, Jin-Gitaxias's ability will result in your opponent having a maximum hand size of zero. He or she will discard each card from his or her hand during his or her cleanup step.

When Jugan, the Rising Star dies, you may distribute five +1/+1 counters among any number of target creatures.


* You choose how many targets Jugan's triggered ability has and how the counters are distributed as you put the ability onto the stack. Each target must receive at least one counter.
* If some of the creatures are illegal targets as Jugan's triggered ability tries to resolve, the original distribution of counters still applies and the counters that would have been put on the illegal targets are lost. They won't be put instead on a legal target.

Kiki-Jiki, Mirror Breaker  

2RRR  

Legendary Creature — Goblin Shaman  

2/2  

Haste  

T: Create a token that's a copy of target nonlegendary creature you control. That token has haste. Sacrifice it at the beginning of the next end step.


* The token copies exactly what was printed on the creature and nothing else (unless that creature was copying something else or was a token; see below). It doesn't copy whether that creature was tapped or untapped, whether it had any counters on it or Auras and/or Equipment attached to it, or any non-copy effects that changed its power, toughness, types, color, and so on.
* If the copied creature had X in its mana cost, X is 0.
* If the copied creature was copying something else, the tokens enter the battlefield as whatever that creature was copying.
* If the copied creature is a token, the tokens created by Kiki-Jiki's ability copies the original characteristics of that token as stated by the effect that put it onto the battlefield.
* Any enters-the-battlefield abilities of the copied creature will trigger when the tokens enter the battlefield. Any "As [this creature] enters the battlefield" or "[This creature] enters the battlefield with" abilities of the copied creature will also work.

Knight of the Reliquary  

1GW  

Creature — Human Knight  

2/2  

Knight of the Reliquary gets +1/+1 for each land card in your graveyard.  

T, Sacrifice a Forest or Plains: Search your library for a land card, put it onto the battlefield, then shuffle your library.


* Knight of the Reliquary's first ability applies only while it's on the battlefield. In all other zones, it's a 2/2 creature.
* The activated ability's cost checks the land's subtype, not its name. You can sacrifice a nonbasic land this way as long as it has the subtype Forest or Plains. Most nonbasic lands don't have basic land types, even if they produce colored mana. For example, Horizon Canopy is neither a Forest nor a Plains, while Temple Garden is both.
* Sacrificing a Forest or Plains is part of the cost of Knight of the Reliquary's activated ability. Assuming that sacrificing the land puts it into your graveyard, Knight of the Reliquary's first ability will immediately give it an additional +1/+1 when that cost is paid because there'll be a new land card in your graveyard. Paying a cost can't be responded to (with Shock, for example).
* Knight of the Reliquary's activated ability lets you find any land card, not just a basic land card.

Kolaghan Monument  

3  

Artifact  

T: Add B or R to your mana pool.  

4BR: Kolaghan Monument becomes a 4/4 black and red Dragon artifact creature with flying until end of turn.


* A noncreature permanent that turns into a creature can attack, and its T abilities can be activated, only if its controller has continuously controlled that permanent since the beginning of his or her most recent turn. It doesn't matter how long the permanent has been a creature.
* If Kolaghan Monument has any +1/+1 counters on it, those counters will remain on it after it stops being a creature. Those counters will have no effect as long as Kolaghan Monument isn't a creature, but they will apply again if it later becomes a creature.
* Activating the last ability of Kolaghan Monument while it's already a creature will override any effects that set its power or toughness to a specific value. Effects that modify power or toughness without setting them to a specific value will continue to apply.

Creature — Demon  

7/7  

Flying, trample  

At the beginning of your upkeep, sacrifice a creature other than Lord of the Pit. If you can't, Lord of the Pit deals 7 damage to you.


* If you control any other creatures as Lord of the Pit's triggered ability resolves, you must sacrifice one. You can't choose to be dealt 7 damage instead.
* If Lord of the Pit has gained lifelink, being dealt 7 damage by it doesn't cause your life total to change, even though you gain and lose life. If your life total is less than 7, you won't lose the game.
* If you have two Lords of the Pit, you can sacrifice them to each other.

Lure  

1GG  

Enchantment — Aura  

Enchant creature  

All creatures able to block enchanted creature do so.


* Lure doesn't give any creatures the ability to block the target creature. It just forces those creatures that are already able to block the creature to do so.
* As blockers are declared, any creature that's tapped or affected by a spell or ability that says it can't block doesn't block. If there's a cost associated with having the creature block, no player is forced to pay that cost, so it doesn't block if that cost isn't paid.

Magus of the Moon

Creature — Human Wizard  

2/2  

Nonbasic lands are Mountains.


* Nonbasic lands lose any other land types and abilities they had. They gain the land type Mountain and gain the ability "T: Add R to your mana pool."
* Magus of the Moon's effect doesn't affect names or supertypes. It won't turn any land into a basic land or remove the legendary supertype from a legendary land, and the lands won't be named Mountain.
* If a nonbasic land has an ability that applies "as [this land] enters the battlefield" or that causes it to enter the battlefield tapped or with counters, the land will lose that ability before it applies. This is a change from previous rules.
* If a nonbasic land has an ability that triggers "when" it enters the battlefield, it will lose that ability before it triggers.

Legendary Creature — Demon Dragon

Flying  

When Malfegor enters the battlefield, discard your hand. Each opponent sacrifices a creature for each card discarded this way.


* Malfegor's ability is not optional. You must discard your entire hand no matter how many creatures your opponents control.
* After you discard your hand and the number of creatures each opponent must sacrifice has been determined, each opponent in turn order, starting with the player whose turn it is if that player is your opponent, chooses which creatures he or she will sacrifice, then all the chosen creatures are all sacrificed at the same time.

Mana Drain  

UU  

Instant  

Counter target spell. At the beginning of your next main phase, add an amount of C to your mana pool equal to that spell's converted mana cost.


* Mana Drain can target a spell that can't be countered. When Mana Drain resolves, that spell won't be countered, but you'll still add mana to your mana pool at the beginning of your next main phase.
* If the target spell is an illegal target when Mana Drain tries to resolve, it will be countered and none of its effects will happen. You won't get any mana.
* Mana Drain's delayed triggered ability will usually trigger at the beginning of your precombat main phase. However, if you cast Mana Drain during your precombat main phase or during your combat phase, its delayed triggered ability will trigger at the beginning of that turn's postcombat main phase.

Enchantment  

Skip your draw step.  

Whenever you discard a card, exile that card from your graveyard.  

Pay 1 life: Exile the top card of your library face down. Put that card into your hand at the beginning of your next end step.


* If a discarded card isn't put into your graveyard (due to an effect such as that of Obstinate Baloth) or leaves your graveyard (perhaps because another effect returned it to your hand), it won't be exiled.
* If you discard a card with madness and wish to cast it, Necropotence's ability won't exile that card. If you don't wish to cast it, you choose whether it ends up exiled or in your graveyard.
* Necropotence's last ability creates a delayed triggered ability that will put the exiled card into your hand. That ability still triggers even if Necropotence is removed from the battlefield before your end step.

T: Add W to your mana pool. Activate this ability only if you control an Island.  

T: Add U to your mana pool. Activate this ability only if you control a Plains.


* Nimbus Maze's last two abilities check the subtypes of lands you control, not their names. You can activate the appropriate abilities as long as you control a land with the corresponding subtype, Plains or Island. Most nonbasic lands don't have basic land types, even if they produce colored mana. For example, Nimbus Maze itself is neither a Plains nor an Island, while Hallowed Fountain is both.

4/4  

When Obstinate Baloth enters the battlefield, you gain 4 life.  

If a spell or ability an opponent controls causes you to discard Obstinate Baloth, put it onto the battlefield instead of putting it into your graveyard.


* If a spell or ability an opponent controls causes you to discard Obstinate Baloth, and both Obstinate Baloth's ability and another ability (such as that of an opponent's Leyline of the Void) instruct you to put Obstinate Baloth somewhere else instead of putting it into your graveyard, you choose which one to apply.
* If you discard Obstinate Baloth and put it onto the battlefield, you've still discarded it. Abilities that trigger when you discard a card (such as that of Raiders' Wake) will still trigger.

Path of Bravery  

2W  

Enchantment  

As long as your life total is greater than or equal to your starting life total, creatures you control get +1/+1.  

Whenever one or more creatures you control attack, you gain life equal to the number of attacking creatures.


* Your starting life total is the life total you began the game with. For most two-player formats, this is 20. For Two-Headed Giant, it's the life total your team started with, usually 30. In Commander games, your starting life total is 40.
* If a creature you control is dealt damage at the same time that you gain life (most likely because a source you control with lifelink deals damage at the same time), and your life total becomes greater than or equal to your starting life total, apply Path of Bravery's effect before considering whether or not the damage dealt to that creature is lethal.
* Path of Bravery's triggered ability triggers only once, after attacking creatures are declared. For example, if you attack with five creatures, you'll gain 5 life as a single event.
* If a creature enters the battlefield attacking after attacking creatures have been declared, the ability won't trigger again because you didn't declare that creature as an attacking creature. However, if such a creature enters the battlefield before the ability resolves, it will be counted when determining how much life is gained.

Creature — Cat Spirit  

1/0  

Phantom Tiger enters the battlefield with two +1/+1 counters on it.  

If damage would be dealt to Phantom Tiger, prevent that damage. Remove a +1/+1 counter from Phantom Tiger.


* If Phantom Tiger is dealt damage by multiple sources at once (most likely because it was blocked by multiple creatures in combat), all of that damage is prevented and you remove only one counter from it.
* If damage that can't be prevented is be dealt to Phantom Tiger, you still remove a counter even though the prevention fails.
* If an effect raises Phantom Tiger's toughness so that it remains on the battlefield without any +1/+1 counters on it, Phantom Tiger's ability prevents all damage that would be dealt to it even though you can't remove a +1/+1 counter from it.

Pillar of Flame  

R  

Sorcery  

Pillar of Flame deals 2 damage to target creature or player. If a creature dealt damage this way would die this turn, exile it instead.


* A creature dealt damage by Pillar of Flame that dies this turn will be exiled even if it wasn't the target of Pillar of Flame (because the damage was redirected somehow). If the target creature isn't dealt damage (most likely because the damage was prevented), it won't be exiled if it dies that turn.
* A creature dealt damage by Pillar of Flame will be exiled no matter why the creature would die that turn. It could have its toughness reduced to 0 or less or be destroyed by another spell or ability.

Restoration Angel  

3W  

Creature — Angel  

3/4  

Flash  

Flying  

When Restoration Angel enters the battlefield, you may exile target non-Angel creature you control, then return that card to the battlefield under your control.


* Once the exiled creature returns, it's considered a new object with no relation to the object that it was. Auras attached to the exiled creature will be put into their owners' graveyards. Equipment attached to the exiled creature will become unattached and remain on the battlefield. Any counters on the exiled creature will cease to exist.
* The returned creature won't be the target of any spells or abilities that targeted it before. Any spells that don't target it, such as Austere Command, will still affect it.
* If you target a creature that you control but don't own, you control the returned creature indefinitely after it returns. When you leave a multiplayer game, exile any objects that you put onto the battlefield under your control but don't own.
* If a token is exiled this way, it will cease to exist and won't return to the battlefield.

River of Tears  

Land  

T: Add U to your mana pool. If you played a land this turn, add B to your mana pool instead.

Rosheen Meanderer  

3(r/g)  

Legendary Creature — Giant Shaman  

4/4  

T: Add CCCC to your mana pool. Spend this mana only on costs that contain X.


* A "cost that contains X" may be a spell's total cost, an activated ability's cost, a suspend cost, or a cost you're asked to pay as part of the resolution of a spell or ability (such as Condescend). A spell's total cost includes either its mana cost (printed in the upper right corner) or its alternative cost (such as flashback), as well as any additional costs (such as kicker). If it's something you can spend mana on, it's a cost. If that cost includes the X symbol in it, you can spend mana generated by Rosheen on that cost.
* You can spend mana generated by Rosheen on any part of a cost that contains X. You're not limited to spending it only on the X part.
* You can spend mana generated by Rosheen on a cost that includes X even if you've chosen an X of 0, or if the card specifies that you can spend only colored mana on X. (You'll have to spend Rosheen's mana on a different part of that cost, of course.)
* You don't have to spend all four mana on the same cost.

Whenever Scourge of Valkas or another Dragon enters the battlefield under your control, it deals X damage to target creature or player, where X is the number of Dragons you control.  

R: Scourge of Valkas gets +1/+0 until end of turn.


* The amount of damage dealt by the Dragon that entered the battlefield is based on the number of Dragons you control when the ability resolves.
* If a Dragon entering the battlefield causes Scourge of Valkas's ability to trigger but leaves the battlefield before that ability resolves, that Dragon still deals damage.

As long as you have 30 or more life, Serra Ascendant gets +5/+5 and has flying.


* If Serra Ascendant is dealt damage at the same time that you gain life (most likely because it dealt combat damage to a creature blocking or blocked by it), and your life total becomes 30 or greater, apply its last effect before considering whether or not the damage dealt to it is lethal.
* In a Two-Headed Giant game, anything that cares about your life total checks your team's life total. Serra Ascendant gets +5/+5 and has flying as long as your team has 30 or more life.

Serum Powder

Artifact  

T: Add C to your mana pool.  

Any time you could mulligan and Serum Powder is in your hand, you may exile all the cards from your hand, then draw that many cards. *(You can do this in addition to taking mulligans.)*


* You can use Serum Powder's second ability only while it's in your hand. If this card is in your hand, you can choose either to mulligan or to use Serum Powder's ability. Using the ability doesn't prevent you from taking further mulligans, and taking a mulligan doesn't prevent you from using a Serum Powder's ability if you happen to draw one in your new hand.
* Unlike a normal mulligan, Serum Powder lets you draw the same number of cards that were in your hand, not one less. If you have already taken one mulligan and your hand contains six cards including a Serum Powder, you can choose to exile those six cards and draw six new cards.
* The cards in your hand are exiled for the rest of the game; they aren't shuffled back into your library if you take another mulligan. Cards exiled are always face up unless the effect that exiled them says they aren't. Be sure to return those cards to your deck for your next game.

Legendary Creature — Praetor  

6/6  

Swampwalk  

At the beginning of your upkeep, return target creature card from your graveyard to the battlefield.  

At the beginning of each opponent's upkeep, that player sacrifices a creature.


* Swampwalk is a keyword ability that means "This creature can't be blocked if defending player controls a Swamp." Most nonbasic lands don't have basic land types, even if they produce colored mana. For example, Graven Cairns is neither a Swamp nor a Mountain, while Blood Crypt is both.
* If another triggered ability during your upkeep causes you to sacrifice a creature, such as that of Lord of the Pit, you won't be able to target it with Sheoldred's triggered ability as that ability is put on the stack.
* The opponent whose upkeep it is chooses a creature to sacrifice when Sheoldred's second triggered ability resolves.
* In a Two-Headed Giant game, the last ability will trigger twice at the beginning of the opposing team's upkeep, once for each player on that team. Each player sacrifices only a creature he or she controls.

* You (not your opponent) choose which pile to put into your hand and which to put into your graveyard.
* A pile can have no cards in it. In this case, you'll choose whether to put all the revealed cards into your hand or into your graveyard.
* In multiplayer games, you choose an opponent to separate the cards when the ability resolves. This doesn't target that opponent. Because the cards are revealed, all players may see the cards and offer opinions.

* Surreal Memoir doesn't target. You don't choose an instant card at random from your graveyard until it resolves. Once you randomly select a card, it's too late for players to respond.
* If you have only one instant card in your graveyard as Surreal Memoir resolves, that's the one you'll return to your hand.
* All players get to see which card you chose at random as it's returned to your hand.

Tavern Swindler

Creature — Human Rogue  

2/2  

T, Pay 3 life: Flip a coin. If you win the flip, you gain 6 life.

Teferi, Mage of Zhalfir  

2UUU  

Legendary Creature — Human Wizard  

3/4  

Flash  

Creature cards you own that aren't on the battlefield have flash.  

Each opponent can cast spells only any time he or she could cast a sorcery.


* Teferi's last ability means that in order for an opponent to cast a spell, it must be that opponent's turn, during a main phase, and the stack must be empty. This is true even if the player doesn't have a sorcery he or she is able to cast, or if a rule or effect allows a sorcery to be cast at another time.
* If you have Teferi on the battlefield, you may exile creature cards in your hand with suspend any time you could cast an instant.
* If a spell or ability lets an opponent cast a card as part of its effect (such as suspend and rebound do), that opponent can't cast that card since the currently resolving ability is still on the stack. This is true even if that card is an instant.

Thundermaw Hellkite  

3RR  

Creature — Dragon  

5/5  

Flying, haste  

When Thundermaw Hellkite enters the battlefield, it deals 1 damage to each creature with flying your opponents control. Tap those creatures.


* Thundermaw Hellkite will deal 1 damage to each creature with flying your opponents control whether those creatures are tapped or untapped.
* If the damage that would be dealt to a creature with flying is prevented, that creature will still be tapped. If that damage is redirected to another creature, the creature with flying will be tapped, not necessarily the creature that ultimately was dealt damage.

Tormenting Voice  

1R  

Sorcery

Trepanation Blade  

3

Equip 2


* The land card is counted when calculating the bonus, and it will be put into the graveyard with the other revealed cards.
* If the equipped creature is attacking a planeswalker in any game except a Two-Headed Giant game, the controller of the planeswalker is the defending player.
* If the equipped creature is attacking in a Two-Headed Giant game, the controller of the attacking creature chooses one of the two defending players, even if the creature is attacking a planeswalker.

Urabrask the Hidden  

3RR  

Legendary Creature — Praetor  

4/4  

Creatures you control have haste.  

Creatures your opponents control enter the battlefield tapped.


* Urabrask the Hidden gives itself haste while it's on the battlefield.
* If a creature an opponent controls enters the battlefield at the same time that Urabrask the Hidden enters the battlefield under your control, Urabrask's effect doesn't apply to your opponent's creature.

Vizkopa Guildmage  

WB  

Creature — Human Wizard  

2/2  

1WB: Target creature gains lifelink until end of turn.  

1WB: Whenever you gain life this turn, each opponent loses that much life.


* Multiple instances of lifelink on the same creature are redundant
* Each time Vizkopa Guildmage's second ability resolves, a delayed triggered ability is created. Whenever you gain life that turn, each of those abilities will trigger. For example, if you activate the second ability twice, let those abilities resolve, then gain 2 life, each opponent will lose a total of 4 life.
* In a Two-Headed Giant game, Vizkopa Guildmage's delayed triggered ability causes the opposing team to lose twice the life you gained.

Vorinclex, Voice of Hunger  

6GG  

Legendary Creature — Praetor  

7/6  

Trample  

Whenever you tap a land for mana, add one mana to your mana pool of any type that land produced.  

Whenever an opponent taps a land for mana, that land doesn't untap during its controller's next untap step.


* The types of mana are white, blue, black, red, green, and colorless.
* If a land you control produces multiple mana of more than one type, Vorinclex's first triggered ability adds one mana of only one of those types. You choose which of those types it adds.
* If Vorinclex leaves the battlefield after its second ability has triggered, that ability still resolves and the affected land won't untap during its controller's next untap step.

1B  

Creature — Zombie

* Wight of Precinct Six's ability applies only while it's on the battlefield. In all other zones, it's a 1/1 creature.

Yosei, the Morning Star  

4WW  

Legendary Creature — Dragon Spirit  

5/5  

Flying  

When Yosei, the Morning Star dies, target player skips his or her next untap step. Tap up to five target permanents that player controls.


* If any of the targets of Yosei's ability are illegal, they won't be tapped.
* If all of the permanents targeted by Yosei's ability become illegal targets, nothing becomes tapped, but the target player still skips his or her untap step.
* If the player becomes an illegal target, the target permanents are tapped, but the player doesn't skip his or her untap step.
* If a permanent won't untap during its controller's next untap step, that effect waits to apply until its controller has an untap step that isn't skipped.
* If more than one effect instructs a player to skip his or her next untap step, such as if Yosei dies more than once in a turn, that player skips that many untap steps. This is different from effects that state that something doesn't untap during an untap step.
