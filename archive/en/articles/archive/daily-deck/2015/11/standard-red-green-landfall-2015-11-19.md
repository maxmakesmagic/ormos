When I think about red aggressive decks in Standard, the deck that immediately comes to mind is Atarka Red. It's one of the most consistent and explosive decks in the format. A newcomer has entered the scene, and while it plays many different cards, it is still trying to do a thing similar to Atarka Red.


Landfall decks are not new to the competitive scene, but unlike the landfall decks that we saw at the start of the *Battle for Zendikar* Limited format, this landfall deck is trying to combo kill you in one turn with [Temur Battle Rage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Temur+Battle+Rage) and [Become Immense](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Become+Immense)—just like traditional Atarka Red decks try to do.

The key differences between Red-Green Landfall and Atarka Red is the landfall deck plays a very different creature suite. [Scythe Leopard](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scythe+Leopard) and [Snapping Gnarlid](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snapping+Gnarlid) make appearances and are the reason why we're calling this deck "Landfall," but another important creature here is [Den Protector](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Den+Protector). Most decks that try to win with [Temur Battle Rage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Temur+Battle+Rage) and [Become Immense](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Become+Immense) are "all-in" decks, meaning that they are trying to do their one thing and they will lose if they can't accomplish it. The addition of [Den Protector](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Den+Protector) slows the deck down a ton, but it helps in two ways. First, it makes your combo more consistent. If your opponent counters your [Become Immense](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Become+Immense), you have a way to get it back at instant speed. Secondly, [Den Protector](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Den+Protector) gives your deck a little more late-game resources, so that you actually have game once you've largely run out of steam.


However, the best reason to play [Den Protector](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Den+Protector) is that it's a combo in itself with [Become Immense](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Become+Immense). [Become Immense](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Become+Immense) makes it a 9/8, and that's usually big enough to be unblockable against most decks, as creatures smaller than [Den Protector](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Den+Protector) can't block it. That's a great reason to play this slower variant of Atarka Red.


Congratulations to Mats Törnros for his Top 32 finish at [Grand Prix Brussels](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/gpbru15)!
