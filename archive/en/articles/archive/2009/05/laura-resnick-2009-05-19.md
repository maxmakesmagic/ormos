| **1. Hero or Villain** | I like a heroic villain and a villanous hero. |
| **2. Mac or PC** | Mac. But I'm not obnoxious about it. |
| **3. Dog or Cat** | Both. I was raised at a kennel and am equally skilled at cleaning up after either species. |
| **4. Soft or Hard Candy** | Neither. I don't like candy. |
| **5. Cake or Pie** | Cake. Especially the kind that are so fancy they're hard to eat. |
