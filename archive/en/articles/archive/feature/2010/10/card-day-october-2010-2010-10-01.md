![Pentagram of the Ages](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Pentagram+of+the+Ages)**[Pentagram of the Ages](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pentagram+of+the+Ages)** – *Ice Age* rare. Many cards from *Ice Age* and *Alliances* feature [Arcum Dagsson](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arcum+Dagsson) (the [Soldevi Machinist](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soldevi+Machinist)) and Sorine Relicbane (the [Soldevi Heretic](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soldevi+Heretic)) squabbling over whether artifacts are good or bad for society. In the case of [Pentagram of the Ages](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pentagram+of+the+Ages), Dagsson is probably correct; it's hard to imagine it destroying their civilization.
 ![Su-Chi](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Su-Chi)**[Su-Chi](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Su-Chi)** – *Masters Edition* rare. [Su-Chi](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Su-Chi) is a 4/4 for ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20160830042801im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless4.gif) that provides four mana when it dies. Its name came from the word for "four" in two different languages.
 ![Three Wishes](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Three+Wishes)**[Three Wishes](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Three+Wishes)** – *Visions* rare. *Three Wishes* is unusual in that it explicitly allows its controller to look at face-down cards in the Exile zone. This used to come up when there was also a [Mindslaver](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mindslaver) and a [nonblack Wish](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?action=advanced&name=+%5Bwish%5D&type=+%5B%22Sorcery%22%5D&color=+!%5BB%5D), but now that the Wishes don't take cards from the Exile zone, it's harder to come up with an application for this rules quirk.
 ![Two-Headed Giant of Foriys](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Two-Headed+Giant+of+Foriys)**[Two-Headed Giant of Foriys](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Two-Headed+Giant+of+Foriys)** – *Unlimited Edition* rare. Early **Magic** card names had the occasional hidden pun. This is one that you might not notice unless you know that "Foriys" is supposed to be pronounced "Four-Eyes."
 ![One With Nature](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=One+With+Nature)**[One With Nature](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=One+With+Nature)** – *Scourge* uncommon. [One With Nature](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=One+With+Nature) is one of those cards that encourages people to combine it with other cards and abilities. Double Strike! Landfall! And so on!
 ![Platinum Angel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Platinum+Angel)**[Platinum Angel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Platinum+Angel)** – *Tenth Edition* rare. [Platinum Angel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Platinum+Angel) nearly missed its chance to be in the core set. For *Tenth Edition*, there was a [public vote](/en/articles/archive/selecting-tenth-edition-week-10-2006-08-16) on whether [Worship](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Worship) or [Platinum Angel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Platinum+Angel) would get to be in. The angel won and it's been in every core set since. [Worship](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Worship)? It hasn't been seen since *Ninth Edition*.
 ![Blacker Lotus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Blacker+Lotus)**[Blacker Lotus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blacker+Lotus)** – *Unglued* rare. [Blacker Lotus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blacker+Lotus) and [Chaos Confetti](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chaos+Confetti) are the only cards that require their own destruction. This means that [Blacker Lotus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blacker+Lotus) is presumably the rarest *Unglued* card! [Chaos Confetti](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chaos+Confetti) just gets to be "the rarest common," which isn't nearly as interesting.
 ![Yawgmoth Demon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Yawgmoth+Demon)**[Yawgmoth Demon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Yawgmoth+Demon)** – *Ninth Edition* rare. The symbol of Phyrexia is not new to **Magic**. It can even be seen in [Yawgmoth Demon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Yawgmoth+Demon)'s staff!
 ![Time Vault](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Time+Vault)**[Time Vault](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Time+Vault)** – *Unlimited Edition* rare. [Time Vault](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Time+Vault) is one of those cards that has gone through a lot of different Oracle wordings. The current version goes back to the original wording, which allows for [Twiddle](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Twiddle) shenanigans.
 ![Mox Opal](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Mox+Opal)**[Mox Opal](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mox+Opal)** – *Scars of Mirrodin* mythic rare. In the real world, opals come in a wide variety of colors, including white, blue, black, red, and green. These variations in reflected color account for [Mox Opal](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mox+Opal)'s ability to create any kind of mana.
 ![Black Carriage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Black+Carriage)**[Black Carriage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Black+Carriage)** – *Homelands* rare. On the [discussion page](http://gatherer.wizards.com/pages/Card/Discussion.aspx?multiverseid=2911) for [Black Carriage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Black+Carriage), ainsi\_la\_nuit says: "Thank you, Grand Creature Type Update, for allowing me to write that WOTC really put the carriage before the horse on this card." Nice work!
 ![Blue Elemental Blast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Blue+Elemental+Blast)**[Blue Elemental Blast](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blue+Elemental+Blast)** – *Fourth Edition* common. The difference between [Blue Elemental Blast](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blue+Elemental+Blast) and [Hydroblast](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hydroblast) is that [Hydroblast](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hydroblast) can target spells and permanents of any color, although it will only affect them if they're red when it resolves. Or if [Hydroblast](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hydroblast) has has the word "red" changed by [Sleight of Mind](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sleight+of+Mind) after it was cast.
 ![Red-Hot Hottie](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Red-Hot+Hottie)**[Red-Hot Hottie](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Red-Hot+Hottie)** – *Unhinged* common. If you want to play a deck with real burn potential, combine [Red-Hot Hottie](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Red-Hot+Hottie) with [Obsidian Fireheart](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Obsidian+Fireheart) so you can spread blaze counters and third-degree-burn counters all over your opponents' creatures and land.
 ![Bringer of the Green Dawn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Bringer+of+the+Green+Dawn)**[Bringer of the Green Dawn](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bringer+of+the+Green+Dawn)** – *Fifth Dawn* rare. When we first saw Mirrodin (in *Mirrodin*), there were only four suns. It took the entire block's storyline to result in the green sun appearing in the sky!
 ![Whitesun's Passage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Whitesun%27s+Passage)**[Whitesun's Passage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Whitesun%27s+Passage)** – *Scars of Mirrodin* common. "Whitesun" is a holy day for the Leonin of Mirrodin, when they celebrate the day when the white sun shines directly over Taj-Nar, beaming its light all the way down into the Cave of Light.
 ![Carrion Call](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Carrion+Call)**[Carrion Call](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Carrion+Call)** – *Scars of Mirrodin* uncommon. If you look closely at the art for [Carrion Call](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Carrion+Call), you'll see that the Phyrexian beetles are feeding off a dead wolf from Mirrodin. It might even be a [Tel-Jilad Wolf](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tel-Jilad+Wolf)!
 ![Etched Champion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Etched+Champion)**[Etched Champion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Etched+Champion)** – *Scars of Mirrodin* rare. It will come as no surprise that [Etched Champion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Etched+Champion) represents a descendant of *Fifth Dawn*'s [Etched Oracle](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Etched+Oracle). It helps that Matt Cavotta was able to reference his art from six years earlier!
 ![Precursor Golem](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Precursor+Golem)**[Precursor Golem](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Precursor+Golem)** – *Scars of Mirrodin* rare. Mirrodin was created by Karn, the silver golem built by Urza. The plane was originally populated by golems that Karn created in his own image and left behind as he explored the Multiverse.
 ![Memnite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Memnite)**[Memnite](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Memnite)** – *Scars of Mirrodin* uncommon. [Memnite](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Memnite) is the first pure 1/1 creature for ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20210707095534im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless0.gif) in the history of **Magic**. Is it safe? Well, [Ornithopter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ornithopter) was a 0/2 flier for ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20210707095534im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless0.gif), and [Dryad Arbor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dryad+Arbor) was a 1/1 that used up a land drop. So ... probably?
 ![Golem Foundry](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Golem+Foundry)**[Golem Foundry](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Golem+Foundry)** – *Scars of Mirrodin* common. When we showed the *Scars of Mirrodin* tokens [in this Arcana](/en/articles/archive/scars-mirrodin-tokens-2010-09-15), we claimed that the Golem token came from [Precursor Golem](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Precursor+Golem). Clearly, though, that [token](http://media.wizards.com/images/magic/daily/arcana/538_4.jpg) came out of the [Golem Foundry](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Golem+Foundry).
 ![Platinum Emperion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Platinum+Emperion)**[Platinum Emperion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Platinum+Emperion)** – *Scars of Mirrodin* mythic rare. From the [*Scars of Mirrodin* FAQ](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/tcg/Resources.aspx?x=magic/rules/faqs): "Abilities that trigger whenever damage is dealt to you will still trigger because that damage is still dealt, even though your life total doesn't change as a result."
