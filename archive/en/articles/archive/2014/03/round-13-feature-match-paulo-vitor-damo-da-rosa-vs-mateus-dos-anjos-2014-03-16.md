Hall of Famer Paulo Vitor Damo da Rosa has been putting up a very impressive showing with Esper Control all weekend, his deck far from unfamiliar to those following Standard right now. If you need some cliff notes, check out the last feature match for an example of how this deck operates. 


Mateus Dos Anjos, however, is the sole undefeated player of the event, having just come off of yet another win to ensure his lead in the event as well as his status as King of the Hill. His deck, Mono-Blue Devotion, is one of the top most played decks of the weekend, ranked only below Esper Control in terms of the number people playing the archetype on Day Two.




*The Round 13 Feature Match featured a juggernaut Hall of Fame player versus the last undefeated player in the tournament.*
