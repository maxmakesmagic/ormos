This week's "Sketches" looks at one of the Beasts of *Legions*, [Bloodstoke Howler](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodstoke+Howler) by industry great Christopher Moeller.


### 1. Art Description


These are the instructions given to the artist:


"Color: red  
 Location: Skirk Ridge  
Action: Show a reptilian beast standing on a ridge with his head bent back letting out a war shriek."


### 2. Sketch


This is the preliminary sketch submitted by Chris. (*Legions* was known as "Scourge" then. Wacky.)


There was no doubt that the Beast itself looked great. But the scale was a little off. "Cool, but scale might be a little extreme," noted a member of the internal creative team, "Those pines come up to its knee, and its power/toughness don't really justify that."


### 3. Final Art


Here is a large version of the final piece. The trees were left out.


### 4. Card


Finally, here is the card as you'll see it in booster packs.
