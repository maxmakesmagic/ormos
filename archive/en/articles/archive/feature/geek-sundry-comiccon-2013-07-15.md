We're super excited to announce our sponsorship of the Geek & Sundry Community party at this year's ComicCon! It's happening Friday, July 19, 2013, 8 p.m. Pacific Time into the evening! It's taking place at Jolt'n Joeâ€™s on 4th and J Street in the Gaslamp Quarter, just a block away from the Convention Center!


There will also be a Livestreaming **Magic** event on Saturday, July 20, at 3 p.m. Pacific. Streaming from Jolt'n Joes means you'll be able to watch celebs playing **Magic**!


Geek & Sundry are operating their Geek Lounge every day of the convention at Jolt'n Joes and you can swing by to demo the game with friends and see what they're up to! Click here to see [their complete schedule](http://www.geekandsundry.com/view/hang-with-geek-sundry-at-sdcc/) for ComicCon!
