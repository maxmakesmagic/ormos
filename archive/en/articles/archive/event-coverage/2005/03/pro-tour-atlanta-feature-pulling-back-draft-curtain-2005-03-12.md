We posed a series of questions to some of the top Pros here in Atlanta about how they run a Rochester Draft, particularly because of the unique *Champions-Champions-Betrayers* set-up being used this weekend. If you learn nothing by reading this, you're just not paying attention.


**Team: Von Dutch**   
**Name: Jeroen Remie**


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/ptatl05/team_remie.jpg)*Jeroen Remie*
**Who is calling your team's draft? Why?**


Me and Jelger. We tested for two weeks at TOGIT and know the format best. Kamiel was busy in school.


**What colors/cards do you want to position yourself for in the third pack? Why?**


White! [Waxmane Baku](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Waxmane+Baku) is by far the best common.


**Have your other opponents approached the draft as you expected during playtesting?**


We have a very flexible strategy so that we don't have to rely on what we expect at all.


****Have there been any cards that have shifted in value for you over the course of this tournament? What are they and what is the reason?****


No, we were very well prepared.


**What are the key cards -- staple cards, not rares -- in *Champions* and why?**


[Kabuto Moth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kabuto+Moth) is by far the best common.


**What are the key cards in *Betrayers* and why?**


[Waxmane Baku](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Waxmane+Baku), [Matsu-Tribe Sniper](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Matsu-Tribe+Sniper), and [Horobi's Whisper](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Horobi%27s+Whisper). The rest of the commons are just bad but these cards just win games by themselves.


**Team: Dave's The Boss**   
**Name: Paul Rietzl**


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/ptatl05/team_rietzl.jpg)*Paul Rietzl*
**Who is calling your team's draft? Why?**


Everyone, because we're all competent and trust each other to know what is important in a matchup.


**What colors/cards do you want to position yourself for in the third pack? Why?**


White on the left for [Waxmane Baku](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Waxmane+Baku). The green deck on the right needs to be done by the *Betrayers* packs.


**Have your other opponents approached the draft as you expected during playtesting?**


Basically. Lots of miscommunication and lack of confidence in the third pack.


**Have there been any cards that have shifted in value for you over the course of this tournament? What are they and what is the reason?**


Some cards that went up in value: [Sakura-Tribe Springcaller](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sakura-Tribe+Springcaller) because it has a big butt and allows you to cast a six-drop on turn four with a 2CC accelerator. [Teardrop Kami](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Teardrop+Kami), and [Bile Urchin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bile+Urchin) both were better than expected due to ninjas.


**What are the key cards -- staple cards, not rares -- in *Champions* and why?**


[Glacial Ray](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glacial+Ray), [Kabuto Moth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kabuto+Moth), and [Sakura-Tribe Elder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sakura-Tribe+Elder) are all essential to each archetype you want to draft.


**What are the key cards in *Betrayers* and why?**


[Waxmane Baku](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Waxmane+Baku) and Ninjas -- 'cause they are sneaky!


**Team: [Hired Muscle](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hired+Muscle)**  
**Name: Murray "the Mauler" Evans**



**Who is calling your team's draft? Why?**


Every man for himself. No one on my team ever listens to me.


**What colors/cards do you want to position yourself for in the third pack? Why?**


The third pack is the weakest so it is something I don't even think about.


**Have your other opponents approached the draft as you expected during playtesting?**


Not applicable. We didn't even have another team to draft against us.


**Have there been any cards that have shifted in value for you over the course of this tournament? What are they and what is the reason?**


**What are the key cards -- staple cards, not rares -- in *Champions* and why?**


[Glacial Ray](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glacial+Ray), [Scuttling Death](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scuttling+Death), Kodama's Might, [Kabuto Moth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kabuto+Moth), and [Teller of Tales](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Teller+of+Tales).


**What are the key cards in *Betrayers* and why?**


[Matsu-Tribe Sniper](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Matsu-Tribe+Sniper) just shuts down their blue and/or white deck.


**Team: Sherman's March**   
**Name: Craig Krempels**


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/ptatl05/team_krempels.jpg)*Craig Krempels*
**Who is calling your team's draft? Why?**


Picks are by committee. We practiced a lot together so we are all basically on the same page.


**What colors/cards do you want to position yourself for in the third pack? Why?**


**Have your other opponents approached the draft as you expected during playtesting?**


Generally, yes.


**Have there been any cards that have shifted in value for you over the course of this tournament? What are they and what is the reason?**


Because of the amount of testing we put in before the draft we had a handle on everything.


**What are the key cards -- staple cards, not rares -- in *Champions* and why?**


Hey! I don't write **Magic** strategy articles for a reason!


**Team: Free Yayo**   
**Name: Zach Parker**


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/ptatl05/team_parker.jpg)*Zach Parker*
**Who is calling your team's draft? Why?**


Me, I'm the most experienced player on the team.


**What colors/cards do you want to position yourself for in the third pack? Why?**


Didn't really test so I don't know but [Waxmane Baku](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Waxmane+Baku) and [Torrent of Stone](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Torrent+of+Stone) are pure gas . . . so I guess those would be the colors.


**Have your other opponents approached the draft as you expected during playtesting?**


Didn't test -- LOL!


**Have there been any cards that have shifted in value for you over the course of this tournament? What are they and what is the reason?**


Not really but I have done some spicy sideboarding Day 1 and some really spicy main deck cards today. I had [Reito Lantern](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reito+Lantern) against the triple [Soratami Mindsweeper](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soratami+Mindsweeper) -- the slowest matchup ever.


**What are the key cards -- staple cards, not rares -- in *Champions* and why?**


White: Moth, Blademaster, Cage  

Black: Greed, Scuttles, Cutthroat  

Red: Ray, Flame, Fire's [Roar](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Roar), [Frostwielder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Frostwielder)  

Green: Might, Reach, Elder, Sustainer, [Moss Kami](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Moss+Kami)  

Blue: Mirror-Guard


**What are the key cards in *Betrayers* and why?**


White: Waxmane, [Kami of False Hope](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kami+of+False+Hope)  

Red: Torrent, [Frostling](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Frostling)  

Green: [Roar](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Roar) of the Jukai, [Child of Thorns](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Child+of+Thorns)  

Blue: Shinobi, Deep Hours  

Black: Shinobi


**Team: Big Tyming w/A.Derosa**   
**Name: Antonino DeRosa**

**Who is calling your team's draft? Why?**


All three of us. It is too hard to keep track of three decks. If all the members work well together it is best to do it this way.


**What colors/cards do you want to position yourself for in the third pack? Why?**


Red on the right because it is the worst color. White goes on the left because [Waxmane Baku](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Waxmane+Baku) is the best common.


**Have your other opponents approached the draft as you expected during playtesting?**


Not at all but that is because this is the first team format where it is pick dependant and not color-dependant so everyone does something different.


**Have there been any cards that have shifted in value for you over the course of this tournament? What are they and what is the reason?**


It is all matchup dependant on the value of the cards.


**What are the key cards -- staple cards, not rares -- in *Champions* and why?**


Not a specific card . . . it is all about matchups, synergy, and mana curve.


**Team: NFC**  
**Name: Osyp Lebedowicz**


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/ptatl05/team_osyp.jpg)*Osyp Lebedowicz*
**Who is calling your team's draft? Why?**


John Fiorillo, he's awesome.


**What colors/cards do you want to position yourself for in the third pack? Why?**


White on the left (C seat) because of [Waxmane Baku](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Waxmane+Baku).


**Have your other opponents approached the draft as you expected during playtesting?**


They have been drafting much worse than expected.


**Have there been any cards that have shifted in value for you over the course of this tournament? What are they and what is the reason?**


Nothing really. We tested enough to know what's good and bad by now.


**What are the key cards -- staple cards, not rares -- in *Champions* and why?**


[Glacial Ray](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glacial+Ray) and [Kabuto Moth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kabuto+Moth) are just more powerful than anything else.


**What are the key cards in *Betrayers* and why?**


[Waxmane Baku](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Waxmane+Baku) is so good.


**Team: Boat**  
**Name: Tiago Chan**


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/ptatl05/team_chan.jpg)*Tiago Chan*
**Who is calling your team's draft? Why?**


Me, because I'm the one with more experience playing *Kamigawa* Block Limited.


**What colors/cards do you want to position yourself for in the third pack? Why?**


Red-black in the C seat for [Horobi's Whisper](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Horobi%27s+Whisper) and [Torrent of Stone](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Torrent+of+Stone). We don't like to pass good removal in any expansion.


**Have your other opponents approached the draft as you expected during playtesting?**


Yes, with either the conventional plan of red-black, blue-white, and green-X or the plan that is supposed to beat it -- white-black, blue-black or blue-red, and green-X. Though we don't believe very much in match-up advantage. At least it isn't working that way for us.


**Have there been any cards that have shifted in value for you over the course of this tournament? What are they and what is the reason?**


[Devouring Greed](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Devouring+Greed) is diminishing value. We never win with that card. [Indomitable Will](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Indomitable+Will) is on the rise. The opponent may know it is coming but even if they do nothing it is still good.


**What are the key cards -- staple cards, not rares -- in *Champions* and why?**


**What are the key cards in *Betrayers* and why?**


[Waxmane Baku](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Waxmane+Baku), [Horobi's Whisper](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Horobi%27s+Whisper) and [Torrent of Stone](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Torrent+of+Stone). None of us have played much with *Betrayers* and reusable removal is always good and Waxmane is simply amazing.


**Team: Squads, Packs, Souls**   
**Name: Joseph Crosby**


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/ptatl05/team_crosby.jpg)*Joseph Crosby*
**Who is calling your team's draft? Why?**


I am. Obviously everyone is very involved but we feel it is important for someone to have the final say in order to prevent communication breakdown. We chose me simply because I have the most team Rochester experience.


**What colors/cards do you want to position yourself for in the third pack? Why?**


Most of the time white will be in C to take advantage of [Waxmane Baku](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Waxmane+Baku). Red is best in B or A because it has a lot of depth but not many top cards. I prefer green in A because it very shallow in *Betrayers* and while it has several solid cards none are generally first picked.


**Have your other opponents approached the draft as you expected during playtesting?**


We tested against players from several countries with different ideas on color placement and the value of being reactive, so there were diverse strategies but that wasn't very surprising. In particular, I find the black in B and A strategy that some Japanese teams were using to be intriguing.


**What are the key cards -- staple cards, not rares -- in *Champions* and why?**


[Glacial Ray](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glacial+Ray) -- top quality, deck defining in a format based on synergy  
[Teller of Tales](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Teller+of+Tales) -- one of the best Faerie Squadrons ever, requires draft adjustment  

Kodama's Might -- See [Glacial Ray](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glacial+Ray)  
[Kabuto Moth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kabuto+Moth) -- Just very good, soul shift & abilities like Teller help [Devouring Greed](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Devouring+Greed) -- potentially devastating burn spell but it requires synergy


**What are the key cards in *Betrayers* and why?**


[Waxmane Baku](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Waxmane+Baku) -- allows for green-white, best common by a mile, further synergy encouragement  
[Matsu-Tribe Sniper](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Matsu-Tribe+Sniper) -- not only the first good green answer to fliers but a permanent and versatile one  

Okina-Gang Shin obi -- requires significantly different play due to its existence
