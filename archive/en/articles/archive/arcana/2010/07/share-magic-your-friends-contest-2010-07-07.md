Well, you'd probably point out that it's not much of a surprise anymore. And you'd be right. But that doesn't change the fact that keen-eyed viewers of *[The Sorcerer's Apprentice](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/TCG/Resources.aspx?x=mtg/tcg/products/sorcerersapprentice)* will see **Magic: The Gathering** on the big screen. And that brings us around to the reason we're here today: a contest!


Five winners will each receive a draft set of product for 8 friends consisting of a display of ***Magic** 2011* product (36 boosters), 8 alternate art [Jace Beleren](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace+Beleren) promo cards, and 16 movie tickets for them and their friends to go see *The Sorcerer's Apprentice*. And forty second-place winners each get an alternate-art [Jace Beleren](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace+Beleren) and four tickets. Not bad! So what do you have to do to win? Read on! (And then follow the instructions. You don't win just for reading)


### Share **Magic** with Your Friends Contest


**Show us your best *M11* Planeswalker deck design and win **Magic** to share with your friends!**



On July 14th the summer blockbuster *The Sorcerer's Apprentice* opens in theaters. On July 16th, ***Magic** 2011* goes on sale. Both of these products will give you the opportunity to experience Magical conflict and cutting edge fantasy graphics. The "Share **Magic** with your Friends" contest gives you the chance to win **Magic: The Gathering** cards for your collection and tickets to see the movie! 


In the ***Magic** 2011* base set, the 5 iconic Planeswalkers â€“ Ajani Goldmane, Jace Beleren, Liliana Vess, Chandra Nalaar, and Garruk Wildspeaker all receive 2 new signature spells that play well with the strategies carved out by their namesake. We would like you to show us deck building skills by submitting a Planeswalker themed deck. 


To enter, design a Planeswalker themed deck for one of the 5 iconic Planeswalkers using only cards released in ***Magic** 2011* (the M11 visual spoiler will go live on July 7 and all of the cards in ***Magic** 2011* will be added to the [Gatherer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Default.aspx) on July 8). Your deck design needs to consist of 60 *M11* cards (including lands) following the normal constructed deck rules (no more than 4 copies of a non-basic land card) and can include a 15 card sideboard if you choose. 


Email your deck design and any needed explanation on how it works best to contest@wizards.com by 11:59 p.m. (PDT) July 12, 2010. 


Along with your deck design and signed waiver, please provide your contact information (name, email, phone) and the store where you attend Friday Night **Magic**.\*   
 \*FNM location is optional.


Winners will be notified by July 15, 2010. Entries will be judged on creativity, uniqueness, and relevancy.
