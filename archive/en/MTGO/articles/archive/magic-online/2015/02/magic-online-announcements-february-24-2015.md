***Tempest Remastered* Announcement**


Were you a fan of *Tempest*, *Stronghold*, and *Exodus*? *Magic* research and development has revisited the 621 cards from these sets and reduced the pool by more than half to pull out the best cards and the best playing archetypes for inclusion in the *Magic Online*-only set: *Tempest Remastered*! *Tempest Remastered* is being released for the first time on May 6, 2015 and will be available for three weeks.


Refer to the [announcement article](http://magic.wizards.com/en/MTGO/articles/archive/magic-online/announcing-tempest-remastered-2015-02-23) for the full details on the upcoming digital-only set.

**Alternate Art [Ugin, the Spirit Dragon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ugin%2C+the+Spirit+Dragon) Grants**


During the February 25th downtime, *Magic Online* will award the alternate art [Ugin, the Spirit Dragon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ugin%2C+the+Spirit+Dragon) promo to players based on their participation in *Magic Online Fate Reforged* Prereleases and Release Events. The chances for receiving an [Ugin, the Spirit Dragon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ugin%2C+the+Spirit+Dragon) will be the same as if each player opened a paper Ugin's Fate booster as part of their event entry. This means players who have played in multiple events will have multiple opportunities to be selected with a possibility of multiple selections; all Wizards team members will be excluded.

**New Episode of Vintage Super League Tonight**


The [Vintage Super League](http://vintagesuperleague.com/) pits *Magic* celebrities against one another with *Magic*'s oldest and most powerful cards as their weapons of choice. Check it out tonight at 6:00 p.m. Pacific (UTC-8) on [twitch.tv/magic](http://www.twitch.tv/magic)!


For a review of the current state of the league, as well as look at what's coming up in tonight's episode, take a look at Randy Buehler's latest [article](http://magic.wizards.com/en/MTGO/articles/archive/magic-online/vintage-super-league-episode-4-2015-02-24).

***Fate Reforged* Redemption Begins Wednesday, March 4**


*Fate Reforged* Redemption begins on Wednesday, March 4! Start filling out your digital *Fate Reforged* collection now if you're interested in redeeming it for a full paper set.


Many players have asked us about the lands in Fate Reforged: how to get them, how they interact with redemption, etc.


As far as redemption is concerned, this is simple: Every card in the Fate Reforged set is required for redemption except the basic lands. Basic lands are not required to redeem a set of Fate Reforged, either standard or premium. Promotional cards and Khans of Tarkir cards are not required.


While they are not required for redemption, you can still collect Fate Reforged basic lands. Intro Packs have non-premium versions of these lands, and premium versions can be found in booster packs at the same rate as in other sets.


Learn more about the *Magic Online* [Redemption Policy](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/magic-online-general-resources/magic-online-redemption-policies-2014-02-04).
