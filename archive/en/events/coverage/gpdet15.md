GRAND PRIX DETROIT 2015
=======================




Both teams (25) Ben Stark, Luis Scott-Vargas, and (2) Eric Froehlich; and (13) Owen Turtenwald, William Jensen, and Reid Duke are 9-0 after the first day!
















GRAND PRIX DETROIT 2015
-----------------------




* [DAY 1 COVERAGE](#tabs-0)


DAY 1 COVERAGE



The first nine rounds of *Magic Origins* Team Limited are in the books here in Detroit! There’s an old adage about team formats that veterans of the format know well—the top tables get *stacked*. And that’s certainly the case here. Playing in the last round, the three remaining undefeated teams were: (25) Ben Stark, Luis Scott-Vargas, and (2) Eric Froehlich; (13) Owen Turtenwald, William Jensen, and Reid Duke; and Jesse Hampton, (1) Mike Sigrist, and (23) Paulo Vitor Damo da Rosa. That’s insane. There are almost as many Pro Tour Top 8s in those nine people than there are cards in each of their Sealed decks.


Team Sealed can be the most skill-testing when it comes to building—and also friendship testing. The tighter knit you are, the better the long tournament will go. It’s no surprise that such strong teams, and such strong friends, find themselves near the top.


After the last round, it was only Owen, Huey, and Reid (the “Peach Garden Oath”) and Stark, LSV, and EFro (perhaps the “Pork Ben Oath”?) who remained 9-0. Going into the second day, they’ll have a huge advantage for making the Top 4. But there’s still lots more *Magic* to be played.


*Magic Origins* has now shown itself impressive in almost all formats, and by tomorrow’s end, we’ll even have some *Magic Origins* Team Drafts under our belts too. For anyone who’s frequented the hotel lobbies after *Magic* event in the last few weeks knows that *Magic Origins* is great for that too.


Tune in tomorrow for all the action bright and early at twitch.tv/magic2.


See you on Sunday!
