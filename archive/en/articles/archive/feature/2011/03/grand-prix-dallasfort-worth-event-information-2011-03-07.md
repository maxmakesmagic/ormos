Located in the heart of Texas, Grand Prix Dallas/Fort Worth will be an amazing event starting on Friday and ending late Sunday. An event that has something for everyone, the Grand Prix will include casual and competitive events at all times. If you cannot make it one day, there is certainly something for you the next day.


In addition to great **Magic**  events (the Standard main event, Commander, Two-Headed Giant, drafts, Win-A-Box for all formats), there will be vendors from all over the country to buy, sell, and trade with. If you're a fan of **Magic** artists, this is a show not to miss. We have a very rare U.S. appearance by John Avon—the master of all **Magic**  lands! John has created some of the most memorable lands in all of **Magic**, as well as the Grand Prix promo Maelstrom Pulse. Fan favorite Steve Argyle, the artist behind such cards as [Chandra Ablaze](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chandra+Ablaze), [Slave of Bolas](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Slave+of+Bolas), [Everflowing Chalice](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Everflowing+Chalice), and [Admonition Angel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Admonition+Angel), will also be in attendance. 


So join us for this amazing event—the fun is huge, the prizes are bountiful and the giveaways are great. Gather your friends, make your plans and we will see you in Texas!!


*The **Magic: The Gathering**  Grand Prix tournament series is a great reason to get out of the house, catch up with old friends, meet some new ones, and play **Magic**. Grand Prix tournaments are world-wide open events that allow all **Magic**  players to participate and experience the thrill of a large-scale competition. In addition to $30,000 in cash prizes, Pro Tour invitations for the top 16 finishers, and exclusive foil promo cards for participants, Grand Prix feature a host of other activities, including public events and artist signings (prizes subject to change).
