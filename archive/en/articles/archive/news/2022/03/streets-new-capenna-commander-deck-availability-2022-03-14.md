Due to supply chain issues, there will be less availability of *Streets of New Capenna* Commander Decks in the United States and Canada than originally planned in time for release on April 29. We do not anticipate other *Streets of New Capenna* products to be impacted.


Wizards Play Network stores everywhere now have a larger window, through May 8, for scheduling *Streets of New Capenna* Commander Launch Party events. Please check with [your local game store](https://locator.wizards.com/) to confirm when *Streets of New Capenna* Commander Decks and Commander Launch Party events will be available for you.


Additional *Streets of New Capenna* Commander Deck product will be available after release. We look forward to sharing these decks with you soon.
