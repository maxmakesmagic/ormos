*Magic Duels* is the best way to learn *Magic*. And now the best way to learn *Magic* is getting better.


*Oath of the Gatewatch* and *Shadows over Innistrad* are on the *Magic Duels* horizon. It's going to be big—304 new cards, two exciting new Story Mode campaigns to overcome, and more. But before we get there, we're introducing some improvements to how you earn coins. And with so much awesome content coming your way, you're definitely going to want those coins.


So, let's break down what's changing, and then we'll talk a little bit about why.


* **MORE**: Multiplayer ranked Versus Battles are now worth 30 coins per win, up from 20 coins.
* **EVEN MORE**: Completing a Daily Quest will earn you 50, 75, or 100 coins, depending on the challenge. Previously, Daily Quests were worth 20, 40, or 60 coins.

There are other ways to earn coins in *Magic Duels*, such as by winning Solo Battles or by completing Skill Quests. None of those coin values are changing. Also, the daily limit of 400 coins for Solo and Multiplayer Versus Battles isn't changing. Most players should end up earning more coins than they did before, even if they play the same amount. Of course, we want you to play more (we're a little biased).


Why do any of this? We believe that players shouldn't have to decide between the way they really want to play *Magic Duels* and the way that will earn coins most efficiently. If we can line those up, everyone wins. If we can't, you end up with "the grind." What was the best way to earn coins before? Duel the AI on hard difficulty. Then do it again. And again. Again. Again. Until you hit the cap. Don't get us wrong—the AI is great for honing your skills or trying out new decks. If you're new to *Magic*, the AI is a wonderful teacher. But we think there are other fun ways to play. And based on feedback, players think so, too.


The *Battle for Zendikar* release brought significant multiplayer improvements, and more are on the way. So we upped the rewards for playing with other real humans (apologies to the artificial intelligences among you). The game is just more interesting against real opponents. You'll see more varied decks, your skill will improve, and you'll have more fun.


And if battling other humans isn't your thing, the Daily Quest coin bump will give you greater rewards for playing your way. Use the Daily Quests to inspire new decks, try out new strategies, and net more coins for doing so. Put another way, we don't want to bind you to a grind. Hopefully, you'll find the kind of grind you won't mind. So if you pined for your pocket to be lined, you'll see that fun and rewards are best intertwined. [*Note:* *Matt wrote this part. —Drew*]


These changes are live today. Right now. Like, if you stopped reading here and just went and played *Magic Duels*, you'd see them in action. But we're almost done, so you might as well hang on for the end. We are constantly evaluating your feedback and monitoring *Magic Duels* to make sure it's the premier gameplay experience you've come to expect from *Magic*. So changes to the economy might happen in the future.


The countdown to our largest update yet is coming to a close. We'll have more details about the combined *Oath of the Gatewatch*-*Shadows over Innistrad* release very soon. Stay tuned, and thanks for playing *Magic Duels*!
