The cycle of five [ghost-lit kami](http://gatherer.wizards.com/default.asp?first=1&last=100&term=ghost-lit&Field_Name=on&setfilter=SaviorsofKamigawa&colorfilter=All&output=summary&sort=name&x=32&y=14) from *Saviors of Kamigawa* all are small spirit creatures and all have a channel ability related to their in-play ability.


The art team made sure that they had similar art composition, as well. Each appears as a gaunt human in flowing *kimono* carrying a large lantern. Note that the glow of each spirit's lantern matches up to its color (except for [Ghost-Lit Stalker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ghost-Lit+Stalker) -- it'd be tough to pull off a black-glowing lantern). And note that in each piece, the face of the kami is mysteriously hidden...
