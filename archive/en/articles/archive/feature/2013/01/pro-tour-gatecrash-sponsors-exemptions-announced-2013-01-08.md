Wit [Pro Tour *Gatecrash*](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/tcg/events.aspx?x=mtg/event/protour/gatecrash13) a month away, the invitation list has been finalized for the field of players heading to Montreal to battle in the Standard and *Gatecrash* Booster Draft formats on February 15-17.


Wizards of the Coast is awarding Sponsor's Exemption invitations and airfare to players who showed excellence in play and positive community activity during the qualifying season but did not earn an invitation through other means. This consideration includes quantity and quality of finishes at Grand Prix events and Pro Tour Qualifiers during the qualifying season, and results from Pro Tour  *Return to Ravnica*. Sponsor's Exemption invitations for Pro Tour *Gatecrash* have been awarded to Harry Corvese (United States), Pierre Dagen (France), Louis Deltour (France), Eric Froehlich (United States), and Jon Stern (Canada). At the conclusion of future qualifying seasons, Wizards of the Coast will examine the list of uninvited players and award Sponsor's Exemption invitations at its sole discretion. 


You can see a [complete list of invited players here](/en/articles/archive/invitation-list-pro-tour-gatecrash-2013-2012-11-12).


The live coverage of Pro Tour *Gatecrash* begins Friday, February 15, on **DailyMTG.com** and [twitch.tv/magicprotour](http://www.twitch.tv/magicprotour). The live video stream starts Friday at 9 a.m. Montreal time. Day One will begin with three rounds of Booster Draft, a change from previous Pro Tours, and will be followed by five rounds of Standard.
