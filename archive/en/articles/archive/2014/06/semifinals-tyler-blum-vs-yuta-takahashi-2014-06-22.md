**The Players**



Playing in his first Grand Prix Top 8 ever, Tyler Blum has been playing incredibly well thus far this weekend. While this might have been his first Grand Prix Top 8, he is no stranger to difficult competition, having been a member of the 2005 Canadian National team that finished third at Worlds. His opponent, Yuta Takahashi, is another incredible player. With multiple Grand Prix Top 8s under his belt, including two wins, as well as a Pro Tour Finals appearance, Takahashi is the most decorated player in this Top 8.



**The Decks**




 Both players are playing Black Devotion, no frills, bells, or whistles. Black Devotion had been on a bit of a slide recently, but the presence of five Black Devotion decks here in the Top 8 of Grand Prix Chicago speaks to the resurging power of the deck. In addition to the incredibly powerful [Pack Rat](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pack+Rat), the deck boasts a host of disruption and removal spells, such as [Thoughtseize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtseize), [Hero's Downfall](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hero%27s+Downfall), and [Bile Blight](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bile+Blight), all supplied by a stream of cards from [Underworld Connections](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Underworld+Connections). If [Pack Rat](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pack+Rat) doesn't get the job done, [Gray Merchant of Asphodel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gray+Merchant+of+Asphodel) can often be counted on to reverse fortunes and pull a win out of a defeat.




**The Games**




 It may be hard to believe, but the first game of this Black Devotion mirror match was determined by none other than [Pack Rat](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pack+Rat). On the play, Blum was able to get his Rat into play on the second turn, but Takahashi held the clutch [Devour Flesh](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Devour+Flesh) to make sure that it never got to make a token. After untapping, Takahashi made a [Pack Rat](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pack+Rat) of his own. Unfortunately for Blum, Takahashi's [Pack Rat](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pack+Rat) was able to begin spawning, making a total of four tokens over the next few turns. Blum was able to get a second copy of his own into play very shortly after Takahashi's got online, but the damage was done. There are few cards in the game that are capable of snowballing out of control quite like [Pack Rat](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pack+Rat), and Takahashi never relinquished the lead once he got it.
