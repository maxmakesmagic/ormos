Almost 400,000 people live in Bochum, with means that it is bustling but not crowded. Bochum can boast that it has many theatres, universities and museums but is most notably the home of the 'Bermuda Triangle' (over 60 cafés, bars, pubs and restaurants) as well as the Bundesliga Football Club, VfL Bochum.



*The **Magic: The Gathering**  Grand Prix tournament series is a great reason to get out into the **Magic** tournament community, catch up with old friends, meet some new ones, and play some great **Magic**. Grand Prix tournaments are world-wide open events that allow all **Magic**  players to participate and experience the thrill of a large-scale competition. In addition to cash prizes, a high Planeswalker Points multiplier, and exclusive foil promo cards for participants, Grand Prix feature a host of other activities, including public events and artist signings (prizes subject to change).

The main tournament at Grand Prix Bochum is open to **Magic**  players of all ages.


Players must have a signed consent form to participate in Grand Prix Bochum. Forms can be found [here](http://www.wizards.com/dci/downloads/Consent_and_Release_Agreement_Bochum2012.pdf) and will be available onsite. Minors must have a parent or guardian’s signature on this form. Consent forms will be collected during the player meeting on Saturday morning.


**Tournament Format**
  


* [Standard](/en/node/704561)
* Deck lists are required (download [blank deck list sheet here](http://www.wizards.com/dci/downloads/CONSTRUCTED_DECKLIST.pdf)).
* Players must use the same deck on Day 2 that they used on Day 1.

**Tournament Structure** 


* Modified Swiss-style (50-minute rounds).
* If 799 or fewer players register for the event, all players with an X-2-0 or better record OR the top 64 players—whichever number is greater—will advance to the second day of the event.
* If 800 or more players register for the event, all players with an X-2-0 or better record OR the top 128 players—whichever number is greater—will advance to the second day of the event.
* The Top 8 players after the final Swiss round on Day 2 will advance to the Top 8 single-elimination finals.
* Top 8 playoff matches will be best 2 of 3, and have no time limit. (Players are still expected to play at a normal pace and complete playoff matches in a reasonable amount of time.)
* Where necessary, the standings after the Swiss rounds will still be used to determine final order in the standings.
* For the first game of each match in the Top 8, the player that finished higher in the Swiss rounds chooses either to play first or to play second. For subsequent games in each Top 8 match, the usual Play/Draw rule applies (loser of the previous game decides whether to play first in the next game).

**Staff**
  
 The Head Judges for Grand Prix Bochum are Frank Wareman and Kevin Desprez. Judges interested in working at this event should submit an application through the [**Magic**  judge website](http://apps.magicjudges.org).
