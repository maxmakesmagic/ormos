![Dark Confidant](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/tcg/products/mma/makakxioolww/JBJYfJLWwV_EN.jpg)  
**[Dark Confidant](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dark+Confidant)** – *Modern Masters* mythic rare. [Dark Confidant](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dark+Confidant) originally appeared in *Ravnica: City of Guilds* and was designed by **Magic** Invitational 2004 winner [Bob Maher](http://www.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/feature/248), which is why you might see or hear this card affectionately referred to as "Bob." 


 The [*Modern Masters* Card Image Gallery](http://www.wizards.com/magic/tcg/article.aspx?x=mtg/tcg/modernmasters/cig#)  is updated every day with the latest card previews. Be prepared for its release on June 7, 2013! 



  
**[City of Brass](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=City+of+Brass)** – *Modern Masters* rare. [City of Brass](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=City+of+Brass) originally appeared in *Arabian Nights*, was reprinted a number of times, and entered the Modern landscape with *Eighth Edition*.

![Bane Alley Broker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Bane+Alley+Broker)**[Bane Alley Broker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bane+Alley+Broker)** – *Gatecrash* uncommon. The lovely broker of Bane Alley is one of the "public faces" of House Dimir and deals in illicit knowledge and items for her guild. You can meet her, if you'd like, by reading [this Uncharted Realms story](http://www.wizards.com/magic/magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/ur/239). 
 


![Sabertooth Alley Cat](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Sabertooth+Alley+Cat)**[Sabertooth Alley Cat](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sabertooth+Alley+Cat)** – *Ravnica: City of Guilds* common. Usually, "alley cat" refers to a normal, domestic housecat without a house. A stray. It's hard to imagine what kind of house this particular cat might have come out of, so it's more likely this little guy's name refers to the less-common use of the term to mean a feral cat, or a domestic cat separated from domestication and returned to the wild. 
 


![Gnat Alley Creeper](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Gnat+Alley+Creeper)**[Gnat Alley Creeper](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gnat+Alley+Creeper)** – *Dissension* uncommon. The *Gatecrash* world guide describes Gnat Alley as "tunnel-like" and says it is "one of the Gruul guild's most trusted methods of navigating through Ravnica's posh neighborhoods." Various lowlifes "use the winding passages of Gnat Alley to infiltrate restricted districts and bypass security checkpoints." Sounds lovely, doesn't it? 
 


![Shadow Alley Denizen](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Shadow+Alley+Denizen)**[Shadow Alley Denizen](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shadow+Alley+Denizen)** – *Gatecrash* common. The vampires of Ravnica have blank eyes—that is, eyes without irises or pupils. This extra little detail separates them visually from the vampires of Innistrad (whose sclera, or "whites of the eye," are black), Mirrodin (syringe fingers), and Zendikar (shoulder and elbow "horns"). 
 


![Bane Alley Blackguard](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Bane+Alley+Blackguard)**[Bane Alley Blackguard](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bane+Alley+Blackguard)** – *Dragon's Maze* common. A blackguard (most commonly pronounced BLA-gerd) is a rude, untrustworthy, and contemptible person. More rarely, it can also be used to mean a man who uses foul language in front of a woman of high social standing. It's hard to imagine this fellow will meet many of those in Bane Alley, though. 
 


![290](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&multiverseid=290)**[Mountain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=290)** – *Limited Edition* common. Back in 2009, [Mark Rosewater](http://www.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Archive.aspx?author=Mark%20Rosewater) revealed that one basic land card had been printed more than any other. You can read Mark's explanation why [in this article](/en/articles/archive/25-random-things-about-magic-2009-02-16) (it's lucky number thirteen). 
 


![222](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&multiverseid=222)**[Shivan Dragon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=222)** – *Limited Edition* Alpha rare. Shiv is a location on the plane of Dominaria (as well as a [Plane](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plane) from *Planechase*), whence came numerous cards with "[Shivan](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&name=+%5BShivan%5D)" in their names. [Shivan Dragon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shivan+Dragon) is the first, though, and is also the first full-grown Dragon in the game (the only other Dragon in Alpha being a [Whelp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=189)). 
 


![Dwarven Strike Force](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Dwarven+Strike+Force)**[Dwarven Strike Force](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dwarven+Strike+Force)** – *Odyssey* uncommon. In **Magic**, there are five Dwarf cards [legal in Modern](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&subtype=+%5B%22Dwarf%22%5D&format=+%5B%22Modern%22%5D), and four of those are Duergar from *Eventide*. "Duergar" is an alternative spelling of the Norse word "*dvergar*," which you might have guessed from context to mean the mythological dwarf. Those of you familiar with **D&D** might have also seen the word there. 
 


![Dwarven Recruiter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Dwarven+Recruiter)**[Dwarven Recruiter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dwarven+Recruiter)** – *Odyssey* uncommon. There are [thirty-eight Dwarves](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&subtype=+%5B%22Dwarf%22%5D) in **Magic**, and thirty-five are red (three are also white!). That means you could build a casual deck with one of each red Dwarf for your Recruiter to... uh... recruit. 
 


![Far // Away](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Far+%2F%2F+Away)**[Far & Away](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Far+%26+Away+)**  – *Dragon's Maze* uncommon. It's a bit hard to the see the great art on split cards, so let's look at the art descriptions to find out who our victims are here. For Far: "Show a Gruul ogre… struggling to escape a vortex of blue energy that is pulling him into it." For Away: "Show a Selesnyan elf… who is being consumed from the ground up by slick black tentacles." And now we know! 
 


![Boros Mastiff](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Boros+Mastiff)**[Boros Mastiff](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Boros+Mastiff)** – *Dragon's Maze* common. Boros's League of Wojek contains an animal division that trains hounds to assist with law enforcement. Along with other Wojek, the animal division helps with search and rescue, detection of explosive/magical devices, arson investigation, cadaver searches, and finding missing people. 
 


![Silverchase Fox](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Silverchase+Fox)**[Silverchase Fox](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Silverchase+Fox)** – *Innistrad* common. The village of Gatstaf lies within the werewolf-infested province of Kessig. Kolman, the bitter elder of unfriendly Gatstaf, once famously declared, "In Kessig, the werewolves outnumber the priests." 
 


![Ulvenwald Bear](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Ulvenwald+Bear)**[Ashcoat Bear](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ashcoat+Bear)** – *Time Spiral* common. Way back in the halcyon days of *Limited Edition* Alpha, [Grizzly Bears](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grizzly+Bears) were 2/2s for two mana. Ever since then, creatures with that combination of power, toughness, and cost have been colloquially known as "Bears." [Ashcoat Bear](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ashcoat+Bear) is a weak example of a "value Bear," which is a 2/2 for two with an extra ability that makes it better. 
 


![Master of the Wild Hunt ](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Master+of+the+Wild+Hunt+)**[Master of the Wild Hunt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Master+of+the+Wild+Hunt)** – ***Magic** 2010*  mythic rare. The [Wild Hunt](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_Hunt) originated from ancient Gallic and Germanic folklore. The myth arose across all of Western, Northern, and Central Europe, from Wales to Scandinavia to Germany. 
 


![Copper Carapace](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Copper+Carapace)**[Copper Carapace](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Copper+Carapace)** – *Mirrodin Besieged* common. After the events of the *Fifth Dawn*, some Viridian elves began to believe that metal wasn't as natural as flesh... on Mirrodin. Anyway, they took on a destructive anti-technology agenda. At least, until the Phyrexians arrived. 
 


![Rot Farm Skeleton](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Rot+Farm+Skeleton)**[Rot Farm Skeleton](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rot+Farm+Skeleton)** – *Dragon's Maze* uncommon. From the [*Dragon's Maze* FAQ](/en/node/633921) : 
  Putting four cards from your library into your graveyard is part of the activation cost of [Rot Farm Skeleton](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rot+Farm+Skeleton)'s ability. The four cards will be in the graveyard before any player can respond. 





![Renegade Krasis](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Renegade+Krasis)**[Renegade Krasis](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Renegade+Krasis)** – *Dragon's Maze* rare. From the [*Dragon's Maze* FAQ](/en/node/633921) : 
 
[Renegade Krasis](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Renegade+Krasis)'s last ability won't trigger if a +1/+1 counter is put on it for any reason other than its evolve ability resolving. 





![Goblin Test Pilot](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Goblin+Test+Pilot)**[Goblin Test Pilot](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Test+Pilot)** – *Dragon's Maze* uncommon. From the [*Dragon's Maze* FAQ](/en/node/633921) : 
 
[Goblin Test Pilot](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Test+Pilot) is a legal target of its own ability.
