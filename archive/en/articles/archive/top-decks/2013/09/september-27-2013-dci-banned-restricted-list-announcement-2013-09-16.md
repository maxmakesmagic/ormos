**Explanation of September 27, 2013, B&R Changes**  
 Erik Lauer 

 Recently, powerful decks in Pauper full of the "free spell mechanic," such as [Cloud of Faeries](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloud+of+Faeries) and [Snap](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snap), combine with [Cloudpost](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloudpost) to generate a lot of mana. Adding card-advantage creatures such as [Mnemonic Wall](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mnemonic+Wall), [Mulldrifter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mulldrifter), and [Sea Gate Oracle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sea+Gate+Oracle) give a constant flow of cards. This also means that [Temporal Fissure](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Temporal+Fissure) not only bounces a lot of your opponent's creatures, it allows you to recast the card-advantage creatures. With the Temporal Wall deck, this makes a loop. Other than permission decks, most decks have a hard time interacting with this strong deck. 

 The DCI looked into which cards were making this so difficult to deal with. First, the storm mechanic has few answers in Pauper. [In our *Gatecrash* update](/en/articles/archive/january-28-2013-dci-banned-restricted-list-announcement-2013-01-28), [Empty the Warrens](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Empty+the+Warrens) and [Grapeshot](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grapeshot) were banned. While we knew [Temporal Fissure](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Temporal+Fissure) was also powerful, it was less strong than those two. Rather than ban the card, we choose to see how the metagame would shake out. In small amounts, the [Temporal Fissure](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Temporal+Fissure) deck is interesting. But, in large amounts, it narrows the competitive metagame. 

 The second problem is [Cloudpost](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloudpost). Without much downside, [Cloudpost](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloudpost) both accelerates your mana and gives a single land that taps for multiple mana, converting the "free spells" into mana generators. While other lands, such as the [Ravnica bouncelands](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&format=+%5B%22Ravnica+Block%22%5D&type=+%5B%22Land%22%5D&text=+%5Breturn%5D), can tap for two mana, they have larger drawbacks. When [Cloudpost](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloudpost) was banned in Modern, The Urza lands ([Urza's Mine](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Urza%27s+Mine), [Urza's Power Plant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Urza%27s+Power+Plant), and [Urza's Tower](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Urza%27s+Tower)) turned out to be strong enough to make a competitive Modern deck. We believe that scaling back to that level might make a more dynamic metagame for Pauper as well.
