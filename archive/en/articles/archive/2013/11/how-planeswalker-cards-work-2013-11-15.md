HOW PLANESWALKER CARDS WORK
===========================



 Posted in [ARTICLES](/en/articles)
 on November 15, 2013 










Planeswalker cards represent allies you can call on to fight by your side, and are similar to artifacts, creatures, and enchantments.


Planeswalker cards are included as part of your deck at the start of the game, just like other cards. You may cast a planeswalker card whenever you could cast a sorcery. Planeswalkers are permanents, so when a planeswalker spell you control resolves, it enters the battlefield under your control.


Each planeswalker has a subtype. For example, Kiora, the Crashing Wave says "Planeswalker—Kiora" on her type line, meaning she has the subtype "Kiora." If a player controls two or more planeswalkers that have the same subtype, that player chooses one to keep and puts the rest into the graveyard.


The number in the bottom right corner of a planeswalker card is its "loyalty." A planeswalker enters the battlefield with that many loyalty counters on it, and if it ever has zero loyalty counters, it is put into its owner's graveyard.


**Planeswalker Abilities**


Planeswalkers have activated abilities. You can activate one of these abilities whenever you could cast a sorcery, but only one of a planeswalker's abilities may be activated during each of your turns.


The cost to activate a planeswalker's ability is to add or remove loyalty counters from that planeswalker. For example, the symbol ![](https://media.wizards.com/legacy/mtg/images/tcg/resources/plus1.jpg) means "Put 1 loyalty counter on this planeswalker," and the symbol ![](https://media.wizards.com/legacy/mtg/images/tcg/resources/neg3.jpg) means "Remove 3 loyalty counters from this planeswalker." You can't activate an ability that removes loyalty counters unless the planeswalker has at least that many loyalty counters on it.


**Fighting a Planeswalker**


Planeswalkers can be attacked, just like another player. As you declare an attacking creature, you choose whether that creature is attacking an opponent or a planeswalker an opponent controls. The defending player may still declare blockers, even if a planeswalker is being attacked.


If a spell or ability you control would deal damage to an opponent, you may choose to have it deal that damage to a planeswalker that opponent controls instead. For example, you can't target a planeswalker with Shock, but you can have a Shock which targets your opponent deal 2 damage to one of his or her planeswalkers—instead of to the target player—when it resolves. You cannot split damage from a single source between a player and a planeswalker.


Whenever damage is dealt to a planeswalker, regardless of whether it's from combat, spells, or abilities, that number of loyalty counters are removed from it.
