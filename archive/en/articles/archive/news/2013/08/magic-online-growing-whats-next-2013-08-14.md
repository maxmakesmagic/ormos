=====================================



 Posted in **News**
 on August 14, 2013 











**Note:** This article has been updated with a change to the previously announced [Phantom Events event structure.](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/other/08142013c#phantompoints) 


![The letter T!](https://web.archive.org/web/20140625154327id_/http://archive.wizards.com/magic/images/dropcap_T.jpg)he upcoming weeks for **Magic Online** are going to be bigger than ever. We have the releases *From the Vault: Twenty* and *Duel Decks: Heroes vs. Monsters* on deck, plus upcoming events like the **Magic Online** Community Cup at PAX Prime (which will feature streaming coverage on [Twitch.tv/Magic](http://twitch.tv/magic)). We also have changes to Cube Tickets and New Player Tickets and a recent expansion of the Magic Online team to share.


Speaking of bigger than ever, **Magic Online** continues to grow by leaps and bounds with more players than ever!


*From the Vault: Twenty* Goes On Sale Friday, August 23, 2013!

It won't be available very long, so don't wait to pick it up!


If you don't have a chance to get one from the store, don't despair: To celebrate **Magic**'s 20th anniversary, players who finish in the Top 8 of any Premier Event during the weekend of September 6 will be awarded a copy of *From the Vault: Twenty* in addition to regular Premier Event prizes! Plus, we will be awarding *From the Vault: Twenty* during the R&D Challenge Event on September 6, as well as during other special events to come.

Introducing Phantom Points and New Player Points
![](https://media.wizards.com/legacy/mtg/images/digital/magiconline/phantom_point.png)On August 21, **Magic Online** Cube Tickets will be replaced with new Phantom Points. Phantom Points will be used as entry options and as prizes in all Phantom Events. They are more clearly associated by name with the events they can be used in. Because Cube Events are a type of Phantom Event, they will now accept and award Phantom Points.

 


Phantom Points come with a new graphic, and they can be used as entry fees to events. Phantom Points open up additional possibilities for future events and prizes. On August 21, Phantom AVR Sealed, Phantom M14 Sealed, and Phantom RTR Block Sealed will all have an entry fee of 6 Event Tickets OR 10 Phantom Points.


Phantom Points will be awarded from these events as well:


 




|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Match
 Wins** | **Prizes** | **QPs** |
| 3 | 16 Phantom Points | 1 |
| 2 | 8 Phantom Points | 0 |
| 1 | 4 Phantom Points | 0 |
| 0 | 2 Phantom Points | 0 |

 


On August 21, all Cube Tickets in your account will be replaced on a one-for-one ratio with Phantom Points.


![](https://media.wizards.com/legacy/mtg/images/digital/magiconline/new_player_point.png)New Player Points will also be introduced on August 21 to replace New Player Tickets. All existing New Player Tickets in your account will be replaced on a one-for-one ratio with New Player Points. New Player Events will now require New Player Points as part of the entry fee.


Phantom Points and New Player Points cannot be purchased or traded, and are only acquired through participation. All other types of tickets and points will remain unchanged.


Introducing the Community Cup Team
![](https://web.archive.org/web/20160405091333im_/http://archive.wizards.com/mtg/images/digital/magiconline/MTGO-Community-Cup-Logo-Black-200.png) The Community Cup is fast approaching (August 30 and 31, 2013, during the PAX Prime convention), and the Community Team has been assembled! The team will face off against employees of Wizards of the Coast in a series of events during the convention period. The Community Team roster is comprised of awesome **Magic** players who also support the **Magic Online** community by helping new players learn the game, raising awareness of **Magic Online**, and displaying all-around terrific sportsmanship.

 


The Community Team lost to Wizards last year, so this year's competition is going to be epic.


Look for the announcement of the Wizards Team coming next week, and in the meantime, [get to know the Community Team](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/magazine/article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/feature/259d)!


Magic Online Is Growing!
![](https://media.wizards.com/legacy/mtg/images/digital/magiconline/mike-turian-100.jpg)There's a lot going on with **Magic Online** behind the scenes, especially around the Wide Beta. To help provide extra support with everything going on with **Magic Online**, the team has grown.

In June, Mike Turian ([@mturian](http://twitter.com/mturian) on Twitter) joined the **Magic Online** team as the digital product manager. Mike will be leading the daily business of **Magic Online**, including communications (the "What's Happening" page, the **Magic Online** Calendar, "Weekly Announcements," the newsletter, and in-game announcements), all **Magic Online** scheduled, premier and queued events, and the general **Magic Online** client. Mike previously worked with Organized Play and the technology teams on products such as [Planeswalker Points](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/planeswalkerpoints), the [Store Locator](http://locator.wizards.com/), and [Wizards Event Reporter](http://archive.wizards.com/wpn/events/tools.aspx).


To support all of the daily business of **Magic Online**, two new members have been added to the team this past month: Lauren Beauregard and Clayton Kroh.


![](https://media.wizards.com/legacy/mtg/images/digital/magiconline/lauren-beauregard-100.jpg)Lauren helps Mike turn the **Magic Online** plans into actions as the new assistant digital product manager. Lauren joins the team from The Seattle Times, where she was the supervisor for their digital advertising team.


![](https://media.wizards.com/legacy/mtg/images/digital/magiconline/clayton-kroh-100.jpg)Clayton Kroh joins the team as a digital content specialist. He will be creating content and communications for our website, announcements, and for future **Magic Online** projects. Clay has many years of content management experience in industries such as consumer packaged goods with Dannon, and videogames with Sony Online Entertainment.


Chris Kiritz continues as business manager for **Magic Online**, as he has for the past five years, but will be focusing entirely on new features and future development. This includes working on Wide Beta, Leagues, and other unannounced projects, ensuring they are successfully deployed and meet the needs of players.


The entire team above is led by Director of Digital Product Management and Publishing Worth Wollpert ([@mtgworth](http://twitter.com/mtgworth) on Twitter). Along with **Magic Online**, Worth's responsibilities also include our *Duels of the Planeswalkers* digital product. He has been a director at Wizards of the Coast for the past five years.


With all of the new additions, we have had one departure from the **Magic Online** team. Sara Riehl is now putting her **Magic Online** skills and knowledge to work as the systems and operations manager for Game Support. Her team directly supports **Magic Online** both in-game and behind-the-scenes. We look forward to continuing the relationship between our teams to further improve how we support our growing community of players during an unprecedented time in **Magic Online**'s history.


The whole team is very excited about the future of **Magic Online**. We have a lot of big plans, and a team that is dedicated to making them a reality. There's so much more to come (can you believe Theros is just a little over a month away?), so keep up with us by following us on Twitter **[@MagicOnline](http://twitter.com/magiconline)!**
