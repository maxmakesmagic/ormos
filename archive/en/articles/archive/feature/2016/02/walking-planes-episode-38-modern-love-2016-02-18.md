Do you play Modern? How would you describe your deck? Competitive? Fun? Weird? Hilariously horrible combos but who cares I love it? At Pro Tour *Oath of the Gatewatch*, Walking the Planes put their creativity on display. Throw in a Back Alley Brawl, a trip down memory lane with "Jonny Magic," and the rise of the Eldrazi, and you've got a classic episode of WTP!
