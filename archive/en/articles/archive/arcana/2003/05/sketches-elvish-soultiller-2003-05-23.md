This week's "Sketches" takes an interactive look at Ron Spears' [Elvish Soultiller](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elvish+Soultiller) from *Legions*. 


### 1. Art Description


These are the instructions given to the artist:


"Color: Green  
 Location: Wirewood forest  
 Action: Show an elf who is much larger and stronger than other elves of his kind. Other elves can be shown but it's not necessary.  
Mood: Strength"


The card was called "Elvish Reviver" in playtest.


### 2. Sketches


Here is one of two preliminary sketches of the "Elvish Reviver" submitted by Ron Spears. The art team agreed that the sketch did capture the strong elf of the art description, but didn't capture the spirit of the 5/4 mutant elf they were really looking for. Click the buttons below to flip between the first and second sketches of "Elvish Reviver." *(Depending on your connection speed, it might take a few seconds for the image to change.)*

The first elf is strong, but the second is clearly mutated -- hulking biceps, bulging calves, and a stronger face. The Mirari strikes [again](/en/articles/archive/sketches-noxious-ghoul-2003-03-25)!


### 3. Final Art


Here is a large version of the final piece. There's even a bit more mutation seen here -- the painting adds a mottled, greenish skintone, and check out the clawed foot in the foreground.


### 4. Card


Finally, here is the card as you'll see it in booster packs.
