The Daily *Magic* Update is a roundup of everything *Magic* you should know on April 22, 2016. Today's Update is brought to you by [Pro Tour *Shadows over Innistrad*](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/ptsoi), because there is nothing else you should be watching this weekend. *Nothing*.


Seriously. Nothing.
===================


1. [Pro Tour *Shadows over Innistrad*](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/ptsoi)

There's a whole lot going on with the Pro Tour *right now* (well, probably approximately right now, depends on when you're reading this). You could be watching on [twitch.tv/magic](https://www.twitch.tv/magic/) right now. You could also read a cool feature on the [rise of East West Bowl](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/ptsoi/east-west-bowls-rise-2016-04-22), one of the more successful newcomers to the team scene. Or you could just visit our [coverage page](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/ptsoi) and find everything we have to offer. Because we're nice like that.


After That, Read Watch, or Listen to These
==========================================


1. [What We Learn from Thraben Inspector](http://www.toplevelpodcast.com/thraben-inspector/) | Top Level Podcast | Patrick Chapin and Mike Flores

Considering that [Thraben Inspector](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thraben+Inspector) is probably in line to be one of the most played *cards* at the Pro Tour, this seems like a relevant topic.


1. [Yo! MTG Taps!—The Final Episode](http://mtgcast.com/mtgcast-podcast-shows/active-podcast-shows/yo-mtg-taps/yo-mtg-taps-the-final-episode) | Joey Pasco and Stephen Marshall

Send off Yo! MTG Taps! in style by listening to their final episode.


1. [Vintage 101: VSL Season Five with Randy Buehler!](http://www.mtggoldfish.com/articles/vintage-101-vsl-season-five-with-randy-buehler) | MTGGoldfish | Islandswamp

With the [newest season of Vintage Super League](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/magic-digital/announcing-community-super-league-2016-04-20) starting up Tuesday (followed by Community Super League Thursday), now's a great time to learn more about Vintage straight from the maestro of VSL, Randy Buehler.


1. [You all liked old paperwork more than I anticipated. Here's more—Expansion submission form & sample *Ice Age* form, circa 1995-96](https://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/4fwro8/you_all_liked_old_paperwork_more_than_i/)

More old-school paperwork from themisprintguy, these documents show the old-school rules for creating and submitting a *Magic* expansion. You can see an example from *Ice Age*, which has some pretty fantastic commentary about the cards from that era.

There are a lot of stories at the Pro Tour, and they have a lot of stories. Follow along on our [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/MagicTheGathering/?fref=ts) to meet many of those players and hear their stories.

It just goes to show you, kids: if you want to play like a Hall of Fame pro, get matching sleeves and deck boxes for whatever mythic rare planeswalker you open.

You don't have to speak Spanish to see that the playmat for Pro Tour *Shadows over Innistrad* is really, really cool.


Deck of the Day
===============


1. Deck of the Day goes on hiatus

As I write this, I'm watching two of my favorite decks at [Pro Tour *Shadows over Innistrad*](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/ptsoi): Esper Control and Black-Green [Seasons Past](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seasons+Past). I'm also looking directly at their decklists and, seeing as how this is the Pro Tour, I probably shouldn't be sharing those. So, given my intimate knowledge of every deck, it doesn't seem wise to post a decklist today.


Sure, I could write about another, non-Standard format, but that's kind of difficult with [Seasons Past](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seasons+Past) and [Narset Transcendent](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Narset+Transcendent) dancing in my head. So, to get your fill of decklists at this Pro Tour, watch for them to appear on Sunday.
