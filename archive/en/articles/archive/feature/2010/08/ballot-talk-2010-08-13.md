The 2010 Pro Tour Hall of Fame ballot went out two weeks ago. Who will join the likes of Kai Budde, Mike Turian, Zvi Mowshowitz, John Finkel, and a dozen others voted the best competitive **Magic** players in the world? No one knows. But a few people have some ideas.

Without giving away who he was voting for, Daily MTG writer Brian David-Marshall wrote an[overview](http://www.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/twtw/102) of the entire ballot. But here at Community Spotlight, we like to point that looking glass outward from wizards.com. Shall we?

Before we get started, here's a list of all the names on the ballot organized by the year the players were added.

To me, not using all five slots on your ballot means one of two things: Either they a) don't feel qualified enough to vote for at least five people, in which case they should be doing more research or not have a vote or b) they feel there aren't a full five people deserving to get into the Hall, which is arrogant (and to me) misguided. There are five players in this year's potential class with at least five Pro Tour Top 8s. There are thirteen with at least four Pro Tour Top 8s and if that isn't enough, there are nine more with at least three including really interesting names like Blume, Chapin, Kibler, Mori, and Steve OMS. If you can't find five worthies from all those guys, you are either ignorant (correctable), a donk (unfortunate), or you loathe your fellow **Magic** players (tragic)."

Steve Sadin announced his 2010 picks on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/SteveSadin):

> "As I am not a buffoon I am obviously voting for Nassif, Saito, and Kibler; master, master, and DragonMaster. I think Nassif is as worthy a unanimous ballot-gatherer as ever drew breath. Saito has been around "best player in the world" for some years if not the clear best. I wouldn't have half so much glory as a deck designer if he hadn't helped Andre Coimbra in the Extended portion of Worlds; so mise! Like I said, I was going to vote for Kibler even before he won that Pro Tour and Grand Prix because in order for the American block to start getting our O'Mahoney-Schwartz brothers and Pikulas into the Hall of Fame we have to stop fracturing our votes. That means getting our deserving boys off the ballot and into the Hall of Fame so that we can make more room for our, you know, additional deserving boys. That starts with Kibler. Congratulations old friend. The enemy's gate is down!

In addition to being simply one of the most skilled players ever to sling spells, Gab is a rather entertaining figure, with a great, if dry, sense of humor and quick wit. He's always great to watch on coverage or in the Arena doing a feature match. And you can't underestimate the value of the hats! I won't go as far as Tim Willoughby and say that if you don't vote for Nassif you should have your vote stripped, but I'd certainly raise my eyebrow at someone not voting for him.

I think selection of Steve this year is nearly as clear as Nassif. His level of play is unquestioned. What more endorsement do you need than Jon Finkel chose to be teammates? One of the other great deciding factors is that Steve is and always has been one of the 'good guys.' His demeanor and professionalism have been second to none. He's never failed to be courteous to judge and opponent alike, an affable conversationalist, and all-around pleasure to have at an event."
