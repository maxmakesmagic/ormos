![Platinum Angel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Platinum+Angel)**[Platinum Angel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Platinum+Angel)** – ***Magic** 2010* mythic rare. In the Gatherer comments for [Platinum Angel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Platinum+Angel), Studoku thinks outside the box: "Giving it indestructability is not bad, but a bit dull. Personally, I like the idea of putting two in play and using [Master Transmuter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Master+Transmuter) to bounce and return them if they're in danger.

In the Gatherer comments for [Doom Blade](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Doom+Blade), Lestat13 has a challenge for you: "I dare you not to shout it's name out as a boxing announcer.

![Acidic Slime](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Acidic+Slime)**[Acidic Slime](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Acidic+Slime)** – ***Magic** 2010* uncommon. In the Gatherer comments for [Acidic Slime](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Acidic+Slime), SavageBrain89 describes it as "My new best friend: a mindless combination of chemicals and cells, that destroys things." Well said!

![Deathmark](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Deathmark)**[Deathmark](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deathmark)** – ***Magic** 2010* uncommon. In the Gatherer comments for [Deathmark](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deathmark), Azr43l has this to say: "I like the art. The dead guy is actually crying up. Or he's upside down, but I prefer the prior."

![Survival of the Fittest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Survival+of+the+Fittest)**[Survival of the Fittest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Survival+of+the+Fittest)** – *Exodus* rare. According to the art description, [Survival of the Fittest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Survival+of+the+Fittest) shows "a large Mogg having beaten a smaller Mogg to the floor in a bloody pulp." Back in *Tempest* block, Moggs died a lot. Just ask [Mogg Fanatic](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mogg+Fanatic)!
 ![Ali from Cairo](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Ali+from+Cairo)**[Ali from Cairo](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ali+from+Cairo)** – *Arabian Nights* rare. In the early days of **Magic**, when sets referred to stories that already existed, there was nothing unusual about a card name with a real-world place in its name. There was [Ali from **Cairo**](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ali+from+Cairo), [Bazaar of **Baghdad**](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bazaar+of+Baghdad), and [Library of **Alexandria**](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Library+of+Alexandria). It is no coincidence that all three of these appeared in ***Arabian** Nights*.
 ![Chaos Confetti](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Chaos+Confetti)**[Chaos Confetti](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chaos+Confetti)** – *Unglued* common. Have you ever noticed that the bottom of [Chaos Confetti](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chaos+Confetti)'s text box is full of bits of paper torn by the giant hands in the art?
 ![Shivan Dragon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=shivan+dragon)**[Shivan Dragon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shivan+Dragon)** – *Limited Edition Alpha* rare. When [Shivan Dragon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shivan+Dragon) first appeared in Alpha, there was no context for the word "Shivan". It wasn't until *Urza's Saga* that "Shiv" appeared appeared on its own, clearly referring to a specific mountain range.
 ![Silhouette](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Silhouette)**[Silhouette](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Silhouette)** – *Legends* common. [Silhouette](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Silhouette) was illustrated by Kaja Foglio, who, at [sixty cards illustrated](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&artist=%5b%22Kaja+Foglio%22%5d) is slightly ahead of her husband Phil Foglio, who's done only [forty-seven](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&artist=%5b%22Phil+Foglio%22%5d). Even if you include the nine [Claymore J. Flapdoodle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&artist=%5b%22Flapdoodle%22%5d) cards, Kaja's still in the lead!
 ![Crash of Rhinos](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Crash+of+Rhinos)**[Crash of Rhinos](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crash+of+Rhinos)** – *Mirage* common. [Crash of Rhinos](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crash+of+Rhinos) was, believe it or not, a key part of a competitive deck called "Strands of Rhinos", which used the Gerrard [Vanguard](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/tcg/productarticle.aspx?x=mtg_tcg_vanguard_productinfo) card (Draw 2 cards a turn, but with a maximum hand size of 4) and [Strands of Night](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Strands+of+Night) for early Rhino-bashing.
 ![Armillary Sphere](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Armillary+Sphere)**[Armillary Sphere](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Armillary+Sphere)** – *Conflux* common. In our world, the invention of the armillary sphere (a model of the celestial sphere) is credited to Eratosthenes (in Greece) or Shi Shen and Gan De (in China). On Esper, it's used to [perform divination](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/stf/28).
 ![Mouth to Mouth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Mouth+to+Mouth)**[Mouth to Mouth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mouth+to+Mouth)** – *Unhinged* uncommon. It's not uncommon to have flavor text indirectly reference another card. [Mouth to Mouth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mouth+to+Mouth) takes this a step farther, though, telling people to go read the other card's flavor text instead. That card, incidentally, is [Ow](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ow).
 ![Nekrataal](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Nekrataal)**[Nekrataal](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nekrataal)** – *Tenth Edition* uncommon. When [Nekrataal](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nekrataal) got new art for *Tenth Edition*, Christopher Moeller was careful to include nods to the [Nekrataal](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Nekrataal). Check out the notches on the swords!
 ![Carbonize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Carbonize)**[Carbonize](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Carbonize)** – *Scourge* uncommon. The unlucky creature in the art for [Carbonize](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Carbonize) is an Aven, the humanoid birds. It's probably a [Dragonstalker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragonstalker), based on the color of the feathers.
 ![Razia, Boros Archangel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Razia%2C+Boros+Archangel)**[Razia, Boros Archangel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Razia%2C+Boros+Archangel)** – *Ravnica: City of Guilds* rare. To quote [Matt Cavotta](/en/articles/archive/holy-war-boros-legion-2005-12-07), "Razia has been the heart and soul of the Boros guild since the signing of the guildpact. She is more like a demi-god to the army than a military leader, inspiring greatness and giving hope, meaning, and destiny to her Boros devout. Just to keep the black-hearted honest, she does, on occasion, rip the battlefield with holy fire."
 ![Wall of Vapor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Wall+of+Vapor)**[Wall of Vapor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wall+of+Vapor)** – *Legends* common. [Wall of Vapor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wall+of+Vapor) was the spiritual predecessor of [Fog Bank](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fog+Bank), which improved on its ancestor by cost, toughness, adding flying and even having an improved version of the rules text!
 ![Lithatog](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Lithatog)**[Lithatog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lithatog)** – *Odyssey* uncommon. The original art for [Lithatog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lithatog) was deemed "not cartoony enough" (something we very rarely say) and had to be assigned to a different creature. While the new art is clearly an atog, you can see what happened to the original on [Chainflinger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chainflinger) (which was originally a dwarf).
 ![Helium Squirter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Helium+Squirter)**[Helium Squirter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Helium+Squirter)** – *Dissension* common. The way that the [Helium Squirter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Helium+Squirter) grants flying is simplicity itself: it spits cytoplast slugs full of helium onto its targets. The residents of Ravnica have very sensibly harnessed the squirters instead of allowing them to roam the rooftops, splattering passersby with cytoplast.
 ![Vigean Hydropon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Vigean+Hydropon)**[Vigean Hydropon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vigean+Hydropon)** – *Dissension* common. [Vigean Hydropon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vigean+Hydropon) is the only creature in **Magic** that can't attack but doesn't have defender (unless you count creatures like [Magus of the Moat](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Magus+of+the+Moat)). This is because "Vigean Hydropon can't attack or block" just looked more sensible than having a defender that couldn't block.
 ![City of Traitors](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=City+of+Traitors)**[City of Traitors](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=City+of+Traitors)** – *Exodus* rare. The flavor text on [City of Traitors](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=City+of+Traitors) references something not many players picked up on: the *en*-Vec (meaning "in favor with the tribe of Vec") and the *il*-Vec ("out of favor with same") are bitter enemies.
 ![Treachery](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Treachery)**[Treachery](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treachery)** – *Urza's Destiny* rare. To quote [Aaron Forsythe](/en/articles/archive/latest-developments/out-control-2005-04-01-1), "[Treachery](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treachery) is just like [Control Magic](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Control+Magic) except it costs zero or negative mana instead of four. Obviously we didn't quite get the idea of 'fixing' cards back then."
