The month is nearly over, so once again it's time to take a trip in our Friday Night *Magic* time machine and see what promos we have in store (and in stores!) for the coming months.


**December**


For many, December is a highly anticipated month full of holidays, presents, the end of one year, and the start of a brand-new one. To celebrate, we're giving you a new tool to see what's ahead with an updated version of [Anticipate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Anticipate) from Volkan Baga. What? You didn't see that coming?

[Anticipate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Anticipate) Promo | Art by [Volkan Baga](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&artist=+%5b%22Volkan+Baga%22%5d)


**January**


It's a new year, which means it's time for a journey to find yourselfâ€¦and maybe a few Forests. Nissa's certainly on such an introspective journey, and you can join her with your copy of [Nissa's Pilgrimage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nissa%27s+Pilgrimage) with art by Christine Choi.

**February**


Would you like to pit your will against that of an Eldrazi? Apparently Jace would in this version of [Clash of Wills](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Clash+of+Wills) with new art by Anna Steinbauer.
