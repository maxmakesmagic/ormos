Pro Tour Team Series
====================


















Overview
--------


The Pro Tour Team Series celebrates and rewards players for doing well at Pro Tours over the course of a season as part of an approved team! Players form teams of 6 and compete throughout a premier play season on the Pro Tour.








How Team Series Scoring Works
-----------------------------


Teams are given scores based on Pro Points earned by team members at Pro Tours. The Pro Points earned by the top five of the six team members on each team will be added to a team’s score at the end of each Pro Tour.


The Top 2 teams at the end of the season are invited to compete in a special team finals event at the *Magic: The Gathering* World Championship for their share of a $50,400 prize purse!


The total prize money for each team in the Team Finals at the *Magic: The Gathering* World Championship will be divided evenly to each team member who competes in the Pro Tour Team Series Finals.




|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Place** | **Per Player** | **Per Team** |
| 1st | $6,000 | $36,000 |
| 2nd | $2,400 | $14,400 |
| **Total** |  | **$50,400** |

Top performing teams may also be able to earn invitations based on their team’s performance over the course of the season. For the full information on prizing for the 2016-17 soft launch, please refer to the Rules & Eligibility below.
