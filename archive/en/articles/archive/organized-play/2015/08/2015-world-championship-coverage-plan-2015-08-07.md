Last weekend, we had a Pro Tour. It was a rather important one for many players, as it defined Pro Tour Players Club levels, World *Magic* Cup captaincies, and the player pool for *Magic*'s biggest weekend of the year:



PAX Prime weekend, featuring the [2015 *Magic: The Gathering* World Championship](http://magic.wizards.com/en/protour/2015WC/event-information).



Pro Tour *Magic Origins* determined the seventeen seats that remained up for grabs at the World Championship. [Our field of 24 competitors is now determined](http://magic.wizards.com/en/protour/2015WC/players), and in just under three weeks you'll be able to witness some of the world's finest *Magic* players compete in what is the game's most prestigious tournament.


2015 World Championship Coverage Plan
=====================================



The 2015 *Magic: The Gathering* World Championship is professional *Magic*'s most exciting weekend for coverage! With 24 of the best players from all over the world being challenged in four formats, it's going to be three days of phenomenal *Magic* to watch in action. Fourteen rounds of Swiss will be played out in the first two days before a cut to the Top 4, which will feature best-of-five matches showed in their entirety on Sunday.



The World Championship will be streamed live from PAX Prime in Seattle, Washington, on our [Twitch channel](http://www.twitch.tv/magic), and you'll also find plenty of content here on DailyMTG as well as through our various social media channels.



The action kicks off on Thursday, August 27 with Day One. Here's what you can expect that day:



* Three rounds of *Modern Masters 2015 Edition* Booster Draft
* Four rounds of Modern Constructed


Day One coverage starts at 9 a.m. PT/12 p.m. ET/4 p.m. UTC.



All competitors will return for seven more rounds of Swiss on Day Two, featuring:



* Three rounds of *Magic Origins* Booster Draft
* Four rounds of Standard


Day Two coverage will begin Friday, August 28 at 9 a.m. PT/12 p.m. ET/4 p.m. UTC.



Once the day concludes, we'll cut to the Top 4, who will return on Sunday for a best-of-five Standard showdown until we are left with one winner.



The World Championship will take a day off on Saturday, as we gear up some PAX Prime goodness that you'll learn more about later this month, including a *Battle for Zendikar* Preview Show that will be hosted on our Twitch channel that you definitely don't want to miss!



The stream will resume on Sunday at 11 a.m. PT/2 p.m. ET/6 p.m. UTC, starting with a re-run of the previous night's *Battle for Zendikar* Preview Show, followed by the conclusion of the World Championship.



If you're attending PAX Prime, then you can see how this all unfolds LIVE! The competitors will be playing on the lower level of the Annex of PAX Prime, where you can watch the players that aren't in the feature match area squaring off with your very own eyes. And if you'd like to watch the coverage, you can do that on the main level of the Annex, where Rich Hagon will be stationed at the news desk. The commentators will be in the booth, which is also on the main level of the Annex, situated in the same space where you can watch the video coverage live!



Whether you're at PAX Prime or simply tuning in from home, you can join Rich Hagon, Brian David-Marshall, Randy Buehler, Marshall Sutcliffe, Rashad Miller, Tim Willoughby, and *Magic* R&D member Ian Duke as they bring you live video coverage along with. . .

*Hall of Famer Luis Scott-Vargas and Magic R&D member Jackie Lee*



. . . Hall of Famer Luis Scott-Vargas and *Magic* R&D member Jackie Lee, who will be joining us on the team for a special three-person booth setup for live feature match commentary. Rather than saving the three-person booth for the Top 4, we'll have three of our commentators in the booth each round doing commentary for the whole show!



Mark your calendars now, because the 2015 *Magic: The Gathering* World Championship is going to be three days of amazing players, incredible matches, and a whole lot more.


2015 World Championship Player Profiles
=======================================



With our 24 competitors at the 2015 World Championship confirmed, we've kicked off our look into each player's origin story. When did they first start playing *Magic*? What was their experience at their first Pro Tour?



We will run a profile that highlights a World Championship competitor every weekday next week. After that, you'll begin to see two profiles every weekday until we have featured every competitor in this year's World Championship.



Player Profiles can always be referred to on our [2015 World Championship Competitors page](http://magic.wizards.com/en/protour/2015WC/players). Below are the players you can learn more about from the last week:
