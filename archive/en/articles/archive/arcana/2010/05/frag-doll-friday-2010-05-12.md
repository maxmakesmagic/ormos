First things first: the second expansion for **Duels of the Planeswalkers** comes out May 12. That's today! There's [more information available](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/other/051110a), but that's not exactly what we're talking about today.


Because the real news (as far as Arcana is concerned, anyway) is that on Friday, May 14, you can play **Duels of the Planeswalkers** against a Frag Doll. It's called "[Frag Doll Friday](http://www.xbox.com/en-US/community/calendar/fragdollfriday/), and here's how it works:

### Frag Doll Friday event


**May 14 6pm – 8pm PDT**


XBox Users can go to the [XBox LIVE website](http://www.xbox.com/en-US/community/calendar/fragdollfriday/) and sign up by signing onto their XBox account. The list of total sign ups will be collected, and then the Frag Dolls will go from the top of the list and add each person to their friends lists. Then the Frag Dolls send out PMs and they play.


Okay, but what (you might be asking) is a Frag Doll?


### Frag Doll History


[![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/arcana/448_FragDolls.jpg)](http://www.fragdolls.com/)The Frag Dolls are a team of gamers recruited by Ubisoft to represent their video games and promote the presence of women in the gaming industry. Started in 2004 by an open call for female gamers, the Frag Dolls immediately rocketed to the spotlight after winning the *Rainbow Six 3: Black Arrow* tournament in a shut-out at their debut appearance. 


Soon after, the team began appearing in major gaming publications like *Electronic Gaming Monthly*, and filmed episodes for three different G4 television shows. They followed their early success by taking open challenges in *Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory* for 32 undefeated hours during the four-week Electronic Gaming Championship. 


**Valkyrie FD**


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/arcana/448_Valkyrie.jpg)Amy Brady is known to many gamers as original Frag Doll, Valkyrie FD, and as Athena PMS, co-leader of the largest girl gaming organization, PMS Clan. She has competed at various pro-circuit tournaments on FPS titles that include *Halo, Rainbow Six Vegas*, and *Ghost Recon*. At Summer CPL 2006, her Frag Doll team made history as the first all-female team to rank 1st Place at a professional tournament. She was also a cast member on the hit gaming reality show *WCG Ultimate Gamer*.


Amy spent many weekends camping with her buddies and playing **Magic: the Gathering** in college, although it has been years since she has been near enough to any of her buddies to play the card game actively. Lucky for her **Magic** has gone online and she has gotten a chance to become reacquainted with the game! If you were a fly on the wall in Amy’s house you might find her cuddled up to one of her favorite supernatural romance novels or competing online in her many current games, which include: *World of Warcraft, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,* and of course **Magic: the Gathering – Duels of the Planeswalkers**!


**PMS Sunie**


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/arcana/448_PMSSunie.jpg)Michelle Roberson, also known as PMS Sunie, has been a competitive gamer for the last 6 years, concentrating mostly on *Warcraft 3: Defense of the Ancients* (DotA), *Heroes of Newerth* (HoN), and *Halo 3.* She has played for numerous competitive organizations including PMS Clan and Team EG. She was also lucky enough to be chosen as a Frag Doll Cadette! Sunie is a fan of **D&D**, sci-fi, and romance novels, and used to play a ton of **Magic: The Gathering** at her local Friday Night **Magic**. She currently resides in northeast Florida and is going to school to study Marketing and English. You can usually find her at different gaming events demoing various games or products!


**GypsyFly PMS**


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/arcana/448_GypsyFlyPMS.jpg)When Daniela Lao, also known as GypsyFly PMS, is not playing games or **Magic: The Gathering** online and off, she is a full time English major and Writing Minor who resides in Florida. She enjoys writing science fiction, horror and children's books, which don't exactly go together, but feels that didn't stop Stephen King or Neil Gaiman. She is an avid collector of comics, classic books, game collectibles, bad jokes, 80's toys and conspiracy theories. She also serves as the longtime site administrator and Marketing Director for PMS Clan. As a Frag Doll Cadette, Gypsy hopes to help promote the FD Community and mission online and at events.


For the rest of the time, when she is not sitting down at a computer, console, or table, she is at the beach, camping, in the park, or traveling the country to industry events for work. Gypsy is currently about to take her SCUBA test as well as her first skydive this year. She'll try to convince someone to let her do both of those at the same time so it can technically be "skydiving."


**PMS Euphie**


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/arcana/448_PMSEuphie.jpg)Karen Rindone, a.k.a PMS Euphie hails from New Jersey. She knows that a lot of people say they're life-long gamers, but for her she feels it is the truth. When she was just four years old her dad handed her a NES controller and introduced her to *Super Mario Bros.* Eighteen years later and she is still gaming-only now she is the Practice Co-Manager for the North American *Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2* division of the PMS clan! Most of her time is spent working with her fellow clan members and gaming. When she is not managing practice sessions she likes to spend time with her friends and family. Lately you can find Euphie playing games such as: *Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2*, *Splinter Cell: Conviction*, **Magic Online** and *Just Dance*!
