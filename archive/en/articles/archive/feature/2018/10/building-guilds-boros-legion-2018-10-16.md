 Chris is the copy editor for DailyMTG. If the Ts are dotted and the eyes are crossed, he dun goofed. 






For every set we release and every world we visit, the Creative team creates a world guide that covers the history of the groups and characters living on the plane. The concept sketches in the world guide are then used by talented artists from around the world to realize the creative vision for the set and give life to the cards.


To create *Guilds of Ravnica*, the Creative team revisited the guilds, updating their typical outfits for Ravnica's current weather (autumn) and filling in details on leadership changes and new character developments based on the overarching storyline.


In the gallery below, you can see just a few of the pages this team created to guide the artists as they brought *Guilds of Ravnica* to life. Enjoy!

Clad in shining armor and righteous zeal, the soldiers of the Boros Legion take up steel against the corruption and chaos that gnaw at the soul of Ravnica. They enforce the spirit of law with a powerful, disciplined military, and are hard at work to forge the city into a safe and just community for all.
