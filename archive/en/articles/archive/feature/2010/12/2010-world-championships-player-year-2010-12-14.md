It's a tie!

Before [Worlds](/en/events/coverage/theres-no-jace-guillaume) this weekend, Brad Nelson was the frontrunner in the Player of the Year race. Combine a rough patch of playing on Brad's part and an amazing run for Guillaume Matignon (he did win the whole thing, after all), and the result? A tie!
