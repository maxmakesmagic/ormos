During Round 1 of Pro Tour **Theros**, competitor Gaudenis Vidugiris was disqualified for Unsporting Conduct - Cheating.


He was found to have drawn an opening hand of eight cards and then not drawn during his first turn. It appeared to the judges that he was taking actions to cover his mistake of drawing an extra card in his opening hand. This was not believed to be a premeditated action but is not permissible at this level of play. As a result, he was disqualified from this event.
