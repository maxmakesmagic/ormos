If you've been reading *Magic* Story, then you know that the four factions of *Rivals of Ixalan* are fighting for control of the golden city of Orazca and its unfathomable power. We're trying something special for the story of this set—letting you decide which faction will come out on top!


Fans around the world have been voting for their favorite faction on social media, with each victory earning that faction points toward their final tally. We also awarded points to the factions based on how far they traveled in our [special geocaching event](https://www.geocaching.com/promotions/promo/magic/). This final vote on DailyMTG is the last chance to make your voice heard, and a victory in this vote is worth even more points than before!


Next week's *Magic* Story will reveal our winner. Vote in the poll below and let us know which faction you want to stake their claim on Orazca!


 


**[Update: Due to unintended functionality in the original poll, we have modified the submission form and reset the tallies. If you voted prior to 3:00 pm PT on February 7, 2018, please vote again.]**
