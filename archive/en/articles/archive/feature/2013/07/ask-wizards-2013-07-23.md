 **Q: Under the new legend rule, in a Two-Headed Giant game, can my ally and I both have a copy of the same legendary creature on the field simultaneously? —Usman K.**

The new legend rule looks at each player individually. So you can control a legendary permanent with the same name as a legendary permanent your teammate controls and both will be fine. The same is true for Planeswalkers with the same Planeswalker type.
