Unfortunately, due to a misunderstanding of tournament procedure, pairing for the Top 4 semifinals booster drafts were not conducted in the order that they should have been.


"We printed the brackets and gave them to the players and judges at the table,” said head judge Riccardo Tessitori. “The draft begun with no one realizing the seating was incorrect, and the error was only noticed after play had commenced and both matches were nearly complete."


It was determined, at the stage in which this error was caught, to go forward with the pairing as it was made instead of invalidating two drafts and match conclusions. As a result, 1st seed for this tournament has played against 3rd seed, and 2nd seed has played against 4th seed. The bracket on the coverage page reflects this pairing.
