 Nam began with a [Thoughtseize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtseize), taking Watanabe's [Underworld Connections](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Underworld+Connections). He followed up with a [Pack Rat](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pack+Rat)s which was promptly killed with a [Devour Flesh](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Devour+Flesh). Watanabe tried a [Duress](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress), nabbing himself a [Hero's Downfall](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hero%27s+Downfall), then followed up with a [Pack Rat](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pack+Rat)s. Nam tried a Nightveil Spectre, but Watanabe was having none of that nonsense and offed it in short order.




 Nam pushed on with the disruption with a [Thoughtseize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtseize), then both players summoned [Desecration Demon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Desecration+Demon)s, who dutifully glared at each other through the skies. Watanabe started using Rat Pack tokens to tap down Nam's [Desecration Demon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Desecration+Demon), knocking the GP:Melbourne champion down to dangerously low life. Nam pondered his options. With a [Mutavault](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mutavault) and 3 other lands on the board, he could stave off the Demon for a turn if necessary. He attacked, knocking Watanabe to 13, then summoned a second Demon and passed.





*Nam considers some triggers*
