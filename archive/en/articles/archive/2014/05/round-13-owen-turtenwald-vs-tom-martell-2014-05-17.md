 Call it the stretch run. Call it the elimination rounds. Call it do or die. Call it some pretty tense **Magic**.




 No matter what you call these last few rounds before the Top 8, there's no doubt that every match seems to count that much more for every player in contention. And when those players just happen to be teammates playing a 75-card mirror, and those teammates happen to both be ranked in the Top 10, and those ranked players are vying for spots in the World **Magic** Cup...well, suffice to say there's a lot on the line here.



Which almost makes it something of a relief that the two players who fit all of those descriptions sitting the text feature match area are teammates and friends. No. 3 Owen Turtenwald and No. 7 Tom Martell have been members of the Pantheon side of ChannelFireball for some time now. They're about as familiar with one another as two players can be. They were so familiar they even showed each other their sideboards before the match when Turtenwald wasn't quite sure if they were an exact 75-card mirror or not.





*The two ChannelFireball Pantheon teammates, No. 3 Ranked Player Owen Turtenwald and No. 7 Ranked Player Tom Martell, were both running the same 75 cards.*
