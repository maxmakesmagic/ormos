Round 9
Feature match
Tom Van de Logt vs. Sigurd Eskeland
---------------------------------------------------------


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/GPCOPENHAGEN00/images/tomvandelogt.gif)Going into this game Tom is lying in third on 22 points and Sigurd is in sixth on 21 a win here would almost gurantee top eight for either of them. Tom is playing a mainly white deck featuring numerous Rebel Searchers, he is howerver lacking in the quality of his rebeld he can search for. Tom's deck also features a Splash of black. Sigurd is playing a more evenly split R/U deck several Pingers and Spellshapers.


**Game one**  

Tom manages to lose this game despite searching up all his Rebels from his deck as he draws an insane amount of land and Sigurd gets some early hits in with a Cloudskate and a Wandering Eye. The eye makes things interesting as Tom can see the Rethink in Sigurd's hand, this becomes even more of an issue when Tom draws an Avatar of Hope with enough mana to cast it but for the Rethink in Sigurd's hand, this becomes even more of an issue when Tom draws an Avatar of Hope with enough mana to cast it but for the Rethink. A Stinging Barner and a Kris Mage bring Tom down to three life and Sigurd uses and ensnare to allow the eye and the mage to attack allowing the barrier to ping Tom for the win. Sigurd made sure that Tom was not on three life during his turn thus allowing him to cast the Avatar.


**Game two**  
![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/GPCOPENHAGEN00/images/sigurd.eskeland.gif)The next very closely resembles the first with Tom again searching up an array of Rebels and Sigurd using a Stinging Barrier and a Kris Mage to thin out the smaller members of Tom's forces. Tom still manages to keep the pressure on and has answers when Sigurd makes an effort to turn the game, once disenchanting a Flowstone Thopter and then later on toppling a Rushing Golem that would have been a nuisance. Sigurd does manage to get a Sparrazan Braker on the table, which he is using to take Tom down bit by bit. Time is called during Sigurd's turn with him at two and Tom at six. If Sigurd cannot kill Tom this turn he will die to Tom's next attack and the game will be a draw. Sigurd does the math then concedes he would come up one damage short even though he had a Magistrates Veto in hand to neutralise Tom's blockers.


**Draw 1-1**
