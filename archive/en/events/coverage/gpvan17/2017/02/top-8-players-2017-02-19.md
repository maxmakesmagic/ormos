 Yes, always. Not too much without a meta shift.

 It feels like a major accomplishment as it's my first major tournament in many years. *Magic* is a game I've loved for over 20 years. It's awesome.

 My first Modern Top 8 makes me feel more well-rounded. I don't need to worrying about the Pro Tours as much to hit Gold again this year!
