**Last Week of *Ravnica* in the Year of Modern Flashbacks**


It's 2016: The Year of Modern Flashbacks! If you want to build up a collection for Modern, these Flashback Drafts add everything you draft to your collection once the event is over. Even if Modern isn't your thing, you can enjoy a leisurely draft through the planes of the past with rotating formats each week!


Full *Ravnica* Block Flashback Drafts begin after the Wednesday, March 30 downtime and run until Wednesday, April 6, at 10:00 a.m. PT (UTC-7), and are followed up by *Coldsnap* Flashbacks. Get the full schedule [here](http://magic.wizards.com/en/MTGO/articles/archive/magic-online/year-of-modern-flashbacks-2015-12-14) and mark your calendar for the formats you're most excited about!

**Reminder: Place Redemption Orders Before March 30**


In an effort to make sure *Magic Online* is available when you want to play *Magic*, we’re working on ways to reduce the number of times we have to bring the system offline for maintenance. As a first step we’re simply going to eliminate at least one downtime each month.


Here are the dates of the exact downtimes we’ll be skipping in the first half of 2016:


* April 6
* April 20
* May 11
* June 8
* June 22

During these weeks without a downtime, *Magic Online* will NOT be processing set redemptions. **This means that if your order wasn't made prior to the March 30 downtime, it won't be processed until April 13.**
