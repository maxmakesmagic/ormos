**Card of the Day - vendredi 30 mai 2008**


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Desert)#### Desert


 *Arabian Nights* common. In *Alpha* and *Beta*, all the nonbasic lands were rare. However, *Arabian Nights* brought the first common nonbasic land into existence in the form of Desert. We don't have the record of the entire decision-making process of making it a common, but presumably the fact that deserts are, well, all over the setting, figured into it somehow.
 


**Card of the Day - jeudi 29 mai 2008**


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Feast%20of%20the%20Unicorn)#### Feast of the Unicorn


 *Classic Sixth Edition* common. When it was reprinted in *Sixth Edition*, Feast of the Unicorn forced the team to make a decision between the two *Homelands* versions. They went with the unicorn-head art and the Autumn Willow quote about Baron Sengir. On the other version, even the Baron sounds like he doesn't really like eating unicorns.
 


**Card of the Day - mercredi 28 mai 2008**


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Incremental%20Growth)#### Incremental Growth


 *Lorwyn* uncommon. The three large gourds in the art of Incremental Growth started off as all the same size (the same size as the much smaller ones, in fact). Appearing as different sizes indicates the different number of +1/+1 counters that each one has received.
 


**Card of the Day - mardi 27 mai 2008**


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Taste%20of%20Paradise)#### Taste of Paradise


 *Alliances* common. Although the attribution of the quote in Taste of Paradise's flavor text seems to contain references to both Elder Druid and Juniper Order Druid, there's really only one Elder Druid of the Juniper Order at a time: Kaysa herself
 


**Card of the Day - vendredi 23 mai 2008**


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Reach%20Through%20Mists)#### Reach Through Mists


 *Champions of Kamigawa* common. The mists of Reach Through Mists are not metaphorical. In fact, Minamo, School at Water's Edge sits at the top of a vast waterfall, which is the portal to the spirit world. When you reach through the mists (or part the veil), you're reaching through that waterfall to use both mortal and kami magic. And that's why it's Arcane!
 


**Card of the Day - jeudi 22 mai 2008**


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Cloud%20Pirates)#### Cloud Pirates


 *Portal* common. The "cloud" designator usually means that a creature can only block fliers. This applies to djinns, sprites, dragons, elementals, and pirates, but not keys or -posts.
 


**Card of the Day - mercredi 21 mai 2008**


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Iceberg)#### Iceberg


 *Ice Age* uncommon. When *Coldsnap* was released, it was retroactively declared to be part of the *Ice Age* block (which, up until then, had consisted of just *Ice Age* and *Alliances*, with *Homelands* sometimes thrown in). The *Coldsnap* theme decks included cards from the rest of the block, which meant that cards like Iceberg got a fresh printing without becoming Standard-legal.
 


**Card of the Day - mardi 20 mai 2008**


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Island%20Fish%20Jasconius)#### Island Fish Jasconius


 *Arabian Nights* uncommon. The Island Fish Jasconius is taken from two classic tales. The "Island Fish" part is, appropriately enough for an *Arabian Nights* card, from "The First Voyage of Sindbad," in which Sindbad's sailors discover that the island they've lit a fire on is actually a gigantic fish. The fire wakes up the fish, all the sailors are in danger of drowning, and so on. The "Jasconius" part is the name of the whale that Saint Brendan is said to have accidentally camped on in the sixth century, with similar results. It turns out that whales, just like giant fish, don't like fires being set on their backs.
 


**Card of the Day - lundi 19 mai 2008**


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Clearwater%20Goblet)#### Clearwater Goblet


 *Fifth Dawn* rare. While straight life gain has not always been a Tier One strategy, Clearwater Goblet was a key element of tournament-winning Prismatic decks on **Magic Online**. In more casual play, it could get extra counters and gain its controller even more life per turn, although that strategy usually involved a Mizzium Transreliquat or something equally convoluted.
 


**Card of the Day - vendredi 16 mai 2008**


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Scapegoat)#### Scapegoat


 *Stronghold* uncommon. The art of Scapegoat portrays a pivotal moment in the *Weatherlight* saga, in which Gerrard believes that he has finally killed Volrath, who had once been Vuel, Gerrard's stepbrother (and Sidar Kondo's son). Unfortunately (and this is what's happening on the card), it was a shapeshifter in the form of Volrath, which meant that Gerrard had to spend the rest of *Stronghold* and *Exodus* chasing him.
 


**Card of the Day - jeudi 15 mai 2008**


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Centaur%20Archer)#### Centaur Archer


 *Ice Age* common. It might seem like a suspicious coincidence that Arna Kennerüd showed up on **Magic** around the time that Darla Kennerud was in charge of flavor text, but in fact, she did it as a tribute to the man she was dating. She only got Kennerud as her own last name *after* the character started saying things in **Magic** continuity.
 


**Card of the Day - mercredi 14 mai 2008**


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Dross%20Scorpion)#### Dross Scorpion


 *Mirrodin* common. Mixed in among the raw Affinity-fueled power of *Mirrodin* were a few more traditional combo pieces. Mixing Dross Scorpion with a Cathodion-imprinted Soul Foundry and any way of sacrificing a creature for a useful effect immediately translated into an arbitrarily large life total, mana pool, or damage to an opponent. This never really translated into big tournament success, because the aforementioned Affinity cards were so good that even infinite combos couldn't stand up to them.
 


**Card of the Day - mardi 13 mai 2008**


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Crooked%20Scales)#### Crooked Scales


 *Mercadian Masques* rare. The obvious way that Crooked Scales is rigged is that the controller can flip coins more than once, which made it pretty good in a Limited environment where a player could reliably scare up ten mana. However, it also takes advantage of timing rules; since the coin-flipping is part of the effect (instead of the cost), any regeneration or other responses must be decided on before anyone knows what the results of the coin-flipping will be. And because it has two targets, it's legitimate to activate the Scales and respond by bouncing your own creature, thus removing all of the downside from a bad coinflip.
 


**Card of the Day - lundi 12 mai 2008**


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Phage%20the%20Untouchable)#### Phage the Untouchable


 *Legions* rare. Before she became Untouchable, Phage was Kamahl's sister Jeska. But after a series of events involving her death, the Mirari, Braids, and the Cabal god Kuberr, Jeska was reborn as Phage and eventually battled Akroma in the pits. You can see part of the battle if you put Phage and Akroma's cards side-by-side.
 


**Card of the Day - vendredi 9 mai 2008**


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Jamuraan%20Lion)#### Jamuraan Lion


 *Visions* common. In addition to being the only mono-white card in **Magic** that keeps a creature from blocking without also keeping it from attacking, Jamuraan Lion sports a nearly unique ![2 Mana](https://magic.wizards.com/images/Symbols/Symbol_2_mana.gif)![White Mana](https://magic.wizards.com/images/Symbols/white_mana.gif) 3/1 body. The only other ![2 Mana](https://magic.wizards.com/images/Symbols/Symbol_2_mana.gif)![White Mana](https://magic.wizards.com/images/Symbols/white_mana.gif) 3/1, *Mercadian Masques*' Ignoble Soldier, actually has a *drawback*, and in fact, the only other mono-white creature in **Magic** that has 3 power and costs less than four mana without any drawbacks or restrictions is *Future Sight* "timeshifted" card—and fellow 3/1 Cat—Blade of the Sixth Pride.
 


**Card of the Day - jeudi 8 mai 2008**


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Wormfang%20Crab)#### Wormfang Crab


 *Judgment* uncommon. The black and red Nightmare creatures from *Torment* took some resource from your opponent as long as they were in play. In *Judgment*, the formula was reversed: instead of taking from your opponent, the Nightmares—both the blue Wormfang creatures and the red "Gorgers"—took some resource of your own as long as they were in play. Wormfang Crab takes a permanent—but as printed, it neglected an important clause that was quickly added with errata: *other than Wormfang Crab*.
 


**Card of the Day - mercredi 7 mai 2008**


![](https://web.archive.org/web/20190613223424im_/https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Twincast)#### Twincast


 *Tenth Edition* rare. The distinct but related mechanics of copying spells and changing their targets have engaged in a sort of exchange program between red and blue over the years, with blue Twincast appearing in *Saviors of Kamigawa* as a color-shifted (and rules-streamlined) version of red Alpha staple Fork even as red's Shunt replaced blue's Deflection as the poster child for changing targets. Even in more recent sets, cards such as Goblin Flectomancer and Wild Ricochet show that both colors continue to have a claim on both abilities under the right circumstances.
 


**Card of the Day - mardi 6 mai 2008**


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Bull%20Aurochs)#### Bull Aurochs


 *Coldsnap* common. Bull Aurochs is one of three Aurochs creatures in *Coldsnap* inspired by the original *Ice Age*Aurochs... which in turn was inspired, you might say, by *Bos primigenius*, the European aurochs (or urus), an extinct relative of modern domestic cattle. The last known aurochs died in Poland in 1627, 368 years before the release of *Ice Age*. (Source: Wikipedia)
 


**Card of the Day - lundi 5 mai 2008**


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Rustspore%20Ram)#### Rustspore Ram


 *Mirrodin* uncommon. Rustspore Ram represents a mechanical life form native to Mirrodin, and an angry one at that. Unlike many creatures depicted in their art as charging, it doesn't have trample or an especially high power. Instead, it takes out its anger on whatever Equipment gets in its way. The stacks on its shoulders spew rust-inducing spores, and the art clearly shows the swath of oxidation this beast—oh, excuse us, Sheep—has already carved.
 


**Card of the Day - vendredi 2 mai 2008**


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Avalanche%20Riders)#### Avalanche Riders


 *Time Spiral* "timeshifted". Originally designed by **Magic** Invitational winner Darwin Kastle, Avalanche Riders was one of three Invitational winners' submissions that were reprinted (all for the first time) in the *Time Spiral* "timeshifted" set (the others were Voidmage Prodigy and Shadowmage Infiltrator). There was another Invitational submission in *Time Spiral*, but it wasn't timeshifted, and it wasn't a winner's submission. It was Tsuyoshi Fujita's "Unluckyman's Paradise," known to you as Gemstone Caverns, voted in as the fan favorite among that year's submissions.
 


**Card of the Day - jeudi 1 mai 2008**


![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Survival%20of%20the%20Fittest)#### Survival of the Fittest


 *Exodus* rare. As one of the most efficient repeatable tutors in **Magic**, Survival of the Fittest has had a storied tournament career. Paired with the wildly powerful—and repeatable—reanimation spell Recurring Nightmare, it propelled three people to the Top 8 of the World Championships in 1998. Later, Paul Barclay's Full English Breakfast deck used Survival's combined power of discard and search to transform Volrath's Shapeshifter into a Flowstone Hellion, attack, put eleven +1/-1 activations on the stack, then discard Phyrexian Dreadnought and hit the opponent with a 23/1 trampler.
