Live Coverage of 2007 Grand Prix Montreal!
==========================================











![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gpmon07/champ.jpg)Grand Prix Montreal is over! Fighting through a whopping 18 rounds of play over two grueling days, Celso Zampere Jr. emerged as the Montreal champion. Facing off against Celso was American National Champion Paul Cheon, who was piloting a blue-black control deck and amazingly undefeated on the weekend. Celso met his opponent with his Brazilian green-white aggro deck, and barely managed to take the match in three. Paul was doing well with Korlash, [Aven Riftwatcher](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aven+Riftwatcher), Venser, and [Momentary Blink](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Momentary+Blink), but he just couldn't overcome his opponent's tag team of [Tarmogoyf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf) and [Serra Avenger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Serra+Avenger). Congratulations to Celso Zampere Jr., Grand Prix-Montreal 2007 champion!
