Welcome to another edition of [Sketches](http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=mtgcom/fullarchive&tablefilter=sketches:). This week we take an look at the creation of *Mirrodin's* 
**[Dross Prowler](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dross+Prowler)** by Mike Sutfin. 

### 1. Art Description

The instructions given to the artist were short and sweet:


> 
> *"A sneaky Nim in the shadows."*
> 
> 
> 

That is what you call "artistic license," folks. The Nim have a characteristic look -- the facial plate-hood covering the eyes and forehead, the spike-like jutting teeth -- but this is about as minimalistic as art descriptions get. 

Sutfin, who has illustrated such iconic classics as [Jhovall Queen](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jhovall+Queen), [Cateran Overlord](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cateran+Overlord), [Tsabo Tavoc](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tsabo+Tavoc), [Exalted Angel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Exalted+Angel), and *Darksteel's* 
[Heartseeker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Heartseeker), is a master of bringing rich detail to his subjects. For this kind of artist, sometimes a light touch on the art description generates great results.

### 2. Sketch

Mr. Sutfin came up with this initial sketch for the [Dross Prowler](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dross+Prowler), which in playtest was called "Nim Cutthroat": 

As you can see, the art team made a strong choice in providing such a slim description. Sutfin filled the frame with complexity and detail that a zombie has rarely enjoyed. Changes were not recommended by the **Magic** art team.

### 3. Final Art

Here is the final art for [Dross Prowler](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dross+Prowler). Note especially the miniature necrogen chimneys sprouting from its back, and the detail and care taken in its creepily composite ear-structure. 

### 4. Card

Finally, here is the card as you can see it in booster packs.
