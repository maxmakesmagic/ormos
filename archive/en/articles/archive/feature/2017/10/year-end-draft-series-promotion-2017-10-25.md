We're starting a ten-week Draft Series promotion. The prize? Two—yes, two—[Standard Showdown boosters](https://magic.wizards.com/en/event-types/standard-showdown)!


The promotion will start on October 28, with [Dino-Sized Weekend](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/news/announcing-dino-sized-weekend-and-ixalan-mid-season-league-2017-09-18). From this point through the end of the year, if you participate in at least six booster drafts at the same store, you will receive two of these boosters from your local game store!


The promotion ends with the *Ixalan* Store Championship on December 31.


Fortunately, there are plenty of opportunities to get some drafts in:


* Dino-Sized Weekend, October 28–29: four-booster-pack *Ixalan* drafts all weekend!
* Drafting at Friday Night *Magic* in November
* Iconic Draft Weekend, November 17–19: first time drafting with *Iconic Masters*!
* Drafting at Friday Night *Magic* in December
* *Unstable* Draft Weekend, December 8–10: get ready for some *Unstable* craziness!

These are just some opportunities where you can draft during that period. Any other moments you find to draft at your [local game store](http://locator.wizards.com/) work as well. Casual drafts will also count toward your total.


So sharpen your Draft skills—there are some exciting times ahead of us!

*Important Info: You need to have your DCI number registered in order to receive your prize. The boosters won't be delivered to the store until after the promotion has finished.*
