Introducing Vintage Masters!
============================



 Posted in **Magic Online**
 on December 8, 2013 










We are extremely excited to announce the forthcoming **Magic Online**-only set, *Vintage Masters.* We want to share with you what *Vintage Masters* is and the goals of the set, when it will be released, and what you'll find in the set. We think you'll be equally excited!

| **Set Name** | *Vintage Masters* |
| **Prerelease Events** | June 13-16, 2014 |
| **Magic Online Release Date** | June 16, 2014 |


What Are the Goals of *Vintage Masters?*
We know that the Vintage format for **Magic Online** demands to be done the right way. With *Vintage Masters,*  we are striving to make available on **Magic Online**  every relevant **Magic**  card in existence for the Vintage format.


Before *Vintage Masters,* many players will have never had the experience of playing a match of Vintage **Magic**. *Vintage Masters*  will contain a number of older **Magic**  cards, many of which are crucial to the Vintage format. This includes the nine cornerstone cards called the Power Nine. These nine cards are perhaps the most famous in **Magic**'s history, cards like Black Lotus and Time Walk. If you've never owned a piece of the Power Nine, you're not alone, but with the release of *Vintage Masters,* **Magic Online**  players will have the chance to possess the power!


The Vintage format allows the use of all **Magic**  sets. There are banned and restricted cards in Vintage, though there are very few banned cards. Restricted cards are those that are limited to one in a deck, rather than the usual limit of four per deck. For more information, you can read about [the Vintage format](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/magazine/article.aspx?x=mtgcom/academy/21), [Vintage format deck construction and the current Vintage banned & restricted list.](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/magazine/article.aspx?x=judge/resources/sfrvintage)


We want *Vintage Masters*  to provide a fun Limited environment like the one that *Modern Masters*  had, so we're working hard to make sure it succeeds there as well. On **Magic Online**  we are excited to offer a full selection of Sealed and Draft play with *Vintage Masters*  starting off with Prerelease Events on June 13, 2014.


*Vintage Masters*  will give **Magic Online**  players a chance to own and enjoy many of the amazing and storied cards in **Magic**. This **Magic Online**-only card set is one we've been driving internally for some time. Anything called *Vintage Masters*  demands quality, so we are investing the effort and taking the time necessary to produce an experience that lives up to its name.


What's in *Vintage Masters* and When Will It Be Released?
Prerelease events for *Vintage Masters*  will begin June 13, 2014, with the set going on sale on June 16. To coincide with the initial availability of cards for the format, Vintage will be introduced to **Magic Online**  on June 11. Ongoing, we will support *Vintage Masters*  with a full suite of **Magic Online**  events.


*Vintage Masters* is a set that will be similar in size to *Modern Masters,* available only in **Magic Online**. *Vintage Masters* will be a non-redeemable set available only in **Magic Online** in 15-card booster packs. *Vintage Masters* booster packs will retail for the MSRP of $6.99, and each pack will contain the following:



* 10 commons
* 3 uncommons
* 1 rare or mythic rare
* 1 premium foil card (any rarity, including the extremely rare premium foil Power Nine card), **OR**  1 Power Nine card


There will be premium foil versions of all cards in the *Vintage Masters* set, including the Power Nine!


We will be revealing more specifics about *Vintage Masters,* including set size and distribution of Power Nine cards as we get closer to the release date.

| Mox Ruby | Mox Jet | Mox Sapphire |
| Ancestral Recall | Time Walk | Black Lotus |


*Vintage Masters* will introduce fresh new artwork for several other classic cards you'll find in the set as well.


How Come *Vintage Masters*  Is Being Released in 2014?
When we first began developing the idea of *Vintage Masters,* our hope was to release it in the same year as **Magic**'s 20th anniversary. After the success and popularity of *Modern Masters,* we agreed the bar was set for quality, and we wanted to not just clear the bar, but raise it again.


To release *Vintage Masters*—and do it *right—*we realized there just wasn't enough time in 2013 like we had originally planned. The June 16, 2014, release date for *Vintage Masters*  reflects the balance between wanting to get the right product out to players, and the desire to deliver a seriously awesome set and play experience that lives up to the name, *Vintage Masters.*
