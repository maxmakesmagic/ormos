Day 2 Coverage



In seemed like Pro Tour Hall of Famer Ben Stark was on an inexorable march to become Grand Prix Atlanta champion. His innovative Desert Red—a brew-ish variant of Ramunap Red—was taking the tournament by storm. But in the finals, New Hampshire player Alex Lloyd parted the clouds for the Approach of the Second Sun, answering Stark with some innovation of his own. Though Lloyd was playing a White-Blue version last week, he turned some knobs and added a whole new color for the aggro match-up—he hit the sweet spot. Hall of Fame be darned, Lloyd took Stark to the Hall of Pain.


This weekend in Atlanta was a great showing of *Ixalan* Standard, with four distinct archetypes in the Top 4—Desert Red, Mardu Vehicles, Esper Approach and Four-Color Energy. Shaheen Soorani made a deep run with Grixis Control, and even the top dog Temur Energy saw a big tweak with (10) Brad Nelson and his Top 8-ing brother (20) Corey Baumeister almost maxing out on Confiscation Coup to break Hazoret the Fervent in half.


Like a Treasure Map—and maybe even Ben Stark's deck's specific Treasure Map— *Ixalan* continues to be a space worth exploring, because there's plenty of treasure to be found within its borders if you just follow the clues.


The triple-Grand Prix weekend has come to a close with the conclusion of Grand Prix Shanghai, Warsaw, and now Atlanta. Rest up travelers, because we're back at it again soon.

### Top 8 Profiles


by Marc Calderaro




 Learn more about Grand Prix Atlanta's Top 8 competitors—including who they are, what they've done in the game, and more—by taking a look through their profiles!

Day 1 Coverage



It was a Standard storm in Atlanta, exploring the rocky seas of *Ixalan*. There was an energy about the place that couldn't be harnessed. Coming out of the Pro Tour, the decks and the players could not be contained.


1,397 players brought their A games but only four could slalom the course to perfection. Justin Rios, Marlon Garcia, Trevor Coulombe, and Petr Sochurek finished 9-0, and will look to translate that Day One into a Top 8 on Day Two. But perils await them, as tons of pros and amateurs alike have their spyglasses trained on the treasure at the end of the weekend.


So tune in to [twitch.tv/magic](http://twitch.tv/magic) tomorrow to see whether these four can keep their leads, or if some enterprising players can take them hostage, and steal what they feel is rightfully theirs.


See you tomorrow!
