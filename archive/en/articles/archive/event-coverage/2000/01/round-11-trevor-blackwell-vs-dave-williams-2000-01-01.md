Trevor Blackwell has become one of the premier pros since he won PTLA last year. He followed it up by winning US Nationals this year. He played a blue-green-red beatdown deck with [Emblazoned Golem](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Emblazoned+Golem)s. 


David Williams is coming off a disappointing DQ in the top 8 of World Championships last weekend. Many feel his marked cards were not intentional making it perhaps the worst beat in PT history. Others aren't so sure. It is a credit to Williams that he is back to compete just one week later after what must have been a terrible experience. Williams went to the internet for his deck choice. He took the undefeated blue-white-red deck from the day before at GP Kobe and replaced the [Exclude](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Exclude)s with [Flametongue Kavu](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flametongue+Kavu)s. 


Game one went well for Blackwell at first. He beat down Williams with a Mongoose at first while he Repulsed his William's [Galina's Knight](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Galina%27s+Knight) two turns in a row. Williams played a [Lightning Angel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Angel) that got two Fires played on it. Williams played a [Galina's Knight](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Galina%27s+Knight) and a [Goblin Legionnaire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Legionnaire) to stop the beats. Blackwell returned with a 4/5 [Emblazoned Golem](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Emblazoned+Golem). Williams got back in the life race by playing Ice on Blackwell's Golem two turns in a row. Williams then drew a [Lightning Angel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Angel), which sealed up the match for him.

Blackwell Flametongued the Goblin, which made the world safe for the [Lightning Angel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Angel) that Williams played the next turn. Blackwell won a counter war to [Repulse](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Repulse) the Angel, but Williams just played it again and continued the beats. A pair of Rages finished off Blackwell.


Williams wins 2-0
