Aaron's Random Card Comment Archive
===================================



 Posted in **Feature**
 on August 1, 2011

By Aaron Forsythe












*Aaron Forsythe, Director of **Magic** R&D is active on his Twitter feed (@[mtgaaron](http://twitter.com/#!/mtgaaron)), and has earned a reputation for frank and open conversation on the topics that matter to **Magic** players. One occasional feature on his Twitter feed is Aaron's Random Card Comment of the Day, or #arccd. Aaron hits the [Random Card](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?action=random) button in Gatherer, then heads into the Discussion tab for that card and writes a short commentary on it—no matter what it is (except for basic lands, as discussed in ARCCD #16).*


*The result is more than 30,000 words and counting of straight-talking card commentary from one of the game's biggest fans and toughest critics. Inside, you'll get Aaron's thoughts, insights, and recollections about the future of [Lotus Petal](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lotus+Petal), the legacy of Unglued, and the reasons we don't print [Stone Rain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stone+Rain) anymore.*


*Here, collected in one place for the first time, are Aaron's Random Card Comments numbers 51-75. We're divvying them up for your protection—as you know if you read either Great Designer Search, 30,000 words is a lot—but if you really want to dive in, you can find our archive of the first 25 [here](/en/articles/archive/latest-developments/aarons-random-card-comment-archive-part-1-2011-06-03), the second 25 [here](/en/articles/archive/latest-developments/aarons-random-card-comment-archive-part-2-2011-06-17), and all the cards Aaron has commented on in Gatherer [here](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?action=advanced&user=+%5BAaron_Forsythe%5D).*


*Enjoy!*
