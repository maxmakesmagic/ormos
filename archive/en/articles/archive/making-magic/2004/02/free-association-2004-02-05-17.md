![Dwarven Berserker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Dwarven+Berserker)During the *Mirage* block, I tried to give **Magic's** dwarves a little flavor. My idea was the dwarves are creatures who wear their emotions on their sleeves. When they experience an emotion, you can tell. As such, I felt the dwarves would constantly be picking fights as they get very easily riled up. This is where the flavor text for [Dwarven Berserker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dwarven+Berserker) came from (“*I may be small, but I can kick your butt.*”) So not only am I responsible for giving dwarves a little more spice, but I'm also the first person to get the word “[butt](/en/articles/archive/making-magic/free-association-2004-02-05-6)” onto a **Magic** card.
