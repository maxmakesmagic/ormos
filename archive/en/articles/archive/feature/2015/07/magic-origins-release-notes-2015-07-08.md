The Release Notes include information concerning the release of a new *Magic: The Gathering* set, as well as a collection of clarifications and rulings involving that set's cards. It's intended to make playing with the new cards more fun by clearing up the common misconceptions and confusion inevitably caused by new mechanics and interactions. As future sets are released, updates to the *Magic* rules may cause some of this information to become outdated. If you can't find the answer you're looking for here, please contact us at [Wizards.com/CustomerService](http://www.wizards.com/CustomerService).


The "General Notes" section includes release information and explains the mechanics and concepts in the set.


The "Card-Specific Notes" section contains answers to the most important, most common, and most confusing questions players might ask about cards in the set. Items in the "Card-Specific Notes" section include full card text for your reference. Not all cards in the set are listed.

**Five Iconic Planeswalkers: An Origin Story**


*Magic Origins* explores the beginnings of five of *Magic*'s most illustrious Planeswalkers: Gideon Jura, Jace Beleren, Liliana Vess, Chandra Nalaar, and Nissa Revane. Throughout the set, you'll find cards depicting life on their home planes, the events that led to the ignition of their Planeswalker sparks, and their first travels as Planeswalkers. These five Planeswalkers form the centerpiece of *Magic Origins*, and each one appears as a double-faced card.




---

**Returning Mechanic: Double-Faced Cards**


Double-faced cards originally appeared in the *Innistrad* block. Instead of the typical card face and *Magic* card back, double-faced cards have two faces: a front face and a back face. There are five double-faced cards in *Magic Origins*. They are legendary creatures on one face, representing the early lives of the characters depicted. On the back face, they are planeswalkers, with their sparks ignited and their true power realized.

> *-9: You get an emblem with "Whenever you cast a spell, target opponent puts the top five cards of his or her library into his or her graveyard."*
> 
> 
> 


The rules governing double-faced cards haven't changed significantly since the *Innistrad* set (with the exception of their interaction with the manifest action; see below). Notably, none of the five *Magic Origins* double-faced cards has an ability that allows it to transform (change which face is up) while on the battlefield; rather, each card exiles itself and then enters the battlefield transformed.


* Each face of a double-faced card has its own set of characteristics: name, types, subtypes, power and toughness, loyalty, abilities, and so on. While a double-faced card is on the battlefield, consider only the characteristics of the face that's currently up. The other set of characteristics is ignored. While a double-faced card isn't on the battlefield, consider only the characteristics of its front face. For example, the above card has only the characteristics of Jace, Vryn's Prodigy in the graveyard, even if it was Jace, Telepath Unbound on the battlefield before it was put into the graveyard.
* The converted mana cost of a double-faced card not on the battlefield is the converted mana cost of its front face.
* The back face of a double-faced card doesn't have a mana cost. A double-faced permanent with its back face up has a converted mana cost of 0. Each back face has a color indicator that defines its color. For example, Jace, Telepath Unbound is a blue permanent.
* The back face of a double-faced card (in the case of *Magic Origins*, the planeswalker face) can't be cast.
* Although the two rules are similar, the "legend rule" and the "planeswalker uniqueness rule" affect different kinds of permanents. You can control Jace, Vryn's Prodigy and Jace, Telepath Unbound at the same time. However, if Jace, Vryn's Prodigy is exiled and enters the battlefield transformed, you'll then control two planeswalkers with the same subtype. You'll choose one to remain on the battlefield, and the other will be put into its owner's graveyard.
* A double-faced card enters the battlefield with its front face up by default, unless a spell or ability instructs you to put it onto the battlefield transformed, in which case it enters with its back face up.
* A *Magic Origins* planeswalker that enters the battlefield because of the ability of its front face will enter with loyalty counters as normal.
* In some rare cases, a spell or ability may cause one of these five cards to transform while it's a creature (front face up) on the battlefield. If this happens, the resulting planeswalker won't have any loyalty counters on it and will subsequently be put into its owner's graveyard.
* You can activate one of the planeswalker's loyalty abilities the turn it enters the battlefield. However, you may do so only during one of your main phases when the stack is empty. For example, if the planeswalker enters the battlefield during combat, there will be an opportunity for your opponent to remove it before you can activate one of its abilities.
* If a double-faced card is manifested, it will be put onto the battlefield face down (this is also true if it's put onto the battlefield face down some other way). Note that "face down" is not synonymous with "with its back face up." A manifested double-faced card is a 2/2 creature with no name, mana cost, creature types, or abilities. While face down, it can't transform. If the front face of a manifested double-faced card is a creature card, you can turn it face up by paying its mana cost. If you do, its front face will be up. A double-faced card on the battlefield can't be turned face down.



---

**Returning Game Supplement: Checklist Cards**


It's important that the cards in your deck be indistinguishable from one another. To accomplish this with double-faced cards, you can use the checklist cards found in some *Magic Origins* booster packs and in *Magic Origins* Prerelease packs. A checklist card acts as a substitute for a double-faced card in hidden zones or wherever its identity is concealed (such as in exile if it's exiled face down). Using checklist cards is optional, but in tournaments, players with double-faced cards must use either checklist cards or opaque card sleeves (or both).


* You must have the actual double-faced card the checklist card is representing with you. The double-faced card should be kept apart from the rest of the deck and your sideboard.
* A checklist card can't be included in a deck except when it's being used to represent a double-faced card.
* You must clearly mark exactly one circle on the checklist card to indicate which double-faced card it represents.
* During the game, a checklist card is considered to be the double-faced card it represents.
* If a checklist card enters a public zone (the battlefield, the graveyard, the stack, or exile unless it's exiled face down), use the actual double-faced card and set the checklist card aside. If the double-faced card is put into a hidden zone (your hand or library), use the checklist card again.
* If a double-faced card is exiled face down or put onto the battlefield face down, keep its identity hidden by using the face-down checklist card or opaque card sleeves (or both).

**New Keyword: Renown**


Renown is a triggered ability that rewards your creatures for striking your enemy, granting them prestige in the form of one or more +1/+1 counters and, sometimes, another ability.


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Valeron+Wardens)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Valeron+Wardens)

> 
> *Valeron Wardens*  
> *2G  
> 
> Creature — Human Monk  
> 
> 1/3  
> 
> Renown 2 (When this creature deals combat damage to a player, if it isn't renowned, put two +1/+1 counters on it and it becomes renowned.)  
> 
> Whenever a creature you control becomes renowned, draw a card.* 
> 
> 
> 


The official rules for renown are as follows:


7702.111. Renown


7702.111a Renown is a triggered ability. "Renown N" means "When this creature deals combat damage to a player, if it isn't renowned, put N +1/+1 counters on it and it becomes renowned."


7702.111b "Renowned" is a designation that has no rules meaning other than to act as a marker that the renown ability and other spells and abilities can identify. Only permanents can be or become renowned. Once a permanent becomes renowned, it stays renowned until it leaves the battlefield. Renowned is neither an ability nor part of the permanent's copiable values.


7702.111c If a creature has multiple instances of renown, each will trigger separately. The first such ability to resolve will cause the creature to become renowned, and subsequent abilities will have no effect (See rule 603.4).


* Renown won't trigger when a creature deals combat damage to a planeswalker or another creature. It also won't trigger when a creature deals noncombat damage to a player.
* If a creature with renown deals combat damage to its controller because that damage was redirected, renown will trigger.
* If a renown ability triggers, but the creature leaves the battlefield before that ability resolves, the creature doesn't become renowned. Any ability that triggers "whenever a creature becomes renowned" won't trigger.



---

**New Ability Word: Spell Mastery**


Spell mastery is a new ability word that appears on some instants and sorceries that improve if there are two or more instant and/or sorcery cards in your graveyard. An ability word appears in italics and has no rules meaning.


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Fiery+Impulse)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fiery+Impulse)

> 
> *Fiery Impulse*  
> *R*  
> *Instant*  
> *Fiery Impulse deals 2 damage to target creature.*  
> *Spell mastery — If there are two or more instant and/or sorcery cards in your graveyard, Fiery Impulse deals 3 damage to that creature instead.*
> 
> 
> 


* Check to see if there are two or more instant and/or sorcery cards in your graveyard as the spell resolves to determine whether the spell mastery ability applies. The spell itself won't count because it's still on the stack as you make this check.
* Some spell mastery abilities cause additional effects to happen, while others replace all or part of the spell's normal effect. See the "Card-Specific Notes" section for more information on specific cards with spell mastery abilities.



---

**New Keyword: Menace**


Some creatures are so frightful that no opposing creature would dare to stand alone against them. Menace is a new keyword that represents an existing ability. A creature with menace can't be blocked except by two or more creatures.


The official rules for menace are as follows:


702.110. Menace


702.110a Menace is an evasion ability.


702.110b A creature with menace can't be blocked except by two or more creatures. (See rule 509, "Declare Blockers Step.")


702.110c Multiple instances of menace on the same creature are redundant.


* Once an attacking creature with menace is legally blocked by two or more creatures, removing one or more of those blockers from combat won't change or undo that block.



---

**Returning Keyword: Prowess**


Starting with *Magic Origins*, prowess is an "evergreen" ability, meaning it may show up in any *Magic* set (although it won't necessarily be in every set going forward). It debuted in *Khans of Tarkir*. Prowess is a keyword that strengthens a creature whenever you cast a noncreature spell.


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Jhessian+Thief)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jhessian+Thief)

> 
> *Jhessian Thief*  
> *2U*  
> *Creature — Human Rogue*  
> *1/3*  
> *Prowess (Whenever you cast a noncreature spell, this creature gets +1/+1 until end of turn.)*  
> *Whenever Jhessian Thief deals combat damage to a player, draw a card.*
> 
> 
> 


The official rules for prowess are as follows:


702.107. Prowess


702.107a Prowess is a triggered ability. "Prowess" means "Whenever you cast a noncreature spell, this creature gets +1/+1 until end of turn."


702.107b If a creature has multiple instances of prowess, each triggers separately.


* Any spell you cast that doesn't have the type creature will cause prowess to trigger. If a spell has multiple types, and one of those types is creature (such as an artifact creature), casting it won't cause prowess to trigger. Playing a land also won't cause prowess to trigger.
* Prowess goes on the stack on top of the spell that caused it to trigger. It will resolve before that spell.
* Once it triggers, prowess isn't connected to the spell that caused it to trigger. If that spell is countered, prowess will still resolve.



---

**Returning Keyword Action: Scry**


Starting with *Magic Origins*, scry is an "evergreen" keyword action, meaning it may show up in any *Magic* set (although it won't necessarily be in every set going forward). Scry most recently appeared in the *Theros* block. Scry lets you get a glimpse of your future and possibly change it.


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Read+the+Bones)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Read+the+Bones)

> 
> *Read the Bones*  
> *2B*  
> *Sorcery*  
> *Scry 2, then draw two cards. You lose 2 life. (To scry 2, look at the top two cards of your library, then put any number of them on the bottom of your library and the rest on top in any order.)*
> 
> 
> 


The official rules for scry are as follows:


701.18. Scry


701.18a To "scry N" means to look at the top N cards of your library, put any number of them on the bottom of your library in any order, and put the rest on top of your library in any order.


* When you scry, you may put all the cards you look at back on top of your library, you may put all of those cards on the bottom of your library, or you may put some of those cards on top and the rest of them on the bottom.
* You choose how to order those cards no matter where you put them.
* You perform the actions stated on a card in sequence. For some spells and abilities, that means you'll scry last. For others, that means you'll scry and then perform other actions.
* Scry appears on some spells and abilities with one or more targets. If all of the spell or ability's targets are illegal when it tries to resolve, it will be countered and none of its effects will happen. You won't scry.



---

**A Note about Trample**


Starting with *Magic Origins*, trample has new reminder text, included below. There is no change to how trample works. The reminder text change is for clarity and brevity.


Trample *(This creature can deal excess combat damage to defending player or planeswalker while attacking.)*




---

**Cycle: "Enemy Pain lands"**


*Magic Origins* includes a cycle of five nonbasic lands that can be tapped for one of two enemy colors.


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Llanowar+Wastes)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Llanowar+Wastes)

> 
> *Llanowar Wastes  
> 
> Land  
> 
> T: Add 1 to your mana pool.  
> 
> T: Add B or G to your mana pool. Llanowar Wastes deals 1 damage to you.* 
> 
> 
> 


* The damage dealt to you is part of the second mana ability. It doesn't use the stack and can't be responded to.
* Like most lands, each land in this cycle is colorless. The damage dealt to you is dealt by a colorless source.



---

**CARD-SPECIFIC NOTES**


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Abbot+of+Keral+Keep)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Abbot+of+Keral+Keep)

> 
> *Abbot of Keral Keep  
>

> 
> Creature — Human Monk  
> 
> 2/1  
> 
> Prowess (Whenever you cast a noncreature spell, this creature gets +1/+1 until end of turn.)  
> 
> When Abbot of Keral Keep enters the battlefield, exile the top card of your library. Until end of turn, you may play that card.* 
> 
> 
> 


* The card exiled by Abbot of Keral Keep's ability is exiled face up.
* You may play that card that turn even if Abbot of Keral Keep is no longer on the battlefield or under your control.
* Playing the card exiled with Abbot of Keral Keep's ability follows the normal rules for playing that card. You must pay its costs, and you must follow all applicable timing rules. For example, if the card is a creature card, you can cast that card by paying its mana cost only during your main phase while the stack is empty.
* Unless an effect allows you to play additional lands that turn, you can play a land card exiled with Abbot of Keral Keep's ability only if you haven't played a land yet that turn.
* If you don't play the card, it will remain exiled.

[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Acolyte+of+the+Inferno)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Acolyte+of+the+Inferno)

> 
> Whenever Acolyte of the Inferno becomes blocked by a creature, it deals 2 damage to that creature.* 
> 
> 
> 


* Acolyte of the Inferno's last ability will trigger once for each creature that blocks it. Each of those creatures will be dealt 2 damage.
* Acolyte of the Inferno's last ability triggers and resolves before combat damage is dealt. If that causes each creature blocking Acolyte of the Inferno to be destroyed, Acolyte of the Inferno will remain blocked and neither deal nor be dealt combat damage.

> Sorcery

> Gain control of target creature until end of turn. Untap that creature. It gains haste until end of turn. (It can attack and tap this turn.)* 
> 
> 
> 


* Act of Treason can target any creature, even one that's untapped or one you already control.
* Gaining control of a creature doesn't cause you to gain control of any Auras or Equipment attached to it.

> 
> G  
> 
> Instant  
> 
> Aerial Volley deals 3 damage divided as you choose among one, two, or three target creatures with flying.* 
> 
> 
> 


* You choose how many targets Aerial Volley has and how the damage is divided as you cast the spell. Each target must receive at least 1 damage.
* If some (but not all) of the targets become illegal before Aerial Volley tries to resolve, the original division of damage still applies, but no damage is dealt to illegal targets. If all targets become illegal, Aerial Volley will be countered.

[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Alchemist%27s+Vial)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Alchemist%27s+Vial)

>

> 
> 
> 


* Activating the last ability of Alchemist's Vial targeting a creature that's already attacking or blocking won't cause that creature to stop attacking or blocking. In some unusual cases, it will prevent that creature from attacking or blocking in any additional combat phases the turn may have.

[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Alhammarret%2C+High+Arbiter)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Alhammarret%2C+High+Arbiter)

> 
> 5UU  
>

> 
> 5/5  
> 
> Flying  
> 
> As Alhammarret, High Arbiter enters the battlefield, each opponent reveals his or her hand. You choose the name of a nonland card revealed this way.  
> 
> Your opponents can't cast spells with the chosen name (as long as this creature is on the battlefield).* 
> 
> 
> 


* Alhammarret's second ability happens as Alhammarret enters the battlefield. No one can cast spells or activate abilities between the time a card is named and the time that Alhammarret's last ability starts to work.
* You choose one card name, not one name per opponent.
* Although spells with the chosen name can't be cast, permanent cards with that name can still be put onto the battlefield by a spell or ability.
* If your opponents have no nonland cards in their hands, you can't choose a card name. Alhammarret's last ability won't stop any spells from being cast in that case.
* Your opponents can still cast a card with the chosen name face down if it has a morph ability. A card with the chosen name can also be manifested.

[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Alhammarret%27s+Archive)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Alhammarret%27s+Archive)

> If you would gain life, you gain twice that much life instead.  
> 
> If you would draw a card except the first one you draw in each of your draw steps, draw two cards instead.* 
> 
> 
> 


* If an effect would set your life total to a specific number that's higher than your current life total, that effect would cause you to gain life equal to the difference. Alhammarret's Archive will then double the amount of life that effect would cause you to gain. For example, if you have 3 life and an effect says that your life total "becomes 10," your life total will actually become 17.
* If two or more replacement effects would apply to a card-drawing event, the player drawing the card chooses the order in which to apply them.
* Because Alhammarret's Archive is legendary, it's unlikely that one player will control two. However, if that happens, life gained by that player will be multiplied by four. Three Archives will multiply that life gain by eight, and so on.
* Similarly, the effects of the last abilities of multiple Archives are cumulative. If you control two, you'll draw four times the number of cards, and so on.
* In a Two-Headed Giant game, only the controller of Alhammarret's Archive is affected by it. If that player's teammate gains life, Alhammarret's Archive will have no effect, even when that life gain is applied to the team's shared life total.

> Whenever a creature enters the battlefield under your control, you may have Angel's Tomb become a 3/3 white Angel artifact creature with flying until end of turn.* 
> 
> 
> 


* If Angel's Tomb is already a creature when a creature enters the battlefield under your control, its ability will override any effects that set its base power and toughness to specific values, but other changes to its power and toughness (such as the one created by [Titanic Growth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Titanic+Growth)) will still apply.
* Effects setting Angel's Tomb's base power and toughness to specific values that begin to apply after Angel's Tomb has become a creature will override the effect of Angel's Tomb. For example, if an effect causes a 3/3 Angel's Tomb to become 0/1, it will remain 0/1 until another effect (such as triggering the ability of Angel's Tomb a second time or targeting it with [Titanic Growth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Titanic+Growth)) causes those values to change.

Creatures can attack planeswalkers controlled by that player's teammate without having to pay this cost.

* Although Bonded Construct can't attack alone, other attacking creatures don't have to attack the same player or planeswalker. For example, Bonded Construct could attack an opponent and another creature could attack a planeswalker that opponent controls.
* If a creature that can't attack alone also must attack if able, its controller must attack with it and another creature if able.
* In a Two-Headed Giant game (or in another format using the shared team turns option), Bonded Construct can attack with a creature controlled by your teammate, even if no other creatures you control attack.

* Call of the Full Moon's last ability will look at the entire previous turn, even if Call of the Moon wasn't on the battlefield for some or all of that turn.

* Celestial Flare targets only a player, not any creature. A creature with hexproof or protection from white can be sacrificed this way, for example.
* If the player sacrifices a blocking creature, any attacking creature it was blocking remains blocked. Unless that creature has trample or is being blocked by another creature, it won't deal combat damage.
* Creatures continue to be attacking or blocking creatures through the end of the combat step. It is possible to cast Celestial Flare within combat but after combat damage is dealt (specifically, during the combat damage step or the end of combat step). Only attacking and blocking creatures that survived combat damage can be sacrificed at this time.

* Chandra, Fire of Kaladesh's activated ability will count any damage Chandra has dealt during the turn to any permanent or player, including combat damage.
* The last sentence of Chandra, Fire of Kaladesh's activated ability isn't a separate ability. The check happens only as that activated ability resolves. You must activate the ability in order to exile Chandra and return her to the battlefield transformed, even if Chandra has already dealt 3 or more damage during the turn.
* The emblem created by Chandra, Roaring Flame is colorless. The damage it deals is from a colorless source.
* Only players actually dealt damage by the third ability of Chandra, Roaring Flame will get an emblem. If all of that damage to a player is prevented, that player won't get an emblem. If any of that damage is redirected to Chandra's controller, that player will get an emblem.
* Each player who gets Chandra's emblem is the owner of that emblem. In multiplayer games, that emblem will remain in the game as long as its owner does, even if Chandra's owner leaves the game.

* Use the power of the target creature as Chandra's Ignition resolves to determine how much damage it deals to each other creature and each opponent.
* If the creature becomes an illegal target by the time Chandra's Ignition tries to resolve (perhaps because another player controls it or it's left the battlefield), Chandra's Ignition will be countered and none of its effects will happen. No damage will be dealt.

* Ending the turn this way means the following things happen in order: 1) All spells and abilities on the stack are exiled. This includes spells and abilities that can't be countered. 2) If there are any attacking and blocking creatures, they're removed from combat. 3) State-based actions are checked. No player gets priority, and no triggered abilities are put onto the stack. 4) The current phase and/or step ends. The game skips straight to the cleanup step. 5) The cleanup step happens in its entirety.
* If any triggered abilities do trigger during this process, they're put onto the stack during the cleanup step. If this happens, players will have a chance to cast spells and activate abilities, then there will be another cleanup step before the turn ends.
* However, any abilities that trigger before the "end the turn" process begins, such as an ability that triggers whenever you draw a card, won't be put into the stack. Those abilities won't happen at a later time.
* Though other spells and abilities that are exiled won't get a chance to resolve, they don't count as being countered.
* Any "at the beginning of the next end step" triggered abilities won't get the chance to trigger that turn because the end step is skipped. Those abilities will trigger at the beginning of the end step of the next turn. The same is true of abilities that trigger at the beginning of other phases or steps.
* If both your hand and graveyard are empty as Day's Undoing starts resolving, you'll still shuffle your library before drawing seven cards.

* You choose the mode as the triggered ability goes on the stack. You can choose a mode that requires targets only if there are legal targets available.
* If the ability is countered (either for having its target become illegal or because a spell or ability counters it), the mode chosen for that instance of the ability still counts as being chosen.
* The phrase "that hasn't been chosen" refers only to that specific Demonic Pact. If you control one and cast another one, you can choose any mode for the second one the first time its ability triggers.
* It doesn't matter who has chosen any particular mode. For example, say you control Demonic Pact and have chosen the first two modes. If an opponent gains control of Demonic Pact, that player can choose only the third or fourth mode.
* In some very unusual situations, you may not be able to choose a mode, either because all modes have previously been chosen or the only remaining modes require targets and there are no legal targets available. In this case, the ability is simply removed from the stack with no effect.
* Yes, if the fourth mode is the only one remaining, you must choose it. You read the whole contract, right?

If, at that time, you don't control another creature named Faerie Miscreant, the ability will have no effect.

* The token copies exactly what's printed on the original creature and nothing else (unless that creature is copying something else; see below). It doesn't copy whether that creature is tapped or untapped, whether it has any counters on it or Auras and Equipment attached to it, or any non-copy effects that have changed its power, toughness, types, color, and so on.
* If the copied creature has X in its mana cost, X is 0.
* If the copied creature is copying something else when the ability resolves, then the token enters the battlefield as a copy of whatever that creature is copying.
* Any enters-the-battlefield abilities of the copied creature will trigger when the token enters the battlefield. Any "as [this permanent] enters the battlefield" or "[this permanent] enters the battlefield with" abilities of the copied creature will also work.
* The token is exiled at the beginning of the next end step regardless of who controls it at that time.
* If the ability resolves during a turn's end step, the token will be exiled at the beginning of the next turn's end step.
* If the token isn't exiled at the beginning of the next end step (perhaps because the delayed triggered ability is countered), it remains on the battlefield indefinitely. It continues to have haste.
* If another creature becomes or enters the battlefield as a copy of the token, that creature won't have haste and it won't be exiled.

> 
> 
> 


* Kytheon's first ability will count creatures that attacked but are no longer on the battlefield (perhaps because they didn't survive combat damage being dealt). It will not count any creatures that were put onto the battlefield attacking, as those creatures were never declared as attackers.
* Gideon's first ability causes a creature to attack him if able. If, during its controller's declare attackers step, that creature is tapped, is affected by a spell or ability that says it can't attack, or hasn't been under its controller's control continuously since that player's turn began, then that creature doesn't attack. If there's a cost associated with having that creature attack, its controller isn't forced to pay that cost. If he or she doesn't, the creature doesn't have to attack.
* If Gideon can't be attacked, perhaps because he has left the battlefield before the creature's controller's next combat, the creature can attack you or another planeswalker you control, or its controller can choose to have it not attack at all.
* If the creature targeted by Gideon's first ability changes controllers before it has the chance to attack Gideon, the ability will apply to it during its new controller's next turn.
* If Gideon becomes a creature due to his third ability, that doesn't count as having a creature enter the battlefield. Gideon was already on the battlefield; he only changed his types. Abilities that trigger whenever a creature enters the battlefield won't trigger.
* Gideon's third ability causes him to become a creature with the creature types Human Soldier. He remains a planeswalker with the planeswalker type Gideon. (He also retains any other card types or subtypes he may have had.) Each subtype is correlated to the proper card type: Gideon is just a planeswalker type (not a creature type), and Human and Soldier are just creature types (not planeswalker types).
* If you activate Gideon's third ability and then damage is dealt to him that can't be prevented, that damage has all applicable results: specifically, the damage is marked on Gideon (since he's a creature) and that damage causes that many loyalty counters to be removed from him (since he's a planeswalker). If Gideon has no loyalty counters on him, he's put into his owner's graveyard as a state-based action. (As long as he still has indestructible, the marked damage won't cause him to be destroyed.)
* Say you activate Gideon's third ability, then an opponent gains control of him before combat. You may have any of your creatures attack Gideon (since he's still a planeswalker). Then Gideon may block (since he's a creature). He may block any eligible attacking creature, including one that's attacking him. During combat, he behaves as an attacked planeswalker and/or a blocking creature, as appropriate. For example, he deals combat damage to any creatures he's blocking, but he doesn't deal combat damage to any unblocked creatures that are attacking him.

* The number of cards you draw is equal to the number of permanents on the battlefield that you shuffle into your library plus the number of cards from your hand that you shuffle into your library.
* A token is owned by the player under whose control it entered the battlefield. Tokens shuffled into a library count toward the number of cards drawn, though they cease to exist upon becoming part of a library. Regardless of what you're using to represent tokens, you won't shuffle that physical object into your library.
* If a player is required to draw more cards than his or her library contains, that player loses the game. If all players lose the game this way, the game is a draw.
* As The Great Aurora resolves, first you choose any number of land cards in your hand to put onto the battlefield, and then each other player in turn order does the same. The lands enter the battlefield simultaneously.

* The value of each X in Hangarback Walker's mana cost must be equal. For example, if X is 2, you'll pay 4 to cast Hangarback Walker and it will enter the battlefield with two +1/+1 counters on it.
* If enough -1/-1 counters are put on Hangarback Walker at the same time to make its toughness 0 or less, the number of +1/+1 counters on it before it got any -1/-1 counters will be used to determine how many Thopter tokens you get. For example, if there are three +1/+1 counters on Hangarback Walker and it gets four -1/-1 counters, you'll get three Thopter tokens. That's because Hangarback Walker's triggered ability checks the creature's existence just before it leaves the battlefield, and it still has all those counters on it at that point.

* Hixus's ability causes a zone change with a duration, a style of ability that's somewhat reminiscent of older cards like Oblivion Ring. However, unlike Oblivion Ring, cards like Hixus have a single ability that creates two one-shot effects: one that exiles the creature when the ability resolves, and another that returns the exiled card to the battlefield immediately after Hixus leaves the battlefield.
* If Hixus leaves the battlefield before its triggered ability resolves, the creature that dealt combat damage to you won't be exiled.
* Auras attached to the exiled creatures will be put into their owners' graveyards. Equipment attached to the exiled creatures will become unattached and remain on the battlefield. Any counters on the exiled creatures will cease to exist.
* If a creature token is exiled, it ceases to exist. It won't be returned to the battlefield.
* The exiled cards return to the battlefield immediately after Hixus leaves the battlefield. Nothing happens between the two events, including state-based actions.
* In a multiplayer game, if Hixus's owner leaves the game, the exiled cards will return to the battlefield. Because the one-shot effect that returns the cards isn't an ability that goes on the stack, it won't cease to exist along with the leaving player's spells and abilities on the stack.

* The activated ability of Jace, Vryn's Prodigy checks to see if there are five or more cards in your graveyard after you discard a card. Putting a fifth card into your graveyard at other times won't cause Jace to be exiled, nor will Jace entering the battlefield while there are five or more cards in your graveyard.
* If you activate the second ability of Jace, Telepath Unbound, you must follow the timing rules for the card's types. For example, if you target a sorcery card, you may cast it during your main phase when the stack is empty. You pay all the spell's costs.
* If you don't cast the card that turn, nothing happens. It remains in your graveyard.
* The card is exiled only if it's cast from the graveyard and put back into the graveyard (either by resolving or being countered). If, at any time, the card goes to a hidden zone (such as your hand or your library), the effect loses track of the card. It won't be exiled, even if that card is put into your graveyard later that turn.

* Knight of the White Orchid's triggered ability has an "intervening ‘if' clause." That means (1) the ability won't trigger at all unless one of your opponents controls more lands than you, and (2) the ability will do nothing if you control at least as many lands as each of your opponents by the time it resolves.
* The Plains you search for doesn't have to be basic. For example, you could put a [Sacred Foundry](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sacred+Foundry) onto the battlefield.

* If multiple nontoken creatures you control die, then Liliana, Heretical Healer's ability will trigger that many times.

No one sees what the other players are discarding before deciding which card to discard.

* If Psychic Rebuttal creates a copy of the spell, you control the copy. That copy is created on the stack, so it's not "cast." Abilities that trigger when a player casts a spell won't trigger. The copy will then resolve like a normal spell, after players get a chance to cast spells and activate abilities.
* The copy will have the same targets as the spell it's copying unless you choose new ones. You may change any number of the targets, including all of them or none of them.

* If the spell mastery ability applies and a creature affected by Send to Sleep changes controllers before its old controller's next untap step, Send to Sleep will prevent it from becoming untapped during its new controller's next untap step.
* Send to Sleep can target tapped creatures. If a targeted creature is already tapped when the spell resolves (and the spell mastery ability applies), that creature remains tapped and doesn't untap during its controller's next untap step.
* If you chose two targets and one is an illegal target when Send to Sleep resolves, that creature won't become tapped and it won't be stopped from untapping during its controller's next untap step (if the spell mastery ability applies). It won't be affected by Send to Sleep in any way.

* When you cast an Aura spell, you have to choose a target for it before this ability puts an Angel token onto the battlefield. In other words, you can't cast an Aura spell intending to enchant the Angel that will be created as a result.
* Casting Sigil of the Empty Throne won't trigger its own ability. It has to be on the battlefield for its ability to work.

* A creature attacks alone if it's the only creature declared as an attacker during the declare attackers step (including creatures controlled by your teammates, if applicable). For example, Sigil of Valor's ability won't trigger if you attack with multiple creatures and all but one of them are removed from combat.

* Note that if an Aura is returned to the battlefield this way, whatever the Aura enchants isn't a target of Starfield of Nyx's ability, nor is it a target of the Aura card itself. You could put an Aura onto the battlefield this way enchanting a creature with hexproof controlled by an opponent, for example.
* A noncreature permanent that turns into a creature can attack, and its T abilities can be activated, only if its controller has continuously controlled that permanent since the beginning of his or her most recent turn. It doesn't matter how long the permanent has been a creature.

* If more than one replacement effect tries to apply to a life gain event, the player who would gain life chooses the order in which they apply. For example, if a player who controls Alhammarret's Archive would gain 3 life while Tainted Remedy is on the battlefield, that player may choose to have the 3 life become doubled to 6 life and then lose 6 life. The player may also choose to apply Tainted Remedy first, turning "gain 3 life" into "lose 3 life." Alhammarret's Archive would then not apply.
* Having more than one Tainted Remedy on the battlefield doesn't have any noticeable effect on life gain. Once the effect of one Tainted Remedy applies, there is no life gain for the others to apply to.

>

* If the spell mastery ability applies, you'll cast the two cards in order. The one you cast last will be the one that resolves first.
* You cast the instant and/or sorcery card(s) from your opponent's library as Talent of the Telepath is resolving. Ignore timing restrictions based on the card's type. Other timing restrictions, such as "Cast [this card] only during combat," must be followed.
* The cards will be put into their owner's graveyard after they resolve, not yours.
* If you can't cast any instant or sorcery cards (perhaps because there are no legal targets available) or if you choose not to cast one, then Talent of the Telepath finishes resolving. Any of the revealed cards you didn't cast will be put into that player's graveyard.
* If you cast a card "without paying its mana cost," you can't pay any alternative costs. You can pay additional costs such as kicker costs. If the card has mandatory additional costs, you must pay those.

* Thopter Spy Network's first ability has an "intervening ‘if' clause." That means (1) the ability won't trigger at all unless you control an artifact as your upkeep begins, and (2) the ability will do nothing if you don't control an artifact as it resolves.
* The last ability will trigger, at most, once per combat damage step. However, if at least one artifact creature you control has first strike and others don't, or if an artifact creature you control has double strike, the ability could trigger twice per combat: once in each combat damage step.

* Throwing Knife's triggered ability triggers before blockers are declared. If you use the ability and destroy the targeted creature with lethal damage, it won't be on the battlefield to block.
* Throwing Knife is the source of the damage dealt because of its triggered ability. For example, you could sacrifice Throwing Knife to deal 2 damage to a creature with protection from red, even if Throwing Knife is equipped to a red creature.

* None of the chosen permanents are targets of Tragic Arrogance.
* If a permanent has more than one of the affected types, it can count for any of them. For example, you could choose an artifact creature as the artifact you're sparing, another creature as the creature, and an enchantment creature as the enchantment. Similarly, you could choose an enchantment creature as both the creature and the enchantment that you're sparing, even if the player controls another creature and/or another enchantment.

* The creature will lose all other colors and creature types, but it will retain any other card types (such as artifact) or supertypes (such as legendary) it may have.
* Turn to Frog overwrites all previous effects that set the creature's base power and toughness to specific values. Any power- or toughness-setting effects that start to apply after Turn to Frog resolves will overwrite this effect.
* Turn to Frog doesn't counter abilities that have already triggered or been activated. In particular, there is no way to cast this spell to stop a creature's ability that says "At the beginning of your upkeep," "When this creature enters the battlefield," or similar from triggering.
* If the affected creature gains an ability after Turn to Frog resolves, it will keep that ability.
* Effects that modify a creature's power and/or toughness, such as the effect of [Titanic Growth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Titanic+Growth), will apply to the creature no matter when they started to take effect. The same is true for any counters that change its power and/or toughness and effects that switch its power and toughness.
