November 28, 2014
 










Wizards of the Coast LLC has ended its organized play relationship with Gordian Knot Games LTD.



We continue to work with our organized play licensees to deliver the best gaming experiences to *Magic: The Gathering* players at Grand Prix across Europe. Regretfully, Gordian Knot Games and Wizards of the Coast are going in separate directions, but we would like to take this opportunity to thank them for the many years that they have contributed to the *Magic* community and wish them all the best with their future endeavors.



Grand Prix events planned for 2015 in Liverpool, Copenhagen, London, and Prague will take place as scheduled. Wizards of the Coast is working with other licensees to ensure a smooth transition and that they are run at the high standard our players deserve.
