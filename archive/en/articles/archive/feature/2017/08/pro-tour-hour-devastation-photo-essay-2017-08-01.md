We didn't just give out one trophy this weekend—we handed out a bunch of awards! Check out [this summary from Marc Calderaro](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/pthou/2016-17-player-and-rookie-of-the-year-champions-2017-07-30), posted yesterday, for the full list.



![The players have come, all snug in their chairs, in hopes that their 75 would get them there.](https://media.wizards.com/2017/images/daily/FEAT20170801_1B.jpg)*The players have come, all snug in their chairs, in hopes that their 75 would get them there.*
About 460 players in total came to Kyoto, Japan. About [one fourth of those were playing a deck we dubbed Ramunap Red](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/pthou/pthou-day-1-standard-metagame-breakdown-2017-07-28)!



![Coverage had come, cardigans aplenty, and Draft decks for birding. Boy it was sweaty!](https://media.wizards.com/2017/images/daily/FEAT20170801_2.jpg)*Coverage had come, cardigans aplenty, and Draft decks for birding. Boy it was sweaty!*
(Sorry, Marc. You were great and always hygienic.)


There are a ton of people who work behind the scenes, not just on coverage, but to make the tournament and the broadcast happen. Sometimes we pop up on camera, especially when recording drafts.



![When early on, there arose such a clatter! There was Martin Jůza, now named the Draft Master!](https://media.wizards.com/2017/images/daily/FEAT20170801_3.jpg)*When early on, there arose such a clatter! There was Martin Jůza, now named the Draft Master!*
[Voted into the Hall of Fame](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/pthou/introducing-2017-class-pro-tour-hall-fame-2017-07-27), and secured [his invite to the World Championship thanks to his drafting prowess](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/pthou/draft-master-final-leg-and-winners-interview-2017-07-28). I'd say Martin Jůza had a good weekend.



![Coverage sprung to—um—the couch? And checked their phones, oh they did, in hopes that someone would tweet 'bout their threads.](https://media.wizards.com/2017/images/daily/FEAT20170801_4.jpg)*Coverage sprung to—um—the couch?

Sometimes we need breaks too. Classy black and white breaks.

The crowd went wild when Yam Wing Chun clinched his Top 8 berth. He provided plenty of drama on the way to his semifinals finish.



![Focused were they, those who played in the Top 8. Their headphones let them focus—winning their mandate!](https://media.wizards.com/2017/images/daily/FEAT20170801_6.jpg)*Focused were they, those who played in the Top 8. Their headphones on snuggly—winning their mandate!*
Seth Manfield fell in the quarterfinals to Paulo Vitor Damo da Rosa in [one of the most amazing comebacks in Pro Tour history](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/162998435).



![The crowd, they did cheer, as their friends moved on! Dash away, dash away, dash away, Yam!](https://media.wizards.com/2017/images/daily/FEAT20170801_7.jpg)*The crowd they did cheer, as their friends moved on! Dash away, dash away, dash away, Yam!*
Yam Wing Chun provided [one of the most heartbreaking moments at the Pro Tour](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/163055319), but up till then, he gave his friends plenty of reasons to cheer.



![Twas Pardee who appeared to challenge the best; toward Worlds they will go, it is not a jest!](https://media.wizards.com/2017/images/daily/FEAT20170801_8.jpg)*Twas Pardee who appeared to challenge the best; toward Worlds they will go, it is not a jest!*
With their trips to the finals, Sam Pardee and Paulo Vitor Damo da Rosa further secured their spots at the World Championship in Boston!



![But who to our wondering eyes should appear? Paulo Vitor Damo da Rosa, your Player of the Year!](https://media.wizards.com/2017/images/daily/FEAT20170801_9.jpg)*But who to our wondering eyes should appear? Paulo Vitor Damo da Rosa, your Player of the Year!  

And Pro Tour Champion!  

And World Championship Competitor!  

And World*Magic *Cup captain!  

Bash away, bash away, bash away Paulo!*
By winning the Pro Tour—his second victory in his twelfth Pro Tour Top 8—Paulo claimed a slew of awards. Pro Tour Champion, yes, but only first place could earn him Player of the Year—a title he's never earned before but now carries. And, of course, he'll represent his country, Brazil, at the World *Magic* Cup, and he'll be competing at the World Championship.


Congratulations to Paulo Vitor Damo da Rosa, Champion of Pro Tour *Hour of Devastation*!
