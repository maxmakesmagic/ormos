Did you know that you can now listen to live streaming audio of the commentary of [Pro Tour](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/daily/mr110-pt) finals coverage on the event coverage page? If you like Randy's column, try listening to him do live coverage along with some of today's top pros (most often with [Brian Kibler](/en/articles/archive/making-magic/free-association-2004-02-05-5) and thus far, never with the "Potato".)
