Player Information
------------------


**Team Formation**


Players who qualify to compete in Pro Tour 25th Anniversary must compete as a team of three for this event. Players can qualify via two methods:


* As a team: players who qualify this way are committed to playing with a team of three, and are already displayed on the Team Invitation list\*
* As an individual: players who qualify for this Pro Tour and are not committed to playing with a specific team of three, and may form a team of three with anyone on the Individuals Invitation List

\*Players who qualified as a team but are part of a Team Series roster and choose to play with other members of their team roster instead of the the team they qualified with for this Pro Tour. If a player chooses to do this, they must notify [premierplay@wizards.com](mailto:premierplay@wizards.com) by Friday, June 8, 2018 with the Team Series team members they intend to form a team of three with. Should a player who qualified as a team do this, the other players that they qualified as a team with will be moved to the Individuals Invitation List. 


Players who did not qualify as a team must submit to [premierplay@wizards.com](mailto:premierplay@wizards.com) their team of three players that they will be forming a team with no later than **July 5, 2018**(no exceptions). Players on a submitted team must be included on the email and must confirm via email that they agree to play as a team.


Means of qualifying as a team and as an individual are detailed in the Team Invitation List and Individual Invitation list, as well as in the [*Magic*Premier Event Invitation Policy](https://wpn.wizards.com/en/document/magic-premier-event-invitation-policy).
