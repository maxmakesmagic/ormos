Players and teams from all over the world have been spending the first month of 2017 preparing for a shaken-up Standard format and the *Aether Revolt*–recharged Booster Draft format for the three-day tournament excitement of [Pro Tour *Aether Revolt*](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/ptaer), which takes place this weekend starting on February 3 in Dublin, Ireland!


As deck-building options opened up with the early exits of [Smuggler's Copter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Smuggler%27s+Copter); [Reflector Mage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reflector+Mage); and [Emrakul, the Promised End](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Emrakul%2C+the+Promised+End), this Pro Tour is expected to be an exciting one. We'll see what ascends to the top as the best players on earth battle for their share of $250,000!


As is customary, today's article serves as a quick guide that should answer any questions you may have on what to expect from this weekend.


Pro Tour *Aether Revolt* Basics
===============================


Here's the general overview of Pro Tour *Aether Revolt*:


* The Pro Tour is a three-day, invitation-only event featuring some of the best *Magic* pros, top Grand Prix finishers, Hall of Famers, and players who found success in December's Regional Pro Tour Qualifiers. Those players will be competing for a share of the $250,000 prize pool, with $50,000 going to the winner along with an invitation to the 2017 *Magic: The Gathering* World Championship. Pro Tour *Aether Revolt* is the second of four Pro Tours in the 2016–17 season.
* The formats for Friday and Saturday are three rounds of Booster Draft—using two *Aether Revolt* booster packs and one *Kaladesh* booster pack, in that order—and five rounds of Standard Constructed. All matches on Friday and Saturday are best-two-out-of-three games.
* The following sets are legal in Standard Constructed for this tournament: *Battle for Zendikar*, *Oath of the Gatewatch*, *Shadows over Innistrad*, *Eldritch Moon*, *Kaladesh*, and *Aether Revolt*.
* The following cards were recently banned in Standard Constructed, and cannot be used by players: [Smuggler's Copter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Smuggler%27s+Copter); [Reflector Mage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reflector+Mage); and [Emrakul, the Promised End](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Emrakul%2C+the+Promised+End).
* All players with 12 or more match points (a 4-4 record or better) at the end of the first day will advance to Day Two of the competition.
* The Top 8 players at the end of Day Two will advance to Sunday's playoff, featuring a modified single-elimination playoff, which you can see for yourself.

* In this modified bracket, the fifth through eighth seeds all start in the first stage of the quarterfinals. Third and fourth seed at the end of Day Two advance to the second stage of the quarterfinals. The top two seeds at the end of Day Two automatically advance to the semifinals. Do well after two days, and you guarantee yourself a minimum of $15,000, and you'll only be two matches away from winning the whole thing!
* All matches played on Sunday are best-three-out-of-five, with the first two games featuring pre-sideboard action.
* The winner gets $50,000, Platinum status in the Pro Tour Players Club (which will give that player invitations with airfare and appearance fees through the 2016–17 and 2017–18 seasons), and an invitation to the 2017 *Magic: The Gathering* World Championship.

That's the gist of what you can expect from the Pro Tour as a tournament. Now, what about coverage?
