He's been involved in competitive Magic since the beginning of the Pro Tour, and has made a career out of consistent finishes. The respect from his peers, suggesting that he will be the man to finally bring a Pro Tour title home to Japan, speaks volumes about his talent. His opponent, Osamu Fujita, is of course the "Silver Collector". Fujita just added $20,000 worth of silver to his mantle with a second place finish at Pro Tour Amsterdam last week. He's carried that momentum back to Japan, as he started off day one of this event at 8-0. Ishida is the only other undefeated player in the tournament, so the winner here will be the lone competitor without a loss.

### Game 1

Ishida played a first turn [Careful Study](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Careful+Study), discarding [Phantom Nishoba](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phantom+Nishoba) and [Duress](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress). [Exhume](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Exhume) brought it out on turn two, and Fujita's Goblins couldn't possibly fight off the life gaining monster. It attacked, and a second one came into play on the following turn via [Reanimate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reanimate) to clinch the game.

Ishida- 1 Fujita- 0

### Game 2

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gpoka04/r9fm1en2.jpg)This game was more bad news for Fujita, as Ishida cast [Careful Study](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Careful+Study), discarded a Nishoba, and brought it back with [Exhume](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Exhume). Fujita had out two Prospectors and a [Sparksmith](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sparksmith) at this point, and played [Goblin Sledder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Sledder). When the Nishoba attacked and damage was on the stack, [Blood Frenzy](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Frenzy) killed it off. Ishida seemed to be in a little trouble, but played [Powder Keg](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Powder+Keg) to fend off the Goblin attack. Fujita attacked with his team to deal four damage, and played [Goblin Matron](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Matron) to search up [Siege-Gang Commander](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Siege-Gang+Commander). Ishida cast [Vampiric Tutor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vampiric+Tutor) followed by [Careful Study](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Careful+Study), discarding Akroma. The Keg burst for one, leaving Fujita with [Sparksmith](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sparksmith) and a Matron, with the Commander coming out right away. Ishida played another Tutor, untapped, and [Reanimate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reanimate)d Akroma right into play. It seemed Ishida was in danger from a counterattack, but he had been planning things out. Now that he had his indestructible creature out and swinging, he played [Energy Field](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Energy+Field) to ensure he'd be safe while she did the rest.

Ishida- 2 Fujita- 0
