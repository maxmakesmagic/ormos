[Download **Magic Online**](https://accounts.onlinegaming.wizards.com/)Have you played the latest **Magic Online** Cube yet? We brought it back last week and it's here until February 12, 2014. With additions from *Theros* such as [Daxos of Meletis](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Daxos+of+Meletis) and [Thassa, God of the Sea](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thassa%2C+God+of+the+Sea) among many others, be sure to get in a draft and play with the latest iteration of our cube!

**What is the Magic Online Cube?**  
 The Cube is a special selection of 720 single **Magic** cards, no duplicates, that is assembled by Ramp;D. At the end of this article, you will find the cards that have changed. These cards are randomly divided into Cube booster packs that are used to run Draft and Sealed events in **Magic Online**. The cards in the **Magic Online** Cube are changed regularly, with new cards replacing some cards in the past Cube.

Want to know more about the events? [Visit MTGO.com](http://staging.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/other/01202014) and read Mike Turian's article about this latest iteration of the Cube.
