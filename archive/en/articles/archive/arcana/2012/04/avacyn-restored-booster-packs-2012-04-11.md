As a large set, *Avacyn Restored* has 244 cards. And it's got five different images that adorn its booster packs. Let's take a look at them!

This one can't come as a surprise. It's Avacyn, Angel of Hope.

And this, of course, is Avacyn's old Helvault-mate Griselbrand. Everything's in order so far. Perfectly logical.

This appears to be an angel of some sort. That's not all that surprising in this set, right?

Whoa! This doesn't look familiar at *all*!
