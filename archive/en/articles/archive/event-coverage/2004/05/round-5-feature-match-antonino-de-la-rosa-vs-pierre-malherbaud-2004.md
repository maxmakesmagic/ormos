![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gpbru04/fm4_1.jpg)During shuffling Antonino asked Pierre what he thinks of the format to which Pierre just shrugged and replies:" I quit playing magic a couple of months ago so I have no clue. I didn't even playtest."


### Game 1


Antonino kicks things off with a first turn [Birds of Paradise](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Birds+of+Paradise) and second turn [Wirewood Symbiote](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wirewood+Symbiote) and [Vine Trellis](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vine+Trellis), quite a good start.  

When Pierre plays a turn 1 [Goblin Sledder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Sledder) Antonino comments that the Goblin deck is a good deck to play if you haven't playtested.


On his second turn Pierre thinks for some time and finally decides to cycle a Gempalm Incinnerator targeting the Symbiote. [Vernal Bloom](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vernal+Bloom) comes down on turn 3 for Antonino, which enables him to cast a [Triskelion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Triskelion) next turn. This is bad news for Pierre since he has just cast a [Goblin Warchief](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Warchief) and [Goblin Sledder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Sledder). Those creatures died to the [Triskelion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Triskelion) but after this very explosive start from Antonino he seems to be out of gas.


"This is so unlike me, usually I attack" looking down on his double [Vine Trellis](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vine+Trellis)m double [Wood Elves](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wood+Elves) team.


Pierre on the other hand is just doing fine with [Goblin Piledriver](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Piledriver), [Goblin Sledder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Sledder) and a Siege-gang commander. Antonino's last out at the moment is a [Tooth and Nail](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tooth+and+Nail) but when he tries "clamp" his [Wirewood Symbiote](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wirewood+Symbiote) his Skullclamp gets shattered, and so do Antonino's hopes of winning game 1.


1-0 to Pierre


In between games Antonino askes if Pierre likes his matcup to which Pierre starts laughing and says: "I have no clue. I draw some cards, I play some cards and I'm winning. People say it's a good matchup though."


### Game 2


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gpbru04/fm4_2.jpg)Unlike game 1, things started off a bit slower this game with no turn 1 plays by either player. Again [Vernal Bloom](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vernal+Bloom) comes down turn 3 for Antonino with the help of a [Rampant Growth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rampant+Growth) this time. Pierre has a sweet Goblin opener with a Piledriver and a Warchief. Again Antonino did have an answer though in [Pyroclasm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyroclasm).  

Antonino gets a little aggravated when Pierre is able to rebuild his forces after the clasm and once more the American from Italy fails to draw any business, either [Triskelion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Triskelion) or [Tooth and Nail](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tooth+and+Nail). A couple of turns later, and some little Elves, the Goblins have taken the match for Pierre Malherbaud.


2-0 Pierre Malherbaud
