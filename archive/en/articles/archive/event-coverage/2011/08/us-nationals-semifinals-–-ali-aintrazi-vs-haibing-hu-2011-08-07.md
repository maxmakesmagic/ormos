This semifinals match showcased a couple of things that I was excited to see. First, there was the obvious inclusion of Ali Aintrazi's UB deck, the only non-CawBlade deck left in the Top 8 field. Despite the resurgence and success of non-CawBlade decks in the Standard portion of the tournament (it only made up four of the eleven top decks), *six* copies piloted by some of the more prominent names in American *Magic* made the Top 8 due to the mixed-format nature of Nationals. Getting something that didn't put a Sword on a Bird was refreshing. Also, Haibing Hu, though he was playing a CawBlade deck hiself, was running a version with a few interesting card choices in both the maindeck and sideboard.


"Sweet, a deck I don't have dead cards against for game 1," Aintrazi joked as he sat down to the table.


"Yeah, most people do against him," Hu said, nodding his head.


### Game One


Hu started things off with a second-turn [Squadron Hawk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Squadron+Hawk). The little birdie fetched up a few more copies, filling Hu's hand. Aintrazi answered with an [Inquisition of Kozilek](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inquisition+of+Kozilek), taking [Jace Beleren](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace+Beleren) from a hand with [Dismember](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dismember), [Mana Leak](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak), [Preordain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Preordain), and three [Squadron Hawk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Squadron+Hawk)s. On his turn, his [Hawk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=+208279)s started to take over the skies. The first started attacking while the second swooped into play. Aintrazi played a [Jace Beleren](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace+Beleren) of his own, using his second ability to take him out of danger, but giving Hu a card in the process. Hu added a third [Hawk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=+208279) to his team and attacked with the other two, knocking Jace to three. Aintrazi realized he was done with his Jace, using it the second time to draw only himself a card. He also made a [Solemn Simulacrum](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Solemn+Simulacrum) that resolved after a bit of thought from Hu.


On his turn, Hu went into thought. After a [Preordain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Preordain), he sent two of his three [Hawk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=+208279)s at Jace to finish him off and the last at Aintrazi. After combat, the final [Hawk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=+208279) joined the skies. Aintrazi popped back with his Simulacrum, dropping Hu to 17. He made a second robot after combat, giving him a slightly better board, and a significant mana advantage. With so many lands in play, he felt content to [Tectonic Edge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tectonic+Edge) Hu's [Celestial Colonnade](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Celestial+Colonnade), dropping him to four lands. At the end of Aintrazi's turn, Hu paid the full amount of life to [Dismember](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dismember) the newest robot.

*'On his turn, Hu went into thought...'* |



Hu's [Preordain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Preordain) to start his turn put him into the tank. He eventually decided to swap both of the cards for a better one off of his deck. At this point, his Squadron of [Hawk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=+208279)s started taking four-point chunks out of Aintrazi's life total. Aintrazi was giving back, swinging with his Simulacrum. He tried to get in with his [Creeping Tar Pit](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Creeping+Tar+Pit) on one turn, but Hu used [Tectonic Edge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tectonic+Edge) to kill it. When Aintrazi played a second Tar Pit, Hu matched it with a second Edge. With one attack, Hu dropped Aintrazi to 2 life, while sitting at 7 himself. Aintrazi attacked with his Simulacrum and passed the turn. When Hu sent his Squad on the following turn, Aintrazi conceded.

### Game Two


Hu started the second game with a pair of mulligans on the draw, which had to have Aintrazi feeling good about his chances this game. Hu made an effort to get back the cards he'd lost with a third-turn [Jace Beleren](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace+Beleren), but Aintrazi had an [Into the Roil](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Into+the+Roil) to cap it at one card, as well as a Jace of his own to take the place of Hu's. Hu thought for a moment about his play before deciding to trap Aintrazi's Jace in an [Oblivion Ring](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oblivion+Ring), trying to pave the way for his own. Aintrazi tried to prevent this with an [Inquisition of Kozilek](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inquisition+of+Kozilek), but Hu had a [Mental Misstep](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mental+Misstep). After untapping, Hu made a [Jace Beleren](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace+Beleren), drawing two cards and passing the turn. Hu only had access to one mana, so Aintrazi took the opportunity to cast a [Consecrated Sphinx](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Consecrated+Sphinx). Hu had nothing to say about it, and nothing to do either, letting Aintrazi draw a pair of cards not only during his draw step, but also off of a Jace activation. Hu used the rest of his turn to make two [Squadron Hawk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Squadron+Hawk)s.

*Haibing Hu* |



With a hand full of cards and a severe advantage, Aintrazi began his turn. His [Inquisition of Kozilek](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inquisition+of+Kozilek) met a [Mental Misstep](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mental+Misstep) from Hu, but his [Tectonic Edge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tectonic+Edge) locked Hu back down at three lands. Aintrazi attacked and then passed the turn with four lands up, content to coast on the wings (and cards) of his [Sphinx](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=+214063). Hu decided that since Aintrazi was already drawing a bunch of cards, he might as well just use Jace's +2 ability, keeping him from going away. An [Inquisition of Kozilek](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inquisition+of+Kozilek) revealed a pair of [Gideon Jura](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gideon+Jura)s, a [Consecrated Sphinx](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Consecrated+Sphinx) of his own, a pair of [Spell Pierce](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spell+Pierce)s, and a [Sword of Feast and Famine](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sword+of+Feast+and+Famine). Aintrazi took the Sword, unafraid of the [Spell Pierce](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spell+Pierce)s thanks to his severe mana advantage.


He had an interesting decision to make on his turn. If he attacked with his [Sphinx](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=+214063), and Hu drew a fifth land, Gideon would come down and kill it. But if he didn't attack, Hu would get two draws, one for his turn and one for Jace, to try to find it. Ultimately, he chose to cast [Black Sun's Zenith](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Black+Sun%27s+Zenith) for one to kill the [Hawk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=+208279)s, attack Jace, and [Despise](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Despise) a copy of Gideon from Hu's hand.


While sitting at 7 life, Hu managed to find a [Day of Judgment](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Day+of+Judgment) to kill the [Sphinx](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=+214063). Aintrazi replaced it, but Hu found a fifth land, playing [Gideon Jura](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gideon+Jura) and forcing Aintrazi to attack him. Aintrazi did so, animating his [Creeping Tar Pit](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Creeping+Tar+Pit), as well, to knock Gideon to one loyalty. On the following attack, Hu was dead. Aintrazi had drawn well over a dozen cards off his [Sphinx](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=+214063), and that crushing advantage combined with a severe shortage of lands thanks to his mulligans was enough to do Hu in.

### Game Three


Aintrazi's attempt at a first-turn Inquisition was stopped by a [Spell Pierce](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spell+Pierce), and the one that followed two turns later was countered with [Mana Leak](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak). When Hu tried to make a [Sword of Feast and Famine](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sword+of+Feast+and+Famine) afterwards, Aintrazi stopped that with a [Mana Leak](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak) of his own. To this point in the game, the story was more what hadn't happened than what had.


The first thing *to* happen was a [Gideon Jura](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gideon+Jura) from Hu on turn five. Aintrazi kicked an [Into the Roil](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Into+the+Roil) at it and filled the space with a [Consecrated Sphinx](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Consecrated+Sphinx). Hu returned the favor of the previous turn, kicking an [Into the Roil](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Into+the+Roil) on the [Sphinx](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=+214063) during his upkeep. Aintrazi replayed it on his turn, and Hu once again cast [Into the Roil](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Into+the+Roil). Before Aintrazi cast it for the third time, he cast [Inquisition of Kozilek](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inquisition+of+Kozilek), stealing an [Oblivion Ring](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oblivion+Ring) from a hand with [Sword of Feast and Famine](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sword+of+Feast+and+Famine), [Gideon Jura](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gideon+Jura), [Day of Judgment](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Day+of+Judgment), and [Tectonic Edge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tectonic+Edge). The [Sphinx](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=+214063) hit the table for the *third* time, and this time it actually got to draw Aintrazi a pair of cards. Hu used his [Day of Judgment](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Day+of+Judgment) to clear it away, but Aintrazi was holding a second copy to replace it. Hu made a [Gideon Jura](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gideon+Jura), using it to force Aintrazi to attack. He had a [Tectonic Edge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tectonic+Edge) in reserve, just in case Aintrazi tried the same maneuver as the last game and animated his Tar Pit.


Aintrazi got a glimpse of the lone [Tectonic Edge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tectonic+Edge) in Hu's hand with [Despise](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Despise) before dropping the bomb and stealing Gideon with a [Volition Reins](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Volition+Reins). At this point, Aintrazi had a *severe* advantage, especially considering the four cards in his hand. Hu had gotten a [Sword of Feast and Famine](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sword+of+Feast+and+Famine) into play alongside his Gideon, but he now had no creatures to hand it to. He drew his card and passed the turn. Aintrazi locked things up with a [Liliana Vess](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Liliana+Vess), hitting the last card in Hu's hand, before swinging his team at Hu. One more turn and it was over.

### Game Four


Aintrazi managed to resolve a first-turn [Despise](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Despise), revealing two copies of [Day of Judgment](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Day+of+Judgment), [Preordain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Preordain), [Glacial Fortress](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glacial+Fortress), [Oblivion Ring](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oblivion+Ring), and [Jace Beleren](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace+Beleren), which he was forced to take. As though he wouldn't anyway. That made things clear for him to play a Jace of his own on the third turn, though he only got a single card out of it before Hu trapped him under [Oblivion Ring](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oblivion+Ring). Hu then took the Planeswalker advantage with [Gideon Jura](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gideon+Jura), which caused Aintrazi to kick it back to Hu's hand with an [Into the Roil](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Into+the+Roil). Rather than try for it once more, while Aintrazi had four mana open, Hu opted to pass the turn. Aintrazi took advantage of this window to cast his threat: the [Consecrated Sphinx](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Consecrated+Sphinx) that had won him his last two games. Hu had an [Into the Roil](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Into+the+Roil) to kick at it during the end of turn, putting himself on the right side of the tempo this time around. He even used a [Tectonic Edge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tectonic+Edge) to put Aintrazi back down to five lands, but Aintrazi had the sixth and was able to recast the [Sphinx](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=+214063). He drew two cards off it before Day wiped it clear.


Aintrazi went after Hu's hand with an [Inquisition of Kozilek](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inquisition+of+Kozilek), but just ended up looking at [Emeria Angel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Emeria+Angel), [Gideon Jura](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gideon+Jura), [Day of Judgment](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Day+of+Judgment), and a [Seachrome Coast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seachrome+Coast). Hu hadn't played the Coast on his last turn, and was dropped to three lands when Aintrazi used two [Tectonic Edge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tectonic+Edge)s to kill his lands. He also added a [Grave Titan](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grave+Titan) to the board, but Hu got to untap his new Coast and cast [Day of Judgment](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Day+of+Judgment) to wipe it all away. An [Emeria Angel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Emeria+Angel) and a land came down for Hu, giving him a little birdie, but Aintrazi had the [Doom Blade](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Doom+Blade) for the Angel. He had another copy when Hu tried to make a [Consecrated Sphinx](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Consecrated+Sphinx). At this point, the attacking began. Hu sent for one with his bird, while Aintrazi sent a pair of [Creeping Tar Pit](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Creeping+Tar+Pit)s after Hu. At two life, and facing lethal damage on the following turn, Hu made a [Gideon Jura](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gideon+Jura). Aintrazi sent his two lands, dropping him to two loyalty. Hu finally found a [Squadron Hawk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Squadron+Hawk), playing all four of his [Hawk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=+208279)s in one turn before Aintrazi killed Gideon. Hu had a single turn left. He drew his card, surveyed the board, and shook Aintrazi's hand, sending him off to the finals and ensuring him a spot on the U.S. National team!
