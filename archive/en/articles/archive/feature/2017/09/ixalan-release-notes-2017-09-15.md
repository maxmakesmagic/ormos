The Release Notes include information concerning the release of a new *Magic: The Gathering* set, as well as a collection of clarifications and rulings involving that set's cards. It's intended to make playing with the new cards more fun by clearing up the common misconceptions and confusion inevitably caused by new mechanics and interactions. As future sets are released, updates to the *Magic* rules may cause some of this information to become outdated. If you can't find the answer you're looking for here, please contact us at [Wizards.com/CustomerService](http://www.wizards.com/CustomerService).


The "General Notes" section includes release information and explains the mechanics and concepts in the set.


The "Card-Specific Notes" section contains answers to the most important, most common, and most confusing questions players might ask about cards in the set. Items in the "Card-Specific Notes" section include full card text for your reference. Not all cards in the set are listed.

*Ixalan* Story Spotlight Cards
------------------------------


There are many important moments in the *Ixalan* story, but the five most crucial—called "story spotlights"—are shown on cards. You can read more about these events in the official *Magic* fiction at [mtgstory.com](http://www.mtgstory.com/).


Story spotlight 1: Ixalan's Binding  

Story spotlight 2: Vraska's Contempt  

Story spotlight 3: River's Rebuke  

Story spotlight 4: Thaumatic Compass  

Story spotlight 5: Perilous Voyage


The story spotlight cards in this set feature a Planeswalker symbol icon in their text boxes. The icon has no effect on game play. The printed cards also include the mtgstory.com URL and a number indicating the sequence of the cards in the story.




---

Major Theme: "Tribal" Bonuses
-----------------------------


At the heart of the *Ixalan* set are four rival factions, each with its own featured creature type: the **Vampires** of the Legion of Dusk, the **Pirates** of the Brazen Coalition, the **Dinosaur** riders of the Sun Empire, and the **Merfolk** of the River Heralds. Many cards in the *Ixalan* set reward you for playing many creatures of a certain creature type, and others reward you for playing lots of creatures that share any type that you choose. Pick your allies wisely!


![](https://media.wizards.com/2017/xln/en_halxu6YFDg.png)


Otepec Huntmaster  

1R  

Creature — Human Shaman  

1/2  

Dinosaur spells you cast cost 1 less to cast.  

T: Target Dinosaur gains haste until end of turn.


![](https://media.wizards.com/2017/xln/en_kQreNok5VK.png)


March of the Drowned  

B  

Sorcery  

Choose one —  

• Return target creature card from your graveyard to your hand.  

• Return two target Pirate cards from your graveyard to your hand.


![](https://media.wizards.com/2017/xln/en_g5JIX0IwbO.png)


Vanquisher's Banner  

5  

Artifact  

As Vanquisher's Banner enters the battlefield, choose a creature type.  

Creatures you control of the chosen type get +1/+1.  

Whenever you cast a creature spell of the chosen type, draw a card.


* If an effect refers to a "[subtype] spell" or "[subtype] card," it refers only to a spell or card that has that subtype. For example, March of the Drowned is a card that benefits Pirates and features Pirates in its illustration, but it isn't a Pirate card.
* To choose a creature type, you must choose an existing creature type, such as Vampire or Knight. You can't choose multiple creature types, such as "Vampire Knight." Card types such as artifact can't be chosen, nor can subtypes that aren't creature types, such as Jace, Vehicle, or Treasure.



---

New Keyword Action: Explore
---------------------------


Explore is a new keyword action that appears on thirteen creature cards in the *Ixalan* set. There are also two cards in the set with abilities that trigger "Whenever a creature you control explores." This mechanic isn't associated with a specific faction, and creatures with explore are found in all five colors.


![](https://media.wizards.com/2017/xln/en_gohG04WiSz.png)


Tishana's Wayfinder  

2G  

Creature — Merfolk Scout  

2/2  

When Tishana's Wayfinder enters the battlefield, it explores. *(Reveal the top card of your library. Put that card into your hand if it's a land. Otherwise, put a +1/+1 counter on this creature, then put the card back or put it into your graveyard.)*


The official rules for explore are as follows:


701.38. Explore


701.38a Certain abilities instruct a permanent to explore. To do so, that permanent's controller reveals the top card of his or her library. If a land card is revealed this way, that player puts that card into his or her hand. Otherwise, that player puts a +1/+1 counter on the exploring permanent and may put the revealed card into his or her graveyard.


701.38b A permanent "explores" after the process described in rule 701.38a is complete, even if some or all of those actions were impossible.


701.38c If a permanent changes zones before an effect causes it to explore, its last known information is used to determine which object explored and who controlled it.


* Once an ability that causes a creature to explore begins to resolve, no player may take any other actions until it's done. Notably, opponents can't try to remove the exploring creature after you reveal a nonland card but before it receives a counter.
* If no card is revealed, most likely because that player's library is empty, the exploring creature receives a +1/+1 counter.
* If a resolving spell or ability instructs a specific creature to explore but that creature has left the battlefield, the creature still explores. If you reveal a nonland card this way, you won't put a +1/+1 counter on anything, but you may put the revealed card into your graveyard. Effects that trigger "whenever a creature you control explores" trigger if appropriate.



---

Returning Mechanic: Double-Faced Cards
--------------------------------------


The theme of exploration continues in the return of double-faced cards. Rather than depict a creature changing forms, these ten double-faced cards represent the tools and tales of discovery. Instead of the typical card face and *Magic* card back, double-faced cards have two faces: a front face and a back face. The front face has a compass symbol in its upper left corner. The back face has a land symbol in its upper left corner and features a new "map" frame. Other than distinguishing one face from the other, these symbols and frames have no effect on gameplay.





![](https://media.wizards.com/2017/xln/en_y4nmM488Eh.png)
![](https://media.wizards.com/2017/xln/en_bdTtGwdBPz.png)

Turn Over


Treasure Map  

2  

Artifact  

1, T: Scry 1. Put a landmark counter on Treasure Map. Then if there are three or more landmark counters on it, remove those counters, transform Treasure Map, and create three colorless Treasure artifact tokens with "T, Sacrifice this artifact: Add one mana of any color to your mana pool."


\\


Treasure Cove  

Land  
*(Transforms from Treasure Map.)*  

T: Add C to your mana pool.  

T, Sacrifice a Treasure: Draw a card.


The rules for double-faced cards haven't changed since their previous appearance in the *Shadows over Innistrad* block.


* Each face of a double-faced card has its own set of characteristics: name, types, subtypes, abilities, and so on. While a double-faced card is on the battlefield, consider only the characteristics of the face that's currently up. The other set of characteristics is ignored.
* While a double-faced card isn't on the battlefield, consider only the characteristics of its front face. For example, the above card has only the characteristics of Treasure Map in the graveyard, even if it was Treasure Cove on the battlefield before it was put into the graveyard. Notably, this means that Treasure Map is a nonland card.
* The converted mana cost of a double-faced card is the converted mana cost of its front face, even while it's on the battlefield with its back face up. For example, Treasure Cove has a converted mana cost of 2, even though it's a land with no mana cost. (This rule was introduced with the release of the *Shadows over Innistrad* set.)
* The back face of each double-faced card in the *Ixalan* set is colorless regardless of the color of its front face.
* A double-faced card enters the battlefield with its front face up by default, unless a spell or ability instructs you to put it onto the battlefield transformed, in which case it enters with its back face up. The back face of a double-faced card can't be played.



---

**Game Supplement: Checklist Card**


It's important that the cards in your deck be indistinguishable from one another. To accomplish this with double-faced cards, you can use the checklist card found in some *Ixalan* booster packs. A checklist card acts as a substitute for a double-faced card in hidden zones or wherever its identity is concealed (such as in exile if it's exiled face down). Using checklist cards is optional, but in tournaments, players with double-faced cards must use either checklist cards or opaque card sleeves (or both).


* You must have the actual double-faced card the checklist card is representing with you. The double-faced card should be kept apart from the rest of the deck and your sideboard.
* A checklist card can't be included in a deck except when it's being used to represent a double-faced card.
* You must clearly mark exactly one box on the checklist card to indicate which double-faced card it represents.
* During the game, a checklist card is considered to be the double-faced card it represents.
* If a checklist card enters a public zone (the battlefield, the graveyard, the stack, or exile unless it's exiled face down), use the actual double-faced card and set the checklist card aside. If the double-faced card is put into a hidden zone (your hand or library), use the checklist card again.
* If a double-faced card is exiled face down or put onto the battlefield face down, keep its identity hidden by using the face-down checklist card or opaque card sleeves (or both).



---

New Ability Word: Enrage
------------------------


The only thing better than a Dinosaur is an angry Dinosaur. *Enrage* is an ability word found on some Dinosaur creatures. It indicates an ability that triggers whenever damage is dealt to that creature. An ability word appears in italics and has no rules meaning.


![](https://media.wizards.com/2017/xln/en_wO9xGNUMhW.png)


Sun-Crowned Hunters  

4RR  

Creature — Dinosaur  

5/4  
*Enrage* — Whenever Sun-Crowned Hunters is dealt damage, it deals 3 damage to target opponent.


* If multiple sources deal damage to a creature with an enrage ability at the same time, most likely because multiple creatures blocked that creature, the enrage ability triggers only once.
* If lethal damage is dealt to a creature with an enrage ability, that ability triggers. The creature with that enrage ability leaves the battlefield before that ability resolves, so it won't be affected by the resolving ability.



---

Returning Ability Word: Raid
----------------------------


Raid is a returning ability word found on some Pirates and Pirate-themed cards in the *Ixalan* set. Each raid ability checks to see if you've attacked with a creature during that turn. This ability word previously appeared in the *Khans of Tarkir* set. An ability word appears in italics and has no rules meaning.


![](https://media.wizards.com/2017/xln/en_uztvewpkp2.png)


Storm Fleet Arsonist  

4R  

Creature — Orc Pirate  

4/4  
*Raid* — When Storm Fleet Arsonist enters the battlefield, if you attacked with a creature this turn, target opponent sacrifices a permanent.


* Raid abilities care only that you attacked with a creature. It doesn't matter how many creatures you attacked with, or which opponent or planeswalker controlled by an opponent those creatures attacked.
* Raid abilities evaluate the entire turn to see if you attacked with a creature. That creature doesn't have to still be on the battlefield. Similarly, the player or planeswalker it attacked doesn't have to still be in the game or on the battlefield, respectively.
* Some raid abilities trigger at the beginning of your end step. These abilities trigger if you attacked with a creature that turn, even if the card with that raid ability wasn't on the battlefield when you attacked.



---

Returning Mechanic: Vehicles
----------------------------


The *Ixalan* set brings back the artifact subtype Vehicle to let you sail the seas in style.


![](https://media.wizards.com/2017/xln/en_gfDHwBBPHF.png)


Sleek Schooner  

3  

Artifact — Vehicle  

4/3  

Crew 1 *(Tap any number of creatures you control with total power 1 or more: This Vehicle becomes an artifact creature until end of turn.)*


The rules for Vehicles haven't changed since their previous appearance in the *Kaladesh* block.


* Each Vehicle is printed with a power and toughness, but it's not a creature. If it becomes a creature (most likely through its crew ability), it will have that power and toughness.
* If an effect causes a Vehicle to become an artifact creature with a specified power and toughness, that effect overwrites the Vehicle's printed power and toughness.
* Vehicle is an artifact type, not a creature type. A Vehicle that's crewed won't normally have any creature type.
* Once a player announces that he or she is activating a crew ability, no player may take other actions until the ability has been paid for. Notably, players can't try to stop the ability by changing a creature's power or by removing or tapping a creature.
* Any untapped creature you control can be tapped to pay a crew cost, even one that just came under your control.
* You may tap more creatures than necessary to activate a crew ability.
* Creatures that crew a Vehicle aren't attached to it or related in any other way. Effects that affect the Vehicle, such as by destroying it or giving it a +1/+1 counter, don't affect the creatures that crewed it.
* Once a Vehicle becomes a creature, it behaves exactly like any other artifact creature. It can't attack unless you've controlled it continuously since your turn began, it can block if it's untapped, it can be tapped to pay a Vehicle's crew cost, and so on.
* You may activate a crew ability of a Vehicle even if it's already an artifact creature. Doing so has no effect on the Vehicle. It doesn't change its power and toughness.
* For a Vehicle to be able to attack, it must be a creature as the declare attackers step begins, so the latest you can activate its crew ability to attack with it is during the beginning of combat step. For a Vehicle to be able to block, it must be a creature as the declare blockers step begins, so the latest you can activate its crew ability to block with it is during the declare attackers step. In either case, players may take actions after the crew ability resolves but before the Vehicle has been declared as an attacking or blocking creature.
* When a Vehicle becomes a creature, that doesn't count as having a creature enter the battlefield. The permanent was already on the battlefield; it only changed its types. Abilities that trigger whenever a creature enters the battlefield won't trigger.
* If a permanent becomes a copy of a Vehicle, the copy won't be a creature, even if the Vehicle it's copying has become an artifact creature.



---

New Artifact Subtype: Treasure
------------------------------


Treasure is a new artifact subtype that appears exclusively on tokens. It**'**s associated with the Pirate faction. There are four versions of the printed Treasure token, each with art of a chest that contains valuables from one of the four factions.


![](https://media.wizards.com/2017/xln/en_BLKANqUD00.png)


Pirate**'**s Prize  

3U  

Sorcery  

Draw two cards. Create a colorless Treasure artifact token with **"**T, Sacrifice this artifact: Add one mana of any color to your mana pool.**"**


* Some spells that create Treasure tokens require targets. You can**'**t cast a spell without choosing legal targets. If all of those targets become illegal, the spell is countered and you won**'**t get its Treasure tokens.



---

Rules Change: Planeswalkers Use the "Legend Rule"
-------------------------------------------------


Previously, planeswalkers and legendary permanents were subject to similar but slightly different rules. The official rules under rule 704, "State-Based Actions," were as follows:


*704.5j If a player controls two or more planeswalkers that share a planeswalker type, that player chooses one of them, and the rest are put into their owners' graveyards. This is called the "planeswalker uniqueness rule."*


*704.5k If a player controls two or more legendary permanents with the same name, that player chooses one of them, and the rest are put into their owners' graveyards. This is called the "legend rule."*


With the release of the *Ixalan* set, the "planeswalker uniqueness rule" is being removed from the rules, and all previously printed planeswalker cards are receiving errata to add the legendary supertype. All *Ixalan* planeswalker cards are printed with the legendary supertype.


![](https://media.wizards.com/2017/xln/en_TEfbSu9pam.png)


Jace, Cunning Castaway (in *Ixalan* booster packs)  

1UU  

Legendary Planeswalker — Jace  

3  

+1: Whenever one or more creatures you control deal combat damage to a player this turn, draw a card, then discard a card.  

−2: Create a 2/2 blue Illusion creature token with "When this creature becomes the target of a spell, sacrifice it."  

−5: Create two tokens that are copies of Jace, Cunning Castaway, except they're not legendary.


![](https://media.wizards.com/2017/xln/en_wHqxXPqICj.png)


Jace, Ingenious Mind-Mage (in an *Ixalan* Planeswalker Deck)  

4UU  

Legendary Planeswalker — Jace  

5  

+1: Draw a card.  

+1: Untap all creatures you control.  

−9: Gain control of up to three target creatures.


* If you control two or more legendary permanents with the same English name, choose one and put each other one into its owner's graveyard. This is called the "legend rule."
* Jace, Ingenious Mind-Mage and Jace, Cunning Castaway have different names, so you can control both at the same time.



---

Cycle: "Check Lands"
--------------------


The *Ixalan* set features a cycle of allied-color dual lands to help you make sure you always have the mana that you need. These cards were first printed in the *Magic 2010* core set.


![](https://media.wizards.com/2017/xln/en_Jt9yurxL7m.png)


Rootbound Crag  

Land  

Rootbound Crag enters the battlefield tapped unless you control a Mountain or a Forest.  

T: Add R or G to your mana pool.


* The enters-the-battlefield abilities of these dual lands check for lands you control with either of the two listed land types, not either of the two listed names. The lands they check for don't have to be basic lands. For example, if you control Scattered Groves (a nonbasic land with the land types Forest and Plains), Rootbound Crag enters the battlefield untapped.
* These dual lands don't have any land types themselves. For example, Rootbound Crag isn't a Forest. A second Rootbound Crag won't enter untapped if you control only Rootbound Crag.
* As these lands are entering the battlefield, they check for lands that are already on the battlefield. They won't see lands that are entering the battlefield at the same time.



---

CARD-SPECIFIC NOTES
-------------------


![](https://media.wizards.com/2017/xln/en_dXpvfRNxUN.png)


Admiral Beckett Brass  

1UBR  

Legendary Creature — Human Pirate  

3/3  

Other Pirates you control get +1/+1.  

At the beginning of your end step, gain control of target nonland permanent controlled by a player who was dealt combat damage by three or more Pirates this turn.


* Admiral Beckett Brass's triggered ability checks what happened earlier in the turn. It doesn't care whether Admiral Beckett Brass was on the battlefield when those Pirates dealt combat damage, whether those creatures are still on the battlefield, or whether they're still Pirates.
* If one Pirate deals combat damage multiple times, most likely because it has double strike, it counts as only one of the three Pirates for Admiral Beckett Brass's triggered ability.
* If more than one player was dealt combat damage by three Pirates, you target only one permanent. It may be controlled by either of those players.
* The control-change effect of Admiral Beckett Brass's triggered ability lasts indefinitely. It doesn't wear off during the cleanup step or when you lose control of Admiral Beckett Brass.
* In a multiplayer game, if a player leaves the game, all cards that player owns leave as well, and any effects that give the player control of permanents immediately end.
* In a Two-Headed Giant game, an unblocked attacking creature deals its combat damage to one of the two players it's attacking. The attacking team chooses which player that is for each creature as combat damage is assigned. Combat damage dealt by Pirates your teammate controls will count when checking for Admiral Beckett Brass's ability.



---

![](https://media.wizards.com/2017/xln/en_2S0d70qzYk.png)


Angrath's Marauders  

5RR  

Creature — Human Pirate  

4/4  

If a source you control would deal damage to a permanent or player, it deals double that damage to that permanent or player instead.


* If a creature with trample you control would deal combat damage to a blocking creature while you control Angrath's Marauders, you must assign its unmodified damage. For example, a 3/3 creature with trample blocked by a 2/2 creature can have at most 1 damage assigned to the defending player. It will then deal 4 damage to the blocking creature and 2 damage to the defending player.
* If an effect such as that of Chandra's Pyrohelix asks you to divide damage among targets, you must divide the unmodified damage before doubling it.
* If you control a second Angrath's Marauders, damage dealt by sources you control will be multiplied by 4. If you control a third, it will be multiplied by 8, and so on.



---

![](https://media.wizards.com/2017/xln/en_uRA1svXM1W.png)


Arcane Adaptation  

2U  

Enchantment  

As Arcane Adaptation enters the battlefield, choose a creature type.  

Creatures you control are the chosen type in addition to their other types. The same is true for creature spells you control and creature cards you own that aren't on the battlefield.


* Replacement effects that modify creatures of a certain type as they enter the battlefield will apply after you apply Arcane Adaptation's effect. This is a change from previous rules. If you control Arcane Adaptation and the *Aether Revolt* card Metallic Mimic, with the same creature type chosen for both, then any creature you control will enter the battlefield with an additional +1/+1 counter on it.

Turn Over


Arguel's Blood Fast  

1B  

Legendary Enchantment  

1B, Pay 2 life: Draw a card.  

At the beginning of your upkeep, if you have 5 or less life, you may transform Arguel's Blood Fast.


//


Temple of Aclazotz  

Legendary Land  
*(Transforms from Arguel's Blood Fast.)*  

T: Add B to your mana pool.  

T, Sacrifice a creature: You gain life equal to the sacrificed creature's toughness.


* If your life total is 6 or greater as your upkeep begins, the second ability of Arguel's Blood Fast won't trigger. You can't take any actions during your turn before your upkeep begins.
* If your life total is 6 or greater as the second ability of Arguel's Blood Fast tries to resolve, it won't do anything.
* Once you've announced the last ability of Temple of Aclazotz, it's too late for anyone to interrupt you by trying to remove the creature you sacrifice.
* For the last ability of Temple of Aclazotz, use the creature's toughness as it last existed on the battlefield to determine how much life you gain.



---

![](https://media.wizards.com/2017/xln/en_8BuR5T4kqb.png)


Ashes of the Abhorrent  

1W  

Enchantment  

Players can't cast spells from graveyards or activate abilities of cards in graveyards.  

Whenever a creature dies, you gain 1 life.


* Activated abilities contain a colon. They're generally written "[Cost]: [Effect]." Some keyword abilities (such as embalm from the *Amonkhet* set) are activated abilities and will have colons in their reminder text. Triggered abilities (starting with "when," "whenever," or "at") are unaffected by Ashes of the Abhorrent.
* Ashes of the Abhorrent doesn't stop players from playing land cards from the graveyard if an effect allows them to do so.
* If a creature dies at the same time that Ashes of the Abhorrent is destroyed, you'll gain 1 life.



---

![](https://media.wizards.com/2017/xln/en_xQgJtSbG5q.png)


Atzocan Archer  

2G  

Creature — Human Archer  

1/4  

Reach  

When Atzocan Archer enters the battlefield, you may have it fight another target creature. *(Each deals damage equal to its power to the other.)*


* You must choose another target creature (if able) as Atzocan Archer's triggered ability is put on the stack. You choose as that ability resolves whether those creatures fight.
* If Atzocan Archer isn't on the battlefield as its triggered ability resolves, or if the target of that ability is illegal, no creature will deal or be dealt damage.
* Atzocan Archer's ability can target another creature you control (such as a Dinosaur with an enrage ability).



---

![](https://media.wizards.com/2017/xln/en_sXHUoH5YAf.png)


Axis of Mortality  

4WW  

Enchantment  

At the beginning of your upkeep, you may have two target players exchange life totals.


* If one of the targeted players is an illegal target when the triggered ability of Axis of Mortality tries to resolve, the exchange won't happen. Neither player's life total will change.
* When the life totals are exchanged, each player gains or loses the amount of life necessary to equal the other player's previous life total. For example, if player A has 5 life and player B has 3 life before the exchange, player A will lose 2 life and player B will gain 2 life. Replacement effects may modify these gains and losses, and triggered abilities may trigger on them.
* If a player can't gain life, that player can't exchange life totals with a player with a higher life total. If a player can't lose life, that player can't exchange life totals with a player with a lower life total. In either of these cases, neither player's life total will change.
* In a Two-Headed Giant game, each player is considered to have the same life total as his or her team. If the two targeted players are on different teams, those players gain or lose the appropriate amount of life so that the teams end up exchanging life totals. If the two targeted players are teammates, they can't exchange life totals.

Belligerent Brontodon  

5GW  

Creature — Dinosaur  

4/6  

Each creature you control assigns combat damage equal to its toughness rather than its power.


* Belligerent Brontodon's ability doesn't actually change any creature's power. It changes only the amount of combat damage it assigns. All other rules and effects that check power or toughness use the real values. For example, Hunt the Weak won't cause a creature to fight with its toughness.

* Bloodcrazed Paladin's last ability won't count creatures that were put directly into a zone other than the graveyard, perhaps because of a replacement effect (for example, a creature that was exiled instead or a commander that moved to the command zone in the Commander variant).

Bonded Horncrest  

3R  

Creature — Dinosaur  

5/5  

Bonded Horncrest can't attack or block alone.


* If you control more than one Bonded Horncrest, they can attack or block together, even if no other creatures attack or block.
* Although Bonded Horncrest can't attack alone, other attacking creatures don't have to attack the same player or planeswalker. For example, Bonded Horncrest could attack an opponent and another creature could attack a planeswalker that opponent controls. Similarly, other blocking creatures don't have to block the same creature that Bonded Horncrest blocks.
* Once Bonded Horncrest has attacked or blocked, it will remain in combat even if you no longer control another attacking or blocking creature.
* If an effect says that Bonded Horncrest attacks or blocks if able and you control another creature able to attack or block, you must attack or block with Bonded Horncrest and that creature.
* In a Two-Headed Giant game, Bonded Horncrest can attack or block with a creature controlled by your teammate, even if no other creatures you control are attacking or blocking.

Exile up to five target creature cards from graveyards. An opponent separates those cards into two piles. Put all cards from the pile of your choice onto the battlefield under your control and the rest into their owners' graveyards.

* You (not your opponent) choose which pile to put onto the battlefield and which to return to graveyards.
* A pile can have no cards in it. In this case, you'll choose whether to put all the exiled cards onto the battlefield or into graveyards.
* In multiplayer games, you choose an opponent to separate the cards when the ability resolves. This doesn't target that opponent. Because the cards are revealed, all players may see the cards and offer opinions.
* In a multiplayer game, if a player leaves the game, all cards that player owns leave as well. If you leave the game, any creatures you control from Boneyard Parley's effect are exiled.

* If it's still in exile, the exiled card returns to the battlefield immediately after Hostage Taker leaves the battlefield. Nothing happens between the two events, including state-based actions.
* In a multiplayer game, if Hostage Taker's owner leaves the game while the card is still exiled and another player owns that card, the exiled card will return to the battlefield under its owner's control. Because the one-shot effect that returns the card isn't an ability that goes on the stack, it won't cease to exist along with the leaving player's spells and abilities on the stack.
* In a multiplayer game, if a player leaves the game, all cards that player owns leave as well. If you leave the game, any spell or permanent cards you control from Hostage Taker's ability are exiled.

* The greatest power among creatures you control is determined as Huatli's first ability resolves. If that number is negative, you won't gain or lose any life.
* You can activate Huatli's first ability even if you control no creatures. You simply won't gain any life.
* You divide the damage among the target creatures as you activate Huatli's last ability. Each target must be assigned at least 1 damage. If X is 0, you can't choose any targets.
* If some (but not all) of the targets become illegal, the original division of damage still applies, but no damage is dealt to illegal targets. If all targets become illegal, the ability will be countered.

Ixalan's Binding  

3W  

Enchantment  

When Ixalan's Binding enters the battlefield, exile target nonland permanent an opponent controls until Ixalan's Binding leaves the battlefield.  

Your opponents can't cast spells with the same name as the exiled card.


* If Ixalan's Binding leaves the battlefield before its triggered ability resolves, the target permanent won't be exiled.
* Auras attached to the exiled permanent will be put into their owners' graveyards. Any Equipment will become unattached and remain on the battlefield. Any counters on the exiled permanent will cease to exist.
* If a token is exiled this way, it will cease to exist and won't return to the battlefield.
* The exiled card returns to the battlefield immediately after Ixalan's Binding leaves the battlefield. Nothing happens between the two events, including state-based actions.
* If the exiled card has a different name in exile than it did on the battlefield, Ixalan's Binding stops players from casting spells with the name of that card as it exists in exile.
* If the exiled card is a land card that's become a nonland permanent, Ixalan's Binding won't stop players from playing lands with that name.
* If there is no exiled card (perhaps because the exiled permanent was a token or was a commander that moved to the command zone in the Commander variant), Ixalan's Binding won't stop players from casting spells.
* In a multiplayer game, if Ixalan's Binding's owner leaves the game and another player owns the exiled card, the exiled card will return to the battlefield under its owner's control. Because the one-shot effect that returns the card isn't an ability that goes on the stack, it won't cease to exist along with the leaving player's spells and abilities on the stack.

Jace, Cunning Castaway

Legendary Planeswalker — Jace

+1: Whenever one or more creatures you control deal combat damage to a player this turn, draw a card, then discard a card.  

−2: Create a 2/2 blue Illusion creature token with "When this creature becomes the target of a spell, sacrifice it."  

−5: Create two tokens that are copies of Jace, Cunning Castaway, except they're not legendary.


* The delayed triggered ability created by Jace's first ability can trigger more than once in a turn if creatures you control deal combat damage at different times in a turn (most likely because one or more has first strike) or if creatures you control deal combat damage to more than one player at once.
* If a token created by Jace's second ability becomes the target of a spell, its ability triggers and goes on the stack on top of that spell. The ability will resolve first (causing the token to be sacrificed). Unless the spell has another target, it will then be countered when it tries to resolve for having no legal targets.
* The tokens from Jace's last ability copy exactly what is printed on Jace and nothing else. They don't copy how many counters are on him or Auras attached to him, or any non-copy effects that have changed his color or types, and so on. They'll each enter the battlefield with three loyalty counters. You can activate one loyalty ability of each of the tokens this turn.
* The tokens created by Jace's last ability don't have the legendary supertype. If another object becomes a copy of the token, that copy also won't be legendary.
* You can control one legendary Jace, Cunning Castaway in addition to any number of nonlegendary copies of Jace, Cunning Castaway. See also "Rules Change: Planeswalkers Use the 'Legend Rule'" in the General Notes section of this document.

The converted mana cost of the spell remains unchanged, no matter what the total cost to cast it was.
* Activated abilities contain a colon. They're generally written "[Cost]: [Effect]."

1/1  

Kumena's Speaker gets +1/+1 as long as you control another Merfolk or an Island.


* Kumena's Speaker gets only +1/+1 from its ability, no matter how many Merfolk and Islands you control.
* Most nonbasic lands that produce blue mana aren't Islands. For example, Glacial Fortress isn't an Island. Some nonbasic lands (such as Irrigated Farmland from the *Amonkhet* set) do have basic land types printed on the type line and may be Islands.
* Because damage remains marked on a creature until it's removed as the turn ends, the damage Kumena's Speaker takes during combat may become lethal if you no longer control a Merfolk or Island later in the turn.

Primal Amulet

Artifact  

Instant and sorcery spells you cast cost 1 less to cast.  

Whenever you cast an instant or sorcery spell, put a charge counter on Primal Amulet. Then if there are four or more charge counters on it, you may remove those counters and transform it.


//


Primal Wellspring  

Land  
*(Transforms from Primal Amulet.)*  

T: Add one mana of any color to your mana pool. When that mana is spent to cast an instant or sorcery spell, copy that spell and you may choose new targets for the copy.


* To determine the total cost of a spell, start with the mana cost or alternative cost you're paying, add any cost increases, then apply any cost reductions. The converted mana cost of the spell remains unchanged, no matter what the total cost to cast it was.
* Effects that reduce the generic mana cost of a spell can't reduce that spell's colored mana requirements.
* Primal Amulet's last ability triggers once you've completed casting a spell. Notably, you can't use Primal Wellspring to pay for the spell that gives Primal Amulet its fourth counter.
* If a fourth charge counter is put on Primal Amulet by something other than the resolution of its ability (as modified by any applicable replacement effects), you won't be able to remove those counters and transform it yet. You'll have to wait until you cast an instant or sorcery spell again.
* The mana produced by Primal Wellspring can be spent on anything, not just an instant or sorcery spell.
* Any instant or sorcery spell you spend the mana on will be copied, not just one that requires targets.
* The delayed triggered ability from Primal Wellspring's mana ability will trigger even if Primal Wellspring leaves the battlefield before that mana is spent.
* If more than one mana produced by a Primal Wellspring is spent to cast a single instant or sorcery spell, the delayed triggered ability associated with each mana spent will trigger. That many copies will be created. It doesn't matter if this mana was produced by one Primal Wellspring or by multiple Primal Wellsprings.
* Primal Wellspring's delayed triggered ability can copy the spell even if that spell is countered before the ability resolves.
* If a copy is created, you control the copy. That copy is created on the stack, so it's not "cast." Abilities that trigger when a player casts a spell won't trigger. The copy will then resolve like a normal spell, after players get a chance to cast spells and activate abilities.
* The copy will have the same targets as the spell it's copying unless you choose new ones. You may change any number of the targets, including all of them or none of them. If, for one of the targets, you can't choose a new legal target, then it remains unchanged (even if the current target is illegal).
* If the copied spell is modal (that is, it says "Choose one —" or the like), the copy will have the same mode. You can't choose a different one.
* If the copied spell has an X whose value was determined as it was cast, the copy has the same value of X.
* You can't choose to pay any additional costs for the copy. However, effects based on any additional costs that were paid for the original spell are copied as though those same costs were paid for the copy too. For example, if you sacrifice a 3/3 creature to cast Fling, and you copy it, the copy of Fling will also deal 3 damage to its target.

* Once Rowdy Crew's triggered ability begins to resolve, no player may take other actions until it's done. Notably, you can't discard or cast any of the cards you draw to try to rig the results of the random discard.
* The card types that can appear on the discarded cards are artifact, creature, enchantment, instant, land, planeswalker, sorcery, and tribal (a card type that appears on some older cards). Legendary is a supertype, not a card type.
* The discarded cards just need to share one card type. For example, Rowdy Crew will get two +1/+1 counters if you discard an artifact creature and an enchantment creature.
* Rowdy Crew doesn't get more than two +1/+1 counters if the discarded cards happen to share more than one card type.

Savage Stomp costs 2 less to cast if it targets a Dinosaur you control.  

Put a +1/+1 counter on target creature you control. Then that creature fights target creature you don't control. *(Each deals damage equal to its power to the other.)*


* You can't cast Savage Stomp unless you choose both a creature you control and a creature you don't control as targets.
* If either target is an illegal target as Savage Stomp resolves, neither creature will deal or be dealt damage.
* If the creature you control is an illegal target as Savage Stomp tries to resolve, you won't put a +1/+1 counter on it. If that creature is a legal target but the other creature isn't, you'll still put the counter on the creature you control.

2U, T: Look at the top four cards of your library. You may reveal a noncreature, nonland card from among them and put it into your hand. Put the rest on the bottom of your library in any order.


* If a seventh card is put into your graveyard by something other than resolving Search for Azcanta's triggered ability, you won't transform it yet. You'll have to wait until your next upkeep.
* If you have seven or more cards in your graveyard, you may transform Search for Azcanta while resolving its triggered ability even if you choose not to put the top card of your library into your graveyard.
* If you don't put the top card of your library into your graveyard while resolving Search for Azcanta's triggered ability, you'll leave it on top of your library (and probably draw it during your draw step).

Settle the Wreckage  

2WW  

Instant  

Exile all attacking creatures target player controls. That player may search his or her library for that many basic land cards, put those cards onto the battlefield tapped, then shuffle his or her library.


* Settle the Wreckage targets only the player. Creatures with hexproof that player controls will be exiled as this spell resolves.
* That player can find fewer basic land cards than the number of exiled creatures, whether because he or she wants to or because he or she doesn't have that many basic land cards left.
* The number of lands that player may find is the number of attacking creatures that were exiled, even if some of those creatures were tokens, weren't creature cards, or didn't end up in exile (most likely because one was that player's commander in the Commander variant).

Exile target creature you control, then return that card to the battlefield under its owner's control. If a Pirate was exiled this way, draw a card.


* Once the exiled creature returns, it's considered a new object with no relation to the object that it was. Auras attached to the exiled creature will be put into their owners' graveyards. Equipment attached to the exiled creature will become unattached and remain on the battlefield. Any counters on the exiled creature will cease to exist.
* The returned creature won't be the target of any spells or abilities that targeted it before. Any spells that don't target it, such as Star of Extinction, will still affect it.
* If a token is exiled this way, it will cease to exist and won't return to the battlefield.
* You'll draw a card if the creature was a Pirate as it was exiled, even if it doesn't return to the battlefield (most likely because it's a token) or if it returns to the battlefield but isn't a Pirate anymore (most likely because it's copying something else).

2  

Artifact  

As Sorcerous Spyglass enters the battlefield, look at an opponent's hand, then choose any card name.  

Activated abilities of sources with the chosen name can't be activated unless they're mana abilities.


* You can choose any card name, even if that card doesn't normally have an activated ability. You're not limited to the names of cards you saw in the opponent's hand.
* You can't choose the name of a token unless that token has the same name as a card.
* Activated abilities contain a colon. They're generally written "[Cost]: [Effect]." Some keyword abilities (such as equip and crew) are activated abilities and will have colons in their reminder text. Triggered abilities (starting with "when," "whenever," or "at") are unaffected by the last ability of Sorcerous Spyglass.
* An activated mana ability is one that produces mana as it resolves, not one that costs mana to activate.
* Sorcerous Spyglass affects cards regardless of what zone they're in. This includes cards in hand, cards in the graveyard, and exiled cards.

* If Steadfast Armasaur is no longer on the battlefield as its ability resolves, use its toughness as it last existed on the battlefield to determine how damage is dealt.

Storm Sculptor can't be blocked.  

When Storm Sculptor enters the battlefield, return a creature you control to its owner's hand.

Sunbird's Invocation  

5R  

Enchantment  

Whenever you cast a spell from your hand, reveal the top X cards of your library, where X is that spell's converted mana cost. You may cast a card revealed this way with converted mana cost X or less without paying its mana cost. Put the rest on the bottom of your library in a random order.


* Casting Sunbird's Invocation won't cause its own ability to trigger.
* The ability of Sunbird's Invocation resolves before the spell that caused it to trigger. It will resolve even if that spell is countered. If you cast a spell as part of the resolution of the ability, that spell resolves before the spell that caused the ability to trigger.
* For spells with X in their mana costs, use the value chosen for X to determine the spell's converted mana cost.
* If the spell's converted mana cost is 0, you do nothing as the ability of Sunbird's Invocation resolves.
* If a revealed card in your library has X in its mana cost, you must choose 0 as the value of X when casting it without paying its mana cost.
* If you cast one of the revealed cards, you do so as part of the resolution of the triggered ability. You can't wait to cast it later in the turn. Timing permissions based on the card's type are ignored, but other restrictions (such as "Cast [this card] only during combat") are not.
* If you cast a card "without paying its mana cost," you can't pay any alternative costs. You can, however, pay additional costs. If the card has any mandatory additional costs, such as that of Costly Plunder, those must be paid to cast the card.
* The converted mana cost of a split card, such as cards with aftermath from the *Amonkhet* block, is based on the combined mana cost of its two halves.

* You reveal all three cards before opponents choose whether to pay life for any of them.
* In a multiplayer game, each opponent in turn order chooses whether to pay life for one card before proceeding to the next card. You choose the order to perform this process for the cards, but opponents may discuss them before making any choices. Opponents will then know choices made by earlier opponents when making their choices.

Haste  

Whenever Tilonalli's Skinshifter attacks, it becomes a copy of another target nonlegendary attacking creature until end of turn.


* If the target of the ability of Tilonalli's Skinshifter becomes an illegal target, Tilonalli's Skinshifter won't become a copy of anything. It will remain a 0/1 attacking creature.
* Tilonalli's Skinshifter copies the printed values of the target creature, plus any copy effects that have been applied to it. It won't copy counters on that creature or effects that have changed its power, toughness, types, color, or so on.
* Notably, Tilonalli's Skinshifter won't copy effects that make a noncreature permanent become a creature. If this causes Tilonalli's Skinshifter to stop being a creature, it's removed from combat.
* If Tilonalli's Skinshifter copies a creature that's copying something else, it will become whatever the target is copying.
* If an effect from a resolving spell or ability, such as that of Rallying Roar, begins to apply to Tilonalli's Skinshifter before it becomes a copy of another creature, that effect will continue to apply.
* Because attackers have already been declared, any abilities Tilonalli's Skinshifter copies that trigger when it or other creatures attack won't trigger.
* Once the ability of Tilonalli's Skinshifter resolves, its new characteristics don't change if the characteristics of the copied creature change or if the copied creature leaves the battlefield.
* Tilonalli's Skinshifter remains a copy of the creature through the end step. Damage is removed from it at the same time that it stops being a copy.

Tishana, Voice of Thunder's power and toughness are each equal to the number of cards in your hand.

When Tishana enters the battlefield, draw a card for each creature you control.

* If Tishana enters the battlefield while you have no cards in hand, it will be put into your graveyard for having 0 toughness before its triggered ability resolves.
* Because damage remains marked on a creature until it's removed as the turn ends, the damage Tishana takes during combat may become lethal if cards leave your hand later in the turn, such as by casting them in your postcombat main phase.

Tocatli Honor Guard  

1W  

Creature — Human Soldier  

1/3  

Creatures entering the battlefield don't cause abilities to trigger.


* Triggered abilities use the word "when," "whenever," or "at." They're usually written as "[Trigger condition], [effect]."
* Replacement effects, such as a permanent entering the battlefield tapped or with counters on it, are unaffected. Abilities that apply "as [this creature] enters the battlefield" are replacement effects.
* Tocatli Honor Guard's ability stops a creature's own enters-the-battlefield triggered abilities as well as other triggered abilities that would trigger when a creature enters the battlefield. This includes abilities that would trigger when Tocatli Honor Guard itself enters the battlefield.
* The trigger event doesn't have to specify "creatures" entering the battlefield. For example, Contraband Kingpin has an ability that says "Whenever an artifact enters the battlefield under your control, scry 1." If an artifact creature enters the battlefield under your control, that ability won't trigger. If a noncreature artifact enters the battlefield under your control, the ability will trigger.
* Look at the permanent as it exists on the battlefield, taking into account continuous effects, to determine whether any triggered abilities will trigger. For example, if you control March of the Machines, which says, in part, "Each noncreature artifact is an artifact creature," each artifact will be a creature at the time it enters the battlefield and will not cause triggered abilities to trigger.
* If Tocatli Honor Guard and another creature enter the battlefield at the same time, neither creature entering the battlefield will cause triggered abilities to trigger.

You'll have to wait until you activate its first ability again.

Each opponent must attack you or a planeswalker you control with at least one creature each combat if able.  

At the beginning of your end step, create a colorless Treasure artifact token with "T, Sacrifice this artifact: Add one mana of any color to your mana pool."


* Each opponent only has to attack you or a planeswalker you control with one creature total, not one creature for you and one for each planeswalker you control. Other creatures are free to attack other players or other planeswalkers, or to not attack at all.
* If a creature isn't able to attack you or a planeswalker you control for any reason (such as being tapped as its controller's declare attackers step begins or being affected by "summoning sickness"), that creature doesn't have to attack. If no creatures a player controls are able to attack you or a planeswalker you control, Trove of Temptation's requirement has no effect during that combat. If there's a cost associated with having a creature attack, its controller isn't forced to pay that cost, so it doesn't have to attack in that case either.
* In a Two-Headed Giant game, each of your two opponents must attack your team or a planeswalker you control with at least one creature if able. Attacking a planeswalker your teammate controls doesn't satisfy Trove of Temptation's requirement. Combat damage from creatures attacking your team may be assigned to your teammate.

If, on the other hand, the target is a legal target but isn't destroyed (most likely because it has indestructible), you will get a Treasure.
* For a player's life total to become 1, what actually happens is that the player loses the appropriate amount of life (or in some rare cases, gains the appropriate amount of life). For example, if the targeted player's life total is 4 when this ability resolves, that player loses 3 life. Other cards that interact with life loss will interact with this effect accordingly.

* The land-animation effect lasts indefinitely. It doesn't wear off during the cleanup step or when you lose control of Waker of the Wilds.
* If the ability targets a land that's already a creature, that land creature's base power and toughness will become 0/0, overwriting its previous base power and toughness. Other effects that modify its power and/or toughness (including any +1/+1 counters that were on it) will continue to apply.

Wildgrowth Walker  

1G  

Creature — Elemental  

1/3  

Whenever a creature you control explores, put a +1/+1 counter on Wildgrowth Walker and you gain 3 life.


* If a creature leaves the battlefield before an effect instructs it to explore, it still explores. Effects that trigger when a creature you control explores, such as that of Wildgrowth Walker, trigger if appropriate.
* If Wildgrowth Walker leaves the battlefield while its triggered ability is on the stack, you won't put a +1/+1 counter on anything but you will gain 3 life.
