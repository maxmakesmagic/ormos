When I'm on the road with other **Magic** players, we loved to prove our superiority. One of the main ways I did this since college was to challenge friends to name a card using as little information as possible.


Now you can play this in a handful of ways. My group of friends usually would just have the moderator provide one piece of information off the card at a time, allowing people to guess. I know another group of friends would have the moderator provide them usually the set, and they would bid how many pieces of information they thought they needed before they could identify the card.


Well, I'm just back from a long trip and I didn't get to play the game while travelling so it's time to fill that need!


What will happen is you will be able to reveal hints in succession, one at a time, and once you think you know what card I'm talking about you click the button to reveal the answer and see if you're right!

Ready to try some more? I'll change up the order of clues so you won't always follow the same order as above, but I believe enough information is always provided to identify the card (assuming you know it; some of these you probably won't.)

In terms of time-wasting, with a group of friends who play lots of **Magic**, this can burn hours off a trip. Seeking inspiration to play with your friends? Might I suggest the "Random" link on Gatherer?
