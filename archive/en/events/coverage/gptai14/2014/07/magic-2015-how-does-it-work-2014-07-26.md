At these events, we're always trying to find smart and talented *Magic* players to talk to, and we're never short of candidates, but we seldom ever turn the camera inwards to look at ourselves. I used to be good at *Magic*. I mean kinda good, not great. Good for New Zealand, but being a father now, and pretending to be a grown-up, I don't have nearly as much time to play as I once did.


Chapman Sim however, my right hand man this weekend, is still well and truly in the thick of it, and will be competing at Pro Tour *Magic 2015* in Portland next weekend. He's done more *Magic 2015* drafts than most of the players who made Day 2 this weekend, and I thought, you know what? I should ask HIM about this format.

**Ray "blisterguy" Walkinshaw:** "So Chapman, I'm an old man now and can't keep up with the hip competitive kids out there. Tell me about *Magic 2015* draft."


**Chapman Sim:** "It's probably faster than you think. Most people seem to be picking slower and more controlling cards at the moment, but I think the format's faster than people realize."


**blisterguy:** "What's the best color in draft?"


**Chaps:** "Definitely Red."


**blisterguy:** "and the second best?"


**The Chapmeister:** "White."


**blisterguy:** "So does that mean the best color combination is Red-White?"


**The Chaptastic Machine:** "Maybe, or at least anything with either Red or White in it."


**blisterguy:** "What's the most underrated card in *Magic 2015* draft?"


**The Chapiest Chap you'll ever meet:** "It's probably... wait, I'm not telling you that, I want to be able to draft them next weekend, hahaha."


**blisterguy:** "What a tease."
