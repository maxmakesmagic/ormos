![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/ptven03/a874.jpg)Kai Budde of Germany and Jeff Cunningham of Canada are great for this game. Both are accomplished players, frequent Internet strategy writers, and perfect gentlemen when at the table. 

Of course, being gentlemen usually means the banter will be at a minimum, which was certainly true for this match.

Kai is playing a three-color [Biorhythm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Biorhythm) deck, and Cunningham—one of the last true beatdown players in the world—is with Goblins. Both snuck into Day 2 with 4-2-1 records, and neither is looking forward to any more losses.

### Game 1

Cunningham opened with a trio of 1/1's—[Goblin Sledder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Sledder), [Sparksmith](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sparksmith), and [Skirk Prospector](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skirk+Prospector). Kai had just what he needed on turn 3, a [Slice and Dice](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Slice+and+Dice), leaving just the 'Smith alive.

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/ptven03/a876.jpg)Cunningham had just the man he needed to keep up what little momentum he had left—[Goblin Goon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Goon). Kai was distressed, and had no play other that [Explosive Vegetation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Explosive+Vegetation), which let the Goon and the 'Smith—aided by [Goblin Burrows](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Burrows)—smack him down to 6. Kai played a [Krosan Tusker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Krosan+Tusker) on his next turn, but Cunningham had the goods: [Clickslither](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Clickslither) and [Goblin Sledder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Sledder). Haste is good.

Cunningham 1 – Budde 0

### Game 2

Cunningham had a really slow start in game 2—just a [Goblin Piledriver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Piledriver) in the first three turns—and Kai punished him for it with a [Wall of Mulch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wall+of+Mulch), cycled Tusker, and a [Ravenous Baloth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ravenous+Baloth). Cunningham got right back in the mix, however, with [Clickslither](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Clickslither); he effectively traded his Piledriver for Kai's Baloth when he attacked.

Kai did nothing but play a land on his fifth turn, and Cunningham dispatched of Kai's Wall with [Clickslither](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Clickslither) and a [Shock](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shock) before adding a [Goblin Goon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Goon) to his side. Kai cycled [Akroma's Vengeance](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Akroma%27s+Vengeance) and again did nothing on his sixth turn.

Cunningham thought for a few minutes about how best to play around Kai's arsenal of mass destruction, and decided his best course of action was to go for the throat. He played land number 6 and [Rorix Bladewing](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rorix+Bladewing), giving him 15 points of offense. Kai killed the [Clickslither](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Clickslither) with a Startstorm for 3, but still took a big hit from the other two and was down to 11 life.

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/ptven03/a877.jpg)Kai played the anti-Goon technology [Broodhatch Nantuko](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Broodhatch+Nantuko) on his next turn and left five land untapped. Cunningham had more juice, though, dropping another [Clickslither](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Clickslither) and sending the team. Kai did what he had to, and blocked the Goon. If Cunningham sacrificed the Goon to the 'Slither, Kai could [Starstorm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Starstorm) for three in response and come out in good shape. Cunningham bit the bullet and let Kai get six 1/1 Insect tokens and drop to two life.

Kai swung in with the Insects and then Startstormed the board clean when Cunningham declared his next attack. Cunningham had an [Avarax](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Avarax) which he played after combat, but Kai had another Startstorm on his next turn. But the problem with [Avarax](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Avarax) is that they come with friends, and Kai had no answer for the replacement.

**Final Result:** Cunningham 2 – Budde 0
