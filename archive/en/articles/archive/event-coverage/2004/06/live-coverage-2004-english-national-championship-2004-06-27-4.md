After day 1 these are the only remaining undefeated players, both sitting on a 6-0-1 record. Neil's past include top eight's in Grand Prix Birmingham (1998 in tempest block constructed) and Manchester for which the format was Invasion Block limited. Steven Williams is a pleasant player, originally from the Isle of Wight he has been playing tournaments for a year or two, but has never achieved a top finish until now. ### Game 1


![Relic Barrier](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Relic+Barrier)
Steven starts with [Relic Barrier](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Relic+Barrier) which faced off against Neil's [Leaden Myr](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leaden+Myr), [Emissary of Hope](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Emissary+of+Hope) started to beat Neil down, whilst he played out an [Ouphe Vandals](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ouphe+Vandals) and an [Arcbound Hybrid](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arcbound+Hybrid). The next turn Steven made the impressive play of [Acquire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Acquire) for Razormain Masticore, Neil had [Rebuking Ceremony](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rebuking+Ceremony) in hand but a tap from the [Relic Barrier](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Relic+Barrier) on the [Leaden Myr](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leaden+Myr) delayed it for a turn. This was all Steven needed Hoverguard observer joined his team and next turn [Stir the Pride](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stir+the+Pride) finished Neil.


Steven Williams Leads 1-0


### Game 2


In between games Neil mentioned that green was really underdrafted and he was able to get 12th pick [Creeping Mold](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Creeping+Mold) amongst many other gems. Steven had a great draw this game with turn 2 [Thought Courier](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thought+Courier), turn 3 Emissary of hope and turn 4 [Hoverguard Observer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hoverguard+Observer), but Neil's [Lose Hope](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lose+Hope) and [Barter in Blood](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Barter+in+Blood) topped this. Next turn it appeared that the Barter had really hurt when Steven, just dropped [Horned Helm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Horned+Helm) and [Vulshok Morningstar](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vulshok+Morningstar) against Neil's [Scavenging Scarab](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scavenging+Scarab), but he had a [Pteron Ghost](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pteron+Ghost) (quite impressive due to the Equipment) and [Goblin Dirigible](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Dirigible). Neil's deck could Find no way to answer those beasts and his attempts to race were stymied by a Sunbeam Spell Bomb and Leonine Den Guard.


Steven wins 2-0
