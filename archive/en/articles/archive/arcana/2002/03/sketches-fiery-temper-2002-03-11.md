Today's card is *Torment*'s [Fiery Temper](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fiery+Temper), by the Brothers Hildebrandt. Greg and Tim are forty-year veterans of fantasy art.

### 1. Art Description

These are the instructions given to the artist:

"This card should show a red wizard casting a spell which causes its victim to burn. The main focus of this card is the fact that the wizard is a psychopath and that he is enjoying his work."

### 2. Sketch

This is the preliminary sketch submitted by Greg Hildebrandt. It is very quick and rough, but with a portfolio like theirs, the art department knows the final product will look good. The card was called "Sear" in its earliest incarnation.

### 3. Final Art

Here is a large version of their final painting.

### 4. Card

Finally, here is the card as you all know it today.
