### The Story


David and Goliath. William Jensen is a Hall of Famer and widely considered one of the Top 5 Limited players of all time. Edgar Magalhaes is an amateur taking his first steps into the professional world. Welcome to the big leagues, kid.

*William Jensen*

Magalhaes has drafted a Green-Black deck with a white splash. Jensen drafted his favorite deck in the format: Blue-Black Card Advantage. [Mnemonic Wall](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mnemonic+Wall) seems to be his signature card for the format.


### The Match


Magalhaes started the first game on the offensive. He played out turn-two [Fleecemane Lion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fleecemane+Lion) and then [Agent of Horizons](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Agent+of+Horizons). Jensen summoned [Blood-Toll Harpy](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood-Toll+Harpy) and traded it off for the 3/2. Magalhaes had another copy at the ready. Jensen put up [Sealock Monster](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sealock+Monster) as a roadblock. Magalhaes made his [Fleecemane Lion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fleecemane+Lion) monstrous. Still it looked like a comfortable spot for Jensen. [Pharika's Cure](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pharika%27s+Cure) took care of the second Agent and they both built up their forces.

*Edgar Magalhaes*

That all changed when Magalhaes tapped four and bestowed [Hopeful Eidolon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hopeful+Eidolon) on his Lion. Jensen could hide behind his monstrous [Sealock Monster](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sealock+Monster), but Magalhaes would be gaining five life a turn. Victory by damage was soon out the window as an option. Jensen dug through his deck with [Read the Bones](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Read+the+Bones), and came up with [Returned Centaur](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Returned+Centaur). He used its ability to mill Magalhaes for four. Magalhaes played his last card, a [Scholar of Athreos](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scholar+of+Athreos), but Jensen had [Sip of Hemlock](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sip+of+Hemlock) at the ready.


But it wasn't going to be a cakewalk for Jensen. Magalhaes's next draw was a [Lash of the Whip](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lash+of+the+Whip) that took out the [Sealock Monster](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sealock+Monster) after blocking. Now the [Fleecemane Lion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fleecemane+Lion) would act as [The Abyss](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=The+Abyss). Time was running out for Jensen. He spent his removal well, buying the maximum turns. He needed [March of the Returned](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=March+of+the+Returned) to get back his [Returned Centaur](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Returned+Centaur) and mill Magalhaes out. He drew it slowly... [Insatiable Harpy](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Insatiable+Harpy)! Enough to buy one more turn. It was all or nothing. He drew again. [March of the Returned](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=March+of+the+Returned)!


Jensen 1 - Magalhaes 0


Magalhaes mulliganed for the second game and started slowly. His [Agent of Horizons](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Agent+of+Horizons) fell to [Stymied Hopes](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stymied+Hopes) from Jensen. Jensen untapped and played [Burnished Hart](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Burnished+Hart), but had to take a turn off to search up lands because his hand was all spells. Magalhaes played out a few creatures but nothing too threatening. That is until the [Fleecemane Lion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fleecemane+Lion) reappeared. It went Monstrous before Jensen could remove it. Magalhaes had just two cards in hand, so Jensen went for [Psychic Intrusion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psychic+Intrusion). They were both good ones: [Reaper of the Wilds](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reaper+of+the+Wilds) and [Hopeful Eidolon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hopeful+Eidolon). After what happened in the first game, Jensen was fine leaving him with the Eidolon.


Would it be a replay of the game one? This time Jensen's big defensive creature was [Shipbreaker Kraken](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shipbreaker+Kraken), and Magalhaes was unable to break through. Jensen was scrying through his deck with the help of the stolen [Reap](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reap)er of the wilds. Soon he had [March of the Returned](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=March+of+the+Returned) and [Mnemonic Wall](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mnemonic+Wall) to go with his [Returned Centaur](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Returned+Centaur). Jensen was at a low life total, though, so it looked like there was a chance for Magalhaes's topdecked [Scholar of Athreos](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scholar+of+Athreos) to steal a win, but Jensen's deck served up [Sip of Hemlock](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sip+of+Hemlock) to shut the door.


Jensen 2 - Magalhaes 0


### The Aftermath


Shortly after the match, Sam Black came up to Jensen and asked how the match went. "Well, both games he had [Fleecemane Lion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fleecemane+Lion), monstrous, with [Hopeful Eidolon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hopeful+Eidolon) on it against my blue-black deck so, yeah I won."
