**Name:** Patrick Tierney


**Age:** 23


**Occupation** Software Engineer


**Hometown:** Seattle


**Previous Magic Accomplishments:** Three Grand Prix Top 8s


**What deck did you play this weekend and why?**  

Jeskai. I wanted to play something wacky, but I have great friends and they made play the deck I have the most experience with.


**What was the best card in your main deck and why?**  
[Mana Leak](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak). Many opponents cast their best spell into two open mana because [Logic Knot](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Logic+Knot) wouldn't counter it but Leak did.


**Did any cards or decks surprise you?**  
[Teferi, Hero of Dominaria](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Teferi%2C+Hero+of+Dominaria) was a lot better than I expected it to be.


**What's the best part about a Magic Grand Prix weekend in Vegas?**  

Getting to cube with all my Magic friends who live all over the country.


**What does this Top 8 mean to you?**  

This Top 8 gets me invites to the next three Pro Tours, none of which I was qualified for, so it means the world to me.

KCI!

**Hometown:** Czech Republic


**Previous Magic Accomplishments:** Hall of Fame class of 2017. Three Pro Tour Top 8s, 30th GP Top 8.


**What deck did you play this weekend and why?**  

Humans. I mostly just wanted to play the Limited GP so I just figured I'd take it easy and play a good aggressive deck with no preparation. It worked out pretty well.


**What was the best card in your main deck and why?**  
[Mantis Rider](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mantis+Rider). It usually came from the top when I needed it.


**Did any cards or decks surprise you?**  

Not really.


**What's the best part about a Magic Grand Prix weekend in Vegas?**  

I get to draft with *Limited Edition Beta* packs on Sunday.

30 is a nice number.

**Hometown:** Brisbane, Australia (but I live in Sydney).

**What deck did you play this weekend and why?**  

Mono-Green Tron. It is my favorite deck, and one I stick with most of the time.


**What was the best card in your main deck and why?**  
[Ugin, the Spirit Dragon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ugin%2C+the+Spirit+Dragon). With a lot of Humans and Mardu Pyromancer in the field, Ugin has performed very well.


**Did any cards or decks surprise you?**  

Not really - the decks are pretty well-known.


**What's the best part about a Magic Grand Prix weekend in Vegas?**  

Making Top 8 for the first time! It's also my first Grand Prix outside of Australia, and everyone was very friendly and great to play.


**What does this Top 8 mean to you?**  

A lot. I've been playing on and off for 22 years. I've never been super competitive, but it means a lot after traveling a long way.

**Name:** Max Mick


**Age:** 16


**Occupation** Teenager


**Hometown:** San Diego


**Previous Magic Accomplishments:** Top 4 Grand Prix Portland

Tron, because I had finals and playing decks other than Tron is hard without testing.


**What was the best card in your main deck and why?**  

The all-powerful Karn father, glory be upon thee.


**Did any cards or decks surprise you?**  
[Surgical Extraction](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Surgical+Extraction) is good.


**What's the best part about a Magic Grand Prix weekend in Vegas?**  

The food!


**What does this Top 8 mean to you?**  

Money, Pro Tour, being able to play Battlebond tomorrow instead of doing the PTQ.

**Name:** Ben Friedman


**Age:** 25


**Occupation** Crypto Pauper


**Hometown:** Las Vegas


**Previous Magic Accomplishments:** Four Grand Prix Top 8s, consistently mediocre on the Pro Tour. Chief contributor to BarnyardMTG.net!


**What deck did you play this weekend and why?**  

Grixis Shadow. Everyone, including my editor at StarCityGames.com, told me it was unplayable. It has no good matchups but it somehow wins.


**What was the best card in your main deck and why?**  
[Mishra's Bauble](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mishra%27s+Bauble). Paying mana for things is more outdated than KONY 2012.


**Did any cards or decks surprise you?**  

My good friend and neighbor Rob Pisano played against a deck with the following cards: [Grave Titan](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grave+Titan). [Esper Charm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Esper+Charm). [Disallow](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Disallow). [Reflecting Pool](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reflecting+Pool). What a throwback!


**What's the best part about a Magic Grand Prix weekend in Vegas?**  

I am hosting no fewer than 12 dirty boys at my mansion this weekend. Shoutout to Wallace the GOATs.


**What does this Top 8 mean to you?**  

I will conduct myself with dignity and maturity at the house party being thrown at my palace this evening.

**Name:** Luke Renaud


**Age:** 21


**Occupation** Student


**Hometown:** Kelowna, BC, Canada


**Previous Magic Accomplishments:** Lost a bunch of win-and-ins.


**What deck did you play this weekend and why?**  

Devoted Company. It's my pet deck and I like making huge numbers to cast [Walking Ballista](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Walking+Ballista). It's also good in this meta minus a couple dodgy matchups.


**What was the best card in your main deck and why?**  
[Selfless Spirit](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Selfless+Spirit). I went from one to three in the 75 - the deck is a combo deck, and protecting the combo is better than having a mediocre backup plan.


**Did any cards or decks surprise you?**  

Nothing really.


**What's the best part about a Magic Grand Prix weekend in Vegas?**  

I win, we go out and have a good time, I lose and we go out and have a good time.


**What does this Top 8 mean to you?**  

It still hasn't hit me yet - it's literally what I dream of.
