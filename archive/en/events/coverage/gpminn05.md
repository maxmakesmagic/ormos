GRAND PRIX MINNEAPOLIS 2005
---------------------------


Comeback Kid Controls Minneapolis!
==================================




July 15-17











![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gpmin05/fin.jpg)Six years ago, Alex Lieberman swept through day one of U.S. Nationals to qualify for the pre-Masters U.S. Booster Challenge at the age of 13. Soon thereafter, with his JSS eligibility lost, he dropped off the face of the competitive **Magic** world. Now, he's back with a vengeance with a championship trophy to take home.


Lieberman defeated Mark Herberholz 2-1 in a great final pitting the deck of the tournament, black-green [Gifts Ungiven](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gifts+Ungiven), against itself in a virtual mirror match. A crushing control deck with sweeping effects, Gifts has become one of the most important cards in the format, built with other control decks in mind. Apparently, the idea was a fruitful one.


White Weenie placed 29 players in Day Two, but none could crack the final. Lieberman takes home $2400 for his two days of pain, not to mention a shiny new trophy and a lot of credit for one hell of a comeback. Congratulations Alex, just six years later, you're a champion again.
