A First Look at Innistrad: Midnight Hunt and Innistrad: Crimson Vow
===================================================================



 Posted in **News**
 on August 5, 2021

 Stybs has played Magic the world over, writing and drafting as part of the event coverage team and slinging Commander everywhere his decks will fit. 






A chill wind blows, howling through the trees. The last ember of twilight flickers out as you fumble to light your torch. Striking sparks turn from sprays—bursts of light that sputter and quickly fade.


Strike. Strike. Strike. *Crunch*.


The sound of dry twigs and fallen leaves breaking somewhere in the woods does nothing to steady your hands.


Strike. Strike. Strike. *Snap*.


For a moment, the wind falls silent. The punch of the shattered branch could just be the season marking its change—but it's not a chance you want to take.


Strike. Strike. Strike. Sparks finally catch hold as the sooty end of your torch flares and settles into a familiar orange glow. It's time to find yourself at home before something finds you.


Welcome back to Innistrad.

We met the horrors of the night when we first arrived with *Innistrad*. The forces of darkness pushed humans to the brink with *Dark Ascension.* The champion of humanity's protection returned from the Helvault in *Avacyn Restored*.


Then, the world began to change. Something beyond the evils of night warped mysterious new terrors and corrupted the guardian Avacyn in *Shadows over Innistrad*. A twist of fate brought more outsiders to Innistrad, and the creatures of the night reclaimed their dominance of the dark as the warping force vanished during *Eldritch Moon*.


Without Avacyn to protect Innistrad, the balance shifts further as dusk to dawn is filled again with everything that hungers for humans.

The monsters we first met on Innistrad are what remain—and they hunger for more.


[*Innistrad: Midnight Hunt*](https://magic.wizards.com/products/midnight-hunt) and [*Innistrad: Crimson Vow*](https://magic.wizards.com/products/crimson-vow) breathe new life—and *unlife*—into everything that made Innistrad so foreboding and grim. And we're so excited to be going back that both sets are a celebration unto themselves.


![MID Logo](https://media.wizards.com/2021/images/daily/EN_usydEys8Ds.png)


*Innistrad: Midnight Hunt* begins our new story ripped right from the worries of Innistrad's populace: a night that may never end. With the sun rising later and setting sooner each day, they turn to the hope of the Harvesttide festival and a ritual with warlocks to maintain the balance.


![Join the Dance](https://media.wizards.com/2021/mid/en_kr7wFIHjUO.png)


Despite plenty of werewolves and other denizens of the night, there's strength and hope for the humans gathered deep in the woods of the Kessig countryside. But the story doesn't end there with one bonfire of a party.


![VOW Logo](https://media.wizards.com/2021/images/daily/EN_AuuDse92Ds.png)


Those that stalk from shadows aren't just the mindless zombies and frenetic werewolves, but also the eternally undead with calculating, grand designs of their own. Why would every vampire that one can imagine unite for an ultra-exclusive wedding and reception everyone is dying to attend? *Innistrad: Crimson Vow* will answer that—and more.

Together, [*Innistrad: Midnight Hunt*](https://magic.wizards.com/products/midnight-hunt) and [*Innistrad: Crimson Vow*](https://magic.wizards.com/products/crimson-vow) revisit what we learned first about Innistrad, showing us again why the wisest humans there never stop fearing nightfall.

Commander Party
===============


With everything to look forward to, it wouldn't be fair to limit the celebrations to those in the story! Taking place at WPN Premium stores near you, a Commander Party offers a new kind of event to celebrate our return to Innistrad, where you'll join a faction and jump into a story experienced through Commander play.


We'll share the participation promo and more information about Commander Party events closer to when they'll take place: October 30–31.
