**ae·o·li·pile**

![Aeolipile](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Aeolipile)  
 From Webster's Revised Unabridged Dictionary:  
 Variant(s): or **e·o·li·pile**  
 Function: noun  
 Etymology: Latin *aeolipilae*; *Aeolus* god of the winds + *pila* a ball  
 : an apparatus consisting chiefly of a closed vessel (as a globe or cylinder) with one or more projecting bent tubes, through which steam is made to pass from the vessel, causing it to revolve. Such an apparatus was first described by Hero of Alexandria in ~200 B.C. It has often been called the first steam engine.
 **A·mu·ga·ba![Amugaba](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Amugaba)**  
 From Rei Nakazawa, **Magic** creative text writer:  
Function: noun  
 Etymology: Like many **Magic** card names, Amugaba has its roots in a foreign language - in this case from the Ugandan name *Mugaba*. The naming team thought *Mugaba* meant "one whose animal totem is an eel," and thus would have been very appropriate for the card. However, upon closer inspection of the research source, they realized that they had looked at the wrong entry! *Mugaba* really meant "given by God," and the name that corresponded with eel-totem was actually *Mubiru*. Regardless, they decided that "Amugaba" sounded better than "Amubiru," so the name was kept.


**an·u·rid**

![Anurid Scavenger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Anurid+Scavenger)  
 From Rei Nakazawa, **Magic** creative text writer:  
 Function: noun  
 Etymology: Like *cephalid* and *aven* before it, *anurid* comes from a species related name, in this case *anuran*, which is the name of the order of animal that include frogs and toads.
 **a·qua·moe·ba**

![Aquamoeba](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Aquamoeba)  
 From Rei Nakazawa, **Magic** creative text writer:  
 Function: noun  
 Etymology: Splitting this word up in half will make it a lot easier to see its origin: *aqua-*, meaning "water," and *amoeba*, a primitive life form which is often thought of as shapeless and changing.
 **ark**

![Ark of Blight](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Ark+of+Blight)

 From Merriam-Webster Online:

 From Rei Nakazawa, **Magic** creative text writer:  
Function: noun  
 Etymology: Like the atogs, the *Odyssey* lhurgoyfs were named with their abilities in mind. For example, Cantivore was derived from the word *incantation*, which has a very strong magical feel to it. Thus, a Cantivore derives power from magical energy, which is one way to describe what enchantments would be in the "real" world. Along the same lines, [Magnivore](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Magnivore) takes its root from *magnify*, which describes what happens to emotions in red, and so on.


**ceph·a·lid**

![Llawan, Cephalid Empress](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Llawan%2C+Cephalid+Empress)  
 From Rei Nakazawa, **Magic** creative text writer:  
 Function: noun  
 Etymology: Both of the major new species introduced in *Odyssey* are named after the type of animal they're based on. "Aven," of course, comes from the word *avian*, as in *bird*. "Cephalid" is derived in much the same way from *cephalopod*, which is the class of animal that includes squid, cuttlefish, and octopi.
 **Chlor·o·phant**

![Chlorophant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Chlorophant)  
 From Rei Nakazawa, **Magic** creative text writer:  
 Function: noun  
 Etymology: It's pretty easy to see where this name came from if you divide it in half: first, there's *chloro-*, as in "chlorophyll," so this is a being made out of plant matter. Then there's *-phant*, as in "elephant," signaling that this creature can get pretty big, which it can.
 **did·ger·i·doo**

![Didgeridoo](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Didgeridoo)  
 From Merriam-Webster Online:

 From Merriam-Webster Online:  
 Function: noun  
 Inflected Form(s): plural **eddies**  
 Etymology: Middle English (Scots dialect) *ydy*, probably from Old Norse *itha*  
 Date: 15th century  
 1 a : a current of water or air running contrary to the main current; especially : a circular current : whirlpool b : something moving similarly  
 2 : a contrary or circular current (as of thought or policy)
 **Ee·sha**

![Commander Eesha](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Commander+Eesha)  
 From Rei Nakazawa, **Magic** creative text writer: Function: proper noun  
 Etymology: Character names sometimes take even more time to create than normal card names. The original "placeholder" name given to this character by *Judgment* author Will McDermott was "Killian." However, the naming team decided it was too based in real world culture, clashing too much with Kirtar and Teroh. "Eesha" was chosen for a few reasons: the "a" ending is generally feminine, reflecting this character's gender; the long "e" sounds in the name echo bird calls, and the name in general sounds softer than those of her two predecessors, hinting at her (somewhat) more reasonable personality.
 **e·pi·cen·ter**

![Epicenter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Epicenter)

 **Gur·zi·gost**

![Gurzigost](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Gurzigost)  
 From Rei Nakazawa, **Magic** creative text writer:  
 Function: noun  
 Etymology: This is one of the rare cases with absolutely no etymology behind it; Brady Dommermuth (**Magic**'s creative director) just started going crazy with syllables and such on the white board, and eventually came up with something cool-sounding that we liked.

 **Hyp·nox**

![Hypnox](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Hypnox)  
 From Rei Nakazawa, **Magic** creative text writer:  
 Function: noun  
 Etymology: The first half of the word comes from "hypnosis," which is a pretty mild way of saying what happens when this guy makes someone remove his entire hand from the game. As for the second half, well, the folks responsible for names always joke that certain letters just make names sound cool by their mere presence, letters like "K," "Z," and, yes, "X." This is probably one of those names that proves the joke true.
 **hy·po·chon·dria**

![Hypochondria](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Hypochondria)  
 From Merriam-Webster Online:

 **I·chor·id**

![Ichorid](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Ichorid)  
 From Rei Nakazawa, **Magic** creative text writer:  
 Function: noun  
 Etymology: Can't figure out how to pronounce this name? It'll help if you know the root word, *ichor*, which means "a watery, acrid discharge from a wound or ulcer." Since this horrific creature feeds on the recently dead, it would feed on ichor, therefore its name.
 **in·sid·i·ous**

![Insidious Dreams](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Insidious+Dreams)  
 From Merriam-Webster Online:  
Function: adjective

 From [www.kidscosmos.org:](http://www.kidscosmos.org:)

 From Rei Nakazawa, **Magic** creative text writer:  
 Function: proper noun  
 Etymology: This sly, sinister character's name is a fusion of two pieces: *aqua*, which means water, and *loquacious*, which means "talkative." Since Laquatus is an underwater being who uses a lot of talk to get what he wants, this name describes him quite well.
 **leg·er·de·main**

![Legerdemain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Legerdemain)  
 From Merriam-Webster Online:

 **Ma·ro**

![Maro](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Maro)  
 From Mark Rosewater, the original Maro:  
 Function: noun  
 Etymology: During the development of *Mirage*, the team created a hole in rare green. I happened to have a cool idea for a creature. Bill Rose, the lead developer of *Mirage,* wrote down the card and labeled it "Maro," the letters he typed in when he wished to send me an internal email. Once you had enough unique letters, the program would fill in the name. Maro got you Mark Rosewater (the first two letters of each of my names.) The name stuck, and thus the Maro was born.
 **Mas·ti·core![Masticore](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Masticore)**  
 From Rei Nakazawa, **Magic** creative text writer:  
Function: noun  
 Etymology: Masticore is based off of two words. It looks like a *manticore*, a mythological creature with the head/body of a lion and the tail of a scorpion, which has appeared on **Magic** cards in the past. But the name is also based off the word *masticate*, meaning "to eat," which is incidentally what the Masticore is doing in the art: eating that metal object.


**me·grim**

![Megrim](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Megrim)  
 From Merriam-Webster Online:  
 Function: noun

![Metathran Elite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Metathran+Elite)  
 From Rei Nakazawa, **Magic** creative text writer:  
 Function: noun  
 Etymology: When Urza was first forming his plan to fight the Phyrexians, he decided to create artificial beings to fight the artificial beings the Phyrexians had made themselves. He called them "Metathran" after the prefix "meta-," which is often used to indicate change, and "Thran," which is the name of the long-dead race the Phyrexians belonged to before they turned themselves into half-mechanical monstrosities.
 **mor·ti·pho·bia**

![Mortiphobia](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Mortiphobia)  
 From Rei Nakazawa, Magic creative text writer:  
 Function: noun  
 Etymology: Although it looks like a real word because of its recognizable roots, it really isn't. *Mort* means "death," and *phobia* means "fear," so this card expresses a "fear of death," which is probably what the poor cards in graveyard that get removed are feeling. But this word demonstrates just how convincing made-up words can sound if already know the roots.
 **na·bob**

![Squee, Goblin Nabob](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Squee%2C+Goblin+Nabob)

 **ni·sho·ba**

![Sabertooth Nishoba](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Sabertooth+Nishoba)  
 From Rei Nakazawa, **Magic** creative text writer:  
 Function: noun  
 Etymology: According to Bill "Quill" McQuillan, who was on the *Invasion* naming team, the word came from a foreign name (possibly Native American) that means "wolf," or is connected to the wolf somehow, and the team modified it into "nishoba." This explains why the creature looks somewhat like a cross between a wolf and a sabertooth tiger. Unfortunately, what language the original word was from, and what form it had, has been lost to the mists of time.

**Pheld·da·grif**

![Phelddagrif](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Phelddagrif)  
 From Mark Rosewater, R&D senior designer:  
 Function: noun  
 Etymology: When the *Ice Age/Alliances* story was being fleshed out, someone came up with the word "Phelddagrif" as an anagram of "Garfield, PhD" and thought it would be a good card name as a "hidden" tribute to Richard Garfield, the game's creator. Originally the name was given to the planeswalker-goddess that would eventually be known as Freyalise, but the continuity director at the time hated it. "'Phelddagrif' doesn't sound like a nature goddess," he said, "it sounds like… like… some kind of flying purple hippo!" And thus Phelddagrif was born!
 **pitch·stone**

![Pitchstone Wall](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Pitchstone+Wall)  
 From Webster's 1998 Revised Unabridged Dictionary:

 **Pulse·mage**

![Pulsemage Advocate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Pulsemage+Advocate)  
 From Rei Nakazawa, **Magic** creative text writer:  
 Function: noun  
 : a school of magic that specializes in resurrection spells  
 Etymology: Each Advocate has a name reflecting what it, and all creatures that carry the word in the future, generally do with its ability. So creatures with the word "Forcemage" in their names will probably belong or work in the Forcemage school of magic, and thus pump power and toughness. "Pulsemage" similarly will convey resurrection. Creative Text wanted a set of names that could carry certain types of abilities throughout different sets and different colors, and schools of magic seemed to be a good way to do it.
 **quay**

![Seafarer's Quay](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Seafarer%27s+Quay)  
 From Merriam Webster Online:  
 Function: noun

 - **revenant** adjective
 **Roh·gahh**

![Rohgahh of Kher Keep](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Rohgahh+of+Kher+Keep)  
 From Steve Conard, *Legends* designer:  
 Function: proper noun  
 Etymology: Rohgahh's original name was "Ur-aah-ah of Kher Keep". We wanted a name that was unpronounceable by humans; it was meant to be a guttural-sounding name. During the editing process it was changed to "Uriah of Kher Keep". That name was laughable as it sounded like "Uriah Heep of Kher Keep" (Uriah Heep is the name of a band and a character in Dickens' *David Copperfield*). The name was subsequently changed to Rohgahh, which was a fine guttural compromise.
 **root·wal·la**

![Rootwalla](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Rootwalla)  
 From Rei Nakazawa, **Magic** creative text writer:  
 Function: noun  
 Etymology: When this now-popular creature was first concepted for *Tempest*, it was called "Chuckwalla," which is a type of American Southwestern desert lizard. Unfortunately, the name was so specific that it didn't exactly match the art that was finally returned. In the end, the naming team decided to alter the name slightly so they wouldn't create a contradiction with the art.
 **row·en![Rowen](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Rowen)**  
 From Merriam-Webster Online:  
Function: noun  
 1 : a second-growth crop  
Etymology: Middle English *rowein*, from (assumed) Old North French *rewain*; akin to Old French *regaïn* aftermath, from *re- + gaïn* aftermath, of Germanic origin; akin to Old High German *weida* pasture, *weidanOn* to hunt for food  
 Date: 15th century


**Sarc·a·tog![Sarcatog](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Sarcatog)**  
 From Rei Nakazawa, **Magic** creative text writer:  
 Function: noun  
 Etymology: Previous atogs, with the exception of[Atog](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Atog), had some indication of what they ate in their name. ([Auratog](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Auratog), for example, ate enchantments.) The naming team decided to do the same for the new *Odyssey* atogs. However, since these guys ate two things, the job was a lot more difficult. *Sarc-* means "flesh," so Sarc-atog eats the "flesh of the dead," or cards in the graveyard. However, because of words like *sarcophagus*, sarc- also brings up images of the grave itself. Thus, this atog eats both the dead *and* the artifacts they're buried with.


**scab·land**

![Scabland](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Scabland)  
 From Merriam-Webster Online:  
 Function: noun  
 Date: 1904  
 : a region characterized by elevated tracts of rocky land with little or no soil cover and traversed or isolated by postglacial dry stream channels -- usually used in plural
 **scal·pe·lex·is**

![Scalpelexis](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Scalpelexis)  
 From Rei Nakazawa, **Magic** creative text writer:  
 Function: noun  
 Etymology: The name for this unusual beastie came only after long wrangling with various word roots. *Scalpel-* comes from both "scalp" (as in what this thing lands on and what it drains from) and the surgical instrument (since it slices out bits of knowledge). The ending, *-lexis*, doesn't come from the car, but the word for "word," as in, oddly enough, "lexicon." Again, this emphasizes what the beast robs from the hapless opponent.
 **sci·on**

![Yavimaya Scion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Yavimaya+Scion)  
 From Merriam-Webster Online:  
 Function: noun  
 Etymology: Middle English, from Middle French *cion*, of Germanic origin; akin to Old High German *chInan* to sprout, split open, Old English *cInan* to gape  
 Date: 13th century  
 1 : a detached living portion of a plant joined to a stock in grafting and usually supplying solely aerial parts to a graft  
 2 : descendant; child
 **sco·ri·a**

![Scoria Wurm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Scoria+Wurm)  
 From Merriam-Webster Online:  
 Function: noun  
 Inflected Form(s): plural **sco·ri·ae**  
 Etymology: Middle English, from Latin, from Greek *skOria*, from *skOr* excrement  
 Date: 14th century  
 1 : the refuse from melting of metals or reduction of ores : slag  
 2 : rough vesicular cindery lava  
 - **sco·ri·a·ceous** adjective
 **scriv·en·er![Scrivener](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Scrivener)**  
 From Merriam-Webster Online:  
Function: noun  
 1 : a professional or public copyist or writer : scribe  
 2 : notary public  
 Etymology: Middle English *scriveiner*, alteration of *scrivein*, from Middle French *escrivein*, from (assumed) Vulgar Latin *scriban-*, *scriba*, alteration of Latin *scriba* scribe  
 Date: 14th century


**scu·tum**

![Phyrexian Scuta](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Phyrexian+Scuta)  
 From Merriam-Webster Online:  
 Function: noun  
 Inflected Form(s): plural **scu·ta**  
 Etymology: New Latin, from Latin, shield  
 Date: 1771  
 : a bony, horny, or chitinous plate : scute
 **seed·time**

![Seedtime](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Seedtime)  
 From Merriam-Webster Online:  
 Function: noun  
 Date: before 12th century  
 1 : the season of sowing  
 2 : a period of original development
 **som·no·phore**

![Somnophore](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Somnophore)  
 From Rei Nakazawa, **Magic** creative text writer:  
 Function: noun  
 Etymology: Somnophore is an example of one thing the creative team likes to do a lot -- combine existing prefixes, suffixes, and bases. *Somno-* is Latin for sleep, and *-phore* is a Latin "combining noun" that means "carrier." (*-Phore* is used often in biological naming.) So *somnophore* is a "sleep carrier," and any creature that has been affected by its ability will attest to that.
 **spuz·zem**

![Floral Spuzzem](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Floral+Spuzzem)  
 From Steve Conard, *Legends* designer:  
 Function: noun  
 Etymology: The name of this creature is in honor of the city Spuzzum, British Columbia. That name was just too good not to use.
 **sym·bi·ote**

![Wirewood Symbiote](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Wirewood+Symbiote)  
 From dictionary.com:  
 Function: noun  
 : An organism in a symbiotic relationship.
 **tai·ga**

![Taiga](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Taiga)  
 From Merriam-Webster Online:  
 Function: noun  
 Etymology: Russian *taiga*  
 Date: 1888  
 : a moist subarctic forest dominated by conifers (as spruce and fir) that begins where the tundra ends
 **tak·kle·mag·got**

![Takklemaggot](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Takklemaggot)  
 From Steve Conard, *Legends* designer:  
 Function: noun  
 Etymology: The name came from a funny misunderstanding of some lyrics by the Blue Oyster Cult. In their song "A Veteran of the Psychic Wars," it sounded to us like they were saying "tackle maggot." We liked the sound of that so much, we named this card after it.
 **tar·pan**

![Tarpan](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Tarpan)  
 From Dictionary.com:  
 Function: noun  
 : A wild horse found in the region of the Caspian Sea, extinct since the early 20th century. (*Equus caballus gomelini*)
 **ther·mo·karst**

![Thermokarst](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Thermokarst)  
 From The U.S. Global Change Research Information Office:  
 Function: noun  
Etymology: from Greek *thermE* heat + German *karst* irregular limestone region  
 : a range of features formed in areas of low relief when permafrost with excess ice thaws. These are unevenly distributed and include hummocks and mounds, water- filled depressions, 'drunken' forests, mud flows on sloping ground, new fens, and other forms of thaw settlement that account for many of the geotechnical and engineering problems encountered in periglacial landscapes. Even where repeated ground freezing takes place, thermokarst features, once formed, are likely to persist.
 **thrall**

![Bladewing's Thrall](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Bladewing%27s+Thrall)  
 From dictionary.com:  
 Function: noun  
 1 : a. One, such as a slave or serf, who is held in bondage.   
 b. One who is intellectually or morally enslaved.   
 2 : Servitude; bondage: *"a people in thrall to the miracles of commerce"* (Lewis H. Lapham).
 **viv·i·fy![Vivify](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Vivify)**  
 From Merriam-Webster Online:  
Function: transitive verb  
 Inflected Form(s): **-fied; -fy·ing**  
 1 : to endue with life or renewed life : animate (rains that vivify the barren hills)  
 2 : to impart vitality or vividness to (concentrating this union of quality and meaning in a way which vivifies both -- John Dewey)  
 Etymology: Middle French *vivifier*, from Late Latin *vivificare*, from Latin *vivificus* enlivening, from *vivus* alive  
 Date: 1545


**Worm·fang**

![Wormfang Turtle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Wormfang+Turtle)  
 From Rei Nakazawa, **Magic** creative text writer:  
 Function: noun  
 Etymoogy: Creative Text knew that it wanted to reference the black Nightmares from *Torment* onto the blue and red versions of *Judgment*, and referring to their distinctive tentacles seemed to be a good fit. But in order to bring home the contrast, they were only given one tentacle each, toothed like a lamprey. They were originally called "Wormtooth" creatures, but input indicated that "Wormfang" sounded cooler.
 **wum·pus**

![Hunted Wumpus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Hunted+Wumpus)  
 From Rei Nakazawa, **Magic** creative text writer:  
 Function: noun  
 Etymology: No, the word does not come from what you do with these creatures when you attack. "Wumpus" is actually a tribute to the old, *old* computer game "[Hunt the Wumpus](http://www.uwec.edu/jerzdg/orr/articles/IF/canon/Hunt_the_Wumpus.htm)," which is appropriate since the only Wumpus was supposed to be [Hunted Wumpus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hunted+Wumpus). ([Thrashing Wumpus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thrashing+Wumpus) was not supposed to be a Wumpus, but rather the leeches you see on the Wumpus in the art. But the focus on them wasn't strong enough, so the card concept changed. Other cards with the Wumpus in the art include [Invigorate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Invigorate) and [Foster](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Foster).)
