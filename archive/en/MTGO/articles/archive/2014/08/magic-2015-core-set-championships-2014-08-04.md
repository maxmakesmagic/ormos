**Hunt Bigger Game**
Push yourself to the limit with *Magic: The Gathering*, the world’s premier trading card game. Customize your own *Magic* deck with potent spells and creatures, then challenge your friends to see who's the fiercest predator!


The *Magic 2015 Core Set* is out in the wild! Hopefully, you had a chance to participate in the [*Magic 2015* Prerelease Events](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/magic-online-2015-core-set-prerelease-and-release-events-2014-06-30#prerelease) that concluded on July 28. If not, get over to the [Release Events](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/magic-online-2015-core-set-prerelease-and-release-events-2014-06-30#release) that are going on until August 13. Do you think Garruk became the Apex Predator overnight? No way; that takes practice. Well, practice and a horrible curse, but that's beside the point. You're going to need every opportunity to study up on the set because *Magic 2015* Championships are on the way!


Just like those wilderness survival shows, you'll need to know how to make the most out of limited resources to triumph over the competition in the [Limited Qualifiers](#m15ltdqualifier) beginning on Wednesday, August 27. Then test your foresight and planning skills as you hunt down the competition in the [Standard Qualifiers](#vmaconstqualifier), beginning Wednesday, September 3! Participation in any qualifier event will earn you a [Reclamation Sage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reclamation+Sage) promo card!


Once natural selection has left only the fiercest competitors standing, qualified players will receive an invitation to participate in a corresponding Championship Final Event. On Saturday, September 6, the *Magic 2015* [Limited Championship Finals](#m15limited) take place at 8:00 a.m. Pacific. The Limited Championship is a Swiss Sealed event followed by a Top 8 Draft. Once the Limited Champion has claimed their prize, the hunt for a Standard Constructed Champion begins.


The [*Magic 2015* Standard Championship Finals](#m15constructed) begin at 8:00 a.m. Pacific on Saturday, September 13. The Standard Championship is a Swiss Constructed event followed by a single-elimination, Top 8, Standard match-up to decide the victor.


In addition to big booster prizes, all players participating in a Championship Final will earn promotional versions of [In Garruk's Wake](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=In+Garruk%27s+Wake) and [Chief Engineer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chief+Engineer).
