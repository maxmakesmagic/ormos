Welcome to another week here at the home of the *Magic* Top 25 Pro Rankings. With Prerelease weekend now in our rearview mirror, where *Khans of Tarkir* was met with a ton of positive comments, we now look to the future, featuring the best in the game doing their best to make morph, raid, and the rest dance to their deck-building tune. Our Top 25 remains unaltered of course—there are no pro points given out at a Prerelease! That gives us the chance to take a look at how things might shift over the coming weeks.



Jérémy Dezani remains at the head of affairs, with a lead of just over 5 points from Owen Turtenwald. If Owen reached the finals of his next Grand Prix, that would be worth 6 points, and Reid Duke at No. 3 could also claim the lead with a single result, were he to win his next Grand Prix, worth 8 Points. Then there's a significant gap down to William Jensen at No. 4. He had a truly astonishing Grand Prix run last year, with a veritable slew of Top 8 finishes, but winning is worth twice as much as losing in the quarterfinals. Jensen would need four quarterfinals losses without Dezani getting anything before Jensen could take the No. 1 spot. Of course, that's slightly misleading, as the points decay throughout the season. As the winner of the Player of the Year Race last season, Dezani's points decay at a faster rate than anyone else's, meaning that with each passing Grand Prix he naturally falls closer to the chasing pack.



Once we're past Jensen at No. 4, there's another big gap, this time of 8 points down to Ivan Floch, the first of eleven players in our list with a score in the 50s. One or two Grand Prix finishes won't take them all the way to the top. For that, they're going to need the turbo boost that comes from a Pro Tour, and *that's* now just over two weeks away!



Join us next week, as we explore more of the *Magic* Top 25 Pro Rankings.
