*What's the best trade you've ever made (trading **Magic** cards for **Magic** cards)?*


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/gpbri09/Nothing-Special.jpg)**From Tim Willoughby, in the GP–Brighton coverage:** At the start of the weekend, fellow coverage reporter Rich Hagon laid down a challenge to plucky Brit Matt Light. Starting with just a [One with Nothing](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=One+with+Nothing), he had to see what he could get. Matt was allowed to use the [One with Nothing](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=One+with+Nothing) as a throw-in to a bigger trade, for something specific, but regardless, it needed to be a clear swap.


Within twenty minutes, that [One with Nothing](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=One+with+Nothing) had become [Garruk Wildspeaker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Garruk+Wildspeaker). The full list of trades involved in getting it there were quite impressive—not least because they didn't particularly involve leaving anyone with a "bad trade."


[...]


Twenty minutes for a Garruk is pretty impressive. But what happens if you open a booster, and get a Garruk, but really want to be able to play Friday Night Magic? That one card alone won't help you much.

And so the real challenge was born. Taking a [Warp World](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Warp+World) deck list [from Jacob Van Lunen's Building on a Budget column](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/boab/47), we challenged Matt to turn that lone planeswalker into a whole 60-card deck.


[...]


What Matt finished up with was far more than a stack of 60 cards. He had turned Nothing into something really quite special, and earned the title of GP–Brighton (Trading) Champion!
