M**agic** developers care a lot about Standard Constructed. It is the most popular tournament format, and it's very important to us that the experience it provides be fun. The Future Future League is the name we have given to the format that we use to test Standard internally. At any given time, the Future Future League contains all the sets that will be in real-world Standard at the same time as the set that is currently in development. This means that at any given time the Future Future League is many months ahead of the real world. Today I'll talk about some decks I played while *Alara Reborn* was the newest set in the Future Future League.

During *Alara Reborn* development, I was still very new to **Magic** Ramp;D. I spent much of the set's development cycle as more of a playtester than a developer, and for a few months I was building decks very quickly, often at a rate of a deck or more per day. Because of this, the decks I was playing were not often well tuned. However, the goal of early playtesting is to tell if cards are fun, not to produce tuned lists. Three extra games playing with a new card is more valuable to us than an hour spent worrying about the last two slots in a deck built around it, especially when the card might change at any moment.

The four decks I present today are very untuned. They are exactly the kinds of decks we make when we need to see how a card plays but don't have a ton of time to spend on making them perfect. This is, of course, not the only kind of Future Future League deck we make. We hold tournaments in which the decks we play are much more refined, and my tournament decks are much stronger than these. However, many more of the decks we make are motivated by what needs to be tested, and we need to test efficiently. Let's begin!
