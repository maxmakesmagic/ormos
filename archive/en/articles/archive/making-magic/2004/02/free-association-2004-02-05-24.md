![Giant Fan](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Giant+Fan)[Giant Fan](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Giant+Fan) is one of my favorite *Unglued* cards. This probably has something to do with my love of counters (this might give you some [insight](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/daily/mr110-insight) on how *Mirrodin* ended up the way it did). Although it's unconnected to my love of things that can't be countered. But that's for another page. The one new tidbit about [Giant Fan](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Giant+Fan) is that its flavor text is parodying a piece of flavor text from an old TCG named Super Deck.
