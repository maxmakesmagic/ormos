14. Before the replicate trigger resolves, cast [Induce Paranoia](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Induce+Paranoia) on the original Stream. This puts Stream, [Induce Paranoia](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Induce+Paranoia), [Gigadrowse](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gigadrowse) and [Rewind](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rewind) in your grave.

11. Alan can use [Ulasht, the Hate Seed](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Ulasht%252C%2Bthe%2BHate%2BSeed) to ping another of Bob's creatures, allowing for one more point of trample damage later.
12. Bob attacks with all of his creatures. Alan's first-strike [Steamcore Weird](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Steamcore+Weird) will block [Streetbreaker Wurm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Streetbreaker+Wurm), and [Tibor and Lumia](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tibor+and+Lumia) will block [Skarrgan Skybreaker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skarrgan+Skybreaker) - otherwise specific blocks are fairly unimportant since all attackers have trample.
13. Before damage is put on the stack, [Niv-Mizzet, the Firemind](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Niv-Mizzet%252C%2Bthe%2BFiremind) will use its ability to draw a card and deal one damage to [Gruul Guildmage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gruul+Guildmage), killing it. (-1 due to BTS).
14. [Djinn Illuminatus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Djinn+Illuminatus) will tap to deal one to [Burning-Tree Bloodscale](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Burning-Tree+Bloodscale), killing it (-1 due to BTS).
15. That leaves 32 points of offense and 16 points of defense, meaning Alan will take 16 more damage.
16. Finally, Bob will sacrifice [Skarrgan Skybreaker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skarrgan+Skybreaker) to deal three more damage to Alan, for a grand total of 25 damage.
