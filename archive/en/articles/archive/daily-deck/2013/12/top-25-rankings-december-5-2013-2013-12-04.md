The **Magic** Top 25 Pro Rankings got a thorough stirring this week thanks to two huge Grand Prix. In [Vienna](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/magazine/article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/eventcoverage/gpvie13/welcome), two Pro Tour champions—[Stanislav Cifka](https://archive.wizards.com/magic/magazine/article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/eventcoverage/ptrtr12/welcome) and [Jérémy Dezani](https://archive.wizards.com/magic/magazine/article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/eventcoverage/ptths13/welcome)—both made the Top 8, sending Dezani into the Top 10 rankings and nudging Cifka up to No. 9. They're part of a cluster of pros within 5 Pro Points that cover Yuuya Watanabe at No. 7 down to Owen Turtenwald at No. 12. Speaking of which... 

 There was plenty of excitement at [the largest Canadian Grand Prix ever](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/magazine/article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/eventcoverage/gptor13/welcome). Owen was going for a historic three-peat of GP triumphs on successive weekends, while Sam Black was looking for a fifth-straight Top 8 appearance. Both attempts failed during an epic last round before the Top 8, but as Sam, who climbed yet another place to No. 6 this week, tweeted: 

  
 For the home team in Canada, there were two ranked players to cheer. Alexander Hayne continued his march up the standings. Having won [Grand Prix Kyoto](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/magazine/article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/eventcoverage/gpkyo13/welcome), he managed Top 16 in Toronto, sending him up to No.18. Jon Stern was not so fortunate, and he falls out of the rankings this week. So who makes it in? None other than the overall winner of the Grand Prix, Ari Lax, who enters the chart at No. 22. 

 Lax ended the last pro season with a heartbreaking loss to Luis Scott-Vargas in the final round of [Pro Tour *Dragon's Maze*](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/magazine/article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/eventcoverage/ptdgm13/welcome)—a match where the winner would be a Platinum Pro for the 2013–14 season, and the loser would not. To his vast credit, Lax took the loss as a call to arms, and has roared back this season. Expect to see Lax as a long-term fixture on the rankings list. 

 Join us right here next week for another look at the **Magic** Top 25 Pro rankings.
