We showed you the [promotional card](/en/articles/archive/promo-premium-rukh-egg-2003-06-27) for the upcoming [Global Celebration tournaments](http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=mtgcom/resource/10aStores) last week. So when did we start making promo cards for events?


[Dirtcowl Wurm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dirtcowl+Wurm) was the very first "prerelease card," given out at the *Tempest* prerelease tournaments in October of 1997.



The card was not "foil;" it was simply a normal version of the card with the word "Prerelease" and the **Magic** "M" stamped in gold leaf on the type line.
