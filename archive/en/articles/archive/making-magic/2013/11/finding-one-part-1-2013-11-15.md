From time to time I like to do articles in a series I've dubbed "The Rosewater Files." These articles are my personal ones where I share some aspect of my life and tie it into some aspect of design. As a holistic thinker, I don't see these two parts of my life as separate, but rather as intertwined elements that define who I am. As such, I feel like giving you all a glimpse of one aspect of my personal life will help you better understand how I approach my designs.

Here is the cream of the crop of my previous Rosewater Files:

One of the questions I always get is where my ideas come from. How do I find the cards and mechanics I need to fill my sets? As you will see, they come from a wide variety of different places in a wide variety of different ways. I am going to walk through numerous sets I've led in chronological order to explore how some aspect of each came to be. While doing that, I'm also going to tell a longer story about how I found the most important thing in my personal life, my wife Lora. Today and next week is the story of how we ended up married. (You can read about the wedding in the link above.)
