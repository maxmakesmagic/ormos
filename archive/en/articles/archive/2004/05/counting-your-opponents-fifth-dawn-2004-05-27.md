Not all games of **Magic** are one-on-one duels, and R&D creates cards with that in mind. Several *Fifth Dawn* cards get better in multiplayer, increasing in power the more opponents you have.


* The more artifacts your opponents have, the more **[Viridian Lorebearers](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Viridian+Lorebearers)** can pump your creatures. And the more chances you could **[Acquire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Acquire)** something good from an opponent's deck. And the more times your **[Battered Golem](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Battered+Golem)** will untap.
* **[Skullcage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skullcage)** cages the skulls of any number of opponents, dealing out damage as appropriate without any additional work from you.
* **[Moriok Rigger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Moriok+Rigger)** triggers whenever artifacts hit the graveyard -- the more the merrier.
* Like [Soul Warden](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soul+Warden), **[Auriok Champion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Auriok+Champion)** will trigger whenever anyone plays a creature -- meaning it will trigger a lot. **[Blasting Station](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blasting+Station)** will be similarly powered up.
* **[Magnetic Theft](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Magnetic+Theft)** has powerful possibilities for meddling with the combat between two other players.
* **[Door to Nothingness](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Door+to+Nothingness)** is slightly reduced in power in multiplayer, since making target player lose doesn't necessarily make you immediately win. But the ability to "show the [Door to Nothingness](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Door%2Bto%2BNothingness)" to any player as an instant creates a very powerful bargaining tool....
* Last but certainly not least, **[Mana Geyser](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Geyser)** may only bring a few red mana to your pool in a duel. But with two or more opponents, turning ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227130050im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless3.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227130159im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/red.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227130159im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/red.gif) into ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227130159im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/red.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227130159im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/red.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227130159im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/red.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227130159im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/red.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227130159im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/red.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227130159im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/red.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227130159im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/red.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227130159im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/red.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227130159im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/red.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227130159im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/red.gif) or potentially *much* more is frighteningly easy.

There are plenty more opportunities for multiplayer to look forward to in *Fifth Dawn*. Bring on the opponents!
