### **SCHEID TRIUMPHS WITH OLD-SCHOOL MONSTERS**

TOP 8 COVERAGE
--------------


Variety was the name of the game here at Grand Prix Los Angeles. California local Daniel Scheid soared to a gigantic victory with his Red-Green Monsters deck. And in a field overrun by Jeskai and Abzan, the Top 8 saw a panoply of different decks, with only one lonely Abzan deck making it to the Semifinals.


First, Sidisi Whip and the Sultai clan threw up impressive numbers as Grand Prix Orlando winner Eugene Hwang spent all Day One as King of the Hill. Pro Tour Hall of Fame member Brian Kibler finished Top 16 with his awesome Temur deck sporting tons of new cards like Savage Knuckleblade, Temur Charm, and Stubborn Denial. But the Top 8 saw Brad Nelson’s innovative Mardu Midrange deck, and two, count ‘em, two Mono-Red Aggro decks.


Even with all these new and mutated decks that showed up to beat Abzan and Jeskai, it was a forgotten favorite that ruled the day. Scheid brought Red and Green beats in there game after game. Stormbreath Dragon, Sarkhan, the Dragonspeaker, Ashcloud Phoenix, and Genesis Hydra all came to party. Scheid reminded everyone that yes, ramping into huge threats is still really good.


This weekend showed that though there are common decks, they are not necessarily the best decks. Jeskai and Abzan are both beatable, and with a whole host of strategies.


The Standard format is just starting to blossom, and it isn't nearly in full bloom.

DAY 2 COVERAGE
--------------


And we’re back for Day 2! It was a crazy first day at Grand Prix Los Angeles, the first major tournament since Pro Tour Khans of Tarkir shook the format to its core. There are plenty of expected decks doing well—Abzan and Jeskai are well-represented—but also plenty of outliers built to feed on them.


Pro Tour Hall of Famer Brian Kibler is ferocious going into the second day, sitting undefeated and King of the Hill with his Temur Aggro deck. The deck features all the Temur clan hits. He’s got Savage Knuckleblade, Crater’s Claws, and a host of counters. And he’s not alone in his clan affiliation. Plenty of second-day combatants have sleeved up the clan.


Joining Kibler in the 9-0 bracket is Peter Ingram, Tamada Ryoichi, Isaac Sears, and Carlo Falcis. Coming up close behind is Grand Prix Orlando champion Eugene Hwang, Brad Nelson, Fabrizio Anteri, Vidianto Wijaya, Valentin Mackl, (16) Patrick Chapin, (11) Eric Froehlich, Jamie Parke, among many, many others.


There are some interesting decks percolating near the top tables. Not only have more than a few Temur decks broken through, but so have Mardu and Sultai (and even an errant Bant deck or two). And the aggressive Red-based decks led by the Satyr Duo—Firedrinker Satyr and Satyr Hoplite—are refusing to submit to the midrange onslaught, even gaining a convert from the Pro Tour Top 8 last week.


This format, though stable, is still thoroughly unexplored. Today will further shake things up as some of the best players in the world figure out what the heck to do with these extremely powerful, extremely three-color Khans of Tarkir cards.

DAY 1 COVERAGE
--------------


“It’s been a while! Now that there are no more Lifebane Zombies, I can actually win!” Brian Kibler exclaimed after his final attack with Savage Knuckleblade put him at a pristine 9-0 record.


Although Siege Rhino and Mantis Rider still left their mark of the day, the biggest stories to come out of Day 1 are the rise of Sultai, Mardu, and Temur decks. All three performed very well over the course of the day, with Pro Tour Hall of Famer Brian Kibler’s Temur deck leading the pack overnight. The other players with perfect records of 9-0 are Peter Ingram, Tamada Ryoichi, Isaac Sears, and Carlo Falcis.


But despite their great starts, these players will need to prove themselves tomorrow as we have Eugene Hwang, Brad Nelson, Fabrizio Anteri, Vidianto Wijaya, Valentin Mackl, (16) Patrick Chapin, (11) Eric Froehlich, Jamie Parke, and plenty of other grizzled veterans lurking behind them with 8-1 records. In total, 196 have earned the right to come back tomorrow and compete for the title of Grand Prix Los Angeles Champion.


Join us here tomorrow for more text and video coverage as we will learn more about the latest Standard innovations and see six more rounds of Standard followed by the Top 8 of Grand Prix Los Angeles 2014! Sunday’s livestream will start at 9:15 am PST.
