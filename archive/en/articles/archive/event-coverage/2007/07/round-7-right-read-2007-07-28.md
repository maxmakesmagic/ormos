After sweeping up Pro Tour–San Diego with teammate Jacob Van Lunen, Chris Lachmann has been eager to prove himself in singles competition. He's off to a great start, having gone undefeated in standard with Green-Red Big Mana, and drafting a truly savage Faerie deck, taking his first round with ease. His opponent is Japan's Flash, Katsuhiro "Hotstepper" Mori, also undefeated so far. Mori cruised through standard with the Japanese black-green Elf deck, but admitted that this was only his second draft since Yokohama.


### Game 1


Lachmann mulliganed into a strong start of [Nightshade Stinger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nightshade+Stinger) with [Spellstutter Sprite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spellstutter+Sprite) and [Peppersmoke](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Peppersmoke) at the ready, but Mori refused to bite, holding back his [Stonybrook Angler](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stonybrook+Angler). Lachmann missed his third land drop and swung again.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration//sideboard/images/worlds07/r7_lachmann_mori.jpg)*Chris Lachmann squares off against Katsuhiro Mori. Not pictured: Garruk Wildspeaker*Mori had no such difficulty, powering out Steambed Aquitects then passing with four mana open. Lachmann naturally held back his Stinger, having found a third for [Paperfin Rascal](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Paperfin+Rascal), and won the clash. Mori showed the expected [Sentinels of Glen Elendra](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sentinels+of+Glen+Elendra). He put the boots in with a [Merrow Reejerey](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Merrow+Reejerey), swinging for 5 and playing out [Stonybrook Angler](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stonybrook+Angler).


Lachmann was firmly on the back foot, but he was just about to find out how bad things were. He played [Thieving Sprite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thieving+Sprite) for two cards. Mori mistakenly showed him all three: [Ethereal Whiskergill](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ethereal+Whiskergill), [Island](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island), and [Garruk Wildspeaker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Garruk+Wildspeaker). Naturally, Lachmann didn't get the option of taking the planeswalker. Mori set up an [Overrun](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Overrun) turn, and that was that.


Mori 1, Lachmann 0


### Game 2


Lachmann kept a two-lander on the play, and again opened with [Nightshade Stinger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nightshade+Stinger). Again, Mori made the right read on his two open land, playing out his Angler after a moment's agonizing. Lachmann had no Spellstutter. Lachmann drew his third land on time, but it was [Shelldock Isle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shelldock+Isle), putting him off-pace for a turn. Mori hit, summoned Steambed Aquitects, and passed it back.


Lachmann had no fourth land, and [Pestermite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pestermite)d Mori's lone [Forest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest) during upkeep. Mori rewarded his efforts with a [Merrow Reejerey](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Merrow+Reejerey) and 5 to the chops. Lachmann peeked at three of Mori's four cards with [Thieving Sprite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thieving+Sprite), and stole [Dreamspoiler Witches](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dreamspoiler+Witches) over two lands.


And here, Mori showed his lack of practice. He swung in with Reejerey and Angler, then pumped with his Aquitects after blocks, dodging the 3 power worth of blockers. Of course his play for the turn was [Inkfathom Divers](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inkfathom+Divers), which would have let the Reejerey tap down the [Pestermite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pestermite) and enabled an extra point of damage.


It seemed insignificant there, but then Lachmann showed him a [Sower of Temptation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sower+of+Temptation), stealing his islandwalker and building a fast clock. Mori could activate his Aquitects on themselves, then untap them with the Angler and get in for 4. With the extra point leaving Lachmann at 8 instead of 9, he'd given him an extra turn.


Of course, he had plucked [Ethereal Whiskergill](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ethereal+Whiskergill) to stop up the skies, so it didn't matter as much as it could have. Lachmann was short on answers. He hit for 3 and made an end-of-turn [Wydwen, the Biting Gale](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wydwen%2C+the+Biting+Gale), but with no removal, he couldn't punch through for the win.


Mori 2, Lachmann 0
