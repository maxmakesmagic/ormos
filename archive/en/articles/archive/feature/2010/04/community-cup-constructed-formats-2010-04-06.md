As we work toward finalizing the Community Cup details, we wanted to announce the constructed formats as early as possible so you, the community at-large, could get your creative juices flowing. So without further ado, here they are: 


* Commander – Unified Constructed\*
* Standard – Unified Constructed\*\*

\*For the Commander – Unified Constructed tournament, each team must create eight (8) 100-card Commander decks (one for each player) using a card pool that only contains one (1) of each  [Commander-legal](http://www.wizards.com/Magic/TCG/Resources.aspx?x=magic/rules/100cardsingleton-commander) card available on **Magic Online**.


\*\*For the Standard – Unified Constructed tournament, each team must create eight (8) 60-card Standard decks with 15-card sideboards (one for each player) using a card pool that only contains four (4) of each [Standard-legal](http://www.wizards.com/Magic/TCG/Resources.aspx?x=judge/resources/sfrstandard) card available on **Magic Online**.


In addition, all **Magic Online** users that post hints, suggestions, tactics or strategies in the Community Team [Commander Deck Strategy](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=%20http://community.wizards.com/magiconline/go/thread/view/76117/23093045/) and [Standard Deck Strategy](http://community.wizards.com/magiconline/go/thread/view/76117/23093057/) threads (and other Community threads as they become available) will be eligible for the soon-to-be-announced prize(s) that your community team will be trying to win you. Just make sure you include your **MTGO** account name along with your suggestions.


Let the challenge begin!
