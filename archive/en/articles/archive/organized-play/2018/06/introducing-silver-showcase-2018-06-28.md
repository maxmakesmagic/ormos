*Magic*'s million-dollar weekend August 2–5 in Minneapolis, Minnesota, is going to be jam-packed with exciting moments. Not only is the city playing host to Pro Tour 25th Anniversary, an $850,000 three-day tournament featuring our first team-format Pro Tour since [Charleston](https://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/ptcha06) in 2006, but it'll also host a very special event featuring eight players, $150,000, and a Rochester Draft (yes, really) that will celebrate *Magic*'s origins.


Presenting . . . The Silver Showcase!
=====================================


The Silver Showcase highlights players from the Pro Tour's past and present as they revisit a beloved old format using booster packs from *Magic*'s first year.


**What Is This?**


The Silver Showcase will be a Rochester Draft event like no other, as the players Rochester draft three packs each of *Limited Edition (Beta)*, one pack each of *Arabian Nights*, one pack each of *Antiquities*, and one pack each of *Legends*.


The Rochester Draft will take place Thursday, August 2, at the Minneapolis Convention Center in Minneapolis, Minnesota, the afternoon before the Pro Tour. The single-elimination rounds will take place after the conclusion of each day of competition for Pro Tour 25th Anniversary, with the quarterfinals taking place Friday evening, the semifinals Saturday evening, and the finals Sunday morning.


All matches apart from the finals will best two out of three. The finals will be best three out of five.


**Who's Playing?**


We invited a total of eight players to participate in the Silver Showcase. The first four of those players are the top lifetime Pro Point earners from each geo-region as of the conclusion of [Pro Tour *Dominaria*](https://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/ptdom).

We'll be bringing you the Rochester Draft on [twitch.tv/magic](https://www.twitch.tv/magic) live from Minneapolis starting on Thursday, August 2 in the afternoon with a special pre–Pro Tour broadcast, exact start time to be finalized in the coming weeks.

The matches for the Silver Showcase will be conducted and broadcasted after the conclusion to Swiss rounds on Friday and Saturday, with the quarterfinals all happening on Friday and the semifinals taking place on Saturday.


The finals—a best-of-five finish between the two remaining players—will take place on Sunday, August 5, starting at 9 a.m. local time (7 a.m. PT/10 a.m. ET/2 p.m. UTC).


The Silver Showcase will be one heck of a party at the Pro Tour for *Magic*'s 25th anniversary, so tune in and don't miss out on the action!
