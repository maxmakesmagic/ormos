**Card of the Day - vendredi 30 mai 2003**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Shock%20Troops)#### Shock Troops


*Mercadian Masques* common.  
This card's name is a play on the fact that its activated ability has the same effect as the card Shock.
 


**Card of the Day - jeudi 29 mai 2003**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Icatian%20Javelineers)#### Icatian Javelineers


*Fallen Empires* common.  
During design, this card did not have the tap as part of its cost, but designer Chris Page built a deck of nothing but Plains and Icatian Javelineers and proved it was a problem. (The card would have been a better white Mogg Fanatic.)
 


**Card of the Day - mercredi 28 mai 2003**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Trap%20Digger)#### Trap Digger


*Scourge* rare. This card is named after the card it emulates, Pit Trap. Its ability essentially turns lands into Pit Traps.
 


**Card of the Day - mardi 27 mai 2003**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Intrepid%20Hero)#### Intrepid Hero


*Urza's Saga* rare.  
During design, this card was a Legend named "David, Giant Killer" after the biblical tale "David and Goliath." Its legendary status was revoked during development.
 


**Card of the Day - lundi 26 mai 2003**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Aven%20Brigadier)#### Aven Brigadier


*Onslaught* rare.  
This card was originally designed as an enchantment, but was changed because R&D believed that "lords" feel better as creatures. Note that Bird Soldiers get +2/+2 from this card.
 


**Card of the Day - vendredi 23 mai 2003**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Edgewalker)#### Edgewalker


*Scourge* uncommon.  
Edgewalker is the first card that reduces the number of colored mana that cards cost to play.
 


**Card of the Day - jeudi 22 mai 2003**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Treetop%20Scout)#### Treetop Scout


*Scourge* common.  
This was originally designed to be a blue card, but was moved into green to line up with Treetop Rangers and Elven Riders.
 


**Card of the Day - mercredi 21 mai 2003**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Goblin%20War%20Strike)#### Goblin War Strike


*Scourge* common.  
*Scourge* does have one repeat, and it is this card, which first appeared in *Portal Second Age*.
 


**Card of the Day - mardi 20 mai 2003**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Day%20of%20the%20Dragons)#### Day of the Dragons


*Scourge* rare.  
If you put Day of the Dragons' comes-into-play ability on the stack and then Disenchant it, all your creatures will be Dragons permanently.
 


**Card of the Day - lundi 19 mai 2003**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Guilty%20Conscience)#### Guilty Conscience


*Scourge* common.  
Guilty Conscience deals the damage to the creature as opposed to the creature dealing it to itself. The card started out doing the latter, but that caused unwanted loops.
 


**Card of the Day - vendredi 16 mai 2003**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Krosan%20Constrictor)#### Krosan Constrictor


*Torment* common.  
The Constrictor was originally going to be a repeat of Warthog, then a repeat of Pygmy Allosaurus, but eventually got it's own identity.
 


**Card of the Day - jeudi 15 mai 2003**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Thumbscrews)#### Thumbscrews


*Tempest* rare.  
Thumbscrews was made to be a reverse of Black Vise, but having it deal scaling amounts of damage was too good, so it was significantly watered down.
 


**Card of the Day - mercredi 14 mai 2003**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Wirewood%20Hivemaster)#### Wirewood Hivemaster


*Legions* uncommon.  
The Hivemaster's text contains the word "nontoken" to prevent an easy infinite combo with Artificial Evolution.
 


**Card of the Day - mardi 13 mai 2003**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Divine%20Intervention)#### Divine Intervention


*Legends* rare.  
Divine Intervention was banned from sanctioned play for a long while because the DCI wanted to discourage people from trying to get draws.
 


**Card of the Day - lundi 12 mai 2003**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Urza's%20Rage)#### Urza's Rage


*Invasion* rare.  
The "can't be countered" text on Urza's Rage differs from that on Obliterate. Urza's Rage cannot be countered by spells or abilities, but it can be countered by the game rules. If the Rage's target becomes illegal (if it's sacrificed or gets protection from red), the Rage is countered.
 


**Card of the Day - vendredi 9 mai 2003**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Seeker)#### Seeker


*Legends* common.  
The original designed intent of Seeker was to just make the creature unblockable, but the developers thought it would be "cooler" if the card mirrored Fear. Quite a bargain at four mana! Not!
 


**Card of the Day - jeudi 8 mai 2003**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Dromar,%20the%20Banisher)#### Dromar, the Banisher


*Invasion* rare.  
The original ability for Dromar was 2WUB: Return target red or green permanent to the top of its owner's library. Development made all the *Invasion* Dragons have abilities that triggered on combat damage instead. Attack!
 


**Card of the Day - mercredi 7 mai 2003**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Bane%20of%20the%20Living)#### Bane of the Living


*Legions* rare.  
For a while, the Bane was uncommon in development. But it was causing such havoc in limited games that it was moved to rare.
 


**Card of the Day - mardi 6 mai 2003**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Capture%20of%20Jingzhou)#### Capture of Jingzhou


*Portal Three Kingdoms* rare.  
Many *P3K* cards were simply remakes of other popular **Magic** cards with new flavorful names. This card is functionally identical to the *Tempest* favorite Time Warp.
 


**Card of the Day - lundi 5 mai 2003**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Moorish%20Cavalry)#### Moorish Cavalry


*Arabian Nights* common.  
Trample is clearly not a white ability. Moorish Cavalry is one of only three white commons with trample; the other two are Elephants.
 


**Card of the Day - vendredi 2 mai 2003**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Zodiac%20Dragon)#### Zodiac Dragon


*Portal Three Kingdoms* rare.  
From rules guru Stephen D'Angelo: "When played under non-*Portal* rules, the text should be read as "When ~this~ goes to a graveyard from play, you may return ~this~ to its owner's hand." The "from play" clause keeps the Dragon from being a combo with cards like Wild Mongrel.
 


**Card of the Day - jeudi 1 mai 2003**



![](http://Gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Nicol%20Bolas)#### Nicol Bolas


*Legends* rare.  
The *Legends* Elder Dragons were based on dragons from designer Steve Conard's **Dungeons & Dragons** campaign. Nicol Bolas was the oldest of these dragons, clocking in at 20,000 years.
