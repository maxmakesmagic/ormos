* Day Two will consist of 3 Rounds of *Rivals of Ixalan*/ *Ixalan* Booster Draft and 4 Rounds of Modern Constructed.
* During the Swiss rounds, the *Magic Online* die roll will determine which player chooses whether or not to take the first turn of the first game of each match.
* During the Swiss rounds, each player will have 40 minutes of priority clock for a best-of-three-game match (80 minutes for both players combined). Three minutes of sideboarding between games will not count toward this total. Slow play will be enforced as needed, and a player who runs out of priority time loses the match, regardless of the game score or state of the current game.
