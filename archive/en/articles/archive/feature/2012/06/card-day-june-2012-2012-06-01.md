![Silent-Blade Oni](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Silent-Blade+Oni)**[Silent-Blade Oni](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Silent-Blade+Oni)** – *Planechase (2012 Edition)* rare. This is the first "Demon Ninja" in **Magic**'s history. Up to now the only types of Ninjas were Human and Rat. One day I hope to see a Goblin Ninja; right [Squee](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Squee%2C+Goblin+Nabob)?
 


![Krond the Dawn-Clad](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Krond+the+Dawn-Clad)**[Krond the Dawn-Clad](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Krond+the+Dawn-Clad)** – *Planechase (2012 Edition)* mythic rare. Krond is the first multi-color Archon in **Magic** as well as the first Legendary Archon. All the rest are mono-white and boringly non-legendary.
 


![Maelstrom Wanderer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Maelstrom+Wanderer)**[Maelstrom Wanderer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Maelstrom+Wanderer)** – *Planechase (2012 Edition)* mythic rare. The Wanderer went through a number of variations during development, including an effect echoing of [Ball Lightning](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ball+Lightning).
 


![Vela the Night-Clad](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Vela+the+Night-Clad)**[Vela the Night-Clad](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vela+the+Night-Clad)** – *Planechase (2012 Edition)* mythic rare. If you rearrange the letters of her name you find "Vacated Hell Thing," which is purely coincidental as she's clearly a very nice Human Wizard.
 


![Thromok the Insatiable](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Thromok+the+Insatiable)**[Thromok the Insatiable](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thromok+the+Insatiable)** – *Planechase (2012 Edition)* mythic rare. Thromok wants to devour hordes of Goblins, Plants, and other tokens before it attacks. You can spice it up further with [Fling](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fling) and [Momentous Fall](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Momentous+Fall)!
 


![Skeleton Ship](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Skeleton+Ship)**[Skeleton Ship](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skeleton+Ship)** – *Ice Age* rare. Have you ever noticed how many ships in **Magic** are illustrated by Tom Wänerstrand? They were the subject of a whole week of Card of the Day back in [June 2007](/en/articles/archive/card-day-june-2007-2007-06-01), with behind-the scenes tidbits from Tom himself. Go read them. They're fascinating!
