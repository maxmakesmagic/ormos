Australian Champ Repeats!
=========================











![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/aunat06/champ.jpg)Canberra, the nation's capital. Australia looks to this city to find its political power, so what better place for the Magic players of Australia to gather to determine who will be representing them at the World Champs later this year in France?


101 players fronted up this weekend with the hope that they would be one of the hallowed four. Climbing to the top of the pile once again, to repeat his 2004 performance, was Tim He, who will be joined by Cameron Veigel, Daniel Piechnick and Anthony Purdom competing under Australia's banner at the Louvre come November this year.

Sunday, July 23: 6:15 p.m. - Quarterfinals: Paul Batum vs. Daniel Piechnick
---------------------------------------------------------------------------


Paul Batum's Zoo faced off Daniel Piechnick's homebrew Blue-Green-White control in the quarter finals, the only matchup in the quarters that can't be described as Blue-Green aggro verses Black-White-Blue control. Batum went undefeated with his deck, going 5-0 before IDing. Piechnick, the last player to take a loss in the tournament, went 3-1 with the deck before double drawing into the top eight, using nearly exactly the same deck that qualified him through Regionals.


Batum won the roll and was forced to keep sending back his hands until settling on four, lamenting Zoo's difficult mana base. Piechnick kept a full grip of seven. Paul managed to hit his land drops nonetheless, but Piechnick's counterspells and his own poor draw kept him from applying any pressure. A well-timed [Bathe in Light](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bathe+in+Light) shut down the hallmark card of Piechnick's deck, [Genju of the Fields](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Genju+of+the+Fields) . Another couple of Bathes tried to deal with Piechnick's Fetters but his counterspells were having none of it.

Many exciting turns of draw-go later, Piechnick set up his second Genju and Batum was out of answers, unable to race 6 points of life gain a turn. Eventually he managed to build up a reasonable force of dudes before [Wrath of God](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wrath+of+God) cleared them away, and finally Batum directed a futile post-script [Demonfire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Demonfire) at Piechnick's life total, then above 30, before scooping up his cards.


Paul Batum 0-1 Daniel Piechnick


Piechnick removed a handful of hard counters for a playset of the unlikely base set uncommon, [Spirit Link](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spirit+Link) , while Batum removed his Helixes for three [Kami of Ancient Law](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kami+of+Ancient+Law) s and a single Glare.


Batum's first-turn Isamaru ate a [Condemn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Condemn) and was followed up by a [Selesnya Guildmage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Selesnya+Guildmage) and [Scorched Rusalka](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scorched+Rusalka) , while Piechnick set up [Genju of the Fields](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Genju+of+the+Fields) and Vitu-Ghazi on defense. Batum seemed unimpressed with his inability to break through a single Enchant [Plains](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plains) , and instead both players slowly built up an army of Saprolings, before a Wrath eventually cleared the board, Piechnick's life still comfortably in the double digits. Batum's second wave of guys was taken down by Final *Judgment*.


An 8-point [Demonfire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Demonfire) toke Piechnick's life into the single digits, but Genju quickly ensures he was in no danger. [Char](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Char) is not so hot when your opponent is gaining six life a turn. Once Piechnick got above 20, Batum quipped,


"I'm going to concede just so you go back to twenty."


Paul Batum 0-2 Daniel Piechnick


The players shuffled while chatting about the matchup, Batum did his best to shuffle all three Genjus to the bottom of Piechnick's deck. Apparently he had some success, with Piechnick forced to mulligan to four.


Piechnick managed to put up a good fight in any case, with [Condemn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Condemn) , [Mana Leak](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak) and a Karoo helping somewhat to deal with Batum's early guys. [Bathe in Light](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bathe+in+Light) thwarted his attempt to stabilize with [Faith's Fetters](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Faith%27s+Fetters) . Piechnick's hand of counterspells was no match for the small force of creatures Batum had managed to accumulate, and [Spirit Link](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spirit+Link) was unfortunately of little help when the creature happens to be dealing lethal damage.


"Just got to do that two times more!" Batum announced to the spectators as they shuffled up for a fourth game.


Paul Batum 1-2 Daniel Piechnick


The trend of mulligans continued, with Batum this time forced to start with an opening grip of four cards. Batum's curve was respectable, opening with [Kird Ape](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kird+Ape) , [Kami of Ancient Law](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kami+of+Ancient+Law) to get rid of [Spirit Link](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spirit+Link) and a third turn [Savannah Lions](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Savannah+Lions) that prompted a [Wrath of God](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wrath+of+God) . [Burning-Tree Shaman](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Burning-Tree+Shaman) was completely (and amusingly) eliminated by [Spirit Link](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spirit+Link) , with Piechnick refusing to allow [Bathe in Light](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bathe+in+Light) to resolve.


"Man, you get life when I activate abilities," complained Batum. "So unfair."


[Kami of Ancient Law](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kami+of+Ancient+Law) finally toke down the [Spirit Link](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spirit+Link) , gaining a life for Piechnick in the process. Batum grimaced when Piechnick complemented his [Vitu-Ghazi, the City-Tree](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vitu-Ghazi%2C+the+City-Tree) with [Prahv, Spires of Order](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Prahv%2C+Spires+of+Order) . Saprolings and Prahv combined to make Batum's [Watchwolf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Watchwolf) look pretty silly, and a small horde of Saprolings finished Batum off, putting Piechnick into the semifinals.


Paul Batum 1-3 Daniel Piechnick
