Sunday, June 24: 12:34 p.m. - Round 11: Guillaume Wafo-Tapa vs. Melissa De Tora
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


*by Noah Weil*

  
![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gpmon07/Wafo.jpg)*Guillaume Wafo-Tapa*
Wafo-Tapa is running the explosive and clearly fun-to-play slivers combo. This deck wants to get a [Wild Pair](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Pair) into play, generate massive card advantage with [Dormant Sliver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dormant+Sliver) then attack for the win in one giant assault. DeTora brought G/W/r to the table. The plan here is similar to the straight G/W deck, but packs Dead/Gone and [Fiery Justice](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fiery+Justice) to clear the way. The gold sorcery also works to pump up an early [Kavu Predator](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kavu+Predator), hoping to create a threat too large for the opponent to deal with.


### Game 1


Melissa started the game with a double-mulligan on the play into a pair of [Flagstones of Trokair](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flagstones+of+Trokair). Still digging for a source of green, Melissa cycled [Edge of Autumn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Edge+of+Autumn) on the next turn, hoping for some luck. None came, and she was forced to pass the turn. Guillaume in the meantime was making [Frenetic Sliver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Frenetic+Sliver) followed by [Telekinetic Sliver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Telekinetic+Sliver). Melissa hoped to slow down what could quickly become a slaughter and played Dead on the [Telekinetic Sliver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Telekinetic+Sliver). The Telekinetic failed to save himself with the Frenetic's ability and Melissa enjoyed a small victory. Unfortunately, she was still unable to find a way to cast the green spells trapped in her hand, while the Pro Tour winner played [Foresee](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Foresee) to further the gap. Guillaume spent his next turn playing [Wild Pair](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Pair) and when a second Dead failed to connect to Frenetic, Melissa simply scooped up her cards to get ready for the next game.

Melissa brought in [Disenchant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Disenchant)s, [Thornscape Battlemage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thornscape+Battlemage)s and an extra Dead/Gone from the board, removing the [Stonewood Invocation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stonewood+Invocation)s and the mostly worthless [Temporal Isolation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Temporal+Isolation)s.


### Game 2


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gpmon07/DeTora.jpg)*Melissa De Tora*
Melissa's hand was much better this game with drops at two and three and a [Fiery Justice](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fiery+Justice) to take out pesky blockers. The first few turns were spent making attackers on Melissa's side and defenders on Guillaume's side. After a couple of turns of building, Melissa sent in with her team, then finished off Guillaume's creatures with a [Fiery Justice](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fiery+Justice), putting him at 24. The game fell into a pattern of: make an attacker, attack you; block that, make another blocker. Wafo-Tapa had been taking moderate hits, but was also enjoying a [Grove of the Burnwillows](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grove+of+the+Burnwillows) on DeTora's side was helping stem the damage. [Telekinetic Sliver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Telekinetic+Sliver) threatened to grind Melissa's offense to a halt while Guillaume kept amassing slivers. Melissa kept plinking away when she could, making more threats, but the game was quickly getting out of control. Wafo-Tapa was now drawing 2 cards for each sliver he played. A [Wild Pair](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Pair) threatened to end the game in a hurry. [Foresee](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Foresee) into another Telekinetic let Guillaume search up a [Whitemane Lion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Whitemane+Lion) and draw two cards. Whitemane fetched [Reflex Sliver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reflex+Sliver). Then [Darkheart Sliver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Darkheart+Sliver). But he couldn't finish it off and was forced to pass. On Melissa's turn his slivers did their impersonations of Rishadan Port and all but locked her out of the game. Melissa managed to keep some pressure on, putting Guillaume at 5, but it was clear the game was going to be over soon. Next turn the Frenchman sacrificed both [Dormant Sliver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dormant+Sliver)s to gain 6 life and more importantly give his other slivers the ability to FIGHT! Trying to keep her spirits up, Melissa pointed to the [Kavu Predator](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kavu+Predator) and said, "You know how big this guy is now?" But that was it. One giant swing from Wafo-Tapa's team was enough to end the match.

Sunday, June 24: 1:51 p.m. - Round 12: Shouta Yasooka vs. Koutarou Ootsuka
--------------------------------------------------------------------------


*by Eric Reasoner*

  
![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gpmon07/Yasooka.jpg)*Shouta Yasooka*
Round 12 saw the two highest ranked Japanese players remaining in the tournament squared off. These guys must be doing something right, they're also teammates for San Diego. When asked, Shouta Yasooka admitted he was the dominant head, as Koutarou Ootsuka was mostly on the team for "attracting the women". Regardless, both players have shown impressive confidence and precision all weekend. With the top 8 within either player's grasp, both were willing to take down the teammate for an all-important win.


Game 1: While both players used [Terramorphic Expanse](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Terramorphic+Expanse) to fix their mana, Shouta went further with a [Prismatic Lens](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Prismatic+Lens) and [Coalition Relic](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Coalition+Relic). Koutarou was satisfied to suspend a [Riftwing Cloudskate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Riftwing+Cloudskate) and play a morph, quickly leading with pressure. Shouta went for the [Damnation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Damnation) a couple turns later and while Koutarou-san had the [Mystic Snake](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mystic+Snake), Shouta had [Delay](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Delay) to suspend it away. Yasooka remained firmly in control, and kept Snake out of the game with Teferi soon after. An end step [Tombstalker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tombstalker) and a [Careful Consideration](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Careful+Consideration) further widened the advantage. Koutarou tried to stay alive with a [Take Possession](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Take+Possession) on the demon. It resolved of course but was quickly tossed via Shouta's Venser. Ootsuka was out of options as Yasooka's creatures crashed in for a speedy Game 1.


Yasooka-1  

Ootsuka-0


Game 2: Again both players again spent time fixing up, [Prismatic Lens](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Prismatic+Lens) and [Careful Consideration](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Careful+Consideration); [Foresee](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Foresee) and [Search for Tomorrow](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Search+for+Tomorrow). How many ways are there to lose a game? Card disadvantage, mana problems, being outplayed…These two players were making full efforts against it all. With perfect threats and counter-threats, these games can be an entrenched affair.



![Take Possession](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Take+Possession)

Koutarou started the offense with a suspended [Riftwing Cloudskate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Riftwing+Cloudskate) and a morph. [Take Possession](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Take+Possession) from Yasooka stole the morph, and now Shouta had a facedown Shapeshifter to call his own. Cloudskate resolved and rescued the stolen Shapeshifter, and Ootsuka ended by suspending an [Aeon Chronicler](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aeon+Chronicler). Yasooka wasn't done yet, with Teferi appearing to stymie suspend. Ootsuka had the answer with his [Vesuvan Shapeshifter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vesuvan+Shapeshifter), but resolving it wouldn't be easy with Teferi around. [Take Possession](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Take+Possession), however, was simple to land. Yasooka had a clever answer to the aura, with a hardcast Shapeshifter coming into play and copying the CIP ability of the Riftwing. [Take Possession](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Take+Possession) fell off and Teferi went back to Yasook's hand.


Teferi tried again to prevent Koutarou's Chronicler from entering play. Ootsuka shut that down with a [Mystic Snake](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mystic+Snake) backed by [Delay](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Delay), with still enough mana left over to Venser a storage land, all allowing Chronicler hit play. Chronicler took a [Slaughter Pact](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Slaughter+Pact), but Ootsuka was well ahead in cards and tempo. Yasooka quite done though, when Ootsuka went for a morph, Yasooka attempted a [Spell Burst](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spell+Burst) (for zero) with buyback. Ootsuka considered and rescued his morph spell with Venser, costing him his original but countering [Spell Burst](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spell+Burst) as well.


Snake and morph came in for Ootsuka and more morphs followed. It was getting confusing, so down came [Damnation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Damnation) to clear the air. Off a clean board, a suspended [Aeon Chronicler](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aeon+Chronicler) and an active [Urza's Factory](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Urza%27s+Factory) from Shouta looked pretty good. It looked so good in fact Ootsuka wanted a piece and cast the popular split-second aura on the land. The Factory did its thing for Ootsuka and Shouta couldn't keep up. Out of cards and time, Shouta fell to the army of turncoat Assembly Workers.

Game 3: Yasooka started with a mulligan, although both players once again made perfect mana with Expanses, [Prismatic Lens](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Prismatic+Lens)es, and [Search for Tomorrow](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Search+for+Tomorrow). With time rapidly ticking away, Yasooka decided to go aggro with an early suspended Chronicler. Ootsuka was happy to play a morph and [Foresee](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Foresee) and try to keep his own pressure on. A [Mystic Snake](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mystic+Snake) protected Koutarou's [Riftsweeper](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Riftsweeper), shuffling in the Chronicler and putting more damage on the board. Shouta needed [Damnation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Damnation) pronto and it wasn't showing up. [Urza's Factory](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Urza%27s+Factory) active made tokens as large as any creature on the board, but any kind of bounce or removal would make Shouta's defenses evaporate. Ootsuka considered and just attacked with [Riftsweeper](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Riftsweeper) and the Snake, leaving a morph behind. At the end of Shouta's turn, Koutarou flipped up a gigantic nine power in [Thelonite Hermit](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thelonite+Hermit). [Damnation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Damnation), Tendrils, and Shapeshifter would all do it, but they were required immediately, and had to resolve versus Koutarou's loaded hand. [Careful Consideration](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Careful+Consideration) dug deeper, but it also removed Shouta's ability to protect his spells. Another Careful was all but a concession, and just as time was called, Shouta Yasooka extended his hand in concession.

Ootsuka-2


  


Sunday, June 24: 2:37 p.m. - Artist Interview with rk post
----------------------------------------------------------


*by Noah Weil*

  
![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gpmon07/Rk.jpg)*Marcy and rk post*
**What is your name and where do you currently live?**


My name is rk post and I live in Kent, Washington


**How long have you been an artist and what got you started?**


I've been doing **Magic** cards for 10 years, but I've considered myself an artist since I was kid. Besides getting bored easily, I've always had a general fascination with drawing and a need to express myself visually.


**What was the first card you drew for Wizards of the Coast?**


Exodus' [Keeper of the Beasts](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Keeper+of+the+Beasts).


[Keeper of the Beasts](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Keeper%2Bof%2Bthe%2BBeasts)
**What **Magic** illustration are you most proud of and why?**


My three favorite pieces are [Unmask](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Unmask), [Lightning Angel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Angel), and [Avatar of Woe](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Avatar+of+Woe). I like them because I think they're just good pieces of art. It's art you could hang on a wall and admire.


**Any other projects you're working on right now?**


My main job is an environment artist for Sony, but there's always something. World of Warcraft cards, White Wolf projects, Versus cards... Random things come across my desk. For example, I worked on the Aliens Versus Predator movie.


**Have you been to Montreal before? What have you seen on your trip so far?**


[Unmask](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Unmask)
I've never been here, although my fiancée has been to Montreal many times. On Friday we went to the old district, and enjoyed just walking around the city. We love the really old architecture, we must have taken hundreds of photos.


**For the readers who are curious, what does the r.k. stand for?**


Well the r is Randy. As for my middle name, you'll have to guess it in person.


**Where will you be next?**


My next event is at [M-Fest/British Nationals, July 26-29](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=events/magic/m-fest). In fact that's where my fiancée and I are getting married.


**Congratulations and enjoy the rest of your trip.**


  


Sunday, June 24: 2:55 p.m. - Best Ever
--------------------------------------


*by Noah Weil*

 

Sadly, this competitor didn't make day two. But I think we'll all remember the time where [Norin the Wary](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Norin+the+Wary) did something.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gpmon07/Best.jpg)*Who's scared now?!*  


Sunday, June 24: 4:44 p.m. - Round 13: Rich Hoaen vs. Antonino De Rosa
----------------------------------------------------------------------


*by Eric Reasoner*

  
![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gpmon07/DeRosa.jpg)*Antonino endures the paparazzi.*
Both players were sitting on 27 points and needed to win out to make it to the Top 8.


The banter began as soon as the player sat down. Antonino informed us all that he was using the same sleeves he used at PT Yokohama earlier in the year. Unwilling to pay the $14 the vendors were charging for sleeves, he claimed he was "Sticking it to the man."


### Game 1


Antonino led with a [Llanowar Reborn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Llanowar+Reborn) into a 3/3 [Riftsweeper](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Riftsweeper) and a suspended Cloudskate. Rich was hoping to win through other methods.


Antonino- "You want me to be mana screwed?"  

Rich- "Yes!"  

Antonino- "What a scumbag move."


Rich played [Mystical Teachings](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mystical+Teachings) into [Careful Consideration](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Careful+Consideration), all the while keeping an eye on Ant.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gpmon07/Hoaen-1.jpg)*I don't remember drafting that.*
"What's that look? Trying to get a read? You can't get a read."


Finkel got the OK from Ant, as did a 2/2 Korlash. Jonny **Magic** wasn't long for the world and met the rough end of a [Psionic Blast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psionic+Blast) at the end of the turn. [Riftsweeper](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Riftsweeper) risked the waters against the Korlash, Antonino hoping that Rich didn't have another copy of the legend to pay the Grandeur cost. No blocks, but Antonino wasn't convinced that Rich didn't have another Korlash. The suspended Cloudskate came in to bounce the Korlash for Ant and he sent his in his team. Rich answered with a [Temporal Isolation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Temporal+Isolation) on the [Riftsweeper](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Riftsweeper). Ant then put his own Pro Tour Player Card into play as an elephant token making sure to mention what a handsome card it is while making some kind of pachyderm mating call and raising his arm in the air like a trunk.  

Rich- "I'll just pretend that never happened."


The draft-master simply untapped, cast [Damnation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Damnation) and replayed his bounced Korlash. Later a [Snapback](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snapback) on Korlash, was met by a confused look from Hoaen and responded to with a Teachings. The Teachings was suspended by a [Delay](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Delay) and a [Riftsweeper](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Riftsweeper) came down to finish it off.


Antonino-"I read that in Inquest!"



![delay](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Delay)

[Slaughter Pact](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Slaughter+Pact) hit a flashbacked Call token and Korlash made yet another appearance. [Haunting Hymn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Haunting+Hymn)s ensured that both players would be playing off the top, but Ant had a Looter Il-Kor to keep things fresh. [Careful Consideration](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Careful+Consideration) gave more Hoaen more options, while Korlash continued on the warpath, knocking out chump blockers each turn. It wasn't enough though as Ant had two Looters getting in each turn and they made short work of the wounded Hoaen.


"I punted that game pretty good"  

"Sorry"


De Rosa- 1  

Hoaen- 0


Antonino- "I have no idea what to sideboard."


### Game 2


Ant started game 2 with a mulligan and Looter Il-Kor. Finkel again was shot down by Psi Blast. Hoean returned the favor with a [Slaughter Pact](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Slaughter+Pact) on Looter. Later when he attempted to [Tendrils of Corruption](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tendrils+of+Corruption) an elephant it transformed into a monkey thanks to [Pongify](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pongify). At this point Ant had all of the tempo and the counters in hand to back it up. Hoaen tried [Careful Consideration](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Careful+Consideration). [Cancel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cancel)ed. [Damnation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Damnation)? [Delay](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Delay)ed. [Shadowmage Infiltrator](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shadowmage+Infiltrator) was Hoaen's last hope. He hit with it, drew his card and could only shake his head.


De Rosa- 2  

Hoaen- 0


  


Sunday, June 24: 5:42 p.m. - Round 14: Kenji Tsumura vs. Ben Lundquist
----------------------------------------------------------------------


*by Kyle Sanchez*

  
![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gpmon07/Ben.jpg)*Ben Lundquist*
As two sat down the crowd started to pile in. These two magicians had skillfully piloted their way to 11-2-1 records and now had to battle each other with top 8 on the line. It's a classic battle of America vs. Japan watched by a bunch of random Canadians.


Their weapons of choice: Kenji with a Mono Blue Pickles deck abusing morph creatures like [Brine Elemental](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brine+Elemental) and [Vesuvan Shapeshifter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vesuvan+Shapeshifter) to lock his opponents out. Ben was playing his homebrew UG deck featuring hits like [Tarmogoyf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf) and [Looter il-Kor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Looter+il-Kor), backed up with [Psionic Blast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psionic+Blast) and [Riftwing Cloudskate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Riftwing+Cloudskate) to tempo the opponent out.


### Game 1


The game started off with a turn 2 Looter for Ben with Kenji playing mystery men on turns 3 and 4. Ben landed a [Tarmogoyf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf) and started to whittle away at Kenji's life as he used [Delay](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Delay) and [Riftwing Cloudskate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Riftwing+Cloudskate) to try and stabilize. Ben answered with his own [Delay](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Delay) followed up with a [Riftsweeper](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Riftsweeper) and Kenji had his back against the wall as two [Looter il-Kor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Looter+il-Kor) sifted through Lundquist's deck to give him the perfect hand.

Kenji's red hair glistened as the lights from the tournament site beat down on him, making it look as though his head was on fire as he sat up in his chair, providing an intimidating shadow over the play area. The way he tapped his permanents sent shivers up the crowd's spine as they watched the best player in the World maneuver around Ben's horde of Looter's.


Kenji landed a Teferi when Ben sent in a team of [Riftsweeper](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Riftsweeper), [Tarmogoyf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf), and two Looter's and used a Shapeshifter to take out the Goyf as Teferi jumped on top of the [Riftsweeper](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Riftsweeper). On Ben's second main phase he played a mystery man of his own and Kenji thought deeply about what to do next. He was out of cards in his hand but had a [Brine Elemental](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brine+Elemental) with a suspend counter on it, along with a [Urza's Factory](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Urza%27s+Factory) that was about to go online.


Kenji started an attack of his own sending in his copied [Tarmogoyf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf) and the Teferi dropping Ben to 10. Ben put Kenji to 6 after attacking with his Looter's giving him two [Psionic Blast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psionic+Blast) in hand to potentially finish the game up. He used one on the Teferi and passed the turn and could only watch as a [Brine Elemental](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brine+Elemental) came into play with haste on Kenji's side. Kenji used [Vesuva](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vesuva)n to stop Ben from untaping for the next few turns, leaving his Shapeshifter and Brine back and simply using a Factory token to deal Ben damage.


Tsumura-1  

Lundquist-0


Game 2:


Two [Serrated Arrows](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Serrated+Arrows) from Kenji started to do a number on Ben's creatures as they took down two of his Shapeshifters in the early turns.


[Tarmogoyf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf) met Kenji's [Cancel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cancel).


[Cancel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cancel) met Ben's [Delay](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Delay).


And on the following turn [Tarmogoyf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf) met Kenji's face as it dropped the Japanese player to 13.


Ben's hand was ripe with goodies including [Mystic Snake](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mystic+Snake), [Snapback](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snapback), [Cancel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cancel), [Riftsweeper](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Riftsweeper), and another [Tarmogoyf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf) while Kenji only had one card in hand along with five more land than his opponent. Kenji ripped a [Brine Elemental](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brine+Elemental) off the top at the perfect time to stop Lundquist from untaping the rest of the game.


The next twenty or so turns were pretty boring with both players passing back and forth until Ben got enough lands to [Psionic Blast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psionic+Blast) the [Brine Elemental](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brine+Elemental). Kenji had a backup and after another twenty turns Ben scooped em' up.


Tsumura-2  

Lundquist-0


Despite Kenji winning the match I have to say that the [Island](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island)s he used are some of the ugliest ever printed. They're the ones from Mirage with clouds in the background, and I couldn't help but feel sorry for his poor taste.


A win next round that will give Ben another top 16 finish, impressive for his sophomore season.


Kenji Tsumara 2-0 over Ben Lundquist.

![Bound in Silence](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Bound+in+Silence)

Paulo defeated me at the start of day 2 which was part of my four consecutive losses that eventually led me to doing coverage, so I guess I was rooting for him here. Andre was sporting the Pro Tour Honolulu shirt and some how managed to find matching shorts. Unfortunately this wasn't a fashion show, but if it was I'd definitely give him the outfit of the weekend.


This match featured Paulo's G/W [Tarmogoyf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf) deck with [Griffin Guide](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Griffin+Guide) and maindeck [Temporal Isolation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Temporal+Isolation) against Andre's GWR [Kavu Predator](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kavu+Predator) deck featuring hits like [Fiery Justice](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fiery+Justice) and [Mystic Enforcer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mystic+Enforcer).


### Game 1


The first couple of turns each player cycled through their decks with Flagstones and [Edge of Autumn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Edge+of+Autumn) from Paulo, and a pair of [Chromatic Star](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chromatic+Star) from Andre. Both players seemed to have slow draws, but still managed to take care of each others creatures with [Temporal Isolation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Temporal+Isolation)s on both sides.


On turn 5 their Flagstones traded and they shuffled and cut each others deck, placing them in the wrong spots. Andre drew for his turn when an observer noticed that Andre had a green sleeve in his hand. After the table judge sorted things out a warning was delievered to both players, and an additional warning to Andre for looking at extra cards.


The next few turns saw both of the players [Mystic Enforcer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mystic+Enforcer)s enchanted with [Temporal Isolation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Temporal+Isolation)'s as Paulo's [Serra Avenger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Serra+Avenger) started to deal some damage to Andre. Paulo trumpted Coimbra yet again playing another [Mystic Enforcer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mystic+Enforcer). All Andre could do was [Griffin Guide](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Griffin+Guide) his [Thornweald Archer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thornweald+Archer) in attempt to stop the beats.


Paulo drew and played a [Saffi Eriksdotter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Saffi+Eriksdotter) which was too much for Andre to handle.



![Kavu Predator](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Kavu+Predator)

PV: 1  

Coimbra: 0


While sideboarding the two discussed the matchup briefly and agreed Paulo to be a slight favorite due to [Serra Avenger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Serra+Avenger) and consistent mana base. PV's Enforcers were also better because he can reach threshold much easier with Edge from Autumn.


### Game 2


Both players kept their opening hands but had slow starts due to their Flagstones trading and awkward mana. Andre's first play was an Enforcer while PV played a Saffi on turn 3. Paulo's sideboarded Bound from Silence halted [Kavu Predator](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kavu+Predator) while Paulo took a couple of hits from [Mystic Enforcer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mystic+Enforcer) which was negated by Andre's [Grove of the Burnwillows](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grove+of+the+Burnwillows).


PV was having mana problems drawing excessive [Flagstones of Trokair](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flagstones+of+Trokair) and [Terramorphic Expanse](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Terramorphic+Expanse) and the game was leaning heavily toward Andre.


Andre landed another [Mystic Enforcer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mystic+Enforcer) and a [Kavu Predator](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kavu+Predator) which proved too much for Paulo to deal with.


PV: 1  

Coimbra: 1


### Game 3


Andre took a mulligan this game but managed to get the perfect mana draw and was able to take out PV's [Tarmogoyf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf) with a [Temporal Isolation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Temporal+Isolation), one of the key cards in this matchup. Despite having an awesome hand Andre shrugged and groaned as he drew, making Paulo believe he had far less gas than he actually had.


The next turn saw Paulo getting a [Serra Avenger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Serra+Avenger) on the board while Andre shrugged and played a 4/4 [Kavu Predator](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kavu+Predator) by using two of his graft lands. This seems like a bad play since Paulo has a good amount of [Pacifism](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pacifism) like effects somewhere in his 60. He could have been trying to bait the Isolation or [Bound in Silence](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bound+in+Silence) out, but moving one counter would have accomplished that just as well, and left him with more graft possibilities.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gpmon07/AndreCoimbra.jpg)*Andre Coimbra keeps his cool*
Andre then used [Fiery Justice](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fiery+Justice) to take out the Avenger; putting five +1/+1 counters on the growing [Kavu Predator](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kavu+Predator). The huge Kavu met a [Bound in Silence](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bound+in+Silence) on the next turn and PV slammed down Avenger # 2. Andre suspended a Gargadon next turn and played a [Mystic Enforcer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mystic+Enforcer), which Paulo met with an Enforcer of his own.


Andre attacked two turns with his Enforcer and a fresh 6/7 [Tarmogoyf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf) and obtained threshold via Gargadon. Paulo blocked Enforcer with Enforcer, and [Tarmogoyf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf) with his Avenger. Once PV blocked Andre took the opportunity to play his [Fatal Frenzy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fatal+Frenzy) that he had been holding the past few turns to make [Tarmogoyf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf) a 12/7, trampling over the Avenger for the win.


Andre wins 2-1 over Paulo Vitor.
