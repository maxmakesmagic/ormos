***Magicthegathering.com** is running "best of" content during the holidays, and will return with new content January 4, 2006. This Magic Arcana originally ran November 15, 2005.*


Boros, Dimir, Golgari, Selesnya. Since the *Ravnica* set focuses on these four guilds, we've heard all about them. But the other guilds are a relative mystery. However, since Ravnica the *plane* is full of the activities of all ten guilds, there are hints about the other guilds floating around in the flavor of *Ravnica*, the cards.


It's too early to reveal too much about these guilds. But here are a few cards that have members of the other guilds in their art or in their flavor text. There's a lot you can learn about them just from the cards already released.

These cards only provide tidbits of lore about the other six guilds active in Ravnica. For them to take center stage like the other four have, you'll have to wait for *[Guildpact](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/arcana/783)* and *[Dissension](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/arcana/934)*!
