The art description of [Death Rattle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Death+Rattle) originally asked artist Vance Kovacs to depict skeletal snakes about to devour an *elf*.



> *Color: Black Spell*  
> *Location: unimportant*  
> *Action: An elf warrior is suddenly surrounded by three skeletal giant snakes that have sprung up from the black muck around him/her. The snake-skeletons are eerily all in the same posture, evenly spaced around him.*  
> *Focus: the elf's imminent death*  
> *Mood: It'll be over soon.*  
> *Notes: Not set in world of the Time Spiral style guide. Design an alternate Magic reality.*


However, the development team wanted to improve the power of giant green creatures, and changed [Death Rattle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Death+Rattle) to read "nongreen creature" instead. Showing an elf in the art would have been right out! Luckily there was time to have Vance Kovacs show a human warrior instead.
