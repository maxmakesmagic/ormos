On August 10, every article on Daily MTG had a YOU DECIDE! poll on the bottom, asking readers to choose between several different elements of a card. Those elements were: Name, Mana Cost, Art, Type Line, Rarity, Line 1, Line 2, Line 3, Artist Credit, and "Power/Toughness or Loyalty". Now that our readers have decided, we're going to reveal a *Zendikar* card, bit by bit, in the order given by the poll. Two of the results were very close, but they'll still be revealed separately.


New updates will occur every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday until the entire card is revealed. Today's update: Line 1 *and* Line 3Rarity, Line 2, and, what the heck, Artist Credit! It's the whole card!
