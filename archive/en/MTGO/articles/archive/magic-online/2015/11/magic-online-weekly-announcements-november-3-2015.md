***Magic Online* Format Updates and FAQ**


We've been listening to player feedback regarding the below format removals and understand the desire for more information about these changes and how they'll help us focus our efforts to improve *Magic Online*. If you missed it, *Magic Online* R&D Robert Schuster answered some of the most common questions in a [recent post](http://wizardsmtgo.tumblr.com/post/132168258539/format-removal-qa#notes) on the official [*Magic Online* Tumblr](http://wizardsmtgo.tumblr.com/).


In order to focus our efforts on improving the most popular formats on *Magic Online*, we are removing official support for some rarely-played formats and player configurations with the November 11, 2015 downtime. Combined, the removal of the formats below represents less than one percent of play on *Magic Online*.


The full list of formats removed during the November 11, 2015 downtime are:


 


* Block Constructed
* Standard Pauper
* 100 Card Singleton
* Prismatic
* Legacy Tribal Wars
* Emperor
* All games with five or six players
* All team play, including Two-Headed Giant

 


Block Constructed and Standard Pauper decks will be moved to become Standard decks in the Collection scene. 100 Card Singleton, Prismatic and Legacy Tribal Wars decks will be moved to become Legacy decks in the Collection scene.


We are always looking to improve the player experience on *Magic Online*. Trimming our offerings will allow us to focus on improving the most-played formats, and will simplify the interface for starting a game.


For those looking for a game, here are our currently supported formats for up to 4 players:


 


* Standard
* Modern
* Legacy
* Vintage
* Planeswalker
* Pauper
* Commander
* Planechase
* Momir Basic
* Freeform Vanguard
* Freeform

***Magic Online* Store Inventory Changes**


Keeping the *Magic Online* Store fresh and up to date is important. Preventing players from having to browse through long lists of older products to find the items they want helps reduce frustration and ensure that store offerings are kept relevant. With this in mind, the *Magic Online* Store was updated during the Wednesday, October 28 downtime, removing a number of the earlier Commander decks from sale. All five *Commander (2014 Edition)* decks will remain on sale (Forged In Stone, Peer Through Time, Sworn To Darkness, Built From Scratch, and Guided By Nature), but the ten decks from *Commander (2011 Edition)* and *Commander (2013 Edition)* were removed.

**Updated Redemption Schedule**


As we transition into the [new Standard rotation](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/feature/metamorphosis-redux-2015-08-24) we have also updated our *Magic Online* Redemption guidelines, so new redemption dates will be more closely aligned with the new Standard rotation schedule beginning with *Battle for Zendikar*. *Battle for Zendikar* Redemption dates can be found below!
