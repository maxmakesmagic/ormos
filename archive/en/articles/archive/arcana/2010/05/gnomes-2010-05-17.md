Sometimes you just want to look at a cute little gnome, you know? But we like to stay current around here and there aren't any gnomes in *Rise of the Eldrazi*. What to do? Well, luckily for us, *Urza's Saga* hit **Magic Online** a little over a month ago. And we've been shockingly negligent in showing you some of the cool tidbits from *that* set!

We shall start with a cute gnome. Let's say you wanted to show something that a mage would use to keep track of time. You'd probably end up with [Metrognome](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Metrognome)!

Now, back in 1998, you had to bring out beads or face-down lands or something to represent your gnomes. But now we have tokens! And we have a computer that is happy to put them out for you. So we commissioned art to go on the gnome tokens. And you know what that means: *new* adorable gnomes!

This piece was assigned to Ron Spencer with the note that it should look like a gnome from the same workbench that [Metrognome](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Metrognome) is sitting on. Behold!
