Dave Williams emerged from this format as the winner although it might be the only trophy he takes home this weekend. A dismal 0-3 performance in yesterday’s MQ Draft found him trailing the leaders with poor tiebreakers. With only three round left the stars will need to align just right for him to climb within the top 2 spots that will advance to the finals.

This was definitely and exciting format with many wild plays and degenerate decks. The highlight of the tournament came in Trent Boneau and Jeff Taylor’s match when Jeff cast Void for 8 to deal with a reanimated Avatar of Woe. When he looked at Trent’s hand he found an 8 casting cost Verdant Force waiting to be discarded. Trent’s other card? Living Death. Trent’s own rules? Sorceries may be cast at instant speed. Yikes!
