Alongside that announcement was the unveiling of the three "Grand Prix TBD"s that coincide on the same weekend, with the main event taking place on May 30 and 31. Those three Grand Prix are:


* Las Vegas, Nevada, USA, at the [Las Vegas Convention Center](http://www.lvcva.com/who-we-are/our-facilities/las-vegas-convention-center/)
* Utrecht, the Netherlands, at [Jaabeurs Utrecht](http://www.jaarbeurs.nl/en)
* Chiba, Japan, at [Makuhari Messe](http://www.m-messe.co.jp/en/)

The format for the main event of these Grand Prix is *Modern Masters* (2015 Edition) Limited.


While Grand Prix Chiba will be a three-day spectacle, Grand Prix Las Vegas and Utrecht will be four day events starting on Thursday, May 28, and will be part of a global celebration of *Modern Masters* (2015 Edition). And because we know that these events will be massive celebrations, the venues hosting these Grand Prix will be spacious enough to support record-breaking main events.


Grand Prix Utrecht will have enough venue space to accommodate a maximum main event capacity of 5,000 players, and Grand Prix Chiba will be able to accommodate 4,000 main event players, along with ample space for additional events across the rest of the weekend.


Grand Prix Las Vegas will take the concept of prize money scaling with main event participation to a whole new level. When registration for this event reaches 5,001 players, this Grand Prix will be split into two Grand Prix instead, run concurrently in the same venue. The Two Grand Prix, in total, will allow Grand Prix Las Vegas to accommodate a maximum main event capacity of 10,000 players.


And if that's not enough *Modern Masters* (2015 Edition) for you, all three of these Grand Prix will be offering a variety of side events featuring the epic set across all four days!


May 28-31 is a global *Modern Masters* (2015 Edition) celebration, and you won't want to miss out on the chance to make *Magic* history.
