Burnished on the chest of the silver golem Karn is the symbol of his creator, Urza.

You can see other shots of the symbol wherever Karn is depicted, and in many of the cards where Urza is depicted, which is rather a lot throughout the Weatherlight Saga.


Check out the *Urza's Legacy* art of [Blessed Reversal](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Blessed%2BReversal). Karn and Jhoira stand behind Urza, who casts a spell to protect them from a swarm of attacking angels controlled by Radiant. Urza's symbol can be seen on a medallion on his chest.

The symbol is somewhat covered up on [Brawl](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brawl) and [Jaded Response](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jaded+Response), but you can see better detail on it on Urza's costuming on [Stroke of Genius](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stroke+of+Genius). Note the blueprint of Karn on the wall, behind Urza.

Urza can be seen magically burning his symbol into the metal surface of an artifact creature in the art of Brand.
