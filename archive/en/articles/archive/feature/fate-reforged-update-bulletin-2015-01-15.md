Welcome to the *Fate Reforged* update. My name is Matt, and I'll be taking care of you today. For our first course, we have some delicious card updates for you. The chef has prepared a delectable blend of functional and nonfunctional updates to tickle the senses and please the palate. From savory roast pangolin to the sweet tang of [Crypt Rat](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crypt+Rats) tartare, there's sure to be something for everyone.



The main course features changes and additions to the Comprehensive Rules. Now that *Fate Reforged* is in season, the fruits of that set will be on full display: rules for manifest and the other new abilities, support for some of the more eccentric new cards, and a plethora of tweaks and tightening.



Today's feast wouldn't be possible without you, the diner. You inspire us with your insatiable passion for *Magic*, and you even suggest recipes and techniques to try. I hope you continue to enjoy our creations as much as we enjoy… um, creating them. Let's eat!
