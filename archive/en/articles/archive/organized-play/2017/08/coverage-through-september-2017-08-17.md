Nationals Weekends . . . Wait, Nationals?!
==========================================


That's right! [2017 Nationals](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/premierplay/2017nationals) weekends kick off September 9–10 and continue September 16–17, and we'll be broadcasting Nationals coverage from one country each of those weekends! My boss, Greg Collins, has more to say on what to expect from these two weekends.

*National Championship weekends are almost upon us! We're excited to showcase the return of this popular tournament with video coverage on [twitch.tv/magic](https://www.twitch.tv/magic) on each of the three Nationals weekends. We start with Japan Nationals on September 9–10, continue with England Nationals on September 16-17, and conclude with US Nationals on October 14–15.*


*Coverage from England and US Nationals will be streamed live. For Japan Nationals, we're trying something new with video coverage. The English-language video coverage will be shifted to start at mid-morning Saturday and Sunday—approximately 17 hours after the days' starts in Japan—to make the coverage more accessible for audiences in Europe and North America. Because all the rounds will be done before we start the day's stream, we will be able to remove the excess time between rounds, have more relevant deck and player information for each round, and streamline the entire day's broadcast. There will still be a live Japanese-language stream on Nico Nico for the local audience.*


*We'll send a small video production team and a writer to the event, with the commentators and another video production team back in our Renton, Washington, offices. To make sure the English-speaking audience can stay as spoiler-free as possible, we will also be delaying all official English written and social media coverage to align with the playback of each day's video matches. Spoiling match results in chat will be highly discouraged!*


*We're definitely viewing this as an experimental approach to coverage, and any experiment needs feedback on how it went, so let us know what you think!*

So there you have it:


* September 9–10: Japan Nationals, mid-morning (start times TBD)
* September 16–17: England Nationals, start times TBD
* October 14–15: US Nationals, start times TBD

Tune in all three weekends to see who will be crowned National Champion in Japan, England, and the USA!


We've got an exciting few weeks of coverage to take us all the way up to the release of *Ixalan*. Tune in every weekend starting with this one to catch it all live!
