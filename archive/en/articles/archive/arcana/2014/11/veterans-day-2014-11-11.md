In the United States, today is what is known as Veterans Day, where we honor the contributions of the men and women in the armed forces. Originally set aside as Armistice Day—the day marked to commemorate the end of hostilities on the Western Front during World War I—and often called Remembrance Day around the world, November 11 means a lot of things to a lot of different people.


Everyone has their own way of commemorating the day, so we're going to put an Arcana spin on things and peek behind the art descriptions on some of *Magic*'s veterans in card form.


Benalish Veteran
================


Color: White creature  

Location: Battlefield  

Action: This is a veteran infantry soldier in his 40s or 50s, but who's still one of the best warriors around. Show him as a strong man with a long gray braid or ponytail. He's helmetless and shieldless—he only believes in his chestplate and his greatsword. Show him barreling forward fearlessly into the fray, perhaps attacking two ogres.  

Focus: The veteran soldier  

Mood: A career soldier who's at his best in battle.

Infantry Veteran
================


Color: White creature  

Location: Battlefield  

Action: Show a human soldier, a 30-year-old veteran, with a few scars but fit and strong and in his military prime. He's shouting to his fellow infantry-men, sword ready, but beckoning for the rest of the line to catch up with him.  

Focus: The veteran soldier (other soldiers can be out-of-frame or in the background)  

Mood: "Hurry, press the attack! You, head for their mages! I'll cover you!"

Ordruun Veteran
===============


Color: Red/White creature (Boros guild)  

Location: Near a Boros barracks building or other Boros location.  

Action: Show an armored minotaur soldier of the Boros guild. He wields a curved, wavy sword. He's a deft swordsman.  

Focus: The minotaur soldier  

Mood: The physique of a heavyweight prize fighter, and the sword skills of a military champion

Veteran of the Depths
=====================


Color: White Creature  

Location: River surface  

Action: Show a lean, wiry merfolk fighter in an active pose. His (or her, up to you) scaly skin is scarred and chipped from many battles, and maybe he's got a torn facial fin, but his expression is restrained and aloof. He should have a cool trademark weapon crafted from natural materials, such as a long antler or bone haft edged with razor-sharp river-mussel shells.  

Focus: The merfolk warrior  

Mood: Tough, aloof, strong
