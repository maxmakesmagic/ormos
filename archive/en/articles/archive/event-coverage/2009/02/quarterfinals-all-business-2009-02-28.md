### Luis Scott-Vargas vs. Masayasu Tanahashi

Luis Scott-Vargas, entering the Top 8 at the top of the standings, and relative unknown Masayasu Tanahashi wasted no time in getting started. Both players were all business, and a language barrier prevented any communication before or between their games.

**Game 1**

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/ptkyo09/qf1_tanahashi.jpg)*Masayasu Tanahashi plays in his first PT Top 8 match.*Scott-Vargas won the roll and Tanahashi mulliganed to six, and Scott-Vargas opened with a [Tidehollow Sculler](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tidehollow+Sculler) taking his opponent’s [Broken Ambitions](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Broken+Ambitions), followed by [Glorious Anthem](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glorious+Anthem) and an attack. Next turn, Tanahashi’s [Mutavault](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mutavault) woke up to try to help a [Spellstutter Sprite](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spellstutter+Sprite) counter Scott-Vargas’s second [Tidehollow Sculler](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tidehollow+Sculler), but [Terror](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Terror) killed the [Mutavault](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mutavault) to fizzle the [Spellstutter Sprite](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spellstutter+Sprite)’s ability and let [Tidehollow Sculler](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tidehollow+Sculler) take another [Broken Ambitions](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Broken+Ambitions). 

Down a land and another card, Tanahashi conceded less than three minutes into the round when Scott-Vargas played a turn-five [Cloudgoat Ranger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloudgoat+Ranger).

**Game 2**

Scott-Vargas mulliganed, then answered Tanahashi’s first-turn [Faerie Conclave](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Faerie+Conclave) with a first-turn [Windbrisk Heights](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Windbrisk+Heights). Tanahashi played a [Sunken Ruins](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sunken+Ruins), which forced him to mana-burn for one when he [Thoughtseize](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtseize)d Scott-Vargas. He saw an awesome hand of two [Glorious Anthem](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glorious+Anthem)s, two [Bitterblossom](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bitterblossom)s, a [Caves of Koilos](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Caves+of+Koilos), and a [Reflecting Pool](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reflecting+Pool), and thought for awhile before taking one of the [Bitterblossom](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bitterblossom)s. Scott-Vargas played the remaining [Bitterblossom](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bitterblossom) on his turn and passed to Tanahashi who showed Scott-Vargas a [Spellstutter Sprite](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spellstutter+Sprite) when he played a [Secluded Glen](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Secluded+Glen) so that he could play Jace Beleron, which he ticked down to two counters to draw a card. This left Scott-Vargas open to play his [Glorious Anthem](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glorious+Anthem). Jace ticked down to one counter and Tanahashi who played a [Faerie Conclave](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Faerie+Conclave) and passed with only three mana available. A Faerie Rogue token killed Jace, and Scott-Vargas played another [Bitterblossom](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bitterblossom) leaving two lands untapped so Tanahashi couldn’t counter with a [Broken Ambitions](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Broken+Ambitions). Tanahashi played [Spellstutter Sprite](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spellstutter+Sprite) at the end of Scott-Vargas’s turn.

Scott-Vargas sipped a giant bottle of iced tea while Tanahashi tried to find a way out of a very difficult board and eventually passed without so much as a land drop. Scott-Vargas played a [Kitchen Finks](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kitchen+Finks), and Tanahashi tapped out to animate a [Faerie Conclave](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Faerie+Conclave) and counter it with [Spellstutter Sprite](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spellstutter+Sprite) before he fell to 13 from Scott-Vargas’s attack. Tanahashi played his fifth land and passed, and on Scott-Vargas’s beginning of combat step, Tanahashi played a [Mistbind Clique](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mistbind+Clique) to stop Scott-Vargas from activating his [Windbrisk Heights](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Windbrisk+Heights). Scott-Vargas attacked with four tokens and lost one to the [Mistbind Clique](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mistbind+Clique) to drop Tanahashi to 7.

On Tanahashi’s turn he attacked with the [Mistbind Clique](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mistbind+Clique), which killed another token, but left Scott-Vargas with four more tokens. Tanahashi held off [Windbrisk Heights](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Windbrisk+Heights) for another turn by using [Cryptic Command](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cryptic+Command) to tap Scott-Vargas’s creatures and draw a card, but that allowed Scott-Vargas to resolve a [Spectral Procession](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spectral+Procession) that Tanahashi had no way to counter with only two mana available. At the end of Scott-Vargas’s turn, Tanahashi tapped out to play an [Agony Warp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Agony+Warp) to kill a token and Scott-Vargas took the opportunity to [Path to Exile](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Path+to+Exile) Tanahashi’s [Mistbind Clique](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mistbind+Clique). Tanahashi drew for the turn and conceded.

Scott-Vargas intently pile shuffled while Tanahashi took some time to take in the scenery, looking all around before what could be his final game of the tournament. 

**Game 3**

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/ptkyo09/qf1_scott-vargas.jpg)*Up two games, Luis Scott-Vargas takes no chances.*Tanahashi mulliganed again and LSV brightened up and looked away from the cards for the first time since the last game. That was before Tanahashi mulliganed a second time. Scott-Vargas had a turn-two [Bitterblossom](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bitterblossom) after Tanahashi missed his second land drop. Scott-Vargas followed up with a third-turn [Tidehollow Sculler](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tidehollow+Sculler), which took the [Bitterblossom](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bitterblossom)—the reason Tanahashi had kept the one-land hand—before Tanahashi drew a land to play it. On turn four Scott-Vargas played a [Kitchen Finks](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kitchen+Finks), and Tanahashi, who had finally found his second land, played a [Spellstutter Sprite](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spellstutter+Sprite) at the end of Scott-Vargas’s turn.

It was mostly futile at this point, as Tanahashi’s deck has a trouble beating a [Bitterblossom](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bitterblossom) even with lands, but when Scott-Vargas attacked with everything Tanahashi blocked the [Tidehollow Sculler](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tidehollow+Sculler) and [Peppersmoke](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Peppersmoke)d it to get his [Bitterblossom](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bitterblossom) back. Luis added a [Knight of Meadowgrain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Knight+of+Meadowgrain) and a [Kitchen Finks](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kitchen+Finks) to the board, knowing Tanahashi’s 75 did not include [Infest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Infest). Tanahashi still hadn’t hit his third land, and he was now too far behind to even play his [Bitterblossom](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bitterblossom). Instead, he left his mana open for an [Agony Warp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Agony+Warp), but when Scott-Vargas played a [Glorious Anthem](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glorious+Anthem), Tanahashi was out of options. He conceded after drawing his next card.

Luis Scott-Vargas defeats Masayasu Tanahashi 3-0 and advances to the Semifinals!
