The April 8, 2016 Update

The Daily *Magic* Update is a roundup of everything *Magic* you should know on April 8, 2016. Today's Update is brought to you by [The Gitrog Monster](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=The+Gitrog+Monster), which is absolutely everywhere today. In fact, can we declare April 8 international [The Gitrog Monster](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=The+Gitrog+Monster) Day? Who do I need to call to make that happen?


Today's Must
============


1. [Ross VS. Majors: White-Black Midrange VS. Black-Green Ramp](http://www.starcitygames.com/article/32733_Ross-VS-Majors-.html) | StarCityGames.com | Ross Merriam and Michael Majors

With the [StarCityGames.com Open](#baltimore) happening this weekend, this Versus video breaks out versions of two of the likely heavy hitters in Standard. On one side, we have White-Black Midrange, a deck that's sure to be popular in some form in order to take advantage of [Sorin, Grim Nemesis](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sorin%2C+Grim+Nemesis) and [Archangel Avacyn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Archangel+Avacyn).


On the other, we have a ramp strategy—possibly the default deck for the weekend—but this one playing black instead of red to play [The Gitrog Monster](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=The+Gitrog+Monster) and [Deathcap Cultivator](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deathcap+Cultivator). If you want a preview of what Standard could look like this weekend, this is a good place to start (though, admittedly, the Frog Horror will probably take a back seat to [Kozilek's Return](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kozilek%27s+Return)).


After That, Read, Watch, or Listen to These
===========================================


1. [[MTG] *Magic Duels*—*Shadows over Innistrad* Update](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XSTfO5uyIA) | TCGPlayer | Ryan Gomez and Jon Corpora

*Magic Duels* recently released its *Shadows over Innistrad* update (and, um, *Oath of the Gatewatch*), and Ryan Gomez and Jon Corpora were on set to review the new release. If you haven't downloaded it yet, but are curious whether you should, click that little play button below.


<https://www.youtube.com/embed/4XSTfO5uyIA>


1. [*Shadows over Innistrad* Set Review: Rare and Mythic Rare](http://lrcast.com/limited-resources-331-shadows-over-innistrad-set-review-rare-and-mythic-rare/) | Limited Resources | Marshall Sutcliffe and Luis Scott-Vargas

There are fewer rares and mythic rares to discuss than commons and uncommons, so this podcast reviewing the harder-to-find cards in the set clocks in at a scant 3 hours. In Limited Resources time, that's nothing. That's barely a podcast at all. Come on guys, are you even trying?


1. [Brewing with Ancestral Vision and Sword of the Meek](http://www.toplevelpodcast.com/eye-of-ugin/) | Top Level Podcast | Mike Flores and Patrick Chapin

You knew they'd chime in eventually. Mike Flores and Patrick Chapin innovate their way through a discussion of the bannings news and start brewing with [Ancestral Vision](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ancestral+Vision) and [Sword of the Meek](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sword+of+the+Meek).


What People Are Talking About
=============================


1. [#KenjiWayfinder](https://twitter.com/hashtag/kenjiwayfinder)

It's that time of year again! The time of year when a few Japanese players start posting tons of new decks online. Every once in a while, one of the decks truly breaks out, whether it's from Kenji Tsumura, as the above link goes to, or Tomoharu Saito (who, as of this writing, hadn't posted anything for this set, but would do so as [#SaitoWayfinder](https://twitter.com/hashtag/saitowayfinder)). Kenji posted a whopping fourteen decks this time around. My favorite was the first—[Punishing Frog](https://twitter.com/hareruyaEnglish/status/718287572670234625), which we'll talk about in the [Deck of the Day below](#deck).

> If this is New Vintage, I'm all in: <https://t.co/xRds2YYc92>

>  — Stephen Menendian (@SMenendian) [April 8, 2016](https://twitter.com/SMenendian/status/718247046063517697)


Not nearly as many people are talking about it, but Vintage had an updated banned and restricted list as well, with [Lodestone Golem](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lodestone+Golem) getting restricted. Stephen Menendian approved of the initial results rolling in.


What to Watch This Weekend
==========================


1. [StarCityGames.com Baltimore Open Weekend](http://www.starcitygames.com/events/090416_baltimore_fact_sheet.html)

*Shadows over Innistrad* will have barely been legal when the Baltimore Open puts the new Standard in the spotlight for the first time. With the rotation, old Standard decks just won't be legal, which means people will have to come with something new, something borrowed, or something blue. All of the action takes place on [twitch.tv/scglive](https://www.twitch.tv/scglive) as Cedric Phillips and Craig Krempels provide commentary starting at 10:30 a.m. ET (7:30 a.m. PT)


Community Spotlight
===================


1. [Seal of Removal](http://sorcast.co.uk/) | Jack and Sophie

While we're often quite focused on American podcasts and videos (what with me speaking only English and bad German), that doesn't mean we have to stick with North America. [Seal of Removal](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seal+of+Removal) is a relatively new podcast out of the United Kingdom that focuses on Limited. It has been running since January and is now on [episode ten](http://sorcast.co.uk/podcast/episode-10-shadows-over-innistrad-full-spoiler). So if Limited podcasts are your thing, check this one out.


And, yes, they do have full-on British accents. That alone might be worth your time.


1. [Planeswalker Map](http://i.imgur.com/GV2WmeR.png)

I can't speak to its accuracy, but this was a cool find. Reddit user fudefite made this map of where various Planeswalkers have traveled in the story. It was somewhat [buried in a random Reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/4dvjtp/how_does_jace_know_about_kamigawa/d1upgyr), but definitely worth a look if you love the story and also difficult to read but incredibly detailed charts.


Deck of the Day
===============


1. [Punishing Frog](https://twitter.com/hareruyaEnglish/status/718287572670234625)

[I wrote about synergies](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/how-build/new-standard-synergies-2016-03-25) built around [The Gitrog Monster](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=The+Gitrog+Monster) a few weeks back, so I'm absolutely tickled someone published a list using all four of the cards I thought would be sweet when combined.


The list is a Jund deck that utilizes a lot of land synergies to control the board and deal a ton of damage to opponents with [Molten Vortex](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Molten+Vortex). Combined with [Groundskeeper](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Groundskeeper), [Molten Vortex](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Molten+Vortex) reads "1RG: Deal 2 damage to a creature or player." Throw in [The Gitrog Monster](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=The+Gitrog+Monster), and you get to draw a card every time you do that. [Drownyard Temple](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Drownyard+Temple) even adds some additional utility for lands you pitch to Vortex or sacrifice at the altar of Gitrog.


But it doesn't end there. Kenji added in [Radiant Flames](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Radiant+Flames) to give the deck time to set up and [Painful Truths](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Painful+Truths) as a way to add more fuel to the fire. [Vessel of Nascency](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vessel+of+Nascency) is great because it can dig to find any part of the combo, plus the lands that go to the graveyard can later be retrieved by [Groundskeeper](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Groundskeeper). [Magmatic Insight](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Magmatic+Insight) also lets you draw cards by pitching lands you can get back later. Throw in [Mina and Denn, Wildborn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mina+and+Denn%2C+Wildborn), and you'll have lands changing zones at your whim.


Plus, you can make a trampling, deathtouch Frog Horror. And who doesn't want that?
