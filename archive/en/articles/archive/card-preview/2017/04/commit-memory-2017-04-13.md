Commit This to Memory

 Maria is one half of the podcast Magic the Amateuring. When she's not working on the podcast, she's probably in an improv show, speaking Welsh, or thinking about popcorn. Rakdos is the true nature of her heart. 






Do you ever sit and wonder to yourself why blue is known as the color of sadness when all it's done is bring you endless, endless joy?


That's right, blue mages. I'm looking at you.


If you're the kind of person who immediately says "*Island!*" when someone asks you what the best card in your deck is, brace yourself. If you're the kind of person who requires your opponent to ask for permission before any spell resolves, get ready. If you're the kind of person who thinks, "*Why do you have to be so controlling?!*" is a compliment, take a deep breath.


Because I just might have a preview card you're never gonna forget.


Everyone, say a great big hello to Commit to Memory.


![](https://media.wizards.com/2017/dw466ytu5_akh/en_13KqTK74C8.png)


This is a very powerful—and very interesting—card. It's also highly flexible. In a game like *Magic*, the power of having options can never be underestimated.


But let's start with the basics.


Commit
======


Commit is a handy spell that's a bit like a Swiss army knife—it can do it all.


It can deal with all different types of cards. From giant creatures to instants and sorceries, Commit is well versed in setting your opponent back. It's especially great against time-sensitive spells, such as pump spells or other counters. In this way, putting your opponent's card just below the top of their library is pretty close to just countering it completely.


After all, it's not asking too much to keep mana open and cast Commit based on what your opponent does on their turn. That means flexibility! And the possibility for blowouts! Yay blowouts!



!["Whoa, two-for-one!"](https://media.wizards.com/2017/images/daily/szmjs97tvG_Blowout.jpg)*"Whoa, two-for-one!"*
Imagine casting Commit in response to your opponent playing a Cartouche on their creature, pumping up their Flameblade Adept with discard, or bouncing an embalmed creature like Trueheart Duelist. Hello, Value Town!


If you really are a "true blue" mage and you've packed even *more* counter magic into your deck, it gives you a second chance at stopping something important after you've bounced it and your opponent attempts to replay it again a few turns later.


It's not often you're given the ability to cast effects similar to [Oust](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oust) or [Remand](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Remand) with the same card. You can even save your own creature from removal if you're in a pinch!


Commit is also good if you find yourself in the middle of a counter war. That's because the next time your opponent tries to cast that same counter spell, you already know about it.


And, as the saying goes, knowing is half the battle. (*Little known fact: The other half of the battle is countering stuff.*)


Memory
======


Memory uses one of *Amonkhet*'s distinctive new mechanics, aftermath. Aftermath is great because it gives your spell usefulness after it's been cast and goes to the graveyard—or, more flavorfully, the afterlife. (Read more about how aftermath works in the [mechanics article](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/feature/amonkhet-mechanics-2017-04-03)!)


This card not only allows you to play with aftermath, but, perhaps even *more* interestingly, it also allows you to strip aftermath *away* from your opponent.


For instance: let's say your opponent is playing an aftermath- or embalm-fueled deck. Commit /// Memory lets you either counter their spell or send their biggest baddie back into their library. Then, it allows you to shuffle that monster or spell away (hopefully forever) while also removing any hope they had of casting their cards with aftermath or embalm by sending them right back into their deck as well.


Memory packs some serious graveyard hate that could be quite useful in formats like Modern or Commander.


I also really like the way Memory works with the red God in Amonkhet.

Red has a strong discard theme in this set. You can see this in cards like Hazoret the Fervent or Flamebade Adept. You get to pitch cards to pump your Adept or activate Hazoret's ability—burning your opponent's creatures or hitting their life total. All of this helps you beat down while simultaneously getting Hazoret online and freeing yourself up to discard zero and draw a brand-new seven.


Did I mention a trip to Value Town?


I thought I'd have a little fun and whip up a Standard list built around Commit /// Memory and its synergy with Hazoret and madness spells from *Shadows over* *Innistrad* block. Oh yeah, and Drake Haven just might make an appearance too. Can you taste the spice?!

The idea here is to empty your hand for value with madness spells—generating power for Flameblade Adept and [Furyblade Vampire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Furyblade+Vampire) while mobilizing Hazoret, making 2/2 Drakes, and getting ready to refuel with Commit /// Memory. I drew this up in the middle of preview season, so there's a chance that more awesome cards that would fit in this deck have yet to appear!


It's important to note that Memory is what we call a "symmetrical effect." It affects all players the same way. Everyone is going to discard their hand and draw seven cards, so it'll take a little bit of setup on your part to make it more beneficial for you. Letting your opponent draw a fresh seven is at its best when they are either not drawing as many cards as you, or are losing key spells in the graveyard. The reason a discard deck is potentially a good fit for Memory is that it frequently runs out of cards in hand, meaning you will get more value out of it than your opponents.


What awesome things will you do with our newest preview card? While it seems like a card with only two modes, in reality, it has a lot more. Shoot me a tweet [@MissMariapants](https://twitter.com/missmariapants) if you have an idea of how to best make this rare shine.


And prepare to get your Trials on at the [*Amonkhet* Prereleases](http://magic.wizards.com/en/event-types/prerelease), starting April 22!
