**What archetypes did you draft?** **Which was your favorite?** Black-green stuff (featuring [Vraska, Relic Seeker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vraska%2C+Relic+Seeker)). I didn't like either of them.

**Hometown**: Foxboro, Massachusetts




**Team**: ChannelFireball

**Limited Record**: 5-1

**What archetypes did you draft? Which was your favorite?** Blue-Red Pirates and then Black-Red Pirates. Black-red was my favorite because it had a lot of bad cards that worked well together.




**What Standard deck are you playing and why?** Four-Color Energy. Energy is just too powerful and Vraska helped the bad matchups.




**What card was your MVP for the weekend?** [Chandra, Torch of Defiance](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chandra%2C+Torch+of+Defiance)




**What would winning the Pro Tour mean to you?** I've come up short before and have looked back on it as a missed opportunity. I'd love to put that behind me and have the title of Pro Tour Champ.

**Age**: 24




**Hometown**: Quebec City, Quebec




**Team**: Massdrop East




**Previous *Magic* Accomplishments** : 13 Grand Prix Top 8s and Pro Tour *Oath of the Gatewatch* Top 8




**Limited Record**: 5-1




**Standard Record**: 7-1-2




**What archetypes did you draft? Which was your favorite?** White-black, [then] blue-black splashing [Vraska, Relic Seeker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vraska%2C+Relic+Seeker), [Lightning Strike](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Strike), and [Marauding Looter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Marauding+Looter). Easily the second one.




**What Standard deck are you playing and why?** White-Blue [God-Pharaoh's Gift](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=God-Pharaoh%27s+Gift). I played it a ridiculous amount and I knew I wasn't going to do well if I only played Temur Energy mirror matches. I needed something a little under the radar.

**What would winning the Pro Tour mean to you?** Going to Worlds—it's one of the tournaments I've never played and I would love to compete at the highest possible level.
