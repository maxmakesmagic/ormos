For uncommon, probably [Ornitharch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ornitharch). And then for rare/mythic, I think [Forgestoker Dragon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forgestoker+Dragon) is the best rare."*

[Raised by Wolves](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Raised+by+Wolves) is the best uncommon. I also like WU Heroic so I think [Ephara, God of the Polis](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ephara%2C+God+of+the+Polis) is the best rare you can open."*

For rare/mythic, I would most want to open either [Xenagos, God of Revels](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Xenagos%2C+God+of+Revels) or [Forgestoker Dragon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forgestoker+Dragon)."*

I think it is my top pick. For uncommon, it is [Glimpse the Sun God](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glimpse+the+Sun+God). For common, it is Snake of the Garden Grove."*
