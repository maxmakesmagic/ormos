How far can we take the art of crafting decks? That's what Sean "Day[9]" Plott hopes to answer in his brand-new *Magic: The Gathering Arena* Twitch series, What the Deck, debuting on **Monday, May 6** (12 p.m. PT/3 p.m. ET) at [twitch.tv/day9tv](https://www.twitch.tv/day9tv).


On What the Deck, Day9 and a guest will battle each other in a no-stakes match using user-submitted decks. These decks are built around themes that aren't often seen in competitive playâ€”alternate-win conditions, unusually expensive spells, oddly specific legendaries, and more. The guest roster will include the likes of Brian "Brian Kibler" Kibler and ProfessorNox.


The idea for the series started with nostalgia for Day[9]'s early days of kitchen-table *Magic* with friends. "I loved building subpar decks around questionable strategies and laughing as the Rube Goldberg machine of our poor decision making played out. What the Deck is all about the goofy, fun-focused spirit of kitchen-table *Magic*," said Day[9].


Wizards of the Coast will help produce the first five episodes of this bi-weekly series. We're excited to see where the fans take this into the future. Expect crazy deck ideas, plenty of viewer interactivity, and maniacal fun. This show is focused on the fun of *Magic*. While there are plenty of competitive events out there, this is not one of those.


In the first episode, Day[9] will be playing community-submitted decks featuring the lovable legendary homunculus [Fblthp, the Lost](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fblthp%2C+the+Lost), while Kibler will be playing multicolored decks built around the powerful legendary Dragon card [Niv-Mizzet Reborn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Niv-Mizzet+Reborn).


For those unable to watch this David-versus-Goliath event live, Day[9] will share all videos as VODs on YouTube as well. We'll see you there!
