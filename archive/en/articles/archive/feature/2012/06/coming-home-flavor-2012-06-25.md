One of **Magic**'s most crucial strengths is its elasticity. We get to push the game in weird directions, let it build in scale and expand in complexity, urge it to wander off to some uncharted nook of the possibility space. But then, after that block-long walkabout, it's able to snap back to its center again. **Magic** finds its way home, restoring itself to a state of classic game play and resonant fantasy mainstays that people can recognize and identify with.

This elasticity allows **Magic** to ramp up its twisty mechanics and intricate game play. It allows the game to periodically explode in a glorious spectacle, but then also be reborn new and fresh every year, phoenix-style. ***Magic** 2013* is that baby reborn phoenix, squawking its way out of the ashes, fresh-feathered, with no sign of its old life in evidence. The core set is the homecoming, allowing **Magic** to roam, to explore, to run wild as it needs to throughout the year.

It's about that time. In the not-too-distant future, it'll be time to make our pyre-nest and be reborn. As the lead designer of ***Magic** 2013*, I'd like to welcome you home.

### The *Magic 2013* Design Team

A lot of you know me as the voice behind [Savor the Flavor](http://archive.wizards.com/www.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Archive.aspx?tag=SavortheFlavor), the now-retired column about **Magic**'s art, flavor, and all things Vorthos here on **DailyMTG.com**. And my main role in R&D continues to be working on the creative team, writing what needs written and giving every world, set, and card its own flavor-intensive sparkle (and we have a lot of goodies in the pipeline—oh man!). Every set passes through our team, and we love all those precious children—but ***Magic** 2013* has a special place in my cardiac organ because I was the set's lead designer, and my awesome team has made you the best set ever ever in all of time no really let me show you it.

It's Mark Rosewater's tradition [to introduce you to every design team](/en/node/655466), but I want to take a moment to talk about this posse of card-set-designing badasses as well.

**Aaron Forsythe**

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/mtgcom/authorpics/authorpic_AaronForsythe.jpg)As director of **Magic** R&D, Aaron has put himself on every core set design team since ***Magic** 2010*. It was Aaron's vision that laid out the model that ***Magic** 2013* continues to follow, and he's a guiding light for simple, clean, top-down designs that resonate with fantasy flavor. As this was my first design lead, I was thrilled to be able to have Aaron's experience and oversight on the team. Aaron has a soft spot for core set design, as I do, and the set owes much to his insight.

**Graeme Hopkins**

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/mtgcom/authorpics/authorpic_graemehopkins.jpg)I worked with Great Designer Graeme Hopkins before on the *Zendikar* design team and was excited to get him on my team for M13, on loan from the digital games group. Graeme has a powerful eye for simple lines of rules text that deliver a flavorful story, which is, in a word, hard. Again and again Graeme wowed me with his ability to create not just cool **Magic** cards, but whole assemblies of cards that helped define the shape of the core set.

**Ryan Miller**

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/mtgcom/authorpics/authorpic_ryanmiller.jpg)Ryan Miller has been busy lately as lead designer of the new [Kaijudo](http://www.kaijudo.com/) TCG, but he also contributes to making awesome **Magic** sets. Ryan's superpower is the ability to distinguish cards and mechanics that generate fun games from cards and mechanics that "read interestingly" (but play miserably). Ryan's instincts helped steer us away from dead ends of design that would have taken weeks of playtesting to sniff out, as well as contributing many cool cards to the set.

**Mark Purvis**

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/mtgcom/authorpics/authorpic_markpurvis.jpg)**Magic** brand manager Mark Purvis is the archetypal longtime player and has great insight into the mind of the collector and kitchen-table gamer. He's also one of my oldest friends, as we've been friends since middle school (which was a long time ago, so let's not get into specific numbers—look, the number of decades that we've known each other is greater than one, okay?). Mark is the person who introduced me to **Magic** back in the 1900s, long before either one of us worked at Wizards, so it was frankly surreal to be on this team, making our living making a **Magic** set together. Mark contributed excellent card designs and fought for the set's overall appeal to longtime, invested **Magic** players.

**Doug Beyer (lead)**

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/mtgcom/authorpics/authorpic_dougbeyer.jpg)I'm the guy who gets to stand up here and leech the accolades from my team's hard work. Also I like flavor a lot. My claim to fame here is really a combination of experience on past core set design teams, a constant craving for straightforward but flavorful cards, and an investment in the way we've built core sets since ***Magic** 2010*. I believe that strong fantasy flavor isn't just fun—it helps you learn and understand the cards. Dragons that feel like dragons and Elves that do what elves do—that gets you out of rules-brain mode and into having-fun-with-smashing-armies-into-each-other mode. After design wrapped for ***Magic** 2012*, Aaron said, "You could do this. You could lead M13 if you wanted to." So that was that.

So what did we actually design? What's going to be waiting for you in ***Magic** 2013*?

### Themes and Features of *Magic 2013*

These days, **Magic** core sets have a few features in common. They include a significant proportion of new cards, they deliver essential **Magic** game play that's accessible to newer players, and they connect with the flavor expectations of a broad audience by taking advantage of familiar fantasy tropes and simple, clean, top-down designs.

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/features/feature201a_06hkrj8o39.jpg)Odric, Master Tactician | Art by [Michael Komarck](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&artist=+%5B%22Michael+Komarck%22%5D)

(If you want to read more about this philosophy of core sets, I've done a lot of blabbing about it in Savor the Flavor. I wrote about serving as the creative rep on the design team for [M11](http://www.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/stf/103) and told tales of building [M12](http://www.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/stf/152). I've chatted about why I'm so fond of the [Planeswalkers' signature spells](http://www.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/stf/99) and about the tiny victories of flavor that make up the rank and file of your [average core set](http://www.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/stf/149).)

Beyond that basic core set philosophy, every core set finds its own niche. We vary things up. This year, we really focused on the characters who come alive in **Magic**.

**M13's Legends**

M13 sports a cycle of five rare legendary creatures. Each one is a unique character from somewhere in **Magic**'s Multiverse—they are from Innistrad, Shandalar, Alara, and Ravnica.

Legendary creatures haven't been in the core set since before ***Magic** 2010*, in part because they have a bit of rules complexity to them, but also because we want the Planeswalkers to shine as the stars of the game. But this year we wanted to go a little deeper into **Magic**'s roster and showcase more of the faces of the Multiverse. This let us do something really cool: create "sub-bosses" for **Duels of the Planeswalkers** 2013.

In **Duels** 2013 (Which has released! It's packed with ***Magic** 2013* cards! It's incredibly fun! [Go get it](http://www.wizards.com/Magic/Digital/DuelsOfThePlaneswalkers.aspx)!), you'll meet these five legends as opponents in the game, and as impediments to your ultimate goal. They represent some of the non-Planeswalker characters that you, the Planeswalker, run afoul of as you travel throughout the Multiverse. Furthermore, these five legends have mechanical themes that lend themselves to building around. They're cool on their own, but they also point the way toward putting together a deck around them. There's also a cycle of supporting cards at lower rarities themed to those legends and designed to work well with them mechanically. That way, each legend has its own feel, its own way of expressing the power of its own color, and its own mechanical theme that is present both in the deck it wields in **Duels** 2013 and the Intro Deck that features it in ***Magic** 2013*.

Odric, a white-aligned monster-slaying cathar official from Innistrad, likes attacking with a big army, so he's best in a strategy that swarms the board with creatures. Talrand, a blue-aligned merfolk summoner from Shandalar, keys off of the power of instants and sorceries, so he creates an advantage in a base-blue deck that runs fewer creatures and more one-for-one spells. Nefarox is an infamous black-aligned demon lord from Grixis on Alara, and his exalted mechanic points him toward a black-white creature deck with exalted creatures throughout the curve. Krenko is a red-aligned goblin mob boss from Ravnica and works best when recruiting hordes and hordes of goblin dimwits. Finally, Yeva is a green-aligned elf shaman from Ravnica, and she gives flash to green creatures, allowing for a tricky deck of creatures with enters-the-battlefield abilities that foul up her opponents' plans.

These five legends do a lot of work in the design of the set. They tie **Duels** 2013 and ***Magic** 2013* together by appearing as focal characters in both games. They help new players (or players who haven't played in a while—welcome back!) build decks by serving as cool, attention-getting tent-poles that suggest mechanical links to other cards. They even highlight mechanical recipes in **Magic** through their flavor links to other cards in the set, giving players a path toward building decks of their own.

**Exalted**

All core sets have the usual "evergreen" mechanics common to all **Magic** sets: flying, first strike, trample—the usual. On top of that, core sets lately have chosen to return a flavorful mechanic from the past, and ***Magic** 2013* is no different. We chose to bring back exalted, the Bant mechanic from *Shards of Alara* block, because it played well, was fun to build around, and lent itself to cool and flavorful cards. Exalted was centered in the Bant colors of white, blue, and green originally, but we chose to center the mechanic in white and black in M13. Black is a new color for exalted, but we felt that beyond white and its allies, black is the color with the most flavor of exalting higher powers. While white honors its paladins and angels with acolytes and squires, black pays loyalty to its demonic lords with cultists and dark priests. 

You'll even find a powerful exalted land, Cathedral of War. The Cathedral is a great place to go lend your exaltation—and give another +1/+1—to your favorite attacking creature.

**Remember the New**

Our goal was to fill the set with new stuff that nevertheless felt like classic **Magic** cards. The core set should be a homecoming, a return to the pleasing home base. Again and again we relied on flavor to make the set feel like something you remember while actually being all-new.

Instead of the [Angel's Feather](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Angel%27s+Feather) artifact cycle from many, many past core sets, ***Magic** 2013* instead sports a cycle of magic rings. Each ring is a piece of Equipment that works best when worn by a creature of a given color. They're fun and can be powerful, especially in decks that have a heavy concentration of creatures in one color. We had been trying to find designs for a cycle of artifact rings since M11 and I think we finally nailed it.

There are two new Planeswalker cards in ***Magic** 2013*. After Sorin and Gideon shook things up in M12, Liliana and Ajani come raging back to the core lineup with two new designs in M13. Ajani, Caller of the Pride, rings up at a sleek three mana and shows off his specialty of supporting and enhancing his allies. Liliana of the Dark Realms focuses on Lily's connection to her mana bonds, specifically calling out the power of necromantic [Swamp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swamp)s. Those two join the Jace, Chandra, and Garruk from ***Magic** 2012* to round out the core five Planeswalkers.

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/features/feature201a_7qxuvynqyh.jpg)  
Then there's the army of one-off designs that are meant to evoke flavorful connections to classic fantasy and fun game play. I'm proud of my team's efforts to engineer so many little cardboard soldiers of Vorthos that they could fuel many, many flavor articles.

**Thoughtful Reprints**

Like every core set, there are plenty of goodies beyond just those major themes and new cards. ***Magic** 2013* also has a host of spicy reprints from **Magic**'s past. If you've never enchanted a [Vampire Nighthawk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vampire+Nighthawk) with [Rancor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rancor), let me tell you: first, that it's fun, and second, that you can do it all within a game of ***Magic** 2013* sealed deck. 

An underappreciated skill in **Magic** design is selecting reprints from **Magic**'s past to cohere both flavorfully and mechanically with their newly designed brethren. I think we chose a fleet of reprints that feel different from past core sets, yet make sense as a first experience for a new player and a homecoming experience for a returning player.

There are plenty more reprints to be revealed in the coming weeks, and I don't want to spoil them all—by which I mean I really want to spoil them all but I want even more for you to see them in booster packs at the [Prerelease](http://www.wizards.com/Magic/TCG/Events.aspx?x=mtgcom/events/Prerelease-facts).

Oh, and speaking of reprints:

No Titans

Yeah. It was time.

But there's one more big, shadowy, larger-than-life feature of ***Magic** 2013* that I want to touch on.

### The Sixth Planeswalker

I've already mentioned that ***Magic** 2013* returns to the core lineup of Ajani, Jace, Liliana, Chandra, and Garruk. But I wanted another face to show up in the core set, an old face that could serve as a reminder that the good guys don't always take all the spotlight.

This particular character was controversial, not only because he would mean adding a sixth Planeswalker to ***Magic** 2013*, but also because he would be the first multicolor ("gold") card to ever appear in a core set. That breaks our rules—we think of gold as a theme that drives three-set blocks and allows **Magic** to go in more complicated directions, rather than a go-to theme of the core set. But I felt like if anybody is going to break all the rules, it's this guy:

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/tcg/products/m13/udr42o6pdr_en.jpg)  
We brought the elder dragon Planeswalker Nicol Bolas to the core set for a few reasons. The pace of story in a trading card game can be slow compared to books or movies or TV shows. We basically get one new plot point every three months, as a new set comes out. Bolas hadn't appeared in person since *Alara* block, and I felt it was important that he show his face from time to time to remind the do-gooders who's still plying his schemes in the background. His presence in the core set sends a message—this guy is important and dangerous. The shadow of Lord Bolas looms large and ominous over M13. In fact, you can see Bolas's horns on the packaging of ***Magic** 2013* boxes.

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/features/feature201a_m13.jpg)  
One thing we haven't seen a lot of in **Magic** is Bolas's minions. We know he makes personal appearances around the Multiverse as needed, making demands of those who serve him and blithely devastating the minds of those who don't. We've even seen a couple of Planeswalkers who have come to work for Bolas's side in [Sarkhan the Mad](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sarkhan+the+Mad) and [Tezzeret, Agent of Bolas](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tezzeret%2C+Agent+of+Bolas). But we rarely get to see those humble henchcreatures who are doing his dirty work, taking their marching orders from the big dragon, implementing the minute, ground-level details of Bolas's master plan.

In ***Magic** 2013*, we do.

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/features/feature201a_6laon8phm5.jpg)Augur of Bolas | Art by [Slawomir Maniak](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&artist=+%5B%22Slawomir+Maniak%22%5D)

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/features/feature201a_ah5mpy0w3z.jpg)Mindclaw Shaman | Art by [Slawomir Maniak](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&artist=+%5B%22Slawomir+Maniak%22%5D)

In blue and red are two of Bolas's dirty-work-doers. Each in their own way, these creatures seek out magics for the millennia-old dragon, gathering ever more power for their draconic master. Both of these creatures help you work toward the long game, trading and digging for answers in the early going and building card advantage in the middle game. Augur of Bolas searches for knowledge in your library and Mindclaw Shaman reaches directly into your opponent's mind, in true Bolas-ian style. But Bolas's central color is black, and Bolas has a particularly powerful minion in that color.

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/tcg/products/m13/55hhijww7n_en.jpg)  
![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/features/feature201a_4kqzhmv9ci.jpg)Disciple of Bolas | Art by [Slawomir Maniak](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&artist=+%5B%22Slawomir+Maniak%22%5D)

Survival and power: two of Bolas's favorite things. This third and final minion also helps Lord Bolas build up magics while helping him survive long enough to win a controlling endgame. Disciple of Bolas can be particularly nasty when you already have [Nicol Bolas, Planeswalker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nicol+Bolas%2C+Planeswalker) on the battlefield, as you can steal one of your opponent's creatures with Bolas's ability, cast Disciple of Bolas once you have your new minion, and then fatally plunder the stolen creature's mind for its knowledge.

Finally, there's one more card themed to this dark dragon:

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/tcg/products/m13/0vavuv5epa_en.jpg)  
![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/features/feature201a_s6zqiu56by.jpg)Gem of Becoming | Art by [Jack Wang](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&artist=+%5B%22FIRST+LAST%22%5D)

If there's anything else that Nicol Bolas requires, it's mana. The Gem of Becoming is one of Bolas's mana artifacts that help him manage his countless mana bonds. The name calls back to the [Pools of Becoming](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pools+of+Becoming), a location on his personal Meditation Plane (a location we've seen before in *Planechase*).

![Pools of Becoming](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Pools+of+Becoming)  
Gather these Gems of Becoming to help you fix your draconic tri-colored mana dilemma—again, it's all about survival and power for Bolas. If you live the longest, learn the most magic, and forge the most mana bonds, you will become invincible.

### Get Thee to a Prerelease

I am beyond excited for you to see and play ***Magic** 2013*—as proud a papa as there has ever been. If you've been plugged into Standard and *Innistrad* Block, it's a great time to cleanse your palate and smash some good old Elves and Goblins and Drakes and Dragons into each other. If you're new to the game or you've been away for awhile, it's a fantastic time to get into **Magic** as we refocus on the basic fun and core strengths of the game. 

**Magic** is building its nest of warm ashes, to be reborn after exploding in a spectacle of heat and light. It's preparing to return to its youth, to welcome back the halcyon days of fantastic armies summoned by planeswalking mages for the purpose of killing each other. I hope you're able to get to a Prerelease, bust some packs, and get to gaming.
