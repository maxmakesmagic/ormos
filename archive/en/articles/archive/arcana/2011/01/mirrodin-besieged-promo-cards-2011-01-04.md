Let's talk for a moment about the *Mirrodin Besieged* Prerelease, which will be on January 29-30. First, we'd like to remind you that you'll choose a side and, based on your faction, will receive either Mirran or Phyrexian boosters. There's [more information here](/en/articles/archive/faction-packs-2010-10-12), but here's the picture of the boosters again.

And here is some new news: your choice of faction will also determine your prerelease card! If you side with Mirrodin, you'll get Hero of Bladehold, and if you align yourself with Phyrexia, you'll take home Glissa, the Traitor. This is subject to availability, of course.

While we're on the subject, we might as well show off the card that will be given out at the *Mirrodin Besieged* Launch Parties on February 4. Behold Thopter Assembly!
