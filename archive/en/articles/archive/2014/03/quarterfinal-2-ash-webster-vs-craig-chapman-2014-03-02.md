Webster started things off by dropping a trio of Planeswalkers, who were demolished with [Hero's Downfall](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hero%27s+Downfall)s in short order. Luckily for Webster, His Xenagos's accompanying Satyrs were enough to put Chapman on the defensive, and Webster was able to follow up with a flurry of angry dudes to take the first game.

*Webster, R/G mage and nominee for 2014's 'Most Egregious Product Placement' award.* 
The second game was Chapman's turn to apply insurmountable pressure. His first [Brimaz, King of Oreskos](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brimaz%2C+King+of+Oreskos) bit the dust in short order, but he was able to keep the second around long enough - and steamroll Webster's defences with a few well-timed spells - to ride the powerful 3-drop to victory.

*Chapman won the second game so blisteringly fast, we had to go for an 'Action Sideboarding' shot. Note the still-exhilarated judge to one side.* 
Chapman spent the early game gaining a ridiculous amount of life off the combination of [Obzedat, Ghost Council](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Obzedat%2C+Ghost+Council) and [Whip of Erebos](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Whip+of+Erebos). Webster went about demolishing his opponent's life total the only way his deck could: by playing an insane amount of Planeswalkers and creatures, firing off a couple of ultimates, and clobbering the heck out of his opponent, invincible ghost collective or no.
