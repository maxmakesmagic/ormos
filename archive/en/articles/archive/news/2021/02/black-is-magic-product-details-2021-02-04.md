PRODUCT DESCRIPTION
-------------------


Black History Month celebrates Black history and honors the stories, culture, and achievements of Black people. The *Black Is Magic* drop celebrates and supports different expressions of Black identity.


Each card was illustrated by a Black artist who brought their unique art style to the drop. Ernanda Souza interprets Shalai, Voice of Plenty as a guardian angel who protects and shields the people. Ejiwa 'Edge' Ebenebe gives us a Ponder that honors elders and African spiritual tradition. Hillary Wilson illustrates Cultivate, a card that acknowledges the need for the past and present to reconcile for a healthier future. Dani Pendergast depicts a moment of calm for *Magic*'s first Black female Planeswalker, Kaya, Ghost Assassin, directly after the War of the Spark. KNIIO celebrates the joys of Black fatherhood by showing us a rare moment in the life of Teferi, Hero of Dominaria. Thomas Zenteno shows us a Sol Ring unlike any other, drawing inspiration from the beautiful jewelry tradition of the Maasai tribe. And finally, Julio Reyna honors the child in all of us with Path of Ancestry, reflecting on *Magic*'s Black history and its origins in Jamuraa.
