PRO TOUR HOUR OF DEVASTATION
============================

















Overview
--------


**Date:** July 28-30, 2017  
**Format:** Standard and *Hour of Devastation/Amonkhet* Booster Draft  
**Official Hashtag:**[#PTHOU](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23pthou&src=typd)


Pro Tour *Hour of Devastation* will take place at:


[Miyako Messe​](http://www.miyakomesse.jp/english/) Japan, 〒606-8343 Kyoto Prefecture  

Kyoto, 左京区岡崎成勝寺町9−1


The formats for this Pro Tour are *Hour of Devastation*/*Amonkhet* Booster Draft and Standard Constructed.


Two packs of *Hour of Devastation* and one pack of *Amonkhet* will be used for the Booster Draft portions of this event, in that order.


Decklists are required.


There is no airport directly within Kyoto. The closest airport to this Pro Tour is [Osaka Itami Airport](http://www.osaka-airport.co.jp/en/), which is often only accessible for domestic flights, followed by [Kansai International Airport](http://www.kansai-airport.or.jp/en/), a more common destination for international travelers. Both airports offer access to Kyoto by train, bus, and limousine taxi at varying prices between ¥1000 and ¥4000, depending on your choice of transportation and how quickly you'd like to get to Kyoto. Transportation by train or bus can be booked on the day you arrive, but we strongly recommend evaluating all options depending on how quickly you would like to arrive in Kyoto.
