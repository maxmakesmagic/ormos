![Goblin Patrol](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Goblin+Patrol)Anton is playing a fairly standard [Psychatog](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psychatog) and Jose is playing a Goblin deck, but with a few non-standard cards like [Goblin Patrol](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Patrol) and a blue splash as well. They are playing for the top eight### Game 1

Anton goes first and although the Spaniard casts a [Jackal Pup](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jackal+Pup) on his first turn, Anton was able to [Mana Leak](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak) a [Goblin Patrol](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Patrol). Jose did himself no favors whatsoever by casting another Patrol and then forgetting it's echo. Anton played a [Psychatog](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psychatog). All Jose could do was [Reckless Charge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reckless+Charge) a [Goblin Piledriver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Piledriver) to knock Anton down to nine. This seemed safe enough although the Piledriver is a pretty good blocker versus [Psychatog](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psychatog).

 The Swede then had an absolutely nuts turn when he cast two Accumulates in Jose's end step, drawing both of the other two Accumulates and attacking for Peon's entire life total.

Anton Jonsson 1 – Jose Peon 0

### Game 2

![Jackal Pup](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Jackal+Pup)Jose had to start the second game with a mulligan. He got a reasonable draw from the six cards, playing a [Mogg Fanatic](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mogg+Fanatic), and then giving it a [Reckless Charge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reckless+Charge) to attack for four. This was followed up by an [Ice](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ice) to slow Anton down, and a [Jackal Pup](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jackal+Pup), while the Swede still had nothing on the table.Anton Edicted away the Fanatic, and then [Duress](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress)ed. This revealed that Jose had a [Tangle Wire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tangle+Wire), an [Annul](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Annul) and a [Goblin Piledriver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Piledriver) in his hand. Jose summoned his Piledriver, and attacked with everything next turn. Once again this proved to be wrong, as Anton was able to deal exactly enough damage with the [Psychatog](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psychatog), via an [Intuition](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Intuition) for [Gush](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gush)

Anton Jonsson 2 – Jose Peon 0
