Helio chose to draw first. Quentin asked if there was a special reason for this and Hélio explained. They joked a little about it and started the game.

While Hélio began with a [Neurok Prodigy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Neurok+Prodigy) and a Hoverguard Seer, Quentin was stuck on two lands, and only managed to cast a [Leonin Bola](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leonin+Bola) and a [Fireball](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fireball) to kill the prodigy.  
 Hélio kept increasing the pressure with [Arcbound Bruiser](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arcbound+Bruiser), [Spikeshot Goblin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spikeshot+Goblin) and [Arcbound Stinger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arcbound+Stinger) while Quentin played a [Sword of Fire and Ice](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sword+of+Fire+and+Ice), an [Arcbound Bruiser](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arcbound+Bruiser) and a [Myr Enforcer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Myr+Enforcer). Already low on life, and with little mana available, Quentin couldn't do more than trade creatures in combat. A couple of attacks later Hélio was up one game.

Game 2 

Quentin chose to draw and Hélio mulliganed. Hélio didn't look too happy about the second hand, but kept it anyways.

Quentin started with a [Necrogen Spellbomb](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Necrogen+Spellbomb) and Hélio's attempt at playing a [Wizard Replica](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wizard+Replica) was annuled. While Quentin played [Vedalken Engineer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vedalken+Engineer) and [Gilded Lotus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gilded+Lotus), all Hélio could do with his three mana was play a [Viridian Longbow](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Viridian+Longbow). When the British player used a [Looming Hoverguard](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Looming+Hoverguard) to send the longbow back to the top of Hélio's deck, there was little Hélio could do get back in the game.

### Game 3

While the players shuffled they hoped that at least the third game wasn't decided due to mana issues.

Quentin: "Let's play a real game"

Helio chose to draw, and once again frowned at his hand but still chose to keep it. Quentin: "That's the fourth bad hand, you must have a pretty good lovelife"

Hélio started with Vulshok Morningstar and Vulshok Prodigy while Quentin dropped his [Sword of Fire and Ice](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sword+of+Fire+and+Ice) and "cycled" a [Necrogen Spellbomb](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Necrogen+Spellbomb). The Portuguese pondered a moment on whether he should equip the flyer, but chose to cast a [Spikeshot Goblin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spikeshot+Goblin) instead. Quentin played the [Gilded Lotus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gilded+Lotus) and passed the turn.

Once again Hélio thought on what to do and opted to equip the prodigy, attack with it and add a [Vulshok Battlegear](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vulshok+Battlegear) to his array of equipment. Quentin [Essence Drain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Essence+Drain)ed the spikey, commenting "better do it while I can", prompting a disheartened look from Hélio, then played a Krak Clan Grunt.

Hélio equipped the prodigy with the Battlegear, took Quentin's life down to ten, made a [Wizard Replica](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wizard+Replica) and equiped it with the Battlegear. With the game looking very much in the Portugese's favor, Quentin bucked the odds and turned the game around. He played a [Looming Hoverguard](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Looming+Hoverguard) - sending the wizard back to whence it came, equipped the grunt, attacked with it for six damage and drew a card for all his hard work. He finished the turn by giving the sword to the Hoverguard to make it a 5/5 flyer with protection from blue and red, able to keep the prodigy from attacking. 

Hélio simply replayed the Wizard and passed the turn.

On his turn Quentin cast a [Goblin Replica](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Replica), with it destroyed the wizard, sent all his team into the red zone and cast a Myr wich was immediately given the sword.

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gpmad04/r5fm2_2.jpg)Hélio strongly (and loudly) beat the top of his deck, drew an island and played it. Since this was his seventh land, Quentin asked, "[Grab the Reins](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grab+the+Reins)?" Hélio's smiled slyly, "Better". The Portuguese sent the prodigy into attacking mode, tapped all his lands and played [Savage Beating](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Savage+Beating) with entwine, taking the game from Quentin.

An astonished public could only respond by confirming, "that *was* a [Savage Beating](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Savage+Beating)!"

Quentin explained that he got a little greedy when he drew the [Goblin Replica](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Replica), and that there was no need to risk so much.
