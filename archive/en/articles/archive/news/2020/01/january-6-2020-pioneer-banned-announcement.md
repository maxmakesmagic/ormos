Ian Duke is a developer in Magic R&D and has been with Wizards of the Coast since 2012. A gift of an Ice Age starter deck in 1995 sparked Ian's lifelong passion for Magic. He also enjoys math, physics, board games, and puzzles. To the surprise of few, his favorite guild is Azorius. 






**Announcement Date**: January 6, 2020


**Pioneer**:


No changes


The list of all banned cards in Pioneer is [here](https://magic.wizards.com/en/game-info/gameplay/formats/pioneer).


**Next Pioneer Banned Announcement**: January 13, 2020


This is our last standalone Pioneer banning announcement. Starting next week, any changes to Pioneer will be part of our normal B&R announcement with all other formats and will not take place every week. Thank you to everyone who has been playing the format and helping to shape it into what it is today, and we're excited to see where the format goes from here!
