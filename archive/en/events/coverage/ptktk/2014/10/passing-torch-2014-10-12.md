 Timothy knows exactly what he likes most about *Magic*.




 "I like to play red because it plays with fire," he explains matter-of-factly as he shuffles his cards before sitting down across from his opponent at Pro Tour *Khans of Tarkir*.



If the number of Jeskai decks is any indication, it's a sentiment shared by many here in Honolulu. One version even made it to the finals of the Pro Tour in the hands of eighth-ranked Shaun McLaren.


Except there are a few things different about Timothy. For starters, Timothy is 11 years old. And he's at the Pro Tour on a field trip, watching a giant screen in the event's public hall as the United States' Ari Lax makes his Pro Tour Top 8 debut against Japan's Yuuya Watanabe, a living legend since his debut on the Pro Tour.



 Timothy hadn't heard of *Magic* until a few months ago, but the confident and outspoken sixth grader is now one of the game's many avid young fans.



All thanks to Sean Pottenger.


...



 Pottenger was born and raised in Hawaii. He picked up his first *Magic* card when he was Timothy's age, and he began playing Friday Night *Magic* soon after. Before long he was looking toward Grand Prix and dipping his toes into the competitive side of the game.



He loved it. The strategy, the depth, the rush of needing a particular card and finding it; it all appealed to Pottenger.


And he was committed. So committed that 10 years ago when he wanted to buy a plane ticket to fly to San Diego for the Junior Super Series—a tournament series that awarded scholarships to players under 18 and an event that he wasn't even qualified for—he lobbied his parents to let him do so on his own dime. To their credit, his parents trusted their son to fly across the Pacific for a card game they didn't understand, and that was the start of a whirlwind tour for Pottenger. He won a last-chance qualifier for the Junior Super Series, and a few years later he took the next step and qualified for his first Pro Tour.
