### Ode to Eivind Nitter


There was a guy named Eivind Nitter  

And Eivind Nitter was not a quitter  

He hailed from the Norwegian countryside  

And when he was born, he probably cried


This Eivind he was a Magic player  

He was a real creature slayer  

He always had a lethal deck  

With all the latest, important tech


One day Eivind travelled away  

All the way to Sweden to play  

He wanted so badly to make the top eight  

And making top eight, yeah, that was his fate


He started by going all the way  

To a 7-0 record the very first day  

Then he drafted and played so great  

He just needed one more win to make the top eight


He lost to Shvartsman in round eleven  

Still one step away from heaven  

Then he finally got his win  

And Eivind took his win with a grin


Who knows what will happen next?  

You won't find the answer in this text  

But look to the coverage when it is up  

Maybe you'll find Eivind on the top...
