On Wednesday, Hall of Fame elect Paulo Vitor Damo da Rosa joined us on CoverItLive to participate in an interview where viewers at home asked all the questions. Below, you can find the transcript of that interview.


**Jon Hickey:**   

Go ahead and submit your questions to Paulo Vitor Damo da Rosa,, and we'll push through a few for him to answer.


**Comment From CMDoyle:**  

Who did you work on your Modern deck with?


**Paulo Vitor Damo da Rosa:**   

I playtested with David Ochoa, Luis Scott-Vargas, and Josh Utter-Leyton.


**Comment From taddat:**  

This may be repetitive, but I'd love to know which guild is Paulo Vitor Damo da Rosa's favorite.


**Paulo Vitor Damo da Rosa:**   

Izzet is by far the one I like the most. The next is Azorius I guess.


**Comment From redge:**  

@Paulo Vitor Damo da Rosa: Who is your favorite person to play ****Magic**: The Gathering** with?


**Paulo Vitor Damo da Rosa:**   

I like playing with Luis Scott-Vargas the most, I guess. We understand each other and we know we can be honest with each other. I also like working with Owen Turtenwald a lot because I feel that we think similarly on a lot of things.


**Comment From Faith:**  

Paulo Vitor Damo da Rosa, do you like playing in the tournaments against the friends you playtested with, or is it less fun when you know what they have?


**Paulo Vitor Damo da Rosa:**   

It's a lot less fun, because most of the time we're playing the same deck and mirror matches are not  

interesting at all for me. I'd much rather play against someone with a different deck.


**Comment From Senortangerino89:**  

What's your favorite card all time and why?


**Comment From Tom Martell:**  

What is your favorite cube archetype Paulo Vitor Damo da Rosa?


**Paulo Vitor Damo da Rosa:**   

It's changed from time to time, but I really like Vendilion Clique. It's very solid, very powerful, gives  

you information, lots of choices, goes in a lot of decks and sideboards, but at the same time is not a  

broken card.


**Paulo Vitor Damo da Rosa:**   

My favorite cube archetype is probably the ramp decks. Blue-green is the color combination I draft most of the time.


**Paulo Vitor Damo da Rosa:**   

Though I usually have splashes. :P


**Comment From Steven:**  

Paulo Vitor Damo da Rosa, what was your first thought upon hearing you'd been voted into the Hall of Fame?


**Paulo Vitor Damo da Rosa:**   

Relief, I guess? I thought I was going to make it, but it was great to know for a fact that I had.


**Comment From Faith:**  

What card in *****Magic***** *2013* do you think is currently overlooked and has the potential to be a powerhouse in thenew standard?


**Comment From GV:**  

@Paulo Vitor Damo da Rosa: what are your predictions for Top 4?


**Paulo Vitor Damo da Rosa:**   

I'm going to predict Shouta Yasooka since he was one of the possible names I had to begin with and he's 2-0 now.


**Paulo Vitor Damo da Rosa:**   
**M13**  draft: I feel like it's the one I know best compared to the other people, though Cube is also very  

enjoyable.


**Comment From Leah:**  

@Paulo Vitor Damo da Rosa: Please do a powerful comeback and make it to the Top 4. Latin America needs you.


**Paulo Vitor Damo da Rosa:**   

Heh. I'll do my best.


**Comment From Ron:**  

Paulo Vitor Damo da Rosa: Who's better for you, Master Finkel or Kai, The German Juggernaut?


**Paulo Vitor Damo da Rosa:**   

Right now, I think Finkel is better, because he's a lot more active than Kai (and also because he's  

standing right behind me).


**Paulo Vitor Damo da Rosa:**   

I have no idea who is the best lifetime though.


**Comment From Stinson:**  

Paulo Vitor Damo da Rosa: you're one of the greatest, you still can make it. We are all cheering for you at my house.


**Paulo Vitor Damo da Rosa:**   

I'm off now. Thanks everyone. See you!
