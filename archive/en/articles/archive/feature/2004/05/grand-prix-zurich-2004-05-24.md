**HOW TO REACH**  
  

Travel Information  
  

The combination of all metropolitan comforts meet the short distances of a small town: the MCH Zurich Exhibition Ltd. is most conveniently situated. Right there in the heart of Switzerland, where all ways lead together. The intercontinental airport Zurich-Kloten presents itself as the direct connection to 72 countries world-wide.  



**By Plane**  

When you are arriving by plane, airport Zurich-Kloten is no more than 10 minutes away from MCH Zurich by train. You also have the option of taking a taxi.


**Arrival by Public Transport**   

The Swiss Federal Railways (SBB, [www.sbb.ch](http://www.sbb.ch)) has hourly service from the Zurich train station to all cities in Switzerland. The S-Bahn (S2, S5, S6, S7, S8, S14), the commuter train system in the extensive Zurich public transport network, runs 10 lines an hour to the city and the lake from Oerlikon, with connections every fifteen to thirty minutes to points throughout the metropolitan area. The Oerlikon train station is easily reached from the fairgrounds by public transport or on foot. Buses (45, 63, 94) and trams (10, 11, 14) travel from many parts of the city to Oerlikon, some even going directly to the fairgrounds.


**Arrival by Car**  

A maximum drive of 10 minutes (about 5-7 km) from the highway exits Affoltern, Opfikon, Seebach, Zurich-Hardturm and Zurich-Schwamendingen to the fair parking garage on Hagenholzstrasse.


**Arrival by Car**  

Even bicyclists and motorcyclists will find plenty of lockable parking places right next to the fair buildings.  

Look for the following symbol which indicates the direction to Messe Zurich both on the highway and in the city.
