The Daily *Magic* Update is a roundup of everything *Magic* you should know on October 24, 2017. Today's Update is brought to you by *Duel Decks:* [*Goblins*](https://twitter.com/blakepr/status/922842530688856065) *vs.* [*Merfolk*](https://twitter.com/blakepr/status/922842670795333632).


Today's Must
============


1. [LRRMtG — *Ixalan* Standard Scuffle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUG7vaw2aSg) | LoadingReadyRun

Four tribes, four players, 3 hours of gameplay featuring Pirates, Dinosaurs, Vampires, and Merfolk (oh my?) from the crew at LRR. Whether you missed the stream, just want to get ideas for your next FNM, or really want to see Merfolk vs. Dinosaurs, it's worth checking out.

After That, Read, Watch, or Listen to These
===========================================


1. [The Modern Banned List Through a Former Developer's Eyes](http://www.starcitygames.com/article/36058_The-Modern-Banned-List-Through-A-Former-Developers-Eyes.html) | StarCityGames.com | Peter Ingram

Ingram used to work in R&D, so this might give you some insight into what someone like Ingram (in this case, Ingram himself) thinks when he looks at the Modern banned list.


1. [Flashback to *Innistrad*](http://manadeprived.com/men-modo-40-flashback-innistrad/) | Men from MODO | Tomi Tuovinen and Travis Sowers

*Magic Online* is heading back to the original *Innistrad* for some drafts this week in what might be the most celebrated Limited format of all time. Get a refresher course ([Travel Preparations](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Travel+Preparations)) from the Men from MODO ([Butcher's Cleaver](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Butcher%27s+Cleaver) plus [Invisible Stalker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Invisible+Stalker)) as they walk you through the finer points ([Spider Spawning](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spider+Spawning)) of the spookiest of Draft formats.


1. [You Don't See That Everyday](http://puremtgo.com/articles/you-dont-see-everyday) | PureMTGO | David Wright

You know what else you don't see every day? Pauper content. The Daily Update hasn't visited the world of Pauper in a while (we meant to call, but you know how it is), but Wright has some new technology (and some new old technology) he's found in online Pauper results. I can't pass that up.


1. [Drafting *Ixalan* with Pros #3](http://www.hareruyamtg.com/article/en/category/detail/199) | Hareruya English | Jeremy Dezani

Martin Müller, Oliver Polak-Rottman, Márcio Carvalho, and Shuhei Nakamura—four of the best players in the world—disagree over a bunch of *Ixalan* Draft picks. Drafting is hard, yo.


Today's Weird Non-*Magic* *Magic* Video
=======================================


1. [*Magic: The Gathering* Is the Greatest Game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oEc-rmQbIyE) | Do Stuff

Am I recommending this video? Honestly, I have no idea. It's a YouTube channel by two women who live in South Korea and, well, do stuff. This video mostly features their friend Brian (I think?) rediscovering *Magic*. It's weird and kind of funny at times and—well—mostly I just had to make sure other people knew this video existed.

We've also got another team revealed! Team Face to Face Games is full of Hall of Fame pros, complete ringers, a rising star, and one top chef (he's also pretty good at *Magic*).


Deck of the Day
===============


1. [Standard Mono-Black Aggro](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/mtgo-standings/standard-mocs-2017-10-22-0)

Look, I'm as confused as you are, but it turns out there might be a viable mono-black aggro deck in the format. Just ask *Magic Online* player Isolating, who went 7-1 in this past weekend's Standard *Magic Online* Championship Series tournament.


That record in this tournament is an indication that Isolating is on to something. Black has been getting some very aggressive creatures lately, and it looks like they might finally add up to something. [Night Market Lookout](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Night+Market+Lookout), [Dread Wanderer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dread+Wanderer), and [Vicious Conquistador](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vicious+Conquistador) all hit for "2" as one-drops—that's more hard-hitting one-drops than red has—and [Night Market Lookout](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Night+Market+Lookout) can even keep pinging away by helping to crew some Vehicles.


[Supernatural Stamina](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Supernatural+Stamina) is the real oddball, acting as extra damage, a way to save your creatures, and a combat trick, all in one.


Finally, tying it all together is the latest [Dark Confidant](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dark+Confidant) variant, [Ruin Raider](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ruin+Raider). I'm a little surprised not to see [Glint-Sleeve Siphoner](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glint-Sleeve+Siphoner) in here, but I suppose with no other energy production, it becomes a bit unreliable as a source of cards. Meanwhile, [Ruin Raider](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ruin+Raider) would probably have a difficult time *not* drawing extra cards in a deck like this.
