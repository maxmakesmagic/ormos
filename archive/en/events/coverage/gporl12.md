It's a Brewer's World at Grand Prix Orlando
===========================================

Grand Prix Orlando 2012
-----------------------


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/gporl12/Conley%20Trophy%20shot.JPG)Conley Woods is the Grand Prix Orlando Champion!


[Delver of Secrets](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Delver+of+Secrets) , [Invisible Stalker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Invisible+Stalker) s and [Runechanter's Pike](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Runechanter%27s+Pike) s were everywhere this weekend, but in the end it was Conley Woods and Patrick Chapin, two rogue deck designers and fan favorites who faced off in the finals with decks no one else had, with Woods taking home his first Grand Prix trophy.


And as the format gets ready to welcome *Dark Ascension*, Chapin and Woods have shown that the format remains wide-open for innovation and rogue deck designs in the hands of capable players. Aspiring deck builders would do well to pay close attention to their lists and methods as a new set dawns.


The weekend will also be remembered for the first time rising star Ben Friedman cracked a Grand Prix Top 8 and for yet another dominant performance by Team Channelfireball, which put three players in the Top 8 and another two in the Top 16.


But in the end it was Conley Woods who won the weekend with his innovative Black/Green Ramp deck proving that rogue can definitely be the way to go.
