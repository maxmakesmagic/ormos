In the [Selecting *Ninth Edition* Wrap-up article](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/selecting9e/wrapup) you saw the final art for [Dancing Scimitar](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dancing+Scimitar) and [Mahamoti Djinn](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mahamoti+Djinn). As you can see, they turned out terrific; if you voted on the Selecting *Ninth Edition* sketches over the last few months, they just prove how good an art director you were.
