Two teams with designs on Sunday glory crossed paths at 3-1. The winning team would likely secure a Day Two appearance.



**Team Chinese Taipei**



A Seat: Huang Hao-Shan


B Seat: Tzu Ching Kuo


C Seat: Lin Drizzt


"Coach": Jian Sheng Xiu



 En route to their victory at the first World *Magic* Cup in 2012, Team Chinese Taipei gave us one of pro *Magic*'s iconic moments: [the Bonfire Topdeck](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fEJoXJj-vg&feature=youtu.be&t=18s). Captain Tzu Ching Kuo is back in command this year, alongside APAC Grand Prix juggernaut Huang Hao-Shan, for whom the fifth Top 8 was the charm. He finally grabbed gold on home soil earlier this year. Their sights are set squarely on a Top 8 berth.




**Team Czech Republic**



A Seat: Josef Vlach


B Seat: Stanislav Cifka


C Seat: Nikola Vavra


"Coach": Tomas Kuchta


It's hard to go wrong with a Pro Tour Champion in the captain's seat, and it's his third time in command. Last year they reached the Top 4. Can they improve on it this time around? Between GP Champion Nikola Vavra and solid, if unseasoned, players Josef Vlach and Tomas Kuchta they have the makings of a deep Saturday run.




*Both Chinese Taipei and the Czech Republic have seen play on the World *Magic* Cup Sunday stage. However, while Chinese Taipei was looking for a second set of trophies, the Czech Republic was still chasing down their first victory.*
