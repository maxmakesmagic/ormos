Earlier this week, [we showed you the promos](/node/322071) that serve as the faces of Intro Packs, but every set has a number of promos beyond those five. And, as a bonus, several of these are cards you haven't seen yet! Which ones? Read on!


Launch
======


If you play in any Launch event February 23–25—including FNM, and on top of any other promos you might receive—you might just find your defenses bolstered by a certain Mastodon.

Game Day
========


The weekend of February 14–15, 2015, stores all around the world will be holding *Fate Reforged* Game Day. Just for participating, you can receive this full-art Mardu Shadowspear, a powerful one-drop that we're also showing off for the first time here.

And if you defeat all comers in the name of your clan? Then the Top 8 will give you an opportunity to secretly supplant your opponents, a card shown off today in [The Week That Was](/node/321771).

In addition, the winner of *Fate Reforged* Game Day will receive an exclusive playmat.

Buy-a-Box
=========


Finally, stores will be able to provide a small number of the Buy-a-Box promo, Shamanic Revelation. The distribution is up to them, so ask your local store if you want to get your hands on a draw spell on steroids. Because why wouldn't you? Just look at this thing!
