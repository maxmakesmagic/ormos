This week's "Sketches" looks at the biggest Beast in *Onslaught*, [Krosan Colossus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Krosan+Colossus) by Kev Walker.

### 1. Art Description

These are the instructions given to the artist:

"Location: Krosan Forest  
 Action: giant bipedal Beast towering over the Krosan forest. It uses its bonespur claws to scoop up a handful of the forest to munch on."

### 2. Sketch

This is the preliminary sketch submitted by Kev. The *Onslaught* team noted that the birds in the art would need to be bigger--not to make the Beast look smaller by comparison, but so that they would be visible once the art was shrunk to card size.

### 3. Final Art

Here is a large version of the final piece.

### 4. Card

Finally, here is the card as it appears in the set.
