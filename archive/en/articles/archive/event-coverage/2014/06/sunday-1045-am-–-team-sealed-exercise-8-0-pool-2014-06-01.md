Below you'll find the card pool handed to the trio of Lucas Esper Berthoud, Paulo Ricardo Cortez, and Walter Perez on Saturday. Little did they know that the builds they decided on for their three decks would help carry them to the top of the standings on Day 1. Now it's your turn. Take a look at the raw materials and see if you can find the undefeated decks hidden inside. We'll give you our heroes's solution later in the day.
