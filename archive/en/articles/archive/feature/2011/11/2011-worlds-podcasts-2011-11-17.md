* [**Thursday, 11:15 a.m.: From the Beginning**](http://webcast2.wizards.com/podcasts/11sanfrancisco/worlds_1.mp3) (15.1 MB)
 It's early morning here in San Francisco, and the excitement is mounting as Worlds is less than an hour away. We tour the event floor interviewing left, right, and center, as the clock ticks down to six rounds of Standard. Want to hear what it's really like? Listen in, with dozens of players from around the world talking about their hopes for the days ahead, including National Champions, Pro Tour winners, Player of the Year contenders, Hall of Famers old and new...there's something for everyone as Worlds gets under way.


* [**Thursday, 7:33 p.m.: Team Night in Canada**](http://webcast2.wizards.com/podcasts/11sanfrancisco/worlds_2.mp3) (15.6 MB)
 After six rounds of Standard, the day is over for individuals in the main event. For the National Team members, however, there's still two rounds to go, and this time there's the addition of Modern and Legacy into the Constructed mix. With Tim Willoughby bringing you text coverage of the early two leaders -- Netherlands and Chinese Taipei -- I'll be watching the current occupants of the third and fourth spots in the standings. It's Dan Lanthier for Canada in the Legacy against Dimitry Olenin of the Russian Federation. In Modern, Noah Long took on Simen Korzunov, while Standard saw Marc Anderson facing Nikolay Zlobnov. Three formats, two teams, one winner. Teams at Worlds.


* [**Friday, 6:04 p.m.: Draft Under the Lights**](http://webcast2.wizards.com/podcasts/11sanfrancisco/worlds_3.mp3) (14.8 MB)
 In our as-it-happens round up from the feature match area, Paulo Vitor Damo da Rosa of Brazil takes on Gerry Thompson, both at 8-2. Also at 8-2 are rivals and new-found friends Matthias Hunt and Fabian Thiele. Both of them are in the running for the Rookie of the Year title, and both were desperate to play each other. Now they have their chance. Finally, we see the Innovator Patrick Chapin in a blazing set against 2006 Player of the Year Shouta Yasooka. Blistering Magic, from some of the best in the world 


* [**Saturday, 11:58 p.m.: The Round That Means the Most**](http://webcast2.wizards.com/podcasts/11sanfrancisco/worlds_4.mp3) (18.4 MB)
The final round of team play is a critical one. With nine points for the team victory, that's an 18-point swing on the line. Six rounds of Modern follow, and even a succession of 2-1s for your three team members make it very hard to claw back that lost ground. When the dust settles after this final team round, it becomes virtually impossible for a team further down the standings to make a run at the final two for Sunday action. That makes this clash between Switzerland and the United States a huge match. See Ali Aintrazi, Haibing Hu, and David Ochoa face off againt Dario Vicedomini, Matthias Künzler, and Matteo Rusconi. Modern, Legacy, Standard, as it happens.


* [**Saturday, 6:45 p.m.: Best. Fun. Ever.**](http://webcast2.wizards.com/podcasts/11sanfrancisco/worlds_5.mp3) (14.2 MB)
The penultimate round of the Swiss. Top 8 on the line everywhere you look. No more hiding places. No more hard-luck stories. Just one on one with everything at stake. Emerging storylines everywhere - Conley Woods dominant. ChannelFireball looking to blow away the competition. Canada looking for a Top 8 through David Caplan. Richard Bland of England, hasn't lost since Thursday. Paulo needing a point to be sure. There is nothing better than the feature match area with a round to go, and we're right at the heart of the action. Join us.
