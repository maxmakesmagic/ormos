Day One had been something of a dream run for Rich Hoaen, an old-school player that earned a Pro Tour Top 8 appearance in 2003 and has been back around the scene recently. That run culminated in a perfect 8-0 start on the first day of Pro Tour *Magic Origins,* and he has set his sights firmly on the Top 8.


Widely regarded as a Limited master in his time, Hoaen had spent the weekend joking about how he didn't know what some of the cards in *Magic*'s newest set did, and he didn't remember their names. But while he may have passed himself off as disconnected, his results from Friday spoke loudly, with a perfect draft followed by an undefeated run in Standard.


Day Two, however, was off to a slower start. A difficult draft and a pair of losses put Hoaen's back up against the wall as he sat down for Round 11 against twentieth-ranked Mike Sigrist, one of the hottest players of the past year. The American entered the weekend in range to make a run of the Player of the Year title, and a win in Round 11 would move him to 9-2 and well on his way to that goal.

The Games
=========


A loaded draft pod meant that powerful decks were harder than ever to come by, and both Hoaen and Sigrist had solid-if-unspectacular decks, with Sigrist playing green-white while Hoaen was battling with black-red.


The first game started with a [Shambling Ghoul](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shambling+Ghoul) for Hoaen met by [Knight of the Pilgrim's Road](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Knight+of+the+Pilgrim%27s+Road) for Sigrist. Declining to block the Ghoul for fear of a combat trick, Sigrist took the first hit of the game but did more than his share in return thanks to the Knight finding its inner [Wild Instincts](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Instincts) to take down an [Akroan Sergeant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Akroan+Sergeant). An attack for 5 also made the Knight renowned.


[Prickleboar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Prickleboar) was the response from Hoaen, but a second [Wild Instincts](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Instincts) took it down and allowed the offense to continue for Sigrist. [Totem-Guide Hartebeest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Totem-Guide+Hartebeest) fetched up [Knightly Valor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Knightly+Valor) the next turn, ensuring a quick end to the first game.

For a format that's known to be aggressive, the second game started off just as inauspiciously, with a [Shadows of the Past](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shadows+of+the+Past) for Hoaen followed by an [Akroan Sergeant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Akroan+Sergeant) and a [Nantuko Husk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nantuko+Husk) to trade with Sigrist's first creature.


[Prickleboar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Prickleboar) followed, but once again it was taken down by [Wild Instincts](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Instincts). This time, Hoaen had a second, and with his defenses up thanks to the now-renowned Sergeant, it meant the vicious attacker was free to roam wild. But as vicious an attacker as [Prickleboar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Prickleboar) is, [Vastwood Gorger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vastwood+Gorger) is an even more potent blocker, and that's exactly what Sigrist followed with.

Undeterred, Hoaen sent the [Prickleboar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Prickleboar) into the red zone, planning to use the [Fiery Impulse](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fiery+Impulse) in hand to upend the Gorger with first-strike damage. A smart double-block by Sigrist foiled that plan, and Hoaen was forced to use the Impulse just to force a trade.


The two-for-one opened the door for Sigrist to attack again, and a timely [Enshrouding Mist](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Enshrouding+Mist) on the next turn removed Hoaen's last blockers, leaving Hoaen helpless to prevent a second [Wild Instincts](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Instincts) from closing out the game and sending Sigrist back to the Standard rounds at 9-2.


**Rich Hoaen 0 â€“ Mike Sigrist 2**
