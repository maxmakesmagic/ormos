The Daily *Magic* Update is a roundup of everything *Magic* you should know on September 27, 2017. Today's Update is brought to you by [the Muffin Man, the Muffin Man, the Muffin Man](#8).


What To Watch Today
===================


1. *Magic: The Gathering Arena* Live Stream | [twitch.tv/magic](https://go.twitch.tv/magic) | 1 p.m. PT/4 p.m. ET/8 p.m. UTC

Join Principle Game Designer Chris Clay and Community Manager Nate Price for a live discussion of all things *MTG Arena*, including a Q&A with anyone who has a good question. And no asking if Paul Cheon can come on the stream. He can't.


Today's Set Reviews
===================


1. [*Ixalan* Constructed Set Review: White](https://www.channelfireball.com/articles/ixalan-constructed-set-review-white/) | ChannelFireball | Luis Scott-Vargas

And so it begins—the most popular Constructed review on the web was published yesterday afternoon, and since it's the first in the series, it gets our "Must" stamp for today. It's kind of like the seal of *Good Housekeeping*, but, you know, without any kind of accompanying guarantee.


1. [*Ixalan* Review: Black](http://manadeprived.com/top-8-magic-ixalan-review-black/) | Top 8 Magic | Mike Flores and Brian David-Marshall

In which Flores and BDM talk *Magic* for the 8,726th time.


1. [*Ixalan* Standard Set Review: Black](http://www.gatheringmagic.com/aliaintrazi-09272017-ixalan-standard-set-review-black/) | Gathering Magic | Ali Aintrazi

Aintrazi moves on to black, having already covered white and blue.


1. [Commander Review: *Ixalan* Part 1 (White, Blue, Black)](https://www.mtggoldfish.com/articles/commander-review-ixalan-part-1-white-blue-black?src=wizards) | MTGGoldfish | Tomer Abramovici

In which Abramovici, um, reviews white, blue, and black cards with an eye to Commander. Hey, sometimes they just nail the headline.


After Those, Read, Watch, or Listen to These
============================================


1. [*Ixalan* Set Review: Rare and Mythic Rare](http://lrcast.com/limited-resources-408-ixalan-set-review-rare-and-mythic-rare/) | Limited Resources | Marshall Sutcliffe and Luis Scott-Vargas

So you're sitting down at Draft Weekend for your first draft of *Ixalan*. You open your pack to see a common you know is good, an uncommon you know is great, and a rare that looks promising. Do you snap up the rare? Which rares should you grab and which should you pass? These are the questions that keep Marshall and Luis up at night, so they seem like good sources for a review of all things rare in *Ixalan* Draft.


1. [The Top 10 *Ixalan* Commons for Limited](https://www.channelfireball.com/articles/the-top-10-ixalan-commons-for-limited/) | ChannelFireball | Mike Sigrist

But after that rare, then what? Siggy's got you, with his list of the ten best commons in *Ixalan*. Though with only one blue card on the list, he must have made some kind of error.


1. [Who is the Raven Man?](http://www.mtgsalvation.com/articles/49659-who-is-the-raven-man?platform=hootsuite) | MTGSalvation | Jay Annelli

Annelli thinks he's solved who Liliana's Raven Man really is—and all I can do is keep humming "Do you know the muffin man?" in my head.


Remembering Gadiel
==================


1. Gadiel Szleifer, Pro Tour Champion, Passed Away

Tragically, Gadiel Szleifer died last week. We struggled a bit with how to memorialize him—but others have already done it better. So we're going to share the remembrances from those who knew him best.


If you're well-ingrained in the world of *Magic*, you might have already read these, but since I was gone last week, I wanted to be sure to share them. To read more about Gadiel, check out the piece [by Ben Swartz on StarCityGames.com](http://www.starcitygames.com/article/35856_Remembering-Gadiel-Szleifer-.html), and the piece by [Ted Knutsen on his blog](https://mixedknuts.wordpress.com/2017/09/20/goodbye-gadiel/).

1. A nudge here and there

Not a ton of action this week, as Prereleases don't add Pro Points. Do, however, watch for significant changes in the coming weeks, as a new round of Grand Prix start up and—the big one—the World Championship starts in just over a week.

What People Are Talking About

My guess is that Chris Cocks agreed to do this mostly for the chance to go to Reading Terminal Market. And see the Liberty Bell. Maybe see the Eagles play and eat a cheesesteak. Though I guess giving the keynote is a pretty big deal, too.


Deck of the Day
===============


1. Grixis Pirates

Christian Calcano cooked up this Grixis Pirates deck and few days back, and it's still the most intriguing Grixis build I've seen. It's aggressive, disruptive, and gets to play [Admiral Beckett Brass](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Admiral+Beckett+Brass). What's not to like?
