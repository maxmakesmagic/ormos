The title of World Champion can bring with it an intimidating swagger. Julien Nuijten, all 15 years of him, is a kid who brought attitude to the table before any of us knew his name -- so now his diminutive shadow looms even larger. Unfortunately, such lights and tricks don't work on the beast that is the "cagey veteran," a label that defines Tsuyoshi Ikeda to a tee. With two Sunday finishes to his name, it's going take more than a little talk and a title to take him out before the cards come to play. ![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/ptcol05/fm9_1.jpg)*Julien Nuijten, left, and Tsuyoshi Ikeda*


The match pitted newer variants of classic archetypes, with Ikeda sporting a version of the Rock that utilizes [Yavimaya Elder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Yavimaya+Elder), [Eternal Witness](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eternal+Witness) and [Sakura-Tribe Elder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sakura-Tribe+Elder) for mana and card advantage. Nuijten was running Tog, complete with [Accumulated Knowledge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Accumulated+Knowledge), [Brainstorm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brainstorm), [Fact or Fiction](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fact+or+Fiction) and of course, [Upheaval](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Upheaval).


After Julien won the flip, he had a tough decision on his hands right off the bat, with [Chrome Mox](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chrome+Mox), [Mana Leak](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak), [Brainstorm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brainstorm), [Fire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fire)/[Ice](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ice) and Isochron's Scepter in his opening hand to go with [Island](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island) and [Polluted Delta](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Polluted+Delta). He chose to play the [Island](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island) and pass the turn, the assumption being he wanted to see what Ikeda was playing before committing one way or another to the Scepter. The flaw in this logic came on turn two, after Ikeda played [Birds of Paradise](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Birds+of+Paradise), when Julien [Brainstorm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brainstorm)ed into three more [Island](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island)s, untapped and imprinted the [Fire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fire)/[Ice](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ice) that many would want for the Scepter, onto his Mox.


After Ikeda played [Treetop Village](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treetop+Village) and two more [Birds](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Birds), Julien added to the questions, casting [Cunning Wish](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cunning+Wish) (after shuffling his library), looking though his sideboard before opting for the removed [Fire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fire)/[Ice](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ice), making the Mox useless. He cast the Scepter and tapped out to kill two [Birds](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Birds) immediately, so Ikeda [Vampiric Tutor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vampiric+Tutor)ed, untapped and cast [Living Wish](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Living+Wish) for [Viridian Shaman](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Viridian+Shaman).


Buh-bye, Scepter.


Suddenly Julien, who lost round 1 yesterday and had no caffeinated products this morning, was stuck at two cards in hand, staring down multiple [Treetop Village](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treetop+Village)s and [Sakura-Tribe Elder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sakura-Tribe+Elder). Drawing a [Psychatog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psychatog) with no black mana sources didn't help much either, and after one more round of beats, he started shuffling for Game 2.


**Ikeda 1, Nuijten 0**


### Game 2


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/ptcol05/fm9_2.jpg)*Tsuyoshi Ikeda*
An Ikeda mulligan gave Julien a needed momentum boost, but his deck was reactive enough that it was still Ikeda who had to come out swinging. Turn-one [Birds](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Birds) were joined in paradise by [Sakura-Tribe Elder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sakura-Tribe+Elder), and with the resulting mana build-up, he played a turn-three [Cranial Extraction](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cranial+Extraction), which Julien successfully [Mana Leak](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak)ed.


With Nuijten content to merely draw and pass turns, Tsuyoshi did most of the playing. He next cast [Pernicious Deed](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pernicious+Deed), which resolved, followed by another Elder. All of this while Julien waited patiently for a chance to use the [Daze](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Daze) in his hand. Unfortunately, as former PT player Matt Vienneau was fond of saying "There are good [Daze](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Daze), and there are bad [Daze](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Daze)," and [Brainstorm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brainstorm) afforded the kid the opportunity to give up on the good.


With Ikeda running low on cards, Julien cast [Living Wish](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Living+Wish) for [Fact or Fiction](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fact+or+Fiction), countering [Cranial Extraction](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cranial+Extraction) before managing to cast it with Tsuyoshi sporting two [Treetop Village](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treetop+Village)s and no cards in hand. It wasn't much of a race, with Julien finding [Cunning Wish](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cunning+Wish), using it to [Vampiric Tutor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vampiric+Tutor) and casting [Upheaval](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Upheaval) a turn later. [Psychatog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psychatog) did the trick, taking the 5-2-1 match to a third game.


**Ikeda 1, Nuijten 1**

### Game 3


Game 3 was anti-climactic. Ikeda once again mulliganed, and with nothing else to do, attacked with [Treetop Village](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treetop+Village) on turns three and four, a sign of extreme weakness. Julien, meanwhile, started drawing cards: He cast all four [Accumulated Knowledge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Accumulated+Knowledge)s and a [Fact or Fiction](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fact+or+Fiction) in the game. With Ikeda barely threatening the Dutchman, playing land after land, Julien went on the offensive. He [Cunning Wish](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cunning+Wish)ed for [Corpse Dance](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Corpse+Dance), then [Intuition](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Intuition)ed for [Psychatog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psychatog)s with [Upheaval](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Upheaval) in hand. He didn't NEED to [Upheaval](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Upheaval), but he worried that Ikeda would [Smother](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Smother) a pumped 'Tog, so he did it anyway. Tsuyoshi could only smile and shake his head, then extended his hand in concession.


**Final Score:**  
**Julien Nuijten 2, Tsuyoshi Ikeda 1**
