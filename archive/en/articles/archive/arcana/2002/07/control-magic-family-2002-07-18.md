The card [Bribery](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bribery) was originally slated to be in *Urza's Destiny*, and had the playtest name "Kick-Ass Control Magic." But the *Destiny* team wanted to continue the "free mechanic" into that set, and created [Treachery](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treachery), which is basically a five mana "free" [Control Magic](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Control+Magic).

[Bribery](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bribery) was moved up a set into *Mercadian Masques*, where it found a happy home, and both cards made significant impacts on their respective Block Constructed -- and Standard -- metagames.

Later, *Odyssey* debuted [Persuasion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Persuasion), which is [Treachery](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treachery) without the free mechanic. The development teams believe the original [Control Magic](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Control+Magic) was undercosted at 4 mana, and [Treachery](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treachery) was undercosted at 5, but both [Bribery](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bribery) and [Persuasion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Persuasion) are costed correctly.
