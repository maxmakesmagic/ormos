*Who's your favorite commander?*

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/mtgcom/authorpics/authorpic_kennagle.jpg)**Ken Nagle:** My favorite commander is The Mimeoplasm, a legendary creature showcased in the "Devour for Power" ***Magic: The Gathering** Commander* deck. I've been wanting to make a "combine two creatures-into-one" [Clone](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Clone) for about four years, and Mark Rosewater tried way back in *Tempest* with [Dracoplasm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dracoplasm). The Mimeoplasm (called "The Amalgamation" in [design](http://www.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/mm/146)) went through many iterations to arrive at the printed version that both is fun and works rules-wise. During playtesting, The Mimeoplasm had many fans, even opponents being attacked by it!

Here's just one potential creature The Mimeoplasm could become:


> The Mimeoplasm  
>  2BUG  
>  Artifact Creature â€“ Construct  
>  1/1  
>  As CARDNAME enters the battlefield, exile a [Polar Kraken](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Polar+Kraken) and a [Triskelion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Triskelion) from among graveyards.  
>  CARDNAME enters the battlefield with fourteen +1/+1 counters on it.  
>  Remove a +1/+1 counter from CARDNAME: CARDNAME deals 1 damage to target creature or player.
> 
> 

Here are just a few reasons why The Mimeoplasm is awesome:


> 
> * Combining creatures is fun. Experiment!
> * Due to the exiling clause, The Mimeoplasm is different each time it enters the battlefield. This keeps game play fresh!
> * The Mimeoplasm is often the largest creature on the battlefield. RAWR fatties!
> * It has a T-Rex for an arm. Isn't that awesome?!
