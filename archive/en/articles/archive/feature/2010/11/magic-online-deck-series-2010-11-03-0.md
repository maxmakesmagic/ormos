**Bringing Legacy to the Masses**


The [Legacy format](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/TCG/Resources.aspx?x=judge/resources/sfrlegacy) allows players to play with cards from the entirety of **Magic**'s rich history. However, with thousands of cards to choose from, creating a deck for this incredibly deep format can be a bit overwhelming. 


Enter the **Magic Online** Deck Series. The new "Boltslinger" and "Exiler" decks give you exactly what you need to be immediately competitive. Fast enough to give any deck a run for its money, these aggressive decks allow you to jump right into Legacy games and experience this awesome format for yourself. 


Each deck comes with a ready-to-play 60-card deck, a 15-card sideboard, and 2 Event Tickets. They are available only on **Magic Online**.





**Magic Online Release Date:** November 8, 2010   
 MSRP: $29.99
