Jacob Van Lunen began playing Magic in 1995. He has participated in organized play at every level of competition and was a member of the winning team at Pro Tour San Diego in 2007, thanks to an innovative draft strategy. As a writer, Van Lunen has had more than three hundred Magic strategy pieces published 






As promised, I've got my latest build of [Master Transmuter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Master+Transmuter) sleeved up and ready to go. 

[Master Transmuter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Master+Transmuter) is one of the most powerful creatures in Extended. Unfortunately, Faeries has prevented this deck from achieving competitiveness. *Mirrodin Besieged* does a good job of changing that, though. Faerie decks will, and I say this with almost 100% certainty, play [Go for the Throat](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Go+for+the+Throat) as their removal spell of choice. To them, [Go for the Throat](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Go+for+the+Throat) is a strict upgrade to [Doom Blade](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Doom+Blade). Cards like [Putrid Leech](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Putrid+Leech), [Demigod of Revenge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Demigod+of+Revenge), and [Doran, the Siege Tower](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Doran%2C+the+Siege+Tower) are all of higher priority than cards like [Master Transmuter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Master+Transmuter) and [Platinum Emperion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Platinum+Emperion) to any tournament savvy player. 

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/boab/boab129_transmuter.jpg)  
This minor change in the outline of Faeries gives us an opportunity to capitalize on the potential power of [Master Transmuter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Master+Transmuter) and its friends. That's not the only trick we've picked up to fight the Faerie Menace. [Shimmer Myr](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shimmer+Myr) gives us an opportunity to resolve our spells or force an unwilling Faerie player to fight with countermagic on their own turn. 

[Spine of Ish Sah](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spine+of+Ish+Sah) may seem expensive, but once you get this thing going with a [Master Transmuter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Master+Transmuter), you will understand why it's worth the wait. Destroying one or more permanents every turn is backbreaking for any opponent. 

[Treasure Mage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treasure+Mage) may seem gimmicky, but it's kind of like a really bad [Sphinx Summoner](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sphinx+Summoner). [Treasure Mage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treasure+Mage) combos nicely with [Grand Architect](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grand+Architect) to put some very scary things on the table at very early turns of the game.

| Grand Architect | Etherium Sculptor |

I experimented with [Grand Architect](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grand+Architect) in the past and it seemed like a necessary tool if I were planning on using cards like [Spine of Ish Sah](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spine+of+Ish+Sah) and [Shimmer Myr](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shimmer+Myr). It's worth noting how strong the pump ability on this creature can be. It makes your [Master Transmuter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Master+Transmuter) dodge things like [Disfigure](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Disfigure) and double [Cunning Sparkmage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cunning+Sparkmage). It makes your [Trinket Mage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Trinket+Mage)s, [Treasure Mage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treasure+Mage)s, [Etherium Sculptor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Etherium+Sculptor)s, and [Sphinx Summoner](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sphinx+Summoner)s all into serious beaters.

[Trinket Mage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Trinket+Mage) is a nice addition to have when you're playing [Grand Architect](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grand+Architect). Most of the time, you just grab an [Everflowing Chalice](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Everflowing+Chalice) to help your mana situation, but there are a lot of situations where a [Chimeric Mass](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chimeric+Mass) or [Executioner's Capsule](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Executioner%27s+Capsule) can really put a damper on your opponent's plans. [Elixir of Immortality](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elixir+of+Immortality) is strong against red decks and it lets us shuffle our graveyard back into our library if we've already used [Sharuum the Hegemon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sharuum+the+Hegemon) and need to get a [Sphinx Summoner](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sphinx+Summoner) going. 

[Etherium Sculptor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Etherium+Sculptor) is the deck's turn two play of choice. In fact, I've found that I rarely lose a game when I untap with an [Etherium Sculptor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Etherium+Sculptor) on the battlefield. It's especially powerful when combined with [Grand Architect](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grand+Architect). The cost reduction alongside the mana ability allows you to get things like Spine Ish Sah into action a lot faster than one might expect. 

![Shimmer Myr](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Shimmer+Myr)  
[Shimmer Myr](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shimmer+Myr) may shine the brightest when you're playing against Faeries, but it's worth noting how powerful it can be against other decks. Flashing in a large artifact after your opponent makes his attack can often be the advantage you need to win the game. 

The top-end package is completely ridiculous: 

[Precursor Golem](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Precursor+Golem) is a huge beating for most decks. It gets especially powerful when you have a [Master Transmuter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Master+Transmuter) spinning it in and out of play. 

[Sharuum the Hegemon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sharuum+the+Hegemon) makes it impossible for other non-Faerie/non-combo decks to keep up with a single [Sphinx Summoner](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sphinx+Summoner). 

[Platinum Emperion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Platinum+Emperion) is a win by itself against a lot of decks. Things get especially difficult for your opponent if you have a [Master Transmuter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Master+Transmuter) in play at the same time. 

[Wurmcoil Engine](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wurmcoil+Engine) is a necessary top-end spell that the deck needs to have access to as a turn four play. Decks like Jund and Mono Red can run you over if you don't have access to a single copy of this card. 



|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Sharuum the Hegemon | Platinum Emperion |

[Sphere of the Suns](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sphere+of+the+Suns) is like a bad [Everflowing Chalice](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Everflowing+Chalice). That being said, it's still quite good. This deck desperately wanted more two-drops that helped lubricate the avalanche of card advantage and board position that starts around turn four or five. 

[Thousand-Year Elixir](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thousand-Year+Elixir) is incredible with [Master Transmuter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Master+Transmuter). I found myself losing most games where I drew more than one copy, though. I decided the only way to guarantee I wouldn't draw more than one was to only play a single copy. If you decide to play cards like [Scarecrone](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scarecrone), then you probably want a few extra copies of this in your main deck. 

A lot of readers suggested that I use [Mindlock Orb](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mindlock+Orb) in my sideboard to help against the [Valakut, the Molten Pinnacle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Valakut%252C%2Bthe%2BMolten%2BPinnacle) decks. While the effect is powerful, I'd rather not turn off my [Sphinx Summoner](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sphinx+Summoner)s and Mages. [Leyline of Sanctity](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leyline+of+Sanctity) seems like a much better choice.

I definitely want access to a [Sphinx of the Steel Wind](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sphinx+of+the+Steel+Wind) post-board to soften up our Jund opponents. 

[Lodestone Golem](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lodestone+Golem) can make things really difficult for players that rely heavily on a specific curve. Playing a full four of these post-board can often make things very difficult for opponents. Remember, [Lodestone Golem](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lodestone+Golem) is especially strong in multiples. With the help of [Sphinx Summoner](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sphinx+Summoner) and [Master Transmuter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Master+Transmuter) it's reasonable to assume we should have trouble finding a few copies in the same game. 

The rest of the sideboard is designed to help us tune the deck for specific matchups. This sideboard configuration allows you to shape your deck based on what cards you've seen from your opponent. 

Here's the final 75:

I played a few matches with the new list to see how it would fare against the latest versions of decks like Faeries. Match reports are particularly enlightening to read with a deck like this. Understanding the unique interactions between different spells is very important.

Note: The Faeries deck my friend and I used has four copies of [Go for the Throat](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Go+for+the+Throat) and two disfigures.

My opponent cast a [Vendilion Clique](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vendilion+Clique) during my end step. I tapped my [Grand Architect](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grand+Architect) and [Etherium Sculptor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Etherium+Sculptor) using [Grand Architect](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grand+Architect)s activate ability, cast [Shimmer Myr](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shimmer+Myr), and cast [Wurmcoil Engine](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wurmcoil+Engine).

I made my [Wurmcoil Engine](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wurmcoil+Engine) and [Shimmer Myr](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shimmer+Myr) into blue creatures and tapped my team.

He untapped, attacked for 4, failed to play a fourth land, and cast [Thoughtseize](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtseize), taking my [Sphinx Summoner](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sphinx+Summoner). I drew another [Sphinx Summoner](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sphinx+Summoner) and cast it. I searched my library for another copy of [Sphinx Summoner](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sphinx+Summoner). My opponent drew his card and passed the turn. I drew an [Island](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island), played it, cast another [Lodestone Golem](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lodestone+Golem). My opponent drew for his turn and simply passed again. I drew a [Master Transmuter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Master+Transmuter), cast it, and passed the turn. My opponent was assembling a nice army of Faerie tokens, but it still looked pretty bad for him. He played a [Creeping Tar Pit](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Creeping+Tar+Pit) and passed the turn. I drew a [Sunken Ruins](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sunken+Ruins), played it, used [Master Transmuter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Master+Transmuter) to phase my [Sphinx Summoner](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sphinx+Summoner) off, then back on the battlefield. I searched up a [Lodestone Golem](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lodestone+Golem), cast it, and passed the turn again. My opponent attacked with all his Faerie tokens and I ate one with my [Sphinx Summoner](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sphinx+Summoner). I drew an [Arcane Sanctum](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arcane+Sanctum), cast [Thousand-Year Elixir](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thousand-Year+Elixir), and passed the turn.

My opponent attacked with all his Faerie tokens again. I activated my [Master Transmuter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Master+Transmuter) returning my [Sphere of the Suns](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sphere+of+the+Suns) back to my hand, and putting the other [Sphinx Summoner](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sphinx+Summoner) onto the battlefield, then I searched for [Sphinx of the Steel Wind](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sphinx+of+the+Steel+Wind). I used the Elixir to untap my [Master Transmuter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Master+Transmuter), activated my [Master Transmuter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Master+Transmuter), and phased out a [Sphinx Summoner](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sphinx+Summoner) to make a [Sphinx of the Steel Wind](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sphinx+of+the+Steel+Wind). I blocked two tokens and netted some life. On my turn I spun up the last [Lodestone Golem](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lodestone+Golem) and put it onto the battlefield. I attacked with Sphinxes and my opponent chumped the big one and traded his [Vendilion Clique](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vendilion+Clique) for the other. My opponent drew for his turn and decided it was an okay time to concede.

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/boab/boab129_leyline.jpg)I went down to six cards and kept [Island](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island), [Arcane Sanctum](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arcane+Sanctum), [Leyline of Sanctity](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leyline+of+Sanctity), [Leyline of Sanctity](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leyline+of+Sanctity), [Sphinx Summoner](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sphinx+Summoner), [Etherium Sculptor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Etherium+Sculptor). I put both Leylines onto the battlefield and my opponent led with a [Valakut, the Molten Pinnacle](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Valakut%2C+the+Molten+Pinnacle). I drew a [Swamp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swamp), played my [Arcane Sanctum](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arcane+Sanctum), and passed the turn. My opponent played [Forest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest), cast [Explore](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Explore), played another [Valakut, the Molten Pinnacle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Valakut%252C%2Bthe%2BMolten%2BPinnacle), and passed the turn.

I drew a [Treasure Mage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treasure+Mage), cast [Grand Architect](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grand+Architect), attacked for 2, and passed the turn.

I drew another [Arcane Sanctum](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arcane+Sanctum), played it, cast [Sphinx Summoner](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sphinx+Summoner), searched for [Master Transmuter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Master+Transmuter), and passed the turn. My opponent cast a [Primal Command](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Primal+Command) putting one of my Leylines on the top of my library and shuffling it. He attacked with [Primeval Titan](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Primeval+Titan) and searched for his fourth [Valakut, the Molten Pinnacle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Valakut%252C%2Bthe%2BMolten%2BPinnacle) and an [Evolving Wilds](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Evolving+Wilds), and passed the turn. I drew [Spine of Ish Sah](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spine+of+Ish+Sah), tapped [Grand Architect](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grand+Architect) and an [Island](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island), cast [Master Transmuter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Master+Transmuter), and cast [Treasure Mage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treasure+Mage).

I then attacked with [Sphinx Summoner](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sphinx+Summoner) for 4, and passed the turn. My opponent cast another [Primeval Titan](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Primeval+Titan) and found a [Terramorphic Expanse](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Terramorphic+Expanse) and [Evolving Wilds](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Evolving+Wilds).

My opponent cast another [Primal Command](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Primal+Command) and put my other Leyline on the top of my library. He entered combat and I activated my [Master Transmuter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Master+Transmuter) to destroy his [Primeval Titan](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Primeval+Titan). He sacrificed his first fetch land and found a fifth [Mountain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mountain). He sacrificed his second and found a sixth. He targeted my [Master Transmuter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Master+Transmuter) with one trigger and my [Platinum Emperion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Platinum+Emperion) with the other three. I used my Elixir and bounced my [Master Transmuter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Master+Transmuter) back to my hand and then back to the battlefield. I used the [Master Transmuter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Master+Transmuter) to bounce my [Platinum Emperion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Platinum+Emperion) back to my hand and then back to the battlefield also. My opponent sacrificed his other fetch land and finished off the Emperion and the Transmuter. He passed the turn. I attacked for lethal damage.

[Go for the Throat](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Go+for+the+Throat) may seem like it makes Faeries better than ever, but it certainly gives this deck a huge advantage. [Shimmer Myr](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shimmer+Myr) and [Spine of Ish Sah](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spine+of+Ish+Sah) give this deck the tools it needs to compete in the latest version of Extended. I strongly recommend putting this deck together. It's one of the most fun archetypes you can possibly play with. 

Happy Brewing!
