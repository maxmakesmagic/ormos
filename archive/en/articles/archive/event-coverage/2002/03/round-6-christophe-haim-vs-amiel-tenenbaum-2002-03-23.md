![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gpbar02/a956.jpg)We started this round with an example of good sportsmanship between both players, who were laughing and joking with each other. Christophe Haim made his first Pro Tour Top 8 last week in Osaka.

### Game 1

Amiel decided to go first and had to mulligan while Christophe kept his opening hand.

Both players dropped lands during their early turns until Haim cast a [Wild Mongrel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Mongrel). After sending in the Mongrel Christophe dropped a [Mad Dog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mad+Dog).  

Amiel cast a [Krosan Archer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Krosan+Archer) to try to stop his opponent's offense but his creature got Aether Bursted back to his hand. After recasting the Archer it got a [Sonic Seizure](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sonic+Seizure) on it to take it out of the way for good. A [Werebear](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Werebear) joined the two-casting-cost creatures. On the other side a [Carrion Wurm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Carrion+Wurm) entered play, which did not stop Haim from attacking. Another four damage from [Thermal Blast](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thermal+Blast) got the job done on the Wurm. When Christophe played a Petravrak to remove Tenenbaum's sole source of blue mana he repelled the Mongrel back. Haim kept attacking until his opponent conceded.

Tenenbaum 0 – 1 Haim

### Game 2

Good mood was still present at the table and both players kept talking about their decks.

Amiel decided to go first and kept his hand, while Haim took a mulligan.  

After some land dropping, Christophe started the hostilities with [Seton's Scout](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seton%27s+Scout). A Hydromorphic Guardian joined his forces. On the other side of the table, a [Possessed Centaur](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Possessed+Centaur) and a [Carrion Wurm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Carrion+Wurm) had been cast. Tenenbaum then cast [Crippling Fatigue](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crippling+Fatigue) twice to clear the table and attacked with his beasts.

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gpbar02/a957.jpg)A Petravrak removed a land on Tenenbaum's side and hoped for reinforcements. A Kamahl then hit the ground on Haim's side to kill the Centaur while a Waste away took care of the pit fighter. At eight life Haim decided to let the [Carrion Wurm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Carrion+Wurm) deal no damage by removing three cards from his graveyard.

He then cast a [Thermal Blast](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thermal+Blast) and a [Sonic Seizure](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sonic+Seizure) to kill of the Wurm and attacked with his Windreader. Tenenbaum cast a [Nantuko Disciple](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nantuko+Disciple) and Haim responded with [Roar of the Wurm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Roar+of+the+Wurm). Amiel then enchanted the Wurm with [Patriarch's Desire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Patriarch%27s+Desire) kill it as he blocked it with his pumped up disciple. The Aven kept nibbling at Tenenbaum's life totals though leaving him at three life. A [Krosan Archer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Krosan+Archer) was cast to block the Aven while an [Upheaval](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Upheaval) was revealed. Christophe then cast a [Cephalid Looter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cephalid+Looter) hoping for some answers in his deck. Meanwhile Amiel got a [Seton's Scout](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seton%27s+Scout) out as another blocker for the Windreader. A concentrate on Haim's side together with a sacrificed [Standstill](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Standstill) gave him some more cards to find an answer. Amiel played [Upheaval](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Upheaval) with four mana in his mana pool to pay a [Syncopate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Syncopate) on Haim's side. [Upheaval](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Upheaval) resolved. 

Both players dropped - once again - only lands until Haim played out a [Werebear](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Werebear). His opponent played [Seton's Scout](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seton%27s+Scout) to block, but Haim enchanted his 4/4 [Werebear](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Werebear) with [Ghostly Wings](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ghostly+Wings), which made it bigger than the Scout. Tenenbaum conceded shortly after.

**Final Result:** Tenenbaum 0 – 2 Haim
