Nagoya's convenient location in the heart of the country affords easy access to travel destinations throughout Japan. The Shinkansen express train links Nagoya with Tokyo, Osaka, Kyoto and other major cities. The Nagoya International Airport offers direct flights to many of the world's major cities; its numerous domestic flight destinations are a gateway to Japan. 


With a population of about 2.15 million living within the city's 326 square kilometers, comfortable living conditions prevail. Reliable and safe public transportation, including subways and extensive bus lines, put many of the city's attractions within easy reach. The city is known for its broad avenues; tree-lined boulevards make strolling around one of the simple pleasures of this city. Popular attractions include Nagoya Castle, originally built in 1612 and housing a museum with many interactive exhibits, and Atsuta-jinja Shrine, which is home to the sword Kusunagi-no-tsurugi, one of the Three Imperial Regalia of Japan..


Although this is the first time in eight years for the city to host a Grand Prix, it is no stranger to **Magic**, with a Pro Tour being held there just last year. Perhaps most well-known as the city where Shu Komuro won the last-ever Rochester Draft at Pro Tour Nagoya 2005, Nagoya is called home by some of Japan’s most noted **Magic**  luminaries, including Jin “The Last Emperor” Okamoto, Worlds 2006 Finalist Ryo Ogura, and one-time National Champion Kotaro Ootsuka. Come join us in Nagoya for the last event of the 2012 season for all the fun and excitement for which Grand Prix are famous.



*The **Magic: The Gathering**  Grand Prix tournament series is a great reason to get out into the **Magic** tournament community, catch up with old friends, meet some new ones, and play some great **Magic**. Grand Prix tournaments are world-wide open events that allow all **Magic**  players to participate and experience the thrill of a large-scale competition. In addition to cash prizes, a high Planeswalker Points multiplier, and exclusive foil promo cards for participants, Grand Prix feature a host of other activities, including public events and artist signings (prizes subject to change).

Minors must have a parent or guardian’s signature on this form. Publicity releases will be collected during registration.


**Tournament Format**
  


* [Standard Constructed](/en/node/704561). Legal sets as of the tournament date are: ***Magic**  2013*, *Innistrad*, *Dark Ascension*, *Avacyn Restored*, and *Return to Ravnica*.
* Deck lists are required (download [blank deck list sheet here](http://www.wizards.com/dci/downloads/CONSTRUCTED_DECKLIST.pdf)).
* Players must use the same deck on Day 2 that they used on Day 1.

**Tournament Structure** 


* Modified Swiss-style (50-minute rounds). The number of rounds on Day One will be determined based on the number of players registered. Players will be paired randomly against players with similar win-loss records, with match points accumulating throughout the event
* If 799 or fewer players register for the event, all players with an X-2-0 or better record OR the top 64 players—whichever number is greater—will advance to the second day of the event.
* If 800 or more players register for the event, all players with an X-2-0 or better record OR the top 128 players—whichever number is greater—will advance to the second day of the event.
* The Top 8 players after the final Swiss round on Day 2 will advance to the Top 8 single-elimination finals.
* Top 8 playoff matches will be best 2 of 3, and have no time limit. (Players are still expected to play at a normal pace and complete playoff matches in a reasonable amount of time.)
* Where necessary, the standings after the Swiss rounds will still be used to determine final order in the standings.
* For the first game of each match in the Top 8, the player that finished higher in the Swiss rounds chooses either to play first or to play second. For subsequent games in each Top 8 match, the usual Play/Draw rule applies (loser of the previous game decides whether to play first in the next game).

**Staff**
  
 The head judges for Grand Prix Nagoya will be James MacKay (Level 4, Australia) and Riccardo Tessitori (Level 5, Italy). If you are interested in volunteering for Grand Prix Nagoya as a judge, please contact Kenji Suzuki, Regional Coordinator Japan/Korea, through the [Judge Center](http://judge.wizards.com/).
