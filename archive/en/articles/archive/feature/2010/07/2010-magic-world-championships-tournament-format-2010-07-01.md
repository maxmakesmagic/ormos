Players playing in the World Championships must have a signed waiver and consent form in order to compete at the World Championships. Forms can be downloaded at [www.wizards.com/protour](/en/node/730476) and will be available onsite. 


**Minors must have a parent or guardian’s signature on these forms. Minors will not be able to register or play unless we receive a waiver signed by a parent or guardian. No exceptions!**


Bring these forms with you to registration. We will make forms available for competitors at registration, if necessary.


To register, all participants must present one of the following forms of identification:


* a driver’s license, or
* a passport, or
* a copy of a birth certificate and photo IDs (school IDs are acceptable).

We encourage players to attend mandatory registration on Wednesday. However we understand that delays might cause players to miss this and we have a registration on Thursday morning between 7:30 a.m. and 8:30 a.m. Players at late registration do not always receive the same gifts as those at mandatory registration.


Players not registered by 8:30 a.m. on December 9 may be denied entry to the World Championships.


If you anticipate any difficulty registering during the official registration hours, please contact Scott Larabee at at +1-206-793-3534 or [scott.larabee@wizards.com](mailto:scott.larabee@wizards.com).
