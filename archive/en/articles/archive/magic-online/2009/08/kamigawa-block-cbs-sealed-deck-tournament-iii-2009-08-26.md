*Long before Mirrodin existed, on the other side of the Multiverse, there was Kamigawa—a plane in the midst of a terrible war. Spirits are launching attacks against humans as, in the shadows, a terror lurks just beyond sight.*


*A gang of Akki goblins try to flee from an angry ice spirit that appears from out of nowhere. A cloud of bizarre creatures emerge from a samurai's heirloom lantern, attacking him while he sleeps. At the Minamo School, students of wizardry fight nonstop to stem a flow of strange beings that materialize from within the Great Waterfall.*
