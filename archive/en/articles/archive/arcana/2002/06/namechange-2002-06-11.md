When the split cards were created in *Invasion*, one thing everyone knew was necessary to pull them off was catchy names -- phrases made of words that meant something individually, yet still made sense together. [Spite/Malice](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spite%2FMalice) is a good example -- I can counter your spell out of Spite, and kill your creature out of Malice. And together, "spite and malice" is a relatively well-known phrase, and is even the name of a card game played with normal playing cards.


At least two of the original five split cards went through name changes. [Assault/Battery](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Assault%2FBattery) was originally known as "Hit/Run". While "Hit" is passable for a direct damage spell, "Run" is pretty silly for a token generating spell. Plus the name refers to a type of automobile accident, which isn't the best source of material. [Assault/Battery](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Assault%2FBattery) is definitely the better name.


[Wax/Wane](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wax%2FWane)'s first name was "Pride/Prejudice". While those terms might make more sense -- Pride makes my creature stronger, and Prejudice makes me want to destroy your enchantments -- some members of the naming team didn't like the fact that the name was taken from a novel, *Pride and Prejudice* by Jane Austin.
