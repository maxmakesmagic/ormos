Hometown hero and former Rookie of the Year Felipe Tapia Becerra is probably the number two pick to win this event, behind a visiting Willy Edel. This round he squares off against Luis Castillejo, native of Spain.


The Matchup
===========


This is your classic Speed vs Inevitability match. Becerra's deck revolves around [Whip of Erebos](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Whip+of+Erebos), and if he manages to get that online, the lifegain will be almost impossible for Castillejo's deck to overcome. It also features a lot of cumulative advantage from cards like Satyr wayfinder, [Courser of Kruphix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Courser+of+Kruphix) and [Eidolon of Blossoms](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eidolon+of+Blossoms), giving it a stranglehold on the long game. Fortunately for Castillejo, the Boss Red deck is geared towards winning within the first five turns. Packed with one-drops and cards to disable blockers, it hopes to overwhelm the opponent early and finish things with burn.

The Games
=========



Castillejo won the roll, and after a mulligan kicked off with [Foundry Street Denizen](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Foundry+Street+Denizen). Next came [Monastery Swiftspear](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Monastery+Swiftspear) and a [Dragon Mantle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragon+Mantle) for the Denizen, putting Becerra to 17. Becerra had a [Satyr Wayfinder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Satyr+Wayfinder) to put in the way of the Denizen, and took another three from the Swiftspear who got her own Mantle. [Frenzied Goblin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Frenzied+Goblin) made sure that blocking would be difficult.

Becerra summoned [Courser of Kruphix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Courser+of+Kruphix), hoping to make the most of its lifegain. Castillejo attacked freely thanks to the goblin, and between [Dragon Mantle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragon+Mantle) and [Titan's Strength](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Titan%27s+Strength) he had Becerra down to just five life. Becerra played [Eidolon of Blossoms](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eidolon+of+Blossoms) and crossed his fingers. Castillejo's creatures crashed in, but after the Eidolon blocked the Swiftspear Castillejo had no trick to save it. Becerra could breathe a sigh of relief. Castillejo summoned a second [Frenzied Goblin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Frenzied+Goblin) and passed.



That relief soon turned to confidence as [Doomwake Giant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Doomwake+Giant) cleared the board. Castillejo was out of gas, and Becerra's next play was [Whip of Erebos](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Whip+of+Erebos). After seeing him gain six from his attackers, Castillejo was ready to pack it in.


**Becerra 1 - Castillejo 0**


Castillejo got to play with seven cards this game, and again came out like gangbusters. First [Foundry Street Denizen](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Foundry+Street+Denizen), then Swiftspear and [Frenzied Goblin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Frenzied+Goblin). Becerra had [Satyr Wayfinder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Satyr+Wayfinder) but still couldn't block. Luckily for him, Castillejo only hit for three and passed with two mana open. He summoned a second Wayfinder and scryed with [Temple of Malady](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Temple+of+Malady).

Castillejo accidentally revealed a [Stoke the Flames](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stoke+the+Flames) in his attempt to play [Dragon Mantle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragon+Mantle) on his Swiftspear, giving Becerra a bit of extra information. His creatures dropped Becerra to just nine and he passed the turn. Becerra played a forest before summoning [Courser of Kruphix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Courser+of+Kruphix), leaving the Temple up, likely signalling a [Murderous Cut](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Murderous+Cut). Castillejo gamely cleared out Becerra's creatures with [Stoke the Flames](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stoke+the+Flames) and [Magma Spray](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Magma+Spray) before attacking with his Swiftspear. Naturally, Becerra had the Cut.



He untapped and summoned a replacement Courser, then played [Wooded Foothills](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wooded+Foothills). The window was closing for Castillejo, and though he had two cards in hand, he was unable to add anything to the board. Things quickly got worse, with [Nylea's Disciple](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nylea%27s+Disciple) giving Becerra four more life. A [Brain Maggot](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brain+Maggot) took [Harness by Force](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Harness+by+Force) and left Castillejo with only blanks. Next came the Whip, and this time Castillejo didn't need to see another card before extending the hand.


**Felipe Tapia Becerra defeats Luis Castillejo 2-0**
