### SERIOUS FUN


Abzan Clan's Master Plan
========================

Bruce Richard

Bruce's games invariably involve a kitchen table, several opponents, crazy plays, and many laughs. Bruce believes that if anyone at your table isn't having fun playing Magic, then you are doing it wrong.


September 30, 2014
 











I love Abzan and there is little doubt that many others love it too. At my Prerelease[[1]](#footnotebottom1), Abzan was the favorite choice by far. Between the color combination, the outlast mechanic, and many cool cards in the clan, it was obvious why so many players wanted to be Abzan. I watched several Abzan players build up on the board, doing their best to lock down opponents, then seeing their incremental advantage simply become too much for their opponents. Abzan didn't win many games quickly, but they did win many games.


When it comes to multiplayer games, what's not to love? White, black, and green offer practically everything you want. The three colors can destroy any permanent in play easily and offer a wide selection of mass destruction, great flying creatures, big beasts, combat tricks, and lifegain and life loss. They may not be able to easily counter a spell, but it can happen if you really need it. They include Orzhov, Golgari, and Selesnya, three of my preferred guilds. That color combination really does it all.


For cards that are all three of those colors, the wedge was a little weak before *Khans of Tarkir*. You could make it work, but generally, if you were going to use the WBG wedge, you were going to focus on more single-colored creatures and less on three-colored gold cards. Teneb, Doran, and Ghave made for some fun decks, but there was always something lacking. Then *Khans of Tarkir* and the Abzan clan came along. Suddenly, a deck like [the one I featured last week](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/sf/khans-tarkir-multiplayer-edition-2014-09-23) can work.

You can go through each card in the deck and understand the value of that card. Abzan did get several [multiplayer powerhouse cards](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/sf/khans-tarkir-multiplayer-edition-2014-09-23). However, the more I looked at the deck, and the more I heard from you, it just didn't quite make sense when you saw it all together. Doran is a great card, but beyond [Birds of Paradise](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Birds+of+Paradise) and [Scars of the Veteran](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scars+of+the+Veteran), it really doesn't offer much except as a cheap fatty. Ajani and Ghave each like to see plenty of creatures in play, but [Duneblast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duneblast) is best suited to a deck that aims to hit with a single huge creature. After hearing from some of you, I decided to rehash things and take this deck in a new direction.


Abzan Garbage Can
=================


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Duneblast)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duneblast)
**[Duneblast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duneblast):** This was the first casualty for all the reason I mentioned above. I wanted to give the deck a new focus and I knew it wasn't going to be a single massive creature. I could have gone this way, but my current Doran deck does that some of the time as Doran (or another creature) gets equipped and an instant or two later is doing lethal damage to an opponent. It is fun, but I wanted something different.



**[Scars of the Veteran](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scars+of+the+Veteran):** [The +1/+1 counter theme in Abzan is fun](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/rc/fistful-counters-2014-09-30), and I'm a counter junkie, but +0/+1 counters lose something. Scars is a flexible card that runs well on defense and offense (with Doran), but it doesn't fit with the theme and was another card that encouraged you to build a single massive creature. Besides, without Doran this card isn't all that great.



**[Doran, the Siege Tower](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Doran%2C+the+Siege+Tower):** This card is a personal favorite. I was lucky enough to have my copies of Doran signed by Mark Zug. The problem is that Doran demands you build around him. This deck does not do that, so you don't get the advantage of cheap creatures suddenly doing far more damage than they are supposed to because of Doran's ability. Including 4/4 creatures in a deck with Doran is failing to use Doran properly, so I took them out.



[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Ivorytusk Fortress)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ivorytusk Fortress)
**[Ivorytusk Fortress](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ivorytusk+Fortress):** I hated removing this card. I like what this card offers. I think it is going to be impressive in some Commander decks. Cards that let you untap on each player's upkeep are powerhouses in multiplayer. So why remove the card?


[Seedborn Muse](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seedborn+Muse).


The Muse does everything [Ivorytusk Fortress](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ivorytusk+Fortress) does and more. [Seedborn Muse](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seedborn+Muse) untaps all your permanents, not just the creatures with +1/+1 counters. [Seedborn Muse](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seedborn+Muse) only costs green mana, so it winds up being easier to cast than [Ivorytusk Fortress](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ivorytusk+Fortress). Once you get past the excitement of a new card, you realize that [Seedborn Muse](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seedborn+Muse) is just the better card. This isn't a Commander deck, so why not run four [Seedborn Muse](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seedborn+Muse)s in place of the [Ivorytusk Fortress](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ivorytusk+Fortress) and get more value?


But I didn't replace [Ivorytusk Fortress](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ivorytusk+Fortress) with [Seedborn Muse](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seedborn+Muse).


[Seedborn Muse](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seedborn+Muse) turns your deck into one of "those" decks. The deck stops being some cool Abzan deck (or anything else for that matter) and turns into a deck that tries to abuse [Seedborn Muse](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seedborn+Muse). That would mean switching out most of the cards and ending up with a deck full of permanents that tap or can store mana or something that abuses [Seedborn Muse](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seedborn+Muse). It can also be a deck with [Seedborn Muse](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seedborn+Muse) in it that doesn't really take advantage of [Seedborn Muse](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seedborn+Muse). I'm not interested in either of those options. I'm looking to celebrate Abzan, not build a [Seedborn Muse](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seedborn+Muse) deck in Abzan colors. Thus, I took out the [Ivorytusk Fortress](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ivorytusk+Fortress)es and did not replace them.



**[Ajani Goldmane](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ajani+Goldmane):** I didn't like cutting Ajani, but the numbers game went against him. I needed the slots for other cards just a little more than I wanted Ajani. He works with multiple creatures and offers all sorts of benefits, but it just wasn't enough. If the current numbers in the deck are off, Ajani will be back in, but for now, the leonin Planeswalker will sit on the sidelines.



New Battle Plan of the Abzan Clan
=================================





[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Anafenza, the Foremost)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Anafenza, the Foremost)

I don't think this is a great multiplayer card. Her ability gives a +1/+1 counter to another tapped creature you control. This usually means that you have to attack with her and another creature to get the bonus.[[2]](#footnotebottom2) Getting a 4/4 creature for three mana is nice, but hardly something that is going to put it in your deck.


Anafenza makes the list because she eliminates your opponents' ability to fill their graveyards. Anafenza forces your opponents to use a creature once. If you can kill it, it is gone. Too many times, you need to kill something multiple times because your opponent has a way to recur creatures. It can kill your efficiency and send you to a quick end. Anafenza forces opponents to play fair, and many decks don't want to play fair. I have kept [Gyre Sage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gyre+Sage) in the deck.


Besides, those are warrior goats in the art! Warrior goats!





[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Vish Kal, Blood Arbiter)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vish Kal, Blood Arbiter)
Vish Kal eliminates your opponents' potential blockers, so the rest of your creatures can be more effective. Vish Kal can be a single-creature wrecking ball, but in this deck he is there to play a more utility role. Vish Kal works with Ghave and loves the whole "give your creatures +1/+1 counters" theme in Abzan. Ghave can remove +1/+1 counters from any of your creatures to give you small creatures to sacrifice to Vish Kal, giving him just the amount of counters he needs to eliminate your opponents' creatures. This sort of efficiency can make him very difficult to deal with. Even forgetting about Ghave, Vish Kal is also happy to sacrifice any of your creatures that appear to be headed for the graveyard anyway. Vish Kal gives you the removal you are looking for with the loss of [Duneblast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duneblast).





[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Flickerform)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flickerform)
So far, you've seen the deck focus on getting several creatures in play, then making them bigger in a variety of ways. The deck also has a second prong of attack with [Siege Rhino](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Siege+Rhino) at the center. The idea is to use [Siege Rhino](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Siege+Rhino)'s enters-the-battlefield ability repeatedly to run your opponents' life totals low. I love [Syphon Soul](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Syphon+Soul) and its variants, so it is hardly surprising that I want to try and abuse [Siege Rhino](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Siege+Rhino).


Part of the deck is trying to give +1/+1 counters to the creatures, and another part of the deck is trying to flicker creatures, which would cause the creatures to lose the counters. Normally, this would be a real problem, but the only creature that is getting flickered is [Siege Rhino](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Siege+Rhino), and possibly a creature that was about to die anyway, so the contradiction between the themes isn't deadly.


[Flickerform](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flickerform) lets us flicker the Rhino on each player's turn, assuming we have the four mana available to make it happen. I looked at [Cloudshift](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloudshift) and decided I wanted a way to flicker the creature more than once, so [Flickerform](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flickerform) made the cut over [Cloudshift](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloudshift).





[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Restoration Angel)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Restoration Angel)
The deck needs more ways to deal with fliers and [Restoration Angel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Restoration+Angel) is a 3/4 flying creature that has flash, so it fills that void, all while offering another way to flicker the [Siege Rhino](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Siege+Rhino). I expect this will not work as well as extort, but even if it is only activated three or four times, that is a 9–12 point life loss for each of your opponents. This could get very ugly very fast. If all that happens with the [Siege Rhino](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Siege+Rhino) is that it forces your opponents to concentrate their efforts on getting rid of the [Siege Rhino](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Siege+Rhino), it means the other cards in your deck will be free to become misery to your opponents.


Where does the deck sit now?

A nine-card [Siege Rhino](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Siege+Rhino) package with the rest of the deck racing to overwhelm your opponents with +1/+1 counters. [Forgotten Ancient](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forgotten+Ancient) can get all the +1/+1 counters you will need all on its own, spreading them to all your creatures or just loading up Vish Kal to kill a particularly large opposing creature.


As always, I'm interested to hear your take on the deck. Drop me an email at [mtgseriousfun@gmail.com](mailto:mtgseriousfun@gmail.com) and make some suggestions to improve the deck. Abzan has so many options, allowing it to swing one way or the other, that I have no doubt others will have better ideas to bring this deck to where we want it to go.
