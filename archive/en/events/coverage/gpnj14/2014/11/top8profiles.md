**Age:** 20  
**Hometown:** Germany   
**Occupation:** Student  
  

**Previous *Magic* Accomplishments:** 
  
Top 8 GP Paris, Top 64 GP Strasbourg.
 



**What did you play this weekend, and why?**
  
I've been playing Miracles since GP Ghent, improving it further and further which led to my Top 8 in Paris and now here in New Jersey. The deck is insane.
 



**What was your record on Day 1 and Day 2?**
  
8-1, 5-0-1.
 



**What, if anything, would you have done differently with your deck for this weekend, and why?**
  
Deck is practically perfected!
 



**Which card in your sideboard exceeded your expectations this weekend, and why?**
  
None, because I knew which place they had. Red/[Blue Elemental Blast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blue+Elemental+Blast) and Snapcaster are pretty amazing, though.
 



**Were you cruisin' or are you bruisin' this weekend?**
  
Toppin'!
