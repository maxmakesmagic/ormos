Today's Magic Arcana is proud to introduce Jake Theis with a special announcement. 





### Two Tickets to Paradise!


![Jake Theis](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/mtgcom/arcana1000/1013_jaketheis.jpg)*Jake Theis, your new best buddy*Wow…I thought I would go my whole life without making an Eddie Money reference. I was wrong. For those of you who don’t know me, I’m Jake Theis, an Assistant Brand Manager for **Magic**, a Deckspert, and soon-to-be your best buddy. You see, [Pro Tour Hawaii](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=protour/honolulu06/facts) is coming up, and I can’t attend (sigh). But this awful news for me means good things for you, the loyal **Magic** fan. 


Beginning today, February 13, we here at **magicthegathering.com** are going to start an absolutely free, last-minute contest to send you and a buddy to PT: Hawaii. You will receive free roundtrip airfare, free hotel accommodations, a behind-the-scenes look at the Pro Tour, entrance into the swanky, exclusive Pro Player Lounge, free admission to a dozen side events, and a $50 gift bag from our Retail Pro Shop. Not bad for entering in your name and clicking a mouse, huh? 


While you can’t compete in the Pro Tour itself, I think you’ll find something to do in this tropical paradise. 


Don’t wait to enter, because this contest ends in one week. Do to the compressed timeframe of this sweepstakes, entrance is open only to U.S. citizens over 18 years old. [Read the official rules here.](/en/articles/archive/sweepstakes-official-rules-2006-02-13) Good luck, and when you return, let me know what an awesome trip I missed… 



**We're sorry, this contest has ended.**
