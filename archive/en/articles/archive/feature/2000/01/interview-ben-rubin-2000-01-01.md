**Name:** Ben Rubin  
**Age:** 17  
**Home:** San Fransisco


Ben Rubin has four PT top 8 finishes to his credit, two of them this year. Unfortunately, Ben was in an accident Thursday night that saw him get prematurely eliminated from the National Championship picture. We sat down with Ben to talk about the accident, how he's feeling, and who he sees doing well this weekend.


**Well, first of all, how are you feeling?**


I'm feeling ok, eating's a bit of a problem though, and I have to take various anti-inflammatory drugs to keep the swelling down, but otherwise things are ok.


**Do you want to explain to our readers why it is I'm asking how you're doing?**


On Thursday night, I played some b-ball with some of my PT friends and was going up for a rebound. Brian Hacker, who was on my team decided to go for it also and his elbow sort of knocked my tooth out of its socket....I bled a lot...went to the hospital where I haqd to wait a while, and the Doctor pushed my tooth back in its socket (no drugs!!!) and sent me home with a prescription. Then, this morning, I had to call for an oral surgeon to reinstall my tooth properly because if I hadn't the tooth would have died and I would have needed a root canal. Since the Oral surgeons weren't working last night, I had to miss the first draft, and therefore I missed US Nats.


**Will you ever play b-ball again?**


Yes. I really like Basketball.


**Have you forgiven Brian?**


Definitely, it was an accident. Brian's a good guy and we've been friends for most of my PT career. He's a lot of fun off the court.


  

The judges decided that you couldn't be admitted after the third round because it would set too much of a precedent for health related excuses. Any thoughts?


I think that according to the current floor rules, their decision was the only viable one. I wish that judges were more flexible in situations like this one, and more considerate to those players who travel across the country to attend events. I don't really feel I was wronged, but I think the floor rules need to be changed so that a player can compete in an event even if he's misses a round, especially in extenuating circumstances like this one.


**How do you think you would have done?**


I felt pretty good about my constructed deck.


**Can I ask what it was?**


Nope, friends of mine may still play the deck.


**Top secret stuff huh?**


Nothing too revolutionary, but it should be interesting to see how it does.


**How do you think you would have done in the draft portion?**


I feel good about my play skills, but I have to admit I wasn't too familiar with Prophecy.


**Do you like what you've seen?**


So far it seems like the colors in this format are as close in power as they've ever been.


**And that's a good thing?** 


It makes for a more diverse playing field, with many different color combos instead of your basic RG on UW archetypes


**OK, since you're now relegated to the role of observer, who do you think is going to do well this weekend?**


Well, since Jon Finkel is 6-0 in the draft portion, I have a hard time believing he won't make top 8?


**Does that mean he'll make the team?**


Once you get to top 8, you never know.


**OK, who else is going to do well?**


Look for Igor Frayman and Dave Price to do surprisingly well.


**So, no Jumblers?**


I'm not too sure. Most of my boys are not in contention.


**OK, this all said, who is your next national champion?**


Jon Finkel. He may still be the best.


**Ok, Thanks a lot for your time Ben.** 


Np.(NO PROBLEM)


**Good luck at worlds.**
