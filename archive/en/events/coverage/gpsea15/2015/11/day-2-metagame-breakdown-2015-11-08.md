 Stybs has played Magic the world over, writing and drafting as part of the event coverage team and slinging Commander everywhere his decks will fit. 






Legacy is a format that finds room for every type of player. While there are powerful decks that form guideposts to the expectations for the metagame, there’s ample room to bring interesting choices players love.


Take for example the Day 2 metagame breakdown from Grand Prix Seattle-Tacoma:




|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Archetype** | **Count** | **% Day 2** |
| Shardless Sultai | 30 | 13.7% |
| Jeskai Miracles | 21 | 9.6% |
| Sultai Delver | 17 | 7.8% |
| Death and Taxes | 15 | 6.8% |
| Elves | 12 | 5.5% |
| Grixis Delver | 12 | 5.5% |
| Temur Delver | 12 | 5.5% |
| Lands | 11 | 5.0% |
| Ad Nauseam Tendrils | 10 | 4.6% |
| Burn | 10 | 4.6% |
| Reanimator | 10 | 4.6% |
| Sneak and Show | 9 | 4.1% |
| Infect | 6 | 2.7% |
| Jund | 6 | 2.7% |

| Blue-Red Delver | 2 | 0.9% |
| Esper Mentor | 2 | 0.9% |
| Food Chain | 2 | 0.9% |

| Blue-Red Burn | 1 | 0.5% |
| Dragon Prison | 1 | 0.5% |
| Four-Color Delver | 1 | 0.5% |
| Goblin Prison | 1 | 0.5% |
| Hypergenesis | 1 | 0.5% |
| Oops! (All Spells) | 1 | 0.5% |
| **TOTAL** | **219** | **100.0%** |

Even rolling things up doesn’t consolidate things much:




|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Archetype** | **Count** | **% Day 2** |
| Delver (All Types) | 42 | 19.2% |
| Shardless Sultai | 30 | 13.7% |
| Jeskai Miracles | 21 | 9.6% |
| Death and Taxes | 15 | 6.8% |
| Burn (All Types) | 12 | 5.5% |
| Elves | 12 | 5.5% |
| Lands | 11 | 5.0% |
| Ad Nauseam Tendrils | 10 | 4.6% |
| Reanimator | 10 | 4.6% |
| Sneak and Show | 9 | 4.1% |
| Stoneblade (All Types) | 9 | 4.1% |
| All Others | 38 | 17.4% |
| **TOTAL** | **219** | **100.0%** |

While the potency of Miracles – the Jeskai version now defining all the Miracles archetype overall – was the talk of the town in a post-[Dig Through Time](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dig+Through+Time) Legacy world, it was [Delver of Secrets](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Delver+of+Secrets) and [Shardless Agent](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shardless+Agent) that have returned in spades.


While the Delver decks covered a variety of angles – from [Young Pyromancer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Young+Pyromancer) meets [Gurmag Angler](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gurmag+Angler) Grixis to [Tarmogoyf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf) meets [Lightning Bolt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt) Temur and [Abrupt Decay](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Abrupt+Decay) meets [Tasigur, the Golden Fang](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tasigur%2C+the+Golden+Fang) Sultai – the common thread connecting them all was a stockpile of Legacy's best one- and two-mana instants and sorceries to back up a turn one [Delver of Secrets](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Delver+of+Secrets). Death by [Insectile Aberration](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Insectile+Aberration) was a common theme throughout Day 1.


Shardless Sultai was similar to many Delver builds – [Brainstorm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brainstorm)s and removal – but layers in things like [Ancestral Vision](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ancestral+Vision)s and [Baleful Strix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Baleful+Strix) to provide resources and removal while setting up their endgame, often leading up to a [Jace, the Mind Sculptor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace%2C+the+Mind+Sculptor) set to ultimate.


Miracles of course had made a splash, presenting [Counterbalance](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterbalance)-meets-[Sensei's Divining Top](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sensei%27s+Divining+Top) throughout the day as well. Close behind included Death and Taxes, Burn, Elves, Lands and [Ad Nauseam](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=174915) [Tendrils](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=383125), all staples that never seemed to truly dwindle at large Legacy events.


Buried deep in the Day 2 breakdown were some fascinating gems as well. Patrick Chapin and Matt Spering, together in collaboration with Tom Martell, both made Day 2 with a unique twist on Esper built around [Monastery Mentor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Monastery+Mentor). [Aluren](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aluren) and Goblin Prison – [Blood Moon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Moon) and [Trinisphere](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Trinisphere) meets [Goblin Settler](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Settler)s into [Siege-Gang Commander](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Siege-Gang+Commander) – went undefeated alongside a 12 Post deck that can cast impressive and expensive threats like [Emrakul, the Aeons Torn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Emrakul%2C+the+Aeons+Torn) and [Karn Liberated](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Karn+Liberated).


With staples and off-the-radar choices leading the way it was still any deck's tournament to take.
