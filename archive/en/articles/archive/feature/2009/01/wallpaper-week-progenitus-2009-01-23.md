This week's desktop wallpaper is Jaime Jones's **Progenitus** from the upcoming *Conflux* set (as seen on the [*Conflux* Product Section](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/tcg/Products.aspx?x=mtg/tcg/products/conflux)). We looked at the sketches in [yesterday's Arcana](/en/articles/archive/sketches-progenitus-2009-01-22), and thought it would be nice to look at it even larger! Enjoy.
