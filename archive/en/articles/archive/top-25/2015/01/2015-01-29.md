Welcome to another look at the *Magic* Top 25 Pro Rankings. This is the second week running without any premier events, and that has given our ranked players—and more than 400 others—the chance to fully digest the implications of *Fate Reforged* for both Limited and Modern rounds at the forthcoming Pro Tour *Fate Reforged* in Washington, DC. That, however, is still more than a week away, and in between there's a double-header Grand Prix weekend to savor, and while both locations focus on Limited action, they're going to provide very different experiences.



In Mexico City, there's a traditional Limited Grand Prix to be had, featuring Sealed Deck on Day One and switching to *Fate Reforged*/*Khans of Tarkir* Booster Draft for those who make it to Sunday. Normally, we might expect several of our ranked players to be there, but that might not be true this time around. First, some of the best players plan to skip the opportunity for pro points at the GP level, instead focusing on the massive jackpot of points, prestige, and cash that is the Pro Tour.



Then there's our second offering: Grand Prix San Jose in California. Once again the format is Limited, but this time it's *Team* Limited. Some of the finest trios ever to line up across a table will be on show, and there'll be plenty of eyes on No. 21 Paul Rietzl. He's joining David Williams and Matt Sperling in a bid to defend the team title they won in San Jose back in 2012. Rietzl, one of the most devoted sports fans out there, must be serious, if he's planning on spending his Sunday evening winning a trophy, rather than watching his beloved New England Patriots try to claim theirs in the Super Bowl.



Wherever our ranked players show up, they're headed for a serious shakeup in the table. For all the news from Mexico City and San Jose, join us again next week at the home of the *Magic* Top 25 Pro Rankings.
