Day 2 Coverage



Andrew Cuneo is your Grand Prix Richmond Champion! Piloting Miracles, a deck firmly in his control wheelhouse, the longtime player navigated the Top 8 on the back of powerful counterspells and Jace, the Mind Sculptor. However it was Back to Basics, which shut down his Lands opponent in the finals, that sealed the deal.


We had 15 amazing rounds of Legacy following Reid Duke and his quest to improve his standing in the Player of the Year Race. Tomorrow we get to come back and watch the other two contenders - Seth Manfield and Luis Salvatto - battle it out in Standard. We’ll be back at 9am on twitch.tv/magic.
