Newly Added Known Issues

**General**


* Creatures with variable power and toughness such as [Crackling Drake](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crackling+Drake) are not correctly updated in the reveal zone.
* Certain effect shields, such as the indestructible one created by [Gideon Jura](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gideon+Jura), sometimes display slightly longer than they should.
* The "Draw a Card" button does not function if a player loses due to running out of time.

**Gameplay**


* [Pili-Pala](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pili-Pala) can incorrectly pay for its own untap ability by tapping to use the ability granted by [Grand Architect](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grand+Architect).
* [Porphyry Nodes](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Porphyry+Nodes) allows a creature to regenerate if it's tied for the least power.

Known Issues List
-----------------






The following is a list of known issues on *Magic Online*. Our goal with the known issues list is to give players insight into what we're working on, as well as helping players avoid problematic bugs and performance issues.


Please note, this is not a comprehensive list of known issues; it simply contains the ones that we feel players are most likely to encounter. If you're curious behind the specific rationale of which issues are included, we talk a little bit more about it [here](http://wizardsmtgo.tumblr.com/post/139554007099/brandon-and-the-bug-blog#notes).


[REPORT A BUG](http://wizards.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/668/~/magic-online%3A-report-an-issue)



The *Magic Online* known issues list is divided up into several categories.


Client and Gameplay known issues are based around the client and broad mechanical interactions. Each known issue is also sorted by where you're likely to encounter it within the client; those categories are listed below. You can search the below table by keyword, or click each header to sort alphabetically.


**Categories:** Collection, Deck Building, Duel Scene, General, Leagues, Play Lobby, and Trade.


Cardset known issues are based around specific cards or groups of cards that are not working as intended.

To identify this creature, players can point their cursor to the name of the token in the game log entry that identifies the attacking creatures and locate the creature that no longer has a blocking creature associated with it. | Duel Scene |
| Ongoing | Some cards with the madness ability do not display the correct reminder text. Notably, this includes [Fiery Temper](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fiery+Temper). | Cardset (General) |
| Ongoing | [Odric, Lunarch Marshal](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Odric%2C+Lunarch+Marshal)'s triggered ability ignores the hexproof ability on a creature if it only has it temporarily. | Cardset (Standard) |
| Ongoing | When some cards with madness are discarded, the triggered ability does not display the madness cost while on the stack. Players can find this information by right-clicking the card or by viewing the game log. | Cardset (General) |
| Ongoing | Abilities that trigger from a permanent becoming the target of a spell or ability (such as that of [Silverfur Partisan](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Silverfur+Partisan)) are not triggered by copies of spells automatically put onto the stack. For example: if a player controls [Zada, Hedron Grinder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Zada%2C+Hedron+Grinder) and casts a spell on Zada, when Zada's triggered ability resolves, the player will be prompted to choose targets for the copies made by Zada. If the player chooses targets for the copies individually, [Silverfur Partisan](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Silverfur+Partisan)'s ability will trigger correctly. If the player clicks OK to automatically choose the targets, the Partisan's ability won't trigger. | Cardset (Standard) |

As this change in template was not a functional change, these tokens continue to function correctly. | Cardset (Standard, Modern) |
| Ongoing | Cards that require a player to remove any number of +1/+1 counters (such as [Retribution of the Ancients](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Retribution+of+the+Ancients) or [Ooze Flux](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ooze+Flux)) incorrectly do not allow a player to remove any counters. | Cardset (Standard) |

| Ongoing | Abilities that generate replacement effects preventing specific cards from being put into graveyards (such as those found on [Progenitus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Progenitus) or [Blightsteel Colossus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blightsteel+Colossus)) do not function properly while resolving [Grenzo, Dungeon Warden](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grenzo%2C+Dungeon+Warden)'s activated ability. | Cardset (Commander) |
| Ongoing | If a permanent enters the battlefield as a copy of a permanent that had a choice made as it entered (such as [Door of Destinies](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Door+of+Destinies) or [Painter's Servant](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Painter%27s+Servant)), the copy correctly allows the controller to make a new choice, but the abilities of the copy that refer to that choice do not function correctly. | Cardset (Commander) |
| Ongoing | If [Deceiver of Form](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deceiver+of+Form)'s triggered ability turns creatures into copies of a legendary creature, the legend rule fails to apply to the copies. | Cardset (Commander, Limited, Standard) |

Players can still activate these abilities at any time that player has priority. | Cardset (Modern, Standard) |

Workaround: you must start by ordering blockers for the left-most attacking creature, then hit OK to move on to the next attacking creature to the right. | Duel Scene |
| Ongoing | When face-down cards are given an activated ability, the art displays incorrectly on the stack when that ability is activated. | Duel Scene |
| Ongoing | When casting a spell, if there is any mana already in the player's pool, the most recently produced colored mana is automatically applied to the spell first. For example, if a player taps a [Cavern of Souls](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cavern+of+Souls) (naming Human), then an Island, then casts [Delver of Secrets](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Delver+of+Secrets), the blue mana applied to the Delver's mana cost will be that from the Island. If the player tapped the Island, then the Cavern, the Cavern's mana would be applied to the spell, and it would be appropriately uncounterable. | Duel Scene |
| Ongoing | While paying the mana cost for a card with delve, players cannot remove cards from the delve selection without canceling the casting process and starting over. | Duel Scene |
| Ongoing | If a player makes a selection, then reverses that selection with the "undo" keyboard shortcut (default: CTRL+Z), the game log will sometimes incorrectly show both cards the player selected.
