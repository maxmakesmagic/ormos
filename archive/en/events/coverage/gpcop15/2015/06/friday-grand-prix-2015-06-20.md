A Grand Prix is the ultimate *Magic* experience. Although the main tournament takes place on Saturday and Sunday, the hall is open for three days, and there is already a wide array of side events and shows on Friday.


Let us take you through some of the highlights!

Side events are firing all day. If you win a last-chance Grand Prix Trial, you score two byes for the main event. And if you beat a member of team ChannelFireball in the Foiled Again Bounty Event, you won 100 prize tix to exchange at the prize wall. And bragging rights, of course.

Several pro players were available for spell slinging on Friday. If you beat them in a game of Modern, you would win a booster! They were happy to sign cards and playmats as well.

If you want to have your cards signed, or are looking for other goodies like art prints or a custom drawing on your playmat, there are quite a few artists too, of course!

To provide last minute expert advice before the Grand Prix, *Magic* Pro Tour Hall of Fame members Ben Stark and William "Huey" Jensen covered the Modern format in detail ...

... and in the evening, there's Richard Hagon's Game Show which always draws quite the crowd, and justifiably so. Can you name the eleven cards with the words "Den" and "Mark" in their name? Can you? Well, then you definitely should have played in this Denmark edition of Rich's trivia contest and would have been able to win some cool prizes!

Next time you attend a Grand Prix, don't miss out on the full Friday experience!
