Warriors are anything but subtle. They have four main ways of announcing their presence: roaring, smashing, hurling axes, and killing people. *Morningtide*'s Warrior enablers show exactly that in-your-face aggression, from [Bramblewood Paragon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bramblewood+Paragon) to [Obsidian Battle-Axe](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Obsidian+Battle-Axe) to [Vengeful Firebrand](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vengeful+Firebrand) and more. But remembering which creatures are Warriors and which are not actually is a little subtle. After all, *Lorwyn* was designed to focus attention exclusively on "race" creature types like Kithkin and Merfolk while glossing over "class" creature types like Warrior. *Time Spiral* and *Ravnica* blocks also have very little "class matters," making it even easier to forget who is a Warrior and who isn't. You might not even realize [Stingscourger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stingscourger) is a warrior until he jumps out and whales on you with that awesome man'o'war'o'nine'tails. So in honor of Warrior Week, I'd like to shine some light on the Hidden Warriors of **Magic**, whose creature types have been hiding in plain sight.


### The Hidden Warrior Lord


Let's start with the reasons to build warrior decks in the first place. Many cards in *Morningtide* can be used to match any tribal deck you want, including [Door of Destinies](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Door+of+Destinies), [Roar of the Crowd](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Roar+of+the+Crowd), and others. But what rewards do warrior decks get all to themselves? Combat is definitely the focus, with power-pumping, haste, and trample galore. In *Morningtide* alone:


* [Bramblewood Paragon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bramblewood+Paragon) makes your Warriors bigger and tramplier.
* [Brighthearth Banneret](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brighthearth+Banneret) makes your Warriors bigger or cheaper.
* [Obsidian Battle-Axe](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Obsidian+Battle-Axe) makes your Warriors bigger and hastier.
* [Boldwyr Intimidator](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Boldwyr+Intimidator) makes your Warriors unblockable while calling out cowards.
* [Unstoppable Ash](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Unstoppable+Ash) champions a Warrior and makes all your creatures more, well, unstoppable.
* Warriors make [Winnower Patrol](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Winnower+Patrol) and [Mudbutton Clanger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mudbutton+Clanger) bigger.
* And [Vengeful Firebrand](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vengeful+Firebrand) gets high-power hasty revenge for your Warriors who have bravely died in battle.


![Lovisa Coldeyes](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Lovisa+Coldeyes)

There's also a key hidden Warrior in standard that's very easy to miss, even though she's a potent hidden Warrior lord: [Lovisa Coldeyes](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lovisa+Coldeyes) gives all other Warriors, Berserkers, and Barbarians +2/+2 and haste. Wait, *all* Warriors?

During *Coldsnap* development we debated back and forth whether [Lovisa Coldeyes](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lovisa+Coldeyes) should help *all* players' Warriors, Berserkers, and Barbarians (like [Goblin King](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+King) helps all players' Goblins) or whether she should just help your own. I was on the latter side. I argued that it was just plain annoying for your own lords to help your opponent's creatures, as well as incomprehensible in flavor. But other developers on the *Coldsnap* team maintained that in the Age of *Ice Age*, all creature type lords had helped both players. Since we were already doing tons of *Ice Age* mechanics in the set, we should be true to *Ice Age* with the lords too. [Field Marshal](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Field+Marshal) was also part of the debate. If we were going to finish the [Goblin King](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+King), [Lord of Atlantis](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lord+of+Atlantis), [Elvish Champion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elvish+Champion), [Lord of the Undead](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lord+of+the+Undead) super-cycle with [Field Marshal](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Field+Marshal), the other side argued, we had better make [Field Marshal](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Field+Marshal)'s text box line up with the other four.


As the debate heated up, the key moment arrived when I rhetorically demanded of the other developers "What kind of lord inspires the *enemies* she's fighting to *kill her*??" I saw a gleam in someone's eye, and knew that I had made a fatal mistake. Another developer exclaimed triumphantly: "The *Barbarian Berserker* lord!" Checkmate. I could not recover from that crushing verbal coup de grace. I lost the debate, and Lovisa and [Field Marshal](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Field+Marshal) help all your opponents' guys too.


I gotta admit, I still believe I was right, and I'm glad I got the chance to revisit the issue by making the *Lorwyn* race lords like [Imperious Perfect](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Imperious+Perfect) and [Merrow Reejerey](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Merrow+Reejerey) help just your own Elves and Merfolk.


When we see an opportunity for a change that doesn't match the past, but will improve **Magic** for the long term (like making race lords affect just your own creatures), I firmly believe we have to take it, even if it leads to uncomfortable transitions like having [Goblin King](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+King) not matching a theoretical "*Your* other soldier creatures get +1/+1 and first strike" version of [Field Marshal](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Field+Marshal) when they're both in *Tenth Edition*. It's worthwhile to make it through those uncomfortable transitions in the short term to keep making **Magic** better for the long term. Because if we keep doing things all the old ways to match all our old mediocre precedents, we just end up building additional mediocre precedents that make it even harder to break away in the future.


Switching from Alpha rules (with their "interrupts" and insane special damage prevention timing steps) to the cleaner, unified *Sixth Edition* rules was a very uncomfortable transition, but in retrospect it was very clearly worth it.


[Jeska, Warrior Adept](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Jeska%252C%2BWarrior%2BAdept)Transitioning from the old days of [Elvish Warrior](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elvish+Warrior) being "Creature – Elf" in *Onslaught* to the modern "Creature – Elf Warrior" race/class model of the [Elvish Warrior](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elvish+Warrior) in *Ninth Edition* and *Morningtide* required a wide-ranging [Creature Type Update](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/feature/424a3) (and an [update to the update](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/feature/440a)) that can be an uncomfortable transition. But every time you play [Elvish Warrior](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elvish+Warrior) with a [Bramblewood Paragon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bramblewood+Paragon) out, or any other Warriors-matters card for the rest of time, I think you'll find it's totally worth it. Before the creature type update, if you had an [Obsidian Battle-Axe](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Obsidian+Battle-Axe) out and played [Jeska, Warrior Adept](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jeska%2C+Warrior+Adept), you couldn't equip the Axe to her for free because despite being called "[Jeska, Warrior Adept](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jeska%2C+Warrior+Adept)," she wasn't "officially" a Warrior. Now that the creature type update has gone through, [Jeska, Warrior Adept](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jeska%2C+Warrior+Adept) is officially a Warrior in the game, and she can pick up the [Obsidian Battle-Axe](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Obsidian+Battle-Axe) and go to 5/2 haste first strike town.


### Tribal Warriors


A whopping five of *Lorwyn*'s eight race tribes include a lot more Warriors than you might expect. If you start picking out the Warriors in a particular race, you can often make a deck that benefits from both race tribal synergies and warrior tribal synergies at the same time.


**Warrior Treefolk**


For example, these creatures you may think of as Treefolk are actually Treefolk Warriors:




|  |
| --- |
| [Battlewand Oak](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Battlewand+Oak) |
| [Dauntless Dourbark](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dauntless+Dourbark) |
| [Timber Protector](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Timber+Protector) |
| [Cloudcrown Oak](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloudcrown+Oak) |
| [Oakgnarl Warrior](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oakgnarl+Warrior) |
| [Oaken Brawler](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oaken+Brawler) |
| [Sentry Oak](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sentry+Oak) |
| [Unstoppable Ash](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Unstoppable+Ash) |
| [Indomitable Ancients](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Indomitable+Ancients) |
| [Ambassador Oak](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ambassador+Oak) |

[Battlewand Oak](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Battlewand+Oak), [Dauntless Dourbark](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dauntless+Dourbark), and [Timber Protector](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Timber+Protector) already form a tribal core, and now [Obsidian Battle-Axe](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Obsidian+Battle-Axe) and friends can join the party.


**Warrior Elementals**


Likewise, many of the humanoid Elementals are not just Elementals, but actually Elemental Warriors:




|  |
| --- |
| [Flamekin Bladewhirl](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flamekin+Bladewhirl) |
| [Nova Chaser](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nova+Chaser) |
| [Vengeful Firebrand](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vengeful+Firebrand) |
| [Brighthearth Banneret](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brighthearth+Banneret) |
| [Ceaseless Searblades](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ceaseless+Searblades) |
| [Flamekin Brawler](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flamekin+Brawler) |
| [Flaring Flame-Kin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flaring+Flame-Kin) |
| [Inner-Flame Igniter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inner-Flame+Igniter) |
| [Seething Pathblazer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seething+Pathblazer) |
| [Petrified Wood-Kin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Petrified+Wood-Kin) |
| [Root-Kin Ally](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Root-Kin+Ally) |

Again, [Flamekin Bladewhirl](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flamekin+Bladewhirl) and [Nova Chaser](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nova+Chaser) focus on Elemental synergy while supporting Warrior-matters, [Vengeful Firebrand](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vengeful+Firebrand) focuses on Warrior synergy while supporting Elemental-matters, and [Brighthearth Banneret](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brighthearth+Banneret) brings out both.


**Warrior Elves**


Boosted by the creature type update, Elves boast a large array of powerful warriors, including many Elf legends from the modern [Nath of the Gilt-Leaf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nath+of+the+Gilt-Leaf), [Rhys the Exiled](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rhys+the+Exiled), and [Radha, Heir to Keld](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Radha%2C+Heir+to+Keld), through *Ravnica*'s awesomely fun [Tolsimir Wolfblood](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tolsimir+Wolfblood), back to the old-school [Eladamri, Lord of Leaves](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eladamri%2C+Lord+of+Leaves) and even [Marhault Elsdragon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Marhault+Elsdragon). All of these Elves are also Elf Warriors:




|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| [Imperious Perfect](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Imperious+Perfect) | [Marhault Elsdragon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Marhault+Elsdragon) |
| [Wren’s Run Vanquisher](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wren%E2%80%99s+Run+Vanquisher) | [Nath of the Gilt-Leaf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nath+of+the+Gilt-Leaf) |
| [Bramblewood Paragon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bramblewood+Paragon) | [Nath’s Elite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nath%E2%80%99s+Elite) |
| [Wren’s Run Packmaster](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wren%E2%80%99s+Run+Packmaster) | [Norwood Warrior](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Norwood+Warrior) |
| [Allosaurus Rider](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Allosaurus+Rider) | [Radha, Heir to Keld](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Radha%2C+Heir+to+Keld) |
| [Elvish Vanguard](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elvish+Vanguard) | [Rhys the Exiled](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rhys+the+Exiled) |
| [Lys Alana Huntmaster](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lys+Alana+Huntmaster) | [Tel-Jilad Chosen](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tel-Jilad+Chosen) |
| [Winnower Patrol](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Winnower+Patrol) | [Tel-Jilad Outrider](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tel-Jilad+Outrider) |
| [Elvish Warrior](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elvish+Warrior) | [Tolsimir Wolfblood](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tolsimir+Wolfblood) |
| [Civic Wayfinder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Civic+Wayfinder) | [Viridian Scout](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Viridian+Scout) |
| [Eladamri, Lord of Leaves](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eladamri%2C+Lord+of+Leaves) | [Viridian Zealot](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Viridian+Zealot) |
| [Elvish Handservant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elvish+Handservant) | [Warren-Scourge Elf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Warren-Scourge+Elf) |
| [Elvish Skysweeper](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elvish+Skysweeper) | [Wurmskin Forger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wurmskin+Forger) |

Think about this Standard-legal start: Turn one: [Llanowar Elves](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Llanowar+Elves). Turn two: [Obsidian Battle-Axe](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Obsidian+Battle-Axe), pitch two green cards, play an [Allosaurus Rider](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Allosaurus+Rider), attack on turn two with a 5/4 haste that's going to keep growing from there. Now that's some Elf-and-Warrior synergy.


**Warrior Giants**



![Obsidian Battle-Axe](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Obsidian+Battle-Axe)

Among the Treefolk, Elementals, and Elves, we've already seen many warriors-who-are-giant, but there are also a lot of Giant Warriors. Besides benefitting from Giant enablers and Warrior enablers, the recurring element here is being totally insane with everyone's favorite [Obsidian Battle-Axe](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Obsidian+Battle-Axe). [Brion Stoutarm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brion+Stoutarm) attacks on turn four as a 6/5 with lifelink. Next turn, you can play another Giant Warrior, pass the Axe to that guy, swing with him for 7ish damage, then use [Brion Stoutarm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brion+Stoutarm) to hurl that 7-power Giant, dealing another 7 damage and gaining 7 life. If you play [Cloudgoat Ranger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloudgoat+Ranger) and equip the axe, his kithkin buddies can send him to the air, letting you attack with a 7/4 Flying Haste creature that gave you three 1/1s to boot.

[Stonehewer Giant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stonehewer+Giant) fetches the Axe, or if you already have it, attacks with haste as a 6/5... who then pulls a second Equipment out of his hat and pops it on. [Hearthcage Giant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hearthcage+Giant) and [Borderland Behemoth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Borderland+Behemoth) are expensive unless you have [Stinkdrinker Daredevil](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stinkdrinker+Daredevil)(s), but they can easily attack with haste with the Axe for 13 or 14 damage. [Blind-Spot Giant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blind-Spot+Giant) becomes a 6/4 haste for ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161225105850im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless2.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227130159im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/red.gif), while [Countryside Crusher](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Countryside+Crusher) is a 5/4 haste that grows and improves your draws for ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20211201201921im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless1.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227130159im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/red.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227130159im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/red.gif). [Sunrise Sovereign](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sunrise+Sovereign) provides an Axe-like pumping bonus to all of his Giant Warrior friends in addition to picking up the Axe himself. [Lovisa Coldeyes](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lovisa+Coldeyes) (that old Battle-Axe...) does a great imitation of a Battle-Axe by giving any of these Giant Warriors +2/+2 and haste, providing backup redundancy in case you don't draw the Equipment.


[Hammerfist Giant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hammerfist+Giant) is especially awesome with [Obsidian Battle-Axe](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Obsidian+Battle-Axe). He comes out, grabs the Axe for free, then hastily pounds the ground to deal 4 damage to each creature without flying. This ability is way better when you can spring it without your opponents getting a turn to see it coming. And best of all, the additional toughness from the Axe means [Hammerfist Giant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hammerfist+Giant) lives through his own activation instead of dying.


[Gatherer](http://ww2.wizards.com/gatherer/) reveals this year's recipient of the "Who knew??" award for Giant Warriors. Recent research has uncovered that in **Magic**'s storylines, *Legends* legend [Bartel Runeaxe](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bartel+Runeaxe) is actually a Giant Warrior himself! While he can't be targeted by Auras, [Bartel Runeaxe](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bartel+Runeaxe) can still pick up (of course!) the latest Runeaxe and show you why he's a legend by attacking at 8/6 haste vigilance and still being available to block. Don't try to [Pacifism](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Pacifism) this guy.


Here are all the Giant Warriors:

**Warrior Goblins**


If goblins like anything as much as explosions, rocks, and fire, it's war. [Stingscourger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stingscourger) and [Mogg War Marshal](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mogg+War+Marshal) can attack with [Lovisa Coldeyes](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lovisa+Coldeyes) or [Obsidian Battle-Axe](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Obsidian+Battle-Axe) before paying echo. [Bloodshot Trainee](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodshot+Trainee) uses Lovisa or the Battle-Axe to go immediately to 4 power and hastily start bombing creatures out. Here is a swarm of Goblins who are also Warriors, led by explosive creature machine [Mogg War Marshal](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mogg+War+Marshal) and the notoriously vicious [Goblin Piledriver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Piledriver).

**Warrior Goat Snakes**


Of course, there are some Treefolk Elemental Elf Giant Goblin Warriors I left off of these lists. [Changeling Berserker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Changeling+Berserker), [Taurean Mauler](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Taurean+Mauler), [Woodland Changeling](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Woodland+Changeling), [Chameleon Colossus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chameleon+Colossus), [Avian Changeling](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Avian+Changeling), [Mirror Entity](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mirror+Entity), [Mutavault](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mutavault) and many of their friends can find a place in many Warrior decks, including those that combine Warrior synergies with racial ones.


### A Zombie and a Centaur Walk into a Deck...


Warriors are much more than a subset of existing race tribes. You can also combine all the most powerful Warriors from each of those tribes into a single deck. Then add powerful Warriors from Standard sets outside *Lorwyn*'s tribes. Some of the coolest include:




|  |
| --- |
| [Keldon Marauders](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Keldon+Marauders) |
| [Korlash, Heir to Blackblade](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Korlash%2C+Heir+to+Blackblade) |
| [Mirri, Cat Warrior](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mirri%2C+Cat+Warrior) |
| [Stonebrow, Krosan Hero](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stonebrow%2C+Krosan+Hero) |
| [Jedit Ojanen of Efrava](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jedit+Ojanen+of+Efrava) |
| [Nacatl War-Pride](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nacatl+War-Pride) |
| [Boreal Centaur](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Boreal+Centaur) |
| [Ghitu Encampment](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ghitu+Encampment) |

Giving Korlash, Stonebrow, Jedit or [Nacatl War-Pride](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nacatl+War-Pride) haste and increased size with Warrior enablers is awesome. With [Nacatl War-Pride](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nacatl+War-Pride), warrior power pumpers like [Bramblewood Paragon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bramblewood+Paragon) or [Lovisa Coldeyes](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lovisa+Coldeyes) pump all the token copies too! Since Stonebrow, Jedit, and [Nacatl War-Pride](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nacatl+War-Pride)’s abilities trigger when they attack, getting them to attack the turn they come out is especially sweet. And giving Jedit , the War-Pride, Korlash, or [Keldon Marauders](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Keldon+Marauders) trample is even better.


[Ghitu Encampment](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ghitu+Encampment) and its cycle almost got out the door for *Tenth Edition* without being updated from *Urza's Legacy* to gain a creature type when they were activated. Fortunately, editors and developers noticed in time how dumb it would be if an activated [Faerie Conclave](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Faerie+Conclave) did not count as a Faerie for [Scion of Oona](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scion+of+Oona) and so on, and we added a type to each one.

### Warriors of Old


I have to give a final shout-out to some cool Warrior interactions outside Standard and outside the *Lorwyn* races. [Sosuke, Son of Seshiro](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sosuke%2C+Son+of+Seshiro) is a classic Warrior lord from Kamigawa. Mons Johnson rightly noted that the abilities on [Sosuke, Son of Seshiro](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Sosuke%252C%2BSon%2Bof%2BSeshiro) seem backwards: shouldn't the poison ability come from being a *snake* and the power-pumping come from being a *warrior*, not the other way around? The thing is, [Sachi, Daughter of Seshiro](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sachi%2C+Daughter+of+Seshiro) really wanted to give her "![](https://web.archive.org/web/20170424152623im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/tap.gif): Add ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20220123123600im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/green.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20220123123600im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/green.gif) to your mana pool" ability to Shamans, not Snakes. And [Sosuke, Son of Seshiro](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Sosuke%252C%2BSon%2Bof%2BSeshiro) and [Sachi, Daughter of Seshiro](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Sachi%252C%2BDaughter%2Bof%2BSeshiro) really wanted to mirror each other. There was no perfect solution to this little SAT puzzle, and [Sosuke, Son of Seshiro](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Sosuke%252C%2BSon%2Bof%2BSeshiro) ended up taking a little flavor hit. The *Legends* legend [Hazezon Tamar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hazezon+Tamar) is a warrior who can make 7 1/1 (Sand) Warrior creature tokens. And [Rally the Horde](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rally+the+Horde) can rally up lots of 1/1 warriors eager to do your bidding.


### Last Week's Poll




| **Have you ever drafted something wacky in Magic, outside of the normal Set A-Set B-Set C block draft model?** |
| Yes | 3198 | 63.0% |
| No | 1878 | 37.0% |
| **Total** | **5076** | **100.0%** |

Cool—about two thirds have busted out the wacky drafts. A lot of play groups have house rules or weird formats they play, and I'm all for that. The point of **Magic** is that you can make it whatever game you want it to be. Usually people do that through building decks, but house rules, weird formats, and in-group banned & restricted lists are fun ways to customize it too.
