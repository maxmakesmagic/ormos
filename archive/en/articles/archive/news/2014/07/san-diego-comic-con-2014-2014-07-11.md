Blake is the content manager for DailyMTG.com, making him the one you should email if you have thoughts on the website, good or less good (or not good). He's a longtime coverage reporter and hasn't turned down a game of Magic in any format ever. 





*Magic* is headed back to [San Diego Comic-Con](http://www.comic-con.org/) this year, and while we love seeing the sites in California, we're most excited about what and who we're bringing to the convention. We've got some pretty exciting things going on at the con, so make sure to get to San Diego July 24–27, 2014, if you don't want to miss out!


The Panel



Saturday, July 26, 2014, noon–1 p.m., Room: 25ABC



Come to the *Magic* panel and get an exclusive sneak peek at *Khans of Tarkir*, *Magic*'s upcoming expansion set on the home plane of Sarkhan Vol! Mark Rosewater (*Magic* head designer) will moderate a panel featuring Mark Purvis (*Magic* director of global brand marketing), Doug Beyer (*Magic* senior creative designer), and Gavin Verhey (*Magic* designer). The panel will answer questions and discuss upcoming product releases, including an exclusive first look at upcoming releases and products.



The panel will be recorded and posted online after the event.

SDCC Exclusive


Once again, we'll be offering the premium black-on-black core set Planeswalkers, this time featuring the six Planeswalkers from Magic 2015. In an SDCC exclusive, you can purchase the six Planeswalker cards together with the NERF Garruk Axe for $120 (including tax) at the Hasbro Booth (#3329). A limited number of each item will also be available online at [HasbroToyShop.com](http://www.hasbrotoyshop.com/) following the convention. The exclusive Magic 2015 Planeswalker Pack featuring Garruk's Axe by NERF will be limited to one per person.


And if you do pick up some of the prettiest *Magic* cards ever printed, artist Jae Lee will be available to sign copies at the Hasbro booth, 9:30–10:30 a.m., Saturday, July 26.



*Magic* Gaming



Did you think we'd have *Magic* events and not let you actually play some *Magic*? Of course not!


Cascade Games will host events and tournaments all weekend long, from morning until night, in more formats and with more twists than we could possibly list here. Instead, head to the [Cascade Games events page]( http://www.cascadegames.com/events/984) that lists all of the options available Thursday through Sunday. There are events for everyone from beginners to veterans, from casual aficionados to the most ardent Legacy masters. If you like playing Magic, you'll find something (or many things) to love at SDCC.
