*Oath of the Gatewatch* gave players many new tools to work with in this draft format. With two booster packs of the small expansion being opened instead of the traditional one, now the small set matters so much more. Some of the old BFZ archetypes have improved while others become nonexistent. *Oath* adds many new archetypes all on its own. Here's a breakdown of what some of the pros drafted this weekend.


**Green**


Face-to-Face's (9) Mike Sigrist drafted a R/G/b deck with large creatures. “It's a creature-centric format. The creatures are just bigger than in BFZ,” he explained. Green has a lot of flexibility. It has great mana fixing and it's possible for your green deck to be three and even four colors. [Netcaster Spider](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Netcaster+Spider) and [Scion Summoner](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scion+Summoner) are the most important commons and [Seed Guardian](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seed+Guardian) is one of the more powerful uncommons. The reach creatures give the deck game against flyers which was something that green struggled with in BFZ. [Scion Summoner](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scion+Summoner) acts as the ramp spell you need to get your bigger creatures out quicker.

Shuhei Nakamura had a more aggressive version of red-green and chose not to splash a color. He was heavier in red with burn spells like [Touch of the Void](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Touch+of+the+Void) and [Fall of the Titans](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fall+of+the+Titans). With multiple copies of [Scion Summoner](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scion+Summoner), a [Brood Monitor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brood+Monitor) and a [From Beyond](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=From+Beyond), he had a nice go-wide strategy. Typically green go-wide decks in this format are looking for lots of token producers and finishers like [Tajuru Warcaller](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tajuru+Warcaller) and [Tajuru Beastmaster](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tajuru+Beastmaster).

**Cohort Allies**


The Ally deck can go in a few directions. There's black-white, which still focuses on life gain and hasn't changed much from BFZ. Greg Orange from Team Hotsauce Games drafted this archetype today. “I'm not too happy with my deck. It's missing a lot of synergy that black-white usually has. The best common is [Vampire Envoy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vampire+Envoy) but I didn't get any of him. I also really like [Kor Sky Climber](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kor+Sky+Climber) in the deck.” Greg was fortunate enough to open [Linvala, the Preserver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Linvala%2C+the+Preserver) in his draft which he hopes to win most of his games with.

ChannelFireball's (4) Eric Froehlich drafted a more aggressive version of Cohort Allies. “I drafted red-white. I like my deck, but I like black-white better.” In this deck, it's less important to have synergy and more important to have a tight mana curve. The two-drop allies with cohort, [Ondu War Cleric](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ondu+War+Cleric) and [Zada's Commando](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Zada%27s+Commando), are the best commons. They beat down early but also offer utility in the late game. In *Battle for Zendikar*, you're looking for creatures with rally like [Firemantle Mage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Firemantle+Mage) and [Resolute Archangel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Resolute+Archangel). “[Resolute Archangel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Resolute+Archangel) is better than most rares,” says Froehlich.

**Colorless and Devoid**


Colorless mana is a prominent theme in *Oath of the Gatewatch*. It's heavily in blue, black and red but touches the other colors as well. If you're going to draft heavy colorless mana, you're very likely going to be drafting blue-black.


Neil Oliver of Team Face-to-Face drafted one of the more interesting blue-black decks. He has four [Blinding Drone](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blinding+Drone)s which requires a lot of colorless mana but he's also splashing green for [Birthing Hulk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Birthing+Hulk). “I love this guy,” says Neil about [Birthing Hulk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Birthing+Hulk). “The splash is free. All of my nonbasic lands produce every color.” Neil had multiple copies of [Unknown Shores](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Unknown+Shores) and [Holdout Settlement](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Holdout+Settlement). He's playing six colorless sources and is relatively happy about it, and he wasn't really interesting in playing [Wastes](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wastes). “My deck is pretty much mono-blue splashing [Oblivion Strike](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oblivion+Strike)s and [Birthing Hulk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Birthing+Hulk). [Blinding Drone](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blinding+Drone) is so important.”

Blue-Red is another direction that can be taken with colorless mana. [Maw of Kozilek](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Maw+of+Kozilek) is a solid common for the deck. It's really flexible and can play the role of offense or defense if you have access to colorless mana. Eleventh-ranked Alexander Hayne drafted a blue-red devoid deck today. “My best cards are [Blinding Drone](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blinding+Drone), [Prophet of Distortion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Prophet+of+Distortion), and [Holdout Settlement](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Holdout+Settlement). I had a lot of colorless sources, and even had two [Wastes](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wastes) in my sideboard. I like [Wastes](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wastes), but I need colored mana too, so the lands that can produce everything are better.” Hayne also had a minor surge theme going on in his deck with spells like [Slip Through Space](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Slip+Through+Space) to power out [Jwar Isle Avenger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jwar+Isle+Avenger).
