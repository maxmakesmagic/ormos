Kai Budde vs. Brad Nelson
-------------------------


Kai Budde, the German [Juggernaut](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Juggernaut), was playing in his tenth lifetime Pro Tour Top 8, while Brad Nelson from the U.S. was only in his second. But whereas Budde's previous Top 8s had all been years ago, Nelson was currently on a streak, just having made Top 8 at the last Pro Tour in San Juan at the end of May. The match-up, White Weenie versus Treehouse, apparently didn't favor any player either, so this was certainly going to be an interesting match to watch.


### Game 1


Nelson played first thanks to this Pro Tour's new play/draw rule, which gave the choice to whoever finished higher in the Swiss rounds. He started with [Verdant Catacombs](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Verdant+Catacombs) for [Murmuring Bosk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Murmuring+Bosk), and Budde started with [Flagstones of Trokair](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flagstones+of+Trokair) and [Steppe Lynx](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Steppe+Lynx).


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/ptams10/qf4_budde.jpg)*Pro Tour Hall of Famer Kai Budde adds yet another Top 8 to his already absurdly impressive resume.*
His second turn already saw Nelson drop down to 16, using his Bosk to cast [Thoughtseize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtseize) on Budde, who revealed a hand of [Plains](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plains), [Spectral Procession](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spectral+Procession), [Student of Warfare](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Student+of+Warfare), and two copies of [Knight of the White Orchid](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Knight+of+the+White+Orchid), as well as [Steppe Lynx](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Steppe+Lynx) which Nelson took. He played a second land, [Treetop Village](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treetop+Village), and passed the turn.


Budde attacked for 2 damage, summoned [Student of Warfare](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Student+of+Warfare) and put that at level one. Nelson fetched a [Forest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest) with his second [Verdant Catacombs](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Verdant+Catacombs) and made a 4/4 [Knight of the Reliquary](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Knight+of+the+Reliquary). Budde got his third land via [Knight of the White Orchid](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Knight+of+the+White+Orchid) and cast [Figure of Destiny](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Figure+of+Destiny), before he passed the turn.


Nelson used his [Knight of the Reliquary](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Knight+of+the+Reliquary) to turn his [Forest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest) into [Reflecting Pool](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reflecting+Pool), then proceeded to cast [Putrid Leech](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Putrid+Leech), [Tarmogoyf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf), and [Treefolk Harbinger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treefolk+Harbinger), setting up [Nameless Inversion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nameless+Inversion) on top of his library. Budde summoned the second [Knight of the White Orchid](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Knight+of+the+White+Orchid) and played [Marsh Flats](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Marsh+Flats) to make his [Steppe Lynx](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Steppe+Lynx) 4/5, potentially 6/7. The [Lynx](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lynx) attacked, and the Harbinger chumpblocked. Budde cracked the [Marsh Flats](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Marsh+Flats) anyway and cast [Spectral Procession](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spectral+Procession).


[Tarmogoyf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf) attacked to put Budde at 16 to Nelson's 11. Then the American cast [Elspeth, Knight-Errant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elspeth%2C+Knight-Errant), made a Soldier token and passed the turn. Budde thought long about his next move, trying to figure out how much damage Nelson could deal on his next turn. With [Tarmogoyf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf), [Knight of the Reliquary](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Knight+of+the+Reliquary), and the [Nameless Inversion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nameless+Inversion) in his hand, not an easy task. In the end, he settled on simply attacking with his three Spirit tokens, cast a third [Knight of the White Orchid](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Knight+of+the+White+Orchid), and moved [Student of Warfare](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Student+of+Warfare) to level three. He specifically did not spend all of his mana on either [Student of Warfare](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Student+of+Warfare) or [Figure of Destiny](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Figure+of+Destiny), but kept one land untapped, signalling (or bluffing) [Path to Exile](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Path+to+Exile) or [Brave the Elements](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brave+the+Elements).


Indeed, it turned out to be the latter, when Nelson cast [Maelstrom Pulse](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Maelstrom+Pulse) to kill off all three Knights. [Brave the Elements](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brave+the+Elements) granted protection from green and rendered a lot of possible attacks from Nelson moot as well. Instead he just pumped his [Putrid Leech](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Putrid+Leech) up to 5/5 flying via Elspeth and attacked with it. That left life totals at 11 to 8 in Budde's favor.


[Student of Warfare](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Student+of+Warfare) improved by four additional levels and charged along one of the flying Spirit tokens. Nelson's Soldier token chump-blocked the 4/4 Student and Nelson went down to 7. Nelson made another token with [Elspeth, Knight-Errant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elspeth%2C+Knight-Errant) and passed the turn. Budde figured by now he would lose his Student to Nelson's [Knight of the Reliquary](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Knight+of+the+Reliquary), and just attacked with one flying token to put Nelson at 6, then summoned [Ranger of Eos](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ranger+of+Eos) (searching [Student of Warfare](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Student+of+Warfare) and [Figure of Destiny](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Figure+of+Destiny)).


Nelson knew he wouldn't have another turn if he couldn't get [Maelstrom Pulse](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Maelstrom+Pulse) now. If he did, he would be able to get rid of both of Budde's flying blockers, then attack with an enormous flying [Knight of the Reliquary](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Knight+of+the+Reliquary) thanks to [Elspeth, Knight-Errant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elspeth%2C+Knight-Errant) to take the first game. If the top card of his deck was [Maelstrom Pulse](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Maelstrom+Pulse).


It wasn't, and he didn't.


**Budde 1, Nelson 0**


### Game 2


Nelson had a quicker start this time around with [Loam Lion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Loam+Lion) and [Knight of the Reliquary](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Knight+of+the+Reliquary), whereas Budde only had [Honor of the Pure](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Honor+of+the+Pure) on turn two as his first play. [Knight of the Reliquary](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Knight+of+the+Reliquary) was sent on the [Path to Exile](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Path+to+Exile), but was quickly replaced by [Putrid Leech](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Putrid+Leech) and [Tarmogoyf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf). Budde had [Knight of the White Orchid](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Knight+of+the+White+Orchid) which died to [Slaughter Pact](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Slaughter+Pact), then another wich stuck around. He also cast [Spectral Procession](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spectral+Procession), two tokens of which traded with the [Putrid Leech](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Putrid+Leech).


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/ptams10/qf4_nelson.jpg)*We're calling it now: Brad Nelson is a future legend of the game.*
Nelson got more and more creatures on the board with a second [Loam Lion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Loam+Lion) and [Treefolk Harbinger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treefolk+Harbinger), once again searching for [Nameless Inversion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nameless+Inversion). Budde went all in and cast not one but two [Spectral Procession](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spectral+Procession)s! With now seven flying 2/2 tokens on the other side of the battlefield, Nelson once again needed a [Maelstrom Pulse](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Maelstrom+Pulse) ... quickly. He didn't get it, and six of the flyers took him down to 1 life, while one died to [Nameless Inversion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nameless+Inversion).


The very next turn, however, he drew the [Maelstrom Pulse](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Maelstrom+Pulse) and left Budde with [Knight of the White Orchid](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Knight+of+the+White+Orchid) as his only creature. Nelson started to get some damage in himself. He needed to end this fast, before Budde found a way to finish him off. It was close, but Budde had [Brave the Elements](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brave+the+Elements) to sneak in the final points of damage.


**Budde 2, Nelson 0**


### Game 3


This time, Nelson had the monster draw with lots of monsters: by turn three he was already attacking for 6 with [Loam Lion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Loam+Lion) and [Treefolk Harbinger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treefolk+Harbinger) which had, of course, searched up [Doran, the Siege Tower](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Doran%2C+the+Siege+Tower).


Meanwhile, Budde had [Figure of Destiny](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Figure+of+Destiny) and [Honor of the Pure](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Honor+of+the+Pure), followed by [Spectral Procession](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spectral+Procession). Nelson had the [Maelstrom Pulse](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Maelstrom+Pulse) for the flyers and Budde was peeking at the top card of his library, asking: "Miracle?"


There was none, and he quickly shuffled it up.


**Budde 2, Nelson 1**


### Game 4


Budde played first and had [Figure of Destiny](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Figure+of+Destiny), once again followed by [Honor of the Pure](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Honor+of+the+Pure). Nelson did one—or several—better, with [Loam Lion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Loam+Lion) followed by [Putrid Leech](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Putrid+Leech). On turn three Budde had no play at all and just put a counter on his Figure. He did, however, cast [Path to Exile](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Path+to+Exile) on the [Putrid Leech](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Putrid+Leech), when Nelson cast [Duress](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress). Left in his hand at this point: only lands.


Nelson made a 4/5 [Tarmogoyf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf), and on the next turn [Doran, the Siege Tower](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Doran%2C+the+Siege+Tower). In the meantime Budde had got his Figure to 5/5 ([Honor of the Pure](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Honor+of+the+Pure), remember?) and, when Nelson's full team swung in, had [Celestial Purge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Celestial+Purge) for Doran while his Figure took down the [Tarmogoyf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf).


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/ptams10/qf4_budde_nelson.jpg)*To be the best, you've got to beat the best*
Nelson had a replacement Doran, but Budde's Figure reached 9/9. The board was a stand-off, with Doran, [Loam Lion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Loam+Lion), [Treetop Village](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treetop+Village), and a recently added [Treefolk Harbinger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treefolk+Harbinger) against the Figure.


"Come on, [Ranger of Eos](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ranger+of+Eos)—come on, Antoine," Budde commanded, looking encouragingly at the top card of his library.


It wasn't. It was [Knight of the White Orchid](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Knight+of+the+White+Orchid). Still he decided to attack with his massive flyer, to take Nelson to 9, with the Knight back on defense as a chumpblocker. One more attack and this match would be over. Nelson was looking for a topdeck, potentially a removal spell. What he did in fact get was [Kitchen Finks](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kitchen+Finks). Not quite the same, but it did bring him up to 11 and bought him just the time he needed to bring things home.


**Brad Nelson 2, Kai Budde 2**


### Game 5


Budde went down to six in the final game and kept a hand with three [Plains](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plains), [Knight of the White Orchid](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Knight+of+the+White+Orchid), [Honor of the Pure](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Honor+of+the+Pure), and [Spectral Procession](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spectral+Procession). Nelson spent his first turn more productively with [Treefolk Harbinger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treefolk+Harbinger) searching up its big brother [Doran, the Siege Tower](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Doran%2C+the+Siege+Tower). On his second turn, Budde made [Honor of the Pure](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Honor+of+the+Pure), while Nelson summoned [Tarmogoyf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf).


Budde cast [Spectral Procession](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spectral+Procession), but Nelson unmade that spell with [Maelstrom Pulse](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Maelstrom+Pulse) and attacked with [Tarmogoyf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf). Budde just made [Knight of the White Orchid](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Knight+of+the+White+Orchid) and passed the turn, whereas Nelson summoned his deck's trademark "0"/5 creature.


With a sigh, Budde dropped a fifth land onto the battlefield and passed without play. When Doran attacked Budde had [Path to Exile](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Path+to+Exile), but one down, more to come: Nelson summoned another Doran and on his next turn cast [Elspeth, Knight-Errant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elspeth%2C+Knight-Errant). Budde was out of spells and soon after out of life.


**Brad Nelson defeats Kai Budde 3-1 and advances to the Semifinals!**
