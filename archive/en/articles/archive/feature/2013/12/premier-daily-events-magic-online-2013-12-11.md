Last Monday, [Mike Turian posted information](http://www.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/other/12092013/eventsreturn) for the return of Premier and Daily Events to **Magic Online** on [MTGO.com](http://www.mtgo.com). Today is that day. Following the regularly scheduled downtime we'll be coming back online with a selection of Daily and Premier Events.


You can view [the event schedule](http://www.wizards.com/magic/digital/magiconline.aspx?x=mtg/digital/magiconline/calendar/2013) to see what scheduled events there are after the planned downtime. The first scheduled event is a Standard Daily event at 12 p.m. Pacific, and after that is a *Theros* Sealed event at 1 p.m. Pacific.


There's been a few questions around the new schedule and changes that were made. We will be evaluating the schedule for future changes, so format decisions might change.


Again, for more information, be sure to read Mike's article over on [MTGO.com](http://www.mtgo.com).
