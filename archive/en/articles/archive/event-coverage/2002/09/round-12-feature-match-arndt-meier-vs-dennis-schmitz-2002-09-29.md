![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gpham02/907.jpg)With three rounds to go both of these German players are in very strong positions. Arndt Meier stands at 10-1 while his opponent Dennis Schmitz is on 9-1-1. Meier is running G/W while Schmitz is running a U/G deck focused around threshold.

Both got a strong start with Mongrels and Rootwallas on turn two. Meier laid a plains and added an [Anurid Brushhopper](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Anurid+Brushhopper) while Schmitz summoned a [Werebear](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Werebear) that didn’t quite match, for the moment.

Meier sent in the killer frog and the Mongrel and a skirmish resulted in the red zone that saw the [Werebear](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Werebear) block the hopper and gain threshold through the help of the Mongrel and a [Mental Note](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mental+Note). On the receiving end the frog hopped off and madnessed out an [Arrogant Wurm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arrogant+Wurm). Schmitz added a 3/3 [Nimble Mongoose](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nimble+Mongoose) to his forces.

With the ground looking snarled up Meier went to the skies with [Battle Screech](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Battle+Screech). Realising he had to get active Schmitz crashed into the red zone, trading a [Centaur Garden](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Centaur+Garden) for Meier’s [Arrogant Wurm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arrogant+Wurm).

Another attack saw [Glory](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glory) pitched to Brushhopper to keep Meier’s blockers alive. [Glory](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glory) looked strong for Meier but Schmitz had a lot of pressure in five creatures. Meier was forced to hold back a couple of the Screech tokens. [Aether Burst](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aether+Burst) bounced the frog back.

Then a [Spurnmage Advocate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spurnmage+Advocate) appeared to further complicate things for Schmitz. He had to sit back while Meier nibbled him through the air. A second [Mental Note](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mental+Note) failed to find him a [Wonder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wonder).

When it did come Meier had reached 6 mana, enough to activate [Glory](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glory) twice and force an alpha strike through with protection against the [Aether Burst](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aether+Burst) in Schmitz’s hand.

Meier 1-0 Schmitz

Schmitz got off to a flier game two with Rootwalla, and two successive [Wild Mongrel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Mongrel) while Meier had to burn just to cast a Rootwalla with a [Sungrass Prairie](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sungrass+Prairie). The Rootwalla’s traded the next turn and then Meier reached 4 mana and dropped [Commander Eesha](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Commander+Eesha).

“What is that?” Schmitz said turning the card to read it.

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gpham02/906.jpg)He attacked anyway, happy to trade an excess Island in his hand to keep the damage going. His deck was running out of steam as he could only summon a [Wonder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wonder). Meanwhile Meier had found the fat flier portion of his deck as his own incarnation, [Glory](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glory), entered play.

Schmitz still kept sending his Hounds into the red zone, trading two cards for [Glory](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glory) and bouncing [Commander Eesha](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Commander+Eesha) with an [Aether Burst](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aether+Burst). Meier didn’t replay it dropping Mongrel instead with mana open to use [Glory](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glory).

Or so it looked. Schmitz charged in again and found himself on the receiving end of an ambush from an [Arrogant Wurm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arrogant+Wurm). He was forced to flash back his own [Moment's Peace](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Moment%27s+Peace) to prevent the hounds getting squashed.

A second [Arrogant Wurm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arrogant+Wurm) followed as Meier went aggro. Next attack Meier sent in everything to put Schmitz at two. It looked like he’d left the door wide open but a [Moment's Peace](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Moment%27s+Peace) shut it pretty quickly. Now Schmitz needed a trick. He had an [Aether Burst](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aether+Burst), but that couldn’t help when Meier had [Glory](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glory) in the graveyard to give his creatures protection from blue.

Arndt Meier beat Dennis Schmitz 2-0
