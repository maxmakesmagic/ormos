![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/promo/grandprix_2012.jpg)*Get your free promo card by playing in the Grand Prix (while supplies last).*Kobe is a city rich with **Magic** history, having hosted the first Pro Tour to be won by a Japanese player (Masashiro Kuroda, 2004) and the largest Grand Prix in Japan to date (1350 players, 2001). This will be the fifth Grand Prix to be held in Kobe.


Kobe is the fifth-largest city in Japan, with a population of about 1.5 million. One of the first cities to open for trade with the West following the end of the Tokugawa Shogunate in 1868, Kobe has long been known as a cosmopolitan port city. The city is the point of origin and namesake of Kobe beef as well as the home of one of Japan's most famous hot spring resorts, the Arima Onsen. Other well-known locations in the city include the Ikuta Shrine, the Kobe Port Tower, and its large Chinatown.


*The **Magic: The Gathering** Grand Prix tournament series is a great reason to get out of the house, catch up with old friends, meet some new ones, and play **Magic**. Grand Prix tournaments are world-wide open events that allow all **Magic**  players to participate and experience the thrill of a large-scale competition. In addition to $30,000 in cash prizes, Pro Tour invitations for the top 4 finishers, and exclusive foil promo cards for participants, Grand Prix feature a host of other activities, including public events and artist signings. For information about Grand Prix in general and to see where other events are being held, check out the Grand Prix [tournament schedule](http://www.wizards.com/Magic/TCG/Events.aspx?x=grandprix/welcome#1).*

A bye is normally given out to a player when there are an odd number of players in a round, but byes may also be rewarded to players for previous performance at a tournament or as a prize at a Trial tournament. Byes will be given to players in the Grand Prix based on the following criteria *(Byes are not cumulative throughout the season or year. Byes do not pass down under any circumstances.

### Artist Information


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/gpkob12/franz%20vohwinkel.jpg)**Franz Vohwinkel** 
  
 Franz Vohwinkel studied graphic design in Darmstadt (Germany) and graduated in 1991. The same year he illustrated his first game "Drunter und Drüber", by Klaus Teuber. Since then he has illustrated and designed more than 200 board and card games. A long-time science fiction and fantasy fan, in 1996 he was offered the chance to illustrate cards for the **Magic: The Gathering**  and Battletech TCGs, becoming the first German artist to work for these projects. Since then, the share of fantasy and science fiction illustrations in Franz's work has grown steadily. Over the years, he has also done illustrations for the Classic Battletech RPG, Dungeons & Dragons, L5R, A Game of Thrones, and many book covers. Some of his illustrations have also been represented in "Spectrum: The Best in Contemporary Fantastic Art". He has won the German Science Fiction - Kurd Lasswitz Award twice. Over the years he has done illustrations for more than 80 **Magic**  cards. Since 2006, he has lived in Seattle, USA.

 Coffee is practically a necessity for any busy artist and there is no exception even for illustrator Ryan Yee. By day Ryan is a video game concept artist for Schell Games in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and by night Ryan immerses himself in his fantasy illustration work for **Magic: The Gathering**. Ryan’s first **Magic**  card illustrations appeared in M11's core set. It was not until Commander and Innistrad that his works started to garner a lot of accolades. Highlight illustrations include [Endless Ranks of the Dead](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Endless+Ranks+of+the+Dead), [Moonmist](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Moonmist), [Paraselene](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Paraselene), and [Command Tower](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Command+Tower). Players can expect to see Ryan’s name on a number of cards being released in 2012 and beyond. If asked over a cup of coffee, Ryan will often mention **Magic**  illustration legends Justin Sweet, Todd Lockwood, Jon Foster, Donato Giancola, Raymond Swanland and Jason Chan as a few of his favorite card illustrators. One of the biggest rewards for Ryan is the opportunity to meet and engage with **Magic**  players from all over the world. He is very excited to travel to Kobe, Japan for this year's Grand Prix.
