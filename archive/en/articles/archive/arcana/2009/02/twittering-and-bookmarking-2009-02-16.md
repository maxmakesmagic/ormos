Let's pretend for a moment that you're looking at an article on magicthegathering.com. To make it easy, we'll pretend that you're reading an Arcana. Like this one. That should be pretty easy.

Well, if you were to move your eyes up and to the right a bit, you might notice something that looks like this:

The bit on the left is new. It lets you automatically add the page you're looking at to various social bookmarking sites, like Digg and Reddit and Delicious, and so on. The other three icons have been there for months now. In case you're interested, the little envelope is an "email this article to someone" link, the one in the middle is a direct link to the thread about the current article (finally! no more scrolling down!), and the one on the left links to the print-friendly version.

We've also got a new Twitter feed, but that's all the way back on the front page of Daily MTG. It's conveniently named "[@dailymtg](/en/articles/archive/2012-07-10)" and it consists of Kelly Digges and Monty Ashley (and sometimes other members of the team) commenting on life in the R&D Pit and the process of making the website every day. Subscribe to the feed now and receive such fascinating tidbits as:
