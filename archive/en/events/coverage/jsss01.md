2001 Junior Super Series Coverage
---------------------------------


![Junior Super Series Logo](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/JSSlogo.jpg)![The Junior Super Series Championship](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/JSS01/jsspana.jpg)The 2001 Junior World Championships are over, and when the dust settled, Ben Ashkar of Minnesota carried his Fires deck all the way to a $20,000 scholarship. He beat Ralph Trapas's Merfolk-Opposition deck 2-0, thanks in part to his Urza's Rages and sideboarded Artifact Mutations. Playing on the stage in front of cameras in the finals was a new experience for these two young players, and judging by their performance this weekend, it may not be the last time they play on camera for large sums of money.
