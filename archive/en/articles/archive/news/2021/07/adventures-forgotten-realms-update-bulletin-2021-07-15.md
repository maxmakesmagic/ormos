Hello, everyone!


*Dungeons & Dragons: Adventures in the Forgotten Realms* is an exciting set that ventured into . . . well, it ventured into a lot of new mechanical space with Classes, dungeons, and rolling d20s. This also means a lot of shiny new rules were added to cover these mechanics. There were also a few rules changes with this set, and there were a few changes to the Oracle text of some *Magic* cards, including adding the Ranger and Bard creature types to some older *Magic* cards.


Both the rules changes and Oracle changes are still under review, so it's possible they'll be a little different from the final changes. When they're finalized, you'll be able to see them on the [rules page](https://magic.wizards.com/en/game-info/gameplay/rules-and-formats/rules) and [Gatherer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Default.aspx).


Alrightâ€”let's venture in!
