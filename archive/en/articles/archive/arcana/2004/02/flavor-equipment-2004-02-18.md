A game of **Magic** is a collection of stories waiting to happen -- and not just stories about game zones, card advantage and "damage going on the stack." It's also about the *flavor* of the game: the imagery of dueling wizards duking it out on a mystic battlefield, which is evoked by the cards' names, art, flavor text, mechanics and rules.

The design of *Darksteel* cranks up **Magic**'s flavor aspect with even more equipment and equipment-focused spells. Today's **Magic** Arcana asks you to take a moment to pause and reflect on the "flava" of equipment.

* **[Whispersilk Cloak](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Whispersilk+Cloak)** brings to mind a gauche and noisy [Rustmouth Ogre](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Rustmouth%2BOgre) who slips on the Cloak, fades from view and slips past enemy [Yotian Soldier](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Yotian%2BSoldier).
* **[Heartseeker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Heartseeker)** conjures visions of a [Auriok Glaivemaster](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Auriok%2BGlaivemaster) picking up the deadly mystical blade, battling goblins in combat with it, then at a crucial moment throwing it at a hapless distant [Sundering Titan](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Sundering%2BTitan) and striking it dead in the chest.
* If you've ever had **[Murderous Spoils](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Murderous+Spoils)** played against you, you already know the card's brutal flavor. Did your [Clockwork Condor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Clockwork%2BCondor), stricken with the spell, lose its grip on a powerful [Sword of Fire and Ice](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Sword%2Bof%2BFire%2Band%2BIce), only for it to drop into the hands of an enemy [Dross Golem](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Dross%2BGolem)?
* Has the **[Unforge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Unforge)** ever melted your [Viridian Shaman](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Viridian%2BShaman)'s [Lightning Greaves](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Lightning%2BGreaves) right around her ankles, so hot that she perished while still wearing them?
* Has a [Leonin Shikari](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Leonin%2BShikari) of the **[Leonin Bola](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leonin+Bola)** ever tied up your troops long enough for an [Neurok Spy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Neurok%2BSpy) wielding a [Barbed Lightning](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Barbed%2BLightning)
**[Spellbinder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spellbinder)** staff to sneak by?
