The Standard hits kept on rolling through the Top 8. The quarterfinals finished up in a flash, and the players got right to it in the semis. Temur was battling Mardu, and Sidisi Whip was against the White-Blue Heroic.



**Jeremy Frye (Temur Midrange) vs. Ryan Scullin (Mardu Midrange)**




 Ryan Scullin came out fast and furious like Paul Walker, with an unanswered [Seeker of the Way](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seeker+of+the+Way) and an unanswered [Goblin Rabblemaster](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Rabblemaster). Not to mention, he drew the perfect Mountain on his fourth turn to make his [Chained to the Rocks](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chained+to+the+Rocks) live. It went on Jeremy Frye's [Courser of Kruphix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Courser+of+Kruphix), and before attacks he cast a second Rabblemaster.
