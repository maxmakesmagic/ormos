Practice your ***Magic**  2013 Core Set* drafting skills right here every week by participating in a Booster Draft against seven AI drafters, powered by the collective intelligence of **Magic**'s R&D department.

 When you're done with your draft, you can compare your picks with other readers in the Forums. Think you can draft a better deck? Want to know what would happen if you made a different first pick? You can keep drafting against the same pool all week and see how your picks change from strategy to strategy.
