This weekend is [Grand Prix Richmond](http://www.magicgp.com), and [Noah Bradley](http://www.noahbradley.com/) is among the artists who will be attending the event. So let's take a look at what cards he did in *Theros* and *Born of the Gods*.

Sometimes we add text with each image. This time, though, I'm just going to shut up and get out of the way of the art. Enjoy!
