Live Coverage of 2004 Australia National Championship
=====================================================











![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/aunat04/fin.jpg)One hundred and ten players converged on the nation's capital with the same goal, to win the Australian nationals. But even if that goal eluded the players, they would all be happy with a spot in the national team and a trip to the world championships to be held in San Francisco later in the year to compete with the best of the best. For the first time the Australian Nationals was split between Constructed and Draft, with three rounds of Constructed, six rounds of Draft and then three more rounds of Constructed leading to the Top 8. When the smoke cleared, Tim He was crowned national champion after his 2-1 victory over Michael Kotchoff. Kotchoff took the first game, but He rebounded through judicious use of Wrath of God and Eternal Dragon in Game 2 and an overwhelming Decree of Justice in the final game to take the title. Tim He is the Australian national champion for 2004!
