When we have a discussion on whether to call a deck "Green Dragons" or "Four-Color Dragons," it is clear that we have an interesting brew on our hands. In the last week or so, Joel Larsson has been tearing up the *Magic Online* leagues with [Shaman of Forgotten Ways](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shaman+of+Forgotten+Ways) and [Dragonlord Ojutai](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragonlord+Ojutai), and he is putting the concoction to the test at Grand Prix Manchester this weekend.


The Player
==========


![](https://media.wizards.com/2016/events/gpman16/GPMan16_JoelLarsson.jpg)  
*Joel Larsson*


Joel Larsson, currently ranked 11th in the Top 25, is a 24-year-old Swedish professional *Magic* player who is best known for his win at Pro Tour *Magic Origins*. Due to his hairstyle and appearance, he received the nickname of "Swedish Kibler" after he played in the finals of *Pro Tour Gatecrash* in 2013.


This season, he made several deep finishes at Pro Tours and already accumulated 51 pro points as a result. This means that he already locked Platinum level for the next season and that he is close to qualifying for the World Championship this summer. But a few more pro points from this Grand Prix would help cement that invitation.

The ideal draw of this deck presents a turn-four Dragon, cast via [Haven of the Spirit Dragon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Haven+of+the+Spirit+Dragon) so that it can be recurred it later. Thanks to [Krallenhorde Howler](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Krallenhorde+Howler) and [Shaman of Forgotten Ways](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shaman+of+Forgotten+Ways), plus [Oath of Nissa](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oath+of+Nissa) to find them, the deck can ramp into a turn-four [Dragonlord Ojutai](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragonlord+Ojutai) consistently. With the perfect draw, it is even possible to play [Dragonlord Atarka](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragonlord+Atarka) as early as turn four!


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Shaman+of+Forgotten+Ways)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shaman+of+Forgotten+Ways)[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Dragonlord+Ojutai)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragonlord+Ojutai)
"The deck is super sweet," Larsson said. "I love it when a deck knits together in a strange way, with [Haven of the Spirit Dragon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Haven+of+the+Spirit+Dragon) and [Oath of Nissa](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oath+of+Nissa). But [Shaman of Forgotten Ways](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shaman+of+Forgotten+Ways) is arguably the key card in the deck; it is really powerful."


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Tireless+Tracker)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tireless+Tracker)[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Dromoka%27s+Command)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dromoka%27s+Command)
Besides deploying powerful Dragons early, the deck is capable of grinding out opponents with green card advantage creatures and white removal spells. "I had been looking for a proactive deck with [Tireless Tracker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tireless+Tracker), [Nissa, Vastwood Seer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nissa%2C+Vastwood+Seer), and [Duskwatch Recruiter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duskwatch+Recruiter), because those cards mean that it's impossible for anyone to out-grind you," Larsson told me. "I wanted a shell that does that, with a fair amount of removal and powerful evasion. Against Green-White Tokens and Bant Company, both of you draw a lot of cards and do a lot of things, but it's often a flier that wins the game in the end. The Dragons are perfect finishers."


"I got the deck from Marcus Angelin, a guy from Stockholm whom I know well. I'm not sure how he came up with it, but I believe he had been playing a lot with Green-White Tokens, and although he liked the [Sylvan Advocate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sylvan+Advocate) / [Oath of Nissa](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oath+of+Nissa) / [Dromoka's Command](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dromoka%27s+Command) package, he didn't like Gideon all that much. He replaced planeswalkers with Dragons and arrived at a list that is very close to what I am playing today."


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Haven+of+the+Spirit+Dragon)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Haven+of+the+Spirit+Dragon)[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Evolving+Wilds)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Evolving+Wilds)
Given that his deck contained four colors, I asked Larsson if he had run into any mana problems at all. "Sometimes you can't cast 2 [Dromoka's Command](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dromoka%27s+Command) on the same turn, but that's about it," he answered. "With [Haven of the Spirit Dragon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Haven+of+the+Spirit+Dragon), [Shaman of Forgotten Ways](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shaman+of+Forgotten+Ways), [Evolving Wilds](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Evolving+Wilds), and [Oath of Nissa](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oath+of+Nissa) to find them, casting off-color Dragons is easy. Besides, most of the deck is mono-green."


If four colors is okay, then why not five? I greedily asked him if [Dragonlord Silumgar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragonlord+Silumgar) was a consideration. Larsson shook his head: "I don't need more power, and it requires two colored mana that are not produced by [Fortified Village](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fortified+Village) or [Canopy Vista](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Canopy+Vista). I would just run an extra [Dragonlord Atarka](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragonlord+Atarka) if I needed more power. [Dragonlord Atarka](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragonlord+Atarka) is really good right now."


Positioning, Matchups, and Sideboarding
=======================================


The main reason why this was Larsson's deck choice this weekend was that he felt Green Dragons matched up very well against all black midrange decks. "Esper and White-Black won Standard GPs recently, and I think many people are going to play a black midrange deck this weekend," Larsson said. "I have a proactive deck that has a better grind and a better late game. They have to start the game by answering our threats and then sticking a threat themselves. But I have plenty of removal, and my deck never runs out of threats. The only way you lose if when they deploy a big threat, like an expensive planeswalker, and you don't have an answer to it." After sideboard, Larsson improves against them by most notably adding additional green card advantage creatures and [Quarantine Field](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Quarantine+Field) and by cutting [Dromoka's Command](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dromoka%27s+Command).


"Bant Company seems fine as well in theory. We play many similar cards, and the matchup comes down to an attrition war that takes forever until someone finds a way to break open the game. My top end is better, and my flyers are great. I don't need to board much, just [Lambholt Pacifist](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lambholt+Pacifist) for [Dromoka's Command](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dromoka%27s+Command)."


"Green-White Tokens is a pretty close matchup," Larsson continued." I would board [Quarantine Field](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Quarantine+Field), which I can protect from [Dromoka's Command](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dromoka%27s+Command) with [Oath of Nissa](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oath+of+Nissa), and maybe some other cards against them, cutting [Den Protector](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Den+Protector) and a few removal spells."


"[Cryptolith Rite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cryptolith+Rite)s decks will be tough as I don't have a good enough clock. I need to kill their [Eldrazi Displacer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eldrazi+Displacer), so I add [Tragic Arrogance](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tragic+Arrogance) and [Declaration in Stone](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Declaration+in+Stone), cutting some slow creatures like [Sylvan Advocate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sylvan+Advocate) against them."


Tips and Tricks
===============


As a final question, I asked Larsson if he could share some advice or interesting plays that we might not see right away picking up this deck. Here is a selection.


* If you fear that your opponent might play [Archangel Avacyn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Archangel+Avacyn), cast [Dragonlord Dromoka](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragonlord+Dromoka) first. If your opponent wants to play [Archangel Avacyn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Archangel+Avacyn) that turn, then they have to do it in response, giving you full information.
* [Hallowed Moonlight](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hallowed+Moonlight) takes out an opposing [Reflector Mage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reflector+Mage) that is blinked with [Eldrazi Displacer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eldrazi+Displacer).
* If you have [Tireless Tracker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tireless+Tracker), you often want to play on turn four so you get a Clue token even if your opponent has a removal spell. However, this needs to be the right land. [Evolving Wilds](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Evolving+Wilds) is perfect, but a Forest is good too. If you have an opening hand with Forest, Plains, [Canopy Vista](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Canopy+Vista), and [Haven of the Spirit Dragon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Haven+of+the+Spirit+Dragon), then it's intuitive to play [Canopy Vista](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Canopy+Vista) untapped on turn 3, but then if you draw [Oath of Nissa](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oath+of+Nissa), you can't go [Tireless Tracker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tireless+Tracker), [Haven of the Spirit Dragon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Haven+of+the+Spirit+Dragon), [Oath of Nissa](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oath+of+Nissa) on turn four. Instead, keep the Forest for turn four.
* Post board, after adding the double-white cards, use [Evolving Wilds](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Evolving+Wilds) more frequently for Plains. Even if you don't have blue or red mana yet, an Island or Mountain is not essential because [Haven of the Spirit Dragon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Haven+of+the+Spirit+Dragon) or [Shaman of Forgotten Ways](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shaman+of+Forgotten+Ways) can fix those colors.
* Don't forget that [Shaman of Forgotten Ways](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shaman+of+Forgotten+Ways) has an 11-mana "ultimate"! It's a great answer to [Ormendahl, Profane Prince](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ormendahl%2C+Profane+Prince) in particular.
* If you're playing against this deck, you should generally kill [Shaman of Forgotten Ways](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shaman+of+Forgotten+Ways) on sight. Even if no Dragon is coming out, Shaman provides a lot of mana to cast random creatures while lands are used to crack clues from [Tireless Tracker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tireless+Tracker) or to activate [Duskwatch Recruiter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duskwatch+Recruiter). Without [Shaman of Forgotten Ways](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shaman+of+Forgotten+Ways), the deck is quite clunky.
