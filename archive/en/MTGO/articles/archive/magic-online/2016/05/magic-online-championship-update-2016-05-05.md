The *Magic Online* Championship is taking place May 13-15. Unfortunately, two players will be unable to attend the event for reasons outside of the control of Wizards of the Coast and the players.


As a result, Wizards of the Coast has extended both players special invitations to the first Pro Tour in 2017 in Dublin as well as the Pro Tour Challenge event at that Pro Tour.


We are sad these players are unable to attend, but are still looking forward to providing players and fans an exciting *Magic Online* Championship.
