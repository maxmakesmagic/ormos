 Doing text coverage for a Grand Prix is a daunting proposition. There is so much to keep track of over the course of the day that many of the cooler details of the *Magic* that's being play can be lost in the shuffle. Fortunately, in times like these, I know that we can always count on the video coverage team to come through with some of the cooler plays that they've seen either on camera or while wandering around the room.
