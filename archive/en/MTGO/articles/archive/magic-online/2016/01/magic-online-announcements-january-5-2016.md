**December MOPR Promo Error and Resolution**


When the December MOPR promos are granted on January 6, players who are qualified to receive the promo may notice that the [Accumulated Knowledge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Accumulated+Knowledge) that will be added to their accounts is not the version advertised in the original December [MOPR card announcement](http://magic.wizards.com/en/MTGO/articles/archive/magic-online/magic-online-announcements-november-17-2015), but will actually use the *Nemesis* art shown below.


![](https://media.wizards.com/2015/mtgo/card_promo_MOPR_accumulated_knowledge.png)
The above promo was mistakenly flagged for the December MOPR grant and will be the version that players receive during the January 6 downtime. Unfortunately, due to testing and quality assurance schedules, the advertised version will not be prepared for a promo grant until January 27. We apologize for this inconvenience and would like to grant qualified players both versions of the promo, the version shown above on Wednesday, January 6, and the previously advertised version on Wednesday, January 27. Thank you for your understanding and sorry for the confusion!

The *Magic Online* promo granted will use the same art as the above card, but will have the *Magic Online* expansion symbol and a *Magic Online* frame.

**Double Pro Tour Qualifier Weekend**


Attention all Pro Tour hopefuls, there's a double Pro Tour Qualifier (PTQ) weekend coming up! Standard Pro Tour Qualifier Preliminaries and the *Battle for Zendikar* Sealed Pro Tour Qualifier Preliminaries begin Thursday, January 7, and run through Sunday, January 10. The Standard PTQ Finals takes place on Saturday, January 9 at 9:00 a.m. Pacific and the *Battle for Zendikar* Sealed PTQ Finals is on Sunday, January 10 at 7:00 a.m. Pacific (UTC -8).


Remember, these are Pro Tour Qualifiers under our [new system](http://magic.wizards.com/en/MTGO/articles/archive/magic-online/pro-tour-qualifier-changes-2015-11-16). Now, when you win a Pro Tour Qualifier Preliminary, you will be granted a token that will allow entry into a PTQ Finals of the same format instead of having to participate in the corresponding Finals Event during the weekend that follows the Preliminary. We hope that this helps those of you with busy schedules have a better shot at the Pro Tour!


Learn more about PTQs on *Magic Online* and get the full schedule [here](http://magic.wizards.com/en/content/magic-online-pro-tour-qualifiers-pro-tour-shadows-over-innistrad).
