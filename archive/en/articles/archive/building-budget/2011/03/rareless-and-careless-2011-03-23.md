Rareless and Careless
=====================

By Jacob Van Lunen




Jacob Van Lunen began playing Magic in 1995. He has participated in organized play at every level of competition and was a member of the winning team at Pro Tour San Diego in 2007, thanks to an innovative draft strategy. As a writer, Van Lunen has had more than three hundred Magic strategy pieces published 






I've had a number of readers ask for a Standard deck that plays no rares. To be honest, I wasn't sure if this was even possible. Cards like [Jace, the Mind Sculptor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace%2C+the+Mind+Sculptor) are so powerful that it becomes very difficult to compete while confining oneself to commons and uncommons.

I decided to do a [Gatherer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Default.aspx) search of Standard [including only commons and uncommons](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?action=advanced&rarity=%7C%5BC%5D%7C%5BU%5D&format=%7C%5B%22Standard%22%5D) to see what colors offered the most powerful spells with the rares and mythic rares out of the picture.

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/boab/boab135_bolt.jpg)  
Red was a clear winner here. [Lightning Bolt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt), [Arc Trail](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arc+Trail), [Staggershock](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Staggershock), [Searing Blaze](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Searing+Blaze), and [Forked Bolt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forked+Bolt) all seemed like cards that had the power level to compete in a world of [Stoneforge Mystic](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stoneforge+Mystic)s and Jaces.

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/boab/boab135_5Cards1.jpg)  
I didn't just want to make a red burn deck, though. That would risk becoming a boring down version of the red deck played by Patrick Sullivan at the recent StarCityGames.com Standard Open in Edison, NJ.

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/boab/boab135_commando.jpg)  
[Neurok Commando](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Neurok+Commando) is a card that has the ability to completely dominate a game. It's especially strong when paired with cards like [Arc Trail](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arc+Trail) and [Forked Bolt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forked+Bolt) that can clear the way and let the card advantage really pile up. One thing that's especially nice with [Neurok Commando](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Neurok+Commando) in the current Standard is how often your opponent will leave back just a single [Squadron Hawk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Squadron+Hawk) back to block. "You already used two burn spells. Could you really have another one?"

![Neurok Commando](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Neurok+Commando)  
The truth is, yes, of course you have another one—if your deck plays twenty burn spells!

I already wanted to play all the good commons and uncommons that red has to offer. [Kiln Fiend](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kiln+Fiend) seemed like a perfect fit to give this deck some really explosive draws. [Kiln Fiend](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kiln+Fiend) has the potential to let you end games very early. It works especially well when you have multiple one-mana burn spells or a [Staggershock](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Staggershock).

![Kiln Fiend](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Kiln+Fiend)  
[Æther Adept](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=%C3%86ther+Adept) may not seem like the best card, but I've been pretty impressed with its ability to bounce creatures wielding [Sword of Feast and Famine](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sword+of+Feast+and+Famine). It's also nice to bounce your opponent's blocker when you have a [Neurok Commando](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Neurok+Commando) waiting to net you some extra cards.

![Aether Adept](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Aether+Adept)  
I played a few games with the deck and found myself wanting some amount of countermagic. [Deprive](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deprive) seemed pretty good in a deck like this, and [Mana Leak](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak) is always a welcome addition. I decided to play a relatively even split and see which card did better for me in actual game play.

![Deprive](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Deprive)  
As with other red decks I've worked on lately, I need a sideboard plan to deal with [Kor Firewalker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kor+Firewalker) and [Baneslayer Angel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Baneslayer+Angel). This time around, though, it's much easier. Blue gives us access to [Narcolepsy](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Narcolepsy), and even if they're still gaining the life from the [Kor Firewalker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kor+Firewalker), it's much more important that we have a way to force our [Kiln Fiend](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kiln+Fiend) and [Neurok Commando](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Neurok+Commando) through their team.

I wanted extra countermagic in my sideboard for matchups like [Valakut, the Molten Pinnacle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Valakut%252C%2Bthe%2BMolten%2BPinnacle). I'll play a full set of [Flashfreeze](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flashfreeze). I'm also a fan of [Spreading Seas](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spreading+Seas) against a lot of different decks that don't play many creatures.

I played a full set of all the aforementioned burn spells and decided to take the deck to battle in the tournament practice room of **Magic Online**. Here's the final 75.

My opponent played a land and cast [Cunning Sparkmage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cunning+Sparkmage) before passing the turn. I drew a [Mountain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mountain), played my [Island](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island), cast [Neurok Commando](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Neurok+Commando), and passed the turn after getting pinged for one.

My opponent cast a [Stoneforge Mystic](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stoneforge+Mystic), searched for [Basilisk Collar](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Basilisk+Collar), cast the Collar, and passed the turn.

My opponent played a [Forest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest) and passed the turn. I drew an [Island](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island), played [Evolving Wilds](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Evolving+Wilds), and passed the turn. My opponent cast a [Lotus Cobra](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lotus+Cobra) and passed the turn after I found a [Mountain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mountain). I drew an [Æther Adept](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=%C3%86ther+Adept), played my land, cast [Burst Lightning](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Burst+Lightning) on the Cobra, and passed the turn. My opponent cast a [Cultivate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cultivate) and passed the turn. I drew [Staggershock](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Staggershock), played my land, cast [Neurok Commando](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Neurok+Commando), and passed the turn. My opponent cast [Pyroclasm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyroclasm), cast [Explore](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Explore), played some lands, and passed the turn. I drew a [Flashfreeze](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flashfreeze) and passed the turn. My opponent attempted to cast an [Inferno Titan](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inferno+Titan), but I had the [Flashfreeze](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flashfreeze). Again came the [Summoning Trap](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Summoning+Trap), but I had another [Flashfreeze](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flashfreeze). My opponent played a seventh land and passed the turn. I drew a [Neurok Commando](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Neurok+Commando), cast it, and passed the turn. My opponent cast [Avenger of Zendikar](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Avenger+of+Zendikar), played an [Evolving Wilds](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Evolving+Wilds), cracked it, and passed the turn. A resolved Avenger really puts the breaks on a deck like mine. I drew a [Mana Leak](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak) and passed the turn. My opponent cast a [Cultivate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cultivate) and played the land, then attacked with a team of Plants and took the game.

The deck performs surprisingly well against the best decks in the field. It took some elbow grease, but it's still very possible to make a viable deck that doesn't play any rares.

I'd love to hear comments and suggestions from my readers. Hit the forums or shoot me and e-mail with your thoughts.

Happy brewing!
