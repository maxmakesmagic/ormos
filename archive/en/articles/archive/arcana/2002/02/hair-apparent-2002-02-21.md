In the original *Odyssey* Style Guide, Kamahl had short-cropped red hair. (See Jeremy Cranford's [Style Guide article](http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=mtgcom/feature/9) for a picture.) But when Kev Walker sent in the card art for [Kamahl, Pit Fighter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kamahl%2C+Pit+Fighter), our hero was bald. The creative team liked Kamahl's new shiney-domed look, but what about other art featuring the barbarian legend?

The biggest impact was on the card [Kamahl's Desire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kamahl%27s+Desire). Dave Dorman painted on the hair, just like he was supposed to according to the Style Guide. It took a good deal of tinkering with the art to get Kamahl's head shaved just right.

As a side effect, [Barbarian Lunatic](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Barbarian+Lunatic)'s art was changed as well. The original Lunatic art (by Ron Spears) showed a *bald* barbarian wielding a huge sword and axe, and suddenly that picture looked too much like Kamahl! So he was given a shaggy head of hair to prevent confusion. Now that's a hair transplant!
