As you may already be aware, *Worldwake* Prereleases are this weekend. That means this is a pretty good time to show the *Worldwake*-specific tokens, right? We hope you said "Right!" because that's what's happening. It's a little too late to change it now.


Some of these tokens are made by *Worldwake* cards that are already on the [Visual Spoiler](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/tcg/article.aspx?x=mtg/tcg/worldwake/spoiler), so this can also double as a guessing game. Hooray!
