 Mike first played with Ice Age and became the copy editor for DailyMTG.com in December 2011. Before DailyMTG, he was an editor on D&D's Dragon magazine for four years. 






It's Worlds Week! As I write this, we're in Day Two of the World Championship. If you are at all curious about *Magic* being played at its highest level, [check out the coverage](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/2014WC)!



But this is Arcana, where we share things like art and story. The story on Twitter seems to be [Treasure Cruise](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treasure+Cruise) in [Modern](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/2014WC/moderndecklists) and [Courser of Kruphix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Courser+of+Kruphix) in [Standard](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/2014WC/standarddecklists), so let's look at those!



Treasure Cruise
===============



Clan: Sultai


Color: Blue spell


Location: A waterway within [Qarsi Palace](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/planeswalkers-guide-khans-tarkir-part-1-2014-09-03), something like the scene shown [in the world guide]


Action: The Sultai revel in luxury and conspicuous consumption. In this jungle paradise, we see the great pleasure barges of the naga rulers being drawn along the waterway. They, the banks, and the surrounding walls bear paper lanterns of many colors (mainly in the Sultai impression) whose lights reflect from the waters. The boats are decorated with gold and gems, which also reflect the lanterns.


Focus: The barges of treasure


Mood: Ostentatious wealth; spare no expense for our pleasure.

Courser of Kruphix
==================



Color: Green enchantment creature


Location: A bright, daylight, wilderness location of your choice.


Action: Enchantment creatures are creations of the gods. All enchantment creatures have "starfield" in their bodies. Start with the centaur reference. Show a female centaur exploring a wilderness location of your choice. Maybe she stands at the edge of a cliff as she surveys the horizon. Not only do her Nyx areas punch through to the different time of day, but also reveal a different location. If you place her in a forest, maybe the Nyx area shows an ocean shoreâ€”up to you.


Focus: The female centaur


Mood: A mystical explorer of wild lands

Arguably, I could have picked any two recent cards that see a lot of play to showcase here. So as a bonus, how about a third card a lot of people have been talking about recently?



Siege Rhino
===========



Clan: Abzan


Color: Green/white/black creature


Location: Out in the desert sands, with an Abzan fortress in the distance


Action: Show an Abzan war rhino, a large rhinoceros-like creature like the one [in the world guide]. It has a small tent/shelter on its back, and has been outfitted with some piece of white dragonscale armor (like the goat-creatures are wearing [in the world guide]). A couple of Abzan soldiers ride it or walk alongside the rhino as the great beast marches to war.


Focus: The war rhino


Mood: Nothing can stop a clan that employs magnificent beasts like this.
