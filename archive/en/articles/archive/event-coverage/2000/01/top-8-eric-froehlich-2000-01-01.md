Online play has become a popular way for players to enjoy the game at all hours of the day, and it gives the serious players a good way to find worthy competition.


Eric Froehlich, 17, of Springfield, Virginia, is an advocate of such play. He did all of his preparation for this Pro Tour with the members of Gary Wise's IRC channel #wisedraft, such as Wise himself, Kai Budde, Tommi Hovi, Tommi Walamies, and Jens Thoren. Thoren's high finish also speaks for the group's ability in draft.


This marks Froehlich's first individual Top 8, but he did have a high finish in Pro Tour - New York as a member of "A Little Too Sick" with PT veterans Kyle Rose and Kamiel Cornelissen. The fact that Rose would include Froehlich as part of his team even thought the youngster hadn't put up very many impressive results was a fine endorsement. So it should come to no surprise that Froehlich broke through this weekend.


Now he is searching for the right people to playtest with for Pro Tour - Osaka, and with any luck, he'll hook up with the right bunch of people and continue building his Magic resume.
