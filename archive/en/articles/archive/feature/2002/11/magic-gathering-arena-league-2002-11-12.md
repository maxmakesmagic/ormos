With the release of *Time Spiral*, Wizards of the Coast will be retiring the organized play program, Arena. Launched in 1996, Arena enjoyed many years of success across the globe. However, both the game of **Magic** and **Magic** players’ tastes have changed throughout the years. As a result, the company will be discontinuing the Arena program effective immediately.


We are excited to announce the rollout of two new offerings that should meet the demands that Arena once satisfied.


If you are interested in either of the following two offerings and are not a retailer, please ask your local store to sample these tournament kits.


### Magic: The Gathering Intro to the DCI Kit


This kit is available to any store. Retailers may purchase it from their Wizards of the Coast Sales Representative or their preferred Wizards of the Coast authorized distributor.


The kit includes:


* 16 **Magic: The Gathering** premium cards exclusive to the Intro to the DCI Kit
* Suggestions for using this kit to support leagues and tournaments in your store
* A poster with **Magic: The Gathering** art
* An information sheet about other tournament support opportunities
* An informational sheet describing the benefits of running DCI-sanctioned tournaments

The premium cards in this kit can be used as league or tournament prizes by themselves or in combination with other prize support.


### Magic: The Gathering Tournament Support Kit


This kit is available to any store currently running DCI-sanctioned **Magic** tournaments. Retailers may purchase it from their Wizards of the Coast Sales Representative or their preferred Wizards of the Coast authorized distributor.


The kit includes:

* A poster featuring **Magic: The Gathering** art from the current expansion
