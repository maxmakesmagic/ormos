One of the best things to do against combo decks is retrace Raven's Crime several times. One of the best ways to beat aggressive decks is the Life from the Loam/Seismic Assault combo. If you combine those, you'll likely end up with a deck similar to the one Bronson Magnan used to win [Grand Prix Lincoln](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/magazine/article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/eventcoverage/gplin12/welcome).



![Seismic Assault](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Seismic%20Assault&options=)With Deathrite Shaman gone, the only main-deck graveyard hate you'll play against is probably Scavenging Ooze. Clearly, that's an issue, but Scavenging Ooze is easier to beat because it's slower. By the time it's online, you might already have your engine up and running!

The biggest issue with the deck is the lack of consistency. Raven's Crime and Flame Jab aren't exactly powerful when you don't have access to Life from the Loam and there aren't any good cheap tutors available in Modern (for good reason). Faithless Looting does a great job of mitigating those issues, but it doesn't fix everything. Some games, you've got to hope to topdeck Life from the Loam, and in others, you might need to dredge into a Raven's Crime.


When you've got it all, the deck is close to unbeatable, though.
