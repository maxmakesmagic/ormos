The entire *Magic* community is gearing up for new things on the horizon—things like *Eternal Masters* and *Shadows over Innistrad*—and *Khans of Tarkir* is just getting left out in the cold. You may think that [Siege Rhino](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Siege+Rhino) has already had its time in the spotlight, but the show is not quite over yet. *Khans* was a powerful block, and while *Khans of Tarkir* and *Fate Reforged* may be leaving Standard in a few months, there is still plenty of innovation to be done with these cards. Today I'm going to be talking about the best *Khans* block cards for Cube.


First, what is a cube?


A cube is a large pool of cards that is used for drafting and playing Limited games of *Magic*. Most cubes are 360 cards, which is conveniently enough cards to support an eight-player draft. It's also common to build cubes with 720 cards, which allows players to draft their cube twice without seeing any of the same cards. The *Vintage* *Cube* and *Legacy* *Cube* on *Magic Online* follow this structure.


There are many great things about building your own cube. Not only do you get some extra play value out of your cards, but you can also customize your cube however you'd like. If you like Vintage, you can build a cube using the most powerful cards of all time. If you've got a smaller collection, pauper or common-only cubes are both fun and surprisingly powerful. If you prefer certain archetypes, you can build around those. I've seen Modern cubes, multicolor cubes, uncommon cubes, tribal cubes, Limited-archetype-only cubes (think [Burning Vengeance](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Burning+Vengeance) and [Dampen Thought](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dampen+Thought)), and plenty of others. The bottom line is that the possibilities for cubes are endless and you can build your cube to suit your play style and personality.


Getting back on topic, what are some of the best cards in *Khans of Tarkir* and *Fate Reforged* for your cubes? Note that there are a lot of great three-color cards like [Siege Rhino](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Siege+Rhino) that would work well in multicolor cubes, but most cubes do not support three-or-more-color decks, so I will not be talking about those cards today. Many cubes support one- and two-color decks, and one of the most important aspects of building successful cubes is to have archetypes for each color pair. Many of the cards I'll be discussing today will have a specific color pair that they fit best in. Here are my top picks from *Khans of Tarkir* and *Fate Reforged*.


**Sorin, Solemn Visitor**


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Sorin%2C+Solemn+Visitor)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sorin%2C+Solemn+Visitor)
Sorin does a lot of great things in cubes. Control players love him because he can create a Vampire token and then gain life with that token on subsequent turns. Midrange players love him because he can grant all of your creatures lifelink, which can put the game out of reach for some opponents. Where Sorin really shines, however, is in the White-Black Tokens archetype. This is a popular cube archetype that looks to flood the board with tokens through spells such as [Lingering Souls](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lingering+Souls), [Raise the Alarm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Raise+the+Alarm), and [Martial Coup](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Martial+Coup). Sorin can give all of these tokens a nice boost, which can help end the game quickly.


Honorable mentions for the White-Black Tokens archetype: [Herald of Anafenza](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Herald+of+Anafenza) and [Brutal Hordechief](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brutal+Hordechief)


**Monastery Mentor**


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Monastery+Mentor)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Monastery+Mentor)
[Monastery Mentor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Monastery+Mentor) shines in a spell-heavy deck and is great in a color pair like white-blue. [Monastery Mentor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Monastery+Mentor) has sort of spawned a new archetype in cubes. You don't really want to play it in a pure control deck with [Wrath of God](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wrath+of+God) and [Day of Judgment](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Day+of+Judgment), but you'd love to play it in a tempo deck with spells like [Ponder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ponder), [Brainstorm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brainstorm), [Vapor Snag](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vapor+Snag), and [Into the Roil](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Into+the+Roil). Inexpensive counterspells like [Mana Leak](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak) and [Remand](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Remand) are also great with Mentor. Mentor can really get out of hand and can win the game quickly if your deck is built right.


Honorable mentions for the White-Blue Tempo archetype: [Seeker of the Way](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seeker+of+the+Way), [Soulfire Grand Master](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soulfire+Grand+Master), and [Treasure Cruise](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treasure+Cruise)


**Whisperwood Elemental**


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Whisperwood+Elemental)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Whisperwood+Elemental)
Large creatures with utility are great in any green deck. Green-white (and to a lesser extent red-green) makes the best use out of creatures like this, as they are relatively fragile decks that rely on creatures that generate card advantage. Decks like black-green would also love Whisperwood, but they need it far less due to having access to strong removal and discard spells, and they can deal with creatures and other permanents far more reliably. Overall, the green-white archetype wants creatures that can gain an edge or are just harder to deal with than your average green or white creature. [Whisperwood Elemental](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Whisperwood+Elemental) does this perfectly, as it not only makes creatures but also protects your creatures from sweepers.


**Valorous Stance**—Speaking of green-white, [Valorous Stance](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Valorous+Stance) is a fantastic spell for this deck. It has two modes that this type of deck wants: save your creature, or kill an opponent's creature. [Valorous Stance](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Valorous+Stance) isn't great in a deck like Blue-White Control because while killing an opposing creature is great, you're very unlikely to have targets for the first mode. Similarly, the White-Black Tokens archetype also won't find this card useful because you won't have enough meaningful creatures to make the most out of the first mode.


Honorable mentions for the green-white archetype: [Wingmate Roc](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wingmate+Roc) and [Warden of the First Tree](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Warden+of+the+First+Tree)


**See the Unwritten**


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=See+the+Unwritten)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=See+the+Unwritten)
[See the Unwritten](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=See+the+Unwritten) is a card that never caught on in Standard but has lots of uses in Cube. This card shines mostly in a strategy that uses [Show and Tell](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Show+and+Tell), [Eureka](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eureka), [Sneak Attack](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sneak+Attack), or [Tooth and Nail](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tooth+and+Nail). Let's call this the "Sneak and Show" archetype. What's more fun than drafting a pile of giant monsters along with ways to sneak them onto the battlefield? The most fun creature (for you, not your opponent) is definitely [Emrakul, the Aeons Torn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Emrakul%2C+the+Aeons+Torn), but large creatures with strong enters-the-battlefield triggers, such as [Dragonlord Atarka](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragonlord+Atarka) and [Grave Titan](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grave+Titan), are also great with [See the Unwritten](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=See+the+Unwritten).


**Clever Impersonator**


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Clever+Impersonator)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Clever+Impersonator)
[Clone](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Clone)s are very common in Cube. My favorites are [Sakashima's Student](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sakashima%27s+Student) (Ninjas!) and [Phantasmal Image](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phantasmal+Image). What I like about [Clever Impersonator](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Clever+Impersonator) is that it can copy any permanent on the battlefield, not just a creature. We have all copied [Grave Titan](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grave+Titan)s and [Thragtusk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thragtusk)s before, but have you ever copied a [Jace, the Mind Sculptor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace%2C+the+Mind+Sculptor) or [Elspeth, Knight-Errant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elspeth%2C+Knight-Errant)? [Clever Impersonator](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Clever+Impersonator) is great in archetypes that don't have many ways to deal with planeswalkers, like White-Blue Control or Blue-Black Control.


Honorable mentions for the control archetype: [Dig Through Time](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dig+Through+Time), [Disdainful Stroke](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Disdainful+Stroke), and [Ugin, the Spirit Dragon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ugin%2C+the+Spirit+Dragon)


**Bloodsoaked Champion**


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Bloodsoaked+Champion)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodsoaked+Champion)
[Bloodsoaked Champion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodsoaked+Champion) works well in a black aggro deck, but I think it shines the most in an archetype like Black-Green Aristocrats. In Black-Green Aristocrats, you are looking to sacrifice your creatures to gain an advantage. [Blood Artist](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Artist), [Zulaport Cutthroat](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Zulaport+Cutthroat), and [Nantuko Husk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nantuko+Husk) are the most commonly played cards that reward you for sacrificing your own creatures. [Bloodsoaked Champion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodsoaked+Champion) can enter the battlefield as early as turn one and get in some quick damage, and after that he can be used as sacrifice fodder. Any time you attack, you can return it to the battlefield for 1B, and you can do this as many times as you want. If you have six lands in play, you can return it three times—and with [Blood Artist](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Artist) and [Zulaport Cutthroat](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Zulaport+Cutthroat) in play, all of that life loss really adds up.


Honorable mention for Black-Green Sacrifice: [Grim Haruspex](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grim+Haruspex)


**Monastery Swiftspear**


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Monastery+Swiftspear)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Monastery+Swiftspear)
[Monastery Swiftspear](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Monastery+Swiftspear) made a huge impact across all formats, and it's no surprise that it's also great for Cube. Mono-Red Aggro is a widely popular Cube archetype that most cubes support. Tiny creatures and burn are the all-stars here, and [Monastery Swiftspear](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Monastery+Swiftspear) is a tiny creature that has great synergy with burn. It would be foolish not to include it in your cube!


**Goblin Heelcutter**


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Goblin+Heelcutter)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Heelcutter)
Mono-red picks up a lot from *Khans* block. Dash is one of the more powerful aggressive mechanics in recent history. It's great at keeping your creatures out of range of sorcery-speed removal and can also sneak in those last few points of damage. [Goblin Heelcutter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Heelcutter) is especially useful because it can make an opposing creature unable to block, and with dash this will often be a game-ending surprise to the opponent.


Honorable mentions for the mono-red archetype: [Mardu Scout](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mardu+Scout), [Hordeling Outburst](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hordeling+Outburst), [Outpost Siege](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Outpost+Siege), and [Wild Slash](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Slash)


**Tasigur, the Golden Fang**


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Tasigur%2C+the+Golden+Fang)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tasigur%2C+the+Golden+Fang)
[Tasigur, the Golden Fang](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tasigur%2C+the+Golden+Fang) has made appearances in both Standard and Modern due to the delve mechanic being super strong. Efficient cantrips like [Preordain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Preordain) and [Serum Visions](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Serum+Visions) as well as fetch lands can fuel delve and help you cast Tasigur very early in the game—sometimes as early as turn two! There is really no specific archetype for Tasigur; any black deck will love a turn-two 4/5 creature.


Honorable mentions for delve decks: [Hooting Mandrills](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hooting+Mandrills) and [Gurmag Angler](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gurmag+Angler)


**Last but Not Least—The Fetch Lands**


![](https://media.wizards.com/2016/images/daily/PL20160301_sofetch.png)


The five *Khans of Tarkir* fetch lands have been Cube staples ever since Cube Drafting has been around, although in the beginning they were known as the *Onslaught*fetch lands. Fetches are useful for a variety of things, the most common being fixing your mana. They have great synergy with dual lands such as [Underground Sea](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Underground+Sea) and [Watery Grave](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Watery+Grave), and help tremendously in allowing you to play more than two colors. They also fuel delve, thin your deck, and shuffle your library after a [Brainstorm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brainstorm) or a [Scroll Rack](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scroll+Rack) activation.


Wrapping Up
===========


Cube Draft is a fantastic format, and while it may look intimidating to get into due to the sheer number of cards you need, it's actually quite fun to build a cube and tweak it over time. There is a cube for everybody, and *Khans of Tarkir* block is a great way to get into the format. *Khans* block especially has a high number of Cube-worthy cards, including plenty of commons and uncommons to get you started!


Thanks for reading and see you next time!
