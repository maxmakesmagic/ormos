### Game 1

Both players kept their starting hands. Armin, playing red/green, had a strong opening with [Wellwisher](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wellwisher) and [Timberwatch Elf](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Timberwatch+Elf). A third turn [Wall of Deceit](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wall+of+Deceit) stopped the bleeding for some time, while [Annex](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Annex) stole one of Armin's mountains. Would it only produce colorless mana, or may Dirk be able to use red mana, for a splashed removal or even an enchant creature? The blue/white mage went to the air with an [Ascending Aven](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ascending+Aven), while a [Crested Craghorn](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crested+Craghorn) got rid of the wall, meaning that dirk needed a new defense, which swiftly came with the aforementioned enchant creature: [Lavamancer's Skill](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lavamancer%27s+Skill)s. "I've used it better in the past" said Dirk after playing it on a bird soldier to shoot the [Crested Craghorn](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crested+Craghorn).

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gppra03/a889.jpg)The skilled bird's life was over the next turn, when Armin played an explosion for 7 on it, putting a [Bloodstoke Howler](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodstoke+Howler) on bottom of his library. [Mistform Dreamer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mistform+Dreamer) and [Keeneye Aven](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Keeneye+Aven) let the beating continue trough the air, while [Symbiotic Wurm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Symbiotic+Wurm) gave the elves some help. A morph, a [Battlefield Medic](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Battlefield+Medic) and a [Grassland Crusader](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grassland+Crusader) joined the ranks of the blue/white mage's army in consecutive turns. [Symbiotic Wurm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Symbiotic+Wurm) went to the red zone, but died a horrible death to [Grassland Crusader](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grassland+Crusader) leaving the field with 4 insect tokens.

At the end of Dirk's next turn, Armin put an insect token into play at with vitality charm, and swung with 5 insects, which got all blocked. [Tribal Unity](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tribal+Unity)? Of course. 4 soldiers went to the graveyard. The crowd sheered as their favorite came into play hit play next turn. The insects swung again, putting Dirk at 2 and Armin made a [Krosan Groundshaker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Krosan+Groundshaker). [Crowd Favorites](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crowd+Favorites) stopped the Groundshaker, but every other of Armin's creatures charged, while he had played a face down creature before combat. Unable to block every creature, Dirk let 1 insect trough. If the face down creature was a Giant Growth effect or a direct damage, the game was over. Sure enough it was a [Patron of the Wild](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Patron+of+the+Wild).

Baberowski-Birner: 0-1

Game 2 

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gppra03/a890.jpg)Dirk played first with a second turn [Battlefield Medic](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Battlefield+Medic) and a third turn morph, while Armin cycled a [Barkhide Mauler](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Barkhide+Mauler) and had no third, nor fourth turn play, but a fifth turn [Skirk Outrider](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skirk+Outrider). Dirk lost a morph to a [Vitality Charm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vitality+Charm)ed [Skirk Outrider](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skirk+Outrider) and made a [Grassland Crusader](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grassland+Crusader). Finally [Symbiotic Beast](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Symbiotic+Beast) hit play, and the tiny goblin grew to a 4/4 monster. Another [Skirk Outrider](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skirk+Outrider) and a [Needleshot Gourna](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Needleshot+Gourna) doubled Armin's forced, at the same time holding back the freshly cast [Mistform Dreamer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mistform+Dreamer) and [Cloudreach Cavalry](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloudreach+Cavalry) until [Crowd Favorites](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crowd+Favorites) hit the board, eventually tapping the Gourna and let the fliers trough for the next few turns.

But it was time for Armin to act, and after playing [Stonewood Invoker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stonewood+Invoker) and [Barkhide Mauler](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Barkhide+Mauler), he swung with everything but his [Needleshot Gourna](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Needleshot+Gourna), which got tapped. No big effect, Dirk lost a morph and Cavalry, Armin an Outrider and a Mauler. Dirk gave a dreamer the needed skills to kill an elf who could mutate into a 7/7 monster. Armin's [Erratic Explosion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Erratic+Explosion), which revealed [Timberwatch Elf](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Timberwatch+Elf), wasn't enough to get rid of the Dreamer, as Dirk could prevent 3 with Medic. Eventually he won trough the air. 

"I didn't have a real chance the whole game" concluded Armin  
 "True" replied Dirk 

1-1

### Game 3

Birner chose to start, while fortune wasn't on Baberowski's side, as he had to mulligan. Armin led the game with a [Sparksmith](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sparksmith), [Timberwatch Elf](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Timberwatch+Elf) and a [Spitfire Handler](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spitfire+Handler).

" I can't beat this", said Dirk Baberowski as he packed his cards.

**Final Result:** Armin Birner beats Dirk Baberowski 2-1 and advances to Top 8
