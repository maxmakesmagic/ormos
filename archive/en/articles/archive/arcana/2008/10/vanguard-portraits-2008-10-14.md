Vanguard cards aren't a recent invention for **Magic Online**. They were originally created for the old Arena League in 1997 and worked the same way. Each player would put out his or her card:

...and the game would proceed as normal, albeit with dramatic effects on both players.


Vanguard came in two seasons, which we've mentioned before in **Magic Arcana** ([Season 1](/en/articles/archive/vanguard-series-1-2002-09-23) on September 23, 2002; and [Season 2](/en/articles/archive/vanguard-series-2-2002-10-09) on October 2, 2002), but we've never really touched on one aspect: at the time, it was very rare to even see a planeswalker in the background of a card, let alone be the subject. Oh, you'd sometimes see Urza yelling at Barrin or something, but to see Serra herself? Not that common! And there were other characters (like Gix) who were more behind-the-scenes origins of [Ring of Gix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Ring%2Bof%2BGix) and [Claws of Gix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Claws%2Bof%2BGix) than front-and-center card subjects. Except for Vanguard! So here's some of the Vanguard artwork, nice and large, so you can get a good look at these people! And demons. And planeswalkers.
