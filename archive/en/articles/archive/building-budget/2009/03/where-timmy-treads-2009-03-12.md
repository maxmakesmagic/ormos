Jacob Van Lunen began playing Magic in 1995. He has participated in organized play at every level of competition and was a member of the winning team at Pro Tour San Diego in 2007, thanks to an innovative draft strategy. As a writer, Van Lunen has had more than three hundred Magic strategy pieces published 






Hellow and welcome to Timmy Week here on **magicthegathering.com**. I've been excited about this particular column for awhile now.

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/boab/boab29_whyIsHePlayingThat.jpg)Who is Timmy? Timmy plays the game to have fun. Many players will see people playing wacky cards or offbeat combos and ask a question like, "Why is he playing with that?" Timmy doesn't play **Magic** to solve metagames or to win tournaments. Timmy just wants to have a good time.

There are four types of Timmy. A quick summary:

* Power gamers like to play big spells and big creatures. They equate quantity of damage, power/toughness, and spells' effects with how much fun the game is.
* Social gamers play to spend time with their friends. They enjoy multiplayer formats and treat **Magic** as something to do while hanging out.
* Diversity gamers want to see what **Magic** has to offer. They'll play a different format every day of the week and happily move along over and over. You'll rarely ever see a diversity gamer playing the same deck twice.
* Adrenalin gamers live for the thrill of the moment. They like coin-flip cards, Erratic Explosions, and great topdecks.

Like a lot of people, when I think about Timmy, I think about the power gamer. I remember playing Magic on a picnic table during recess. I remember casting [Shivan Dragon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shivan+Dragon) and [Baron Sengir](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Baron+Sengir). I remember loving every minute of it.

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/boab/boab29_cross1.jpg)  
One card sprang to mind when I found out there was going to be a Timmy Week:

![Where Ancients Tread](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Where+Ancients+Tread)  
[Where Ancients Tread](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Where+Ancients+Tread)!

I want to play with Where Ancients Tread because it's fun. I'm trying to get into the Timmy mindset here, and I can't think of a better way to do it. Timmy is not satisfied with his 5-power monster. Timmy wants his 5-power beater to deal 5-damage to something when it comes into play.

Now it's time to decide what we can put into our [Where Ancients Tread](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Where+Ancients+Tread) deck.

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/boab/boab29_cross2.jpg)  
**[Druid of the Anima](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Druid+of+the+Anima)**: I want to cast big goofy monsters. I don't want my opponents to overrun me with little dudes before I can play the fat. Acceleration is important. The Druid will also help fix my mana.

**[Llanowar Elves](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Llanowar+Elves)**: I'm playing Llanowar Elves for the same ramping purpose as Druid of the Anima.

**[Devoted Druid](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Devoted+Druid)**: This lovely individual ramps our mana extremely quickly.

**[Elvish Visionary](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elvish+Visionary)**: I want chump-blockers for the early stages of the game. As the game progresses my Visionary can combo with my [Stampeding Wildebeests](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stampeding+Wildebeests) or be sacrificed to my [Caldera Hellion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Caldera+Hellion).

**[Stampeding Wildebeests](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stampeding+Wildebeests)**: These guys are a lot of fun here. I can return an [Elvish Visionary](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elvish+Visionary) or [Civic Wayfinder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Civic+Wayfinder) back to my hand and replay it every turn. If I get [Where Ancients Tread](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Where+Ancients+Tread) into play I can start bouncing 5-power monsters back to my hand to [Lava Axe](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lava+Axe) my opponent every turn.

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/boab/boab29_cross3.jpg)  
**[Civic Wayfinder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Civic+Wayfinder)**: This respectable 2/2 will smooth out my mana and help me survive the early stages of the game.

**[Caldera Hellion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Caldera+Hellion)**: The Hellion will clear my opponent's board and make way for the fatty boom-booms.

**[Flameblast Dragon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flameblast+Dragon)**: I looked through [Gatherer](http://beta.gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Default.aspx) to find cards that just screamed "TIMMY!", and this screams it with fire.

**[Deus of Calamity](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deus+of+Calamity)**: I love dropping the Deus on people. It's a very underplayed card that's a lot of fun to play with.

Once we mash all this fat together the list looks like this:

The Casual Room on **Magic Online** is a great place to find other people who want to crash big creatures into bigger creatures, so that's where I headed.

### Game 1 vs. Esper

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/boab/boab29_master.jpg)I keep [Llanowar Elves](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Llanowar+Elves), [Devoted Druid](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Devoted+Druid), [Forest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest), [Mountain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mountain), [Deus of Calamity](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deus+of+Calamity), [Where Ancients Tread](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Where+Ancients+Tread), and [Elvish Visionary](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elvish+Visionary) on the play. I lead off with my [Llanowar Elves](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Llanowar+Elves). My opponent plays an [Arcane Sanctum](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arcane+Sanctum) and passes. I draw another [Deus of Calamity](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deus+of+Calamity), attack for 1 with my [Llanowar Elves](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Llanowar+Elves), play my [Devoted Druid](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Devoted+Druid), and pass the turn. My opponent plays an [Island](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island) and a [Tidehollow Strix](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tidehollow+Strix). I draw a [Mountain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mountain) and pause to think for a moment.

I know it is probably correct to play a [Deus of Calamity](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deus+of+Calamity) here, but I decide to go for the Timmy moment. I play my [Where Ancients Tread](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Where+Ancients+Tread) and pass the turn. My opponent plays a Plains and a [Master of Etherium](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Master+of+Etherium) before attacking for 3 in the air. On my turn I draw a [Flameblast Dragon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flameblast+Dragon), and I slam down the Dragon in the most thunderous way I know how when playing on the Internet. [Where Ancients Tread](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Where+Ancients+Tread) triggers and I destroy my opponent's Strix. My opponent untaps and plays [Sculpting Steel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sculpting+Steel) creating a copy of his [Master of Etherium](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Master+of+Etherium) before passing. I draw a [Stampeding Wildebeests](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stampeding+Wildebeests) and play my [Deus of Calamity](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deus+of+Calamity), destroying a [Master of Etherium](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Master+of+Etherium). I attack with my [Flameblast Dragon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flameblast+Dragon) and pass. My opponent puts a temporary stop to my Timmy fun with [Wrath of God](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wrath+of+God). I draw a Forest and play [Stampeding Wildebeests](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stampeding+Wildebeests) dealing my opponent 5 damage. He untaps and plays [Tidehollow Sculler](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tidehollow+Sculler) taking my [Deus of Calamity](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deus+of+Calamity). On my turn I return the Wildebeests back to my hand, draw another [Forest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest), and play the Wildebeests again, putting my opponent at 4 life. My opponent plays another [Master of Etherium](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Master+of+Etherium). On my turn I replay the [Stampeding Wildebeests](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stampeding+Wildebeests) and the game is over.

 1-0 ### Game 2 vs. White Weenie

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/boab/boab29_paladin.jpg)I mulligan and keep [Druid of the Anima](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Druid+of+the+Anima), [Forest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest), [Forest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest), [Civic Wayfinder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Civic+Wayfinder), [Caldera Hellion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Caldera+Hellion), and [Flameblast Dragon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flameblast+Dragon) on the play. My opponent plays a [Plains](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plains) and passes. I draw [Llanowar Elves](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Llanowar+Elves) and play them. My opponent plays a [Knight of Meadowgrain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Knight+of+Meadowgrain) and passes. I draw [Elvish Visionary](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elvish+Visionary), play my [Civic Wayfinder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Civic+Wayfinder) getting a [Mountain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mountain), and pass. My opponent plays a [Spirit Link](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spirit+Link) on [Knight of Meadowgrain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Knight+of+Meadowgrain) before playing [Sigiled Paladin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sigiled+Paladin). He attacks me for 3 and gains 6 life (thanks to double lifelink). On my turn I draw another [Elvish Visionary](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elvish+Visionary). I play the first Visionary and find another [Mountain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mountain), then play the second and find another [Flameblast Dragon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flameblast+Dragon). My opponent untaps, plays another [Sigiled Paladin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sigiled+Paladin), and attacks me for 4, gaining 8 life. On my turn I draw a Forest and play my second Mountain before blowing up the world and ending up with a 6/6 [Caldera Hellion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Caldera+Hellion) on the table. My opponent plays [Kitchen Finks](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kitchen+Finks) and passes. I draw another [Civic Wayfinder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Civic+Wayfinder) and attack with my 6/6, and my opponent chump-blocks with [Kitchen Finks](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kitchen+Finks). I play [Civic Wayfinder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Civic+Wayfinder) and [Druid of the Anima](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Druid+of+the+Anima) before passing. My opponent attacks with [Kitchen Finks](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kitchen+Finks) and I trade my [Civic Wayfinder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Civic+Wayfinder). On my turn I play [Flameblast Dragon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flameblast+Dragon). A few swings later and my opponent is left charred and defeated.

 2-0 ### Game 3 vs. Bant

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/boab/boab29_battlegrace.jpg)I keep [Forest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest), [Forest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest), [Forest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest), [Elvish Visionary](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elvish+Visionary), [Civic Wayfinder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Civic+Wayfinder), [Deus of Calamity](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deus+of+Calamity), [Flameblast Dragon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flameblast+Dragon), and [Where Ancients Tread](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Where+Ancients+Tread) on the draw. My opponent plays a [Seaside Citadel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seaside+Citadel) and passes. I draw another [Flameblast Dragon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flameblast+Dragon), play a [Forest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest), and pass. My opponent plays another [Seaside Citadel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seaside+Citadel). I play [Elvish Visionary](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elvish+Visionary) drawing a [Stampeding Wildebeests](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stampeding+Wildebeests) and pass. My opponent plays a Plains and a [Rhox War Monk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rhox+War+Monk). I draw a [Mountain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mountain), play my [Civic Wayfinder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Civic+Wayfinder) getting another [Mountain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mountain), and pass. My opponent attacks for three, plays another [Rhox War Monk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rhox+War+Monk), and passes.

3-2

I think Timmy would be happy with this little brew. The deck plays big monsters and has a lot of fun interactions between cards.

Remember the most important lesson Timmy has to offer: Have fun. This is a game, and it should be treated like one. I don't think having fun is exclusive Timmy territory. I have fun every time I sit down to play a game of **Magic**, whether it be on my kitchen table or under the bright lights at the Pro Tour.

Now embrace your inner Timmy and build some decks with [Titanic Ultimatum](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Titanic+Ultimatum)!

Happy brewing!
