Step 1. **Magic**'s creative team writes descriptions of creatures, locations and items in a new world in the **Magic** multiverse.

Step 2. Artists create concept sketches from those descriptions to go into that world's style guide.

Step 3. Card artists illustrate individual **Magic** cards based on the style guide.

Today we'll take a look at the *Mirrodin* block during Step 2, the creation of the style guide.

Red in the *Mirrodin* block is about [mountains](/en/articles/archive/mirrodin-environments-red-2003-10-30) of rusted iron, crude goblin contraptions, and creatures with spikes and blades. Check out a few illustrations of red-aligned artifacts the style guide, and compare them with the final art of cards like [Goblin War Machine](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+War+Machine), [Juggernaut](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Juggernaut), and [Goblin Replica](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Replica).
