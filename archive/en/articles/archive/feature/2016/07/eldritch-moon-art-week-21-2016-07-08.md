The full [Card Image Gallery](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/card-image-gallery/eldritch-moon) is up!


There's a ton to go through—Limited cards and archetypes get filled out, hidden gems get discovered, and the full scope of what the set is doing is revealed. It can be a bit overwhelming.


So why don't you take a break and do the *Magic* equivalent of stopping to smell the roses—enjoy some of the lovely art from cards we've previewed this week. This week's themes are the Gatewatch and Zombies! Click any image below to open it in its own window.


Enjoy!
