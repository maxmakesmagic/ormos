 Stybs has played Magic the world over, writing and drafting as part of the event coverage team and slinging Commander everywhere his decks will fit. 






There's more than meets the eye as Transformers cards arrive to *Magic: The Gathering*'s *Universes Beyond—*in two stunning looks—when *Magic*'s next set [*The Brothers' War*](https://magic.wizards.com/en/products/the-brothers-war) releases November 18, 2022.

Transformers cards use the set code "BOT" and feature their own set symbol. These cards aren't Standard legal, but can be played in Commander, Legacy, and Vintage.

These beautiful double-faced cards appear in two versions, one with artwork evocative of their Generation 1 television debut in the 1980s and the other as their Shattered Glass reimagining—an alternate universe where the heroes we know are the villains we face, and vice versa.

Just like the Transformers robots you know and love, these representations can convert—or "transform" like existing double-faced cards—from their robot to their vehicle or other alternate form, and back again. And with the More Than Meets the Eye ability, you can bring them out onto the battlefield directly as their alternate non-robot form!
