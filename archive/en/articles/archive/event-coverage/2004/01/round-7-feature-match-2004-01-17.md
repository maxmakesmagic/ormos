Turian responded, "Well, you have to get lucky to go 6-0." This is the third draft of the day, and the winner will go to sleep with a perfect 7-0 record, and both will start tomorrow with the exact same deck. ### Game 1

Jonsson played a first turn [Auriok Transfixer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Auriok+Transfixer), and Turian played [Sunbeam Spellbomb](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sunbeam+Spellbomb). The curve continued as Jonsson played a turn two [Leonin Skyhunter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leonin+Skyhunter), and a [Viridian Longbow](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Viridian+Longbow). [Raise the Alarm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Raise+the+Alarm) on end step gave Jonsson even more threats, while Turian just had a Talisman and [Neurok Hoversail](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Neurok+Hoversail). [Altar's Light](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Altar%27s+Light) took care of the Longbow, but Jonsson team still got through for five damage. [Arrest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arrest) stopped the Skyhunter, so the 1/1s attacked for three, bringing Turian to eight. [Blinding Beam](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blinding+Beam) slowed things down even more, and Jonsson summoned [Hematite Golem](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hematite+Golem). Turian played [Goblin Replica](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Replica), and had enough mana left over to activate it if need be. It traded with the Golem, and Jonsson kept the threats coming with [Skyhunter Cub](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skyhunter+Cub). Turian had yet another [Blinding Beam](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blinding+Beam), so only the Soldier tokens attacked, bringing him down to five. [Electrostatic Bolt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Electrostatic+Bolt) and [Awe Strike](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Awe+Strike) couldn't prevent the inevitable, as Turian ran out of cards that would slow down Jonsson's attack.

Jonsson- 1 Turian- 0

### Game 2

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/ptams04/fm13_3.jpg)Turian started with a Longbow, and Jonsson cast [Chromatic Sphere](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chromatic+Sphere). [Steel Wall](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Steel+Wall) came out on turn two, as Turian missed his second land drop. Jonsson played a Talisman and a Longbow, and Turian played a Longbow of his own. Jonsson was stuck at two lands himself, but the Talisman allowed him to play a [Cathodion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cathodion). Turian finally drew a second land, and used it to play a Talisman. The [Steel Wall](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Steel+Wall) blocked the [Cathodion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cathodion), and [Granite Shard](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Granite+Shard) came out to deal the final point of damage and kill it. Turian untapped, and used [Electrostatic Bolt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Electrostatic+Bolt) to kill the [Cathodion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cathodion). Jonsson summoned [Goblin War Wagon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+War+Wagon), and Turian simply cycled through a Spellbomb. [Vulshok Gauntlets](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vulshok+Gauntlets) on the Wagon gave Jonsson a seven damage attacker, and Turian played [Goblin Replica](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Replica). Jonsson chose not to untap the Wagon, and played a second [Granite Shard](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Granite+Shard) to get a sarcastic "great" out of Turian. The Shards took down the Replica, and Turian attacked with a Berserker for three. The Wagon now untapped and dealt eight damage thanks to a [Leonin Scimitar](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leonin+Scimitar), bringing Turian to three where the Shards would have been able to finish him off. A [Sunbeam Spellbomb](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sunbeam+Spellbomb) provided five life to barely keep him alive, and the Shards killed the Berserker. [Blinding Beam](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blinding+Beam) stopped the Wagon for one attack, since it untapped thanks to its special ability on the following turn. Turian's [Skyhunter Cub](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skyhunter+Cub) was tapped down with [Blinding Beam](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blinding+Beam), letting the Wagon get through for the win.

Jonsson- 2 Turian- 0
