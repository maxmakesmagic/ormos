We asked a couple of players how to beat Abzan, arguably the biggest deck in the format and the one match-up one absolutely has to have a plan against …


How do You Beat Abzan?
======================





![](https://media.wizards.com/2014/events/gpsto14/qq_severin.jpg)
***Thoralf Severin:** With [Hornet Queen](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hornet+Queen)! Trading five to one is pretty good and returning it with [Whip of Erebos](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Whip+of+Erebos) is absoluetly insane.* 


![](https://media.wizards.com/2014/events/gpsto14/qq_zatlkaj.jpg)
***Matej Zatlkaj:** By being aggressive and exploiting their lack of consistency, punish their bad draws, ignore [Siege Rhino](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Siege+Rhino). Either that or go over the top with control or delve strategies.*

***Oliver Polak-Rottmann:** Grind out the game with better late-game options. [Siege Rhino](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Siege+Rhino) doesn't affect the Sultai deck.*

***Denniz Rachid:** My plan is to play better; my deck probably has a 50-50 match-up against Abzan—like most decks really.*
