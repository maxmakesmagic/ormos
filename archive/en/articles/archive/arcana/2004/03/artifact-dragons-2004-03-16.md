**[Clockwork Dragon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Clockwork+Dragon)** is only the most recent member of an elite group: it is one of only four artifact creatures in **Magic** with the Dragon creature type. This illustrious gang of clanking lizards has been ravaging opponents' life totals since *Mirage*.

Illustrating an artifact dragon is an interesting challenge for an artist. How do you represent the creature's artifact nature while expressing the majestic and destructive power of a dragon? Today's Magic Arcana takes a close-up look at these four draconic automata in all their glory.
