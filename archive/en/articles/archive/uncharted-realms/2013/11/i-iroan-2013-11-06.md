*The **ode** is a Classical form of [lyric poetry](http://www.poets.org/viewmedia.php/prmMID/5784). Its name comes from the Greek* aeidein*, "to sing," and this sort of poem was intended to be performed at public occasions to dancing and the strains of lyre and flute.  
  

The most famous composer of odes in the ancient Greek world was [Pindar](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pindar), who is credited with inventing the form. His poems memorialized the winners of athletic competitions but also incorporated lofty ideals of philosophy and religion.  
  

In this piece, I attempted to recall the lyrical style of Pindar in a victory ode to the champion of [the Iroan Games in Akros](/en/articles/archive/making-magic/planeswalkers-guide-theros-part-2-2013-08-28).*

Sing , elegant Muses of star-dappled Nyx  

The joyous name of Him, glory-crowned,  

Who raises victor's pennant o'er battle ground,  

Bestows His love on th' highest of poleis,  

Bold Akros, paragon preeminent  

In war, in peace eternal vigilant.  

The Kolophon's apex blazes higher  

Than sun-spear Khrusor's sacred fire  

And Purphoros's forge; Keranan bolt  

Of prophecy its epic ramparts smote.  

Yet, eclipsing all, Thine aegis gleams,  

Philomachos, who shields the deme.

Brows bent, we pray, as Thou Anax  

Endowed, in holy tournaments,  

The wreath of mortal excellence,  

Now bless Thy child, Pandamator.  

Athlete superb, famed pankratist,  

Euphoric in victory rose-kissed.  

O tetrapteric-helmed, spear-shaking  

Fame's epitome, bright-shining  

Hoplite's lord, Iroas, hegemon.  

Enthusiasts, eyes bright, oiled skin,  

Thy happy youth, physiques aglow,  

Gymnastic offertory show.  

Akroan heir, the weighty pallium  

Of honor lies, god's panoply,  

On your character. Let all see  

Humility, not hubris, as befits  

Your family, Stratians, throne;  

Or fall to grim Erebos, disowned.  

Th'empyrial heights where Nymosyne,  

Arissa, Lanathos, so many  

Strove, whose phalanxes monsters slew  

And kakomancers sent below,  

Echo sweet paeans. In agora raise  

Kylix and pause in reverent praise.
