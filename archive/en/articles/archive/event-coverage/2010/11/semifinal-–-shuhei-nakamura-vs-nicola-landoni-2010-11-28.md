While Nakamura's victory over Tommi Lindgren was rather mundane, it's fair to assume that Landoni's heart was thumping wildly after a last-card win over Jorg Unfried of Germany. Nakamura had Player of the Year to think of, while Landoni was all about the here and now in his first Grand Prix top 8.


[Trigon of Rage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Trigon+of+Rage) and [Horizon Spellbomb](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Horizon+Spellbomb) from Nakamura faced a classic opening for the Italian. [Silver Myr](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Silver+Myr), and then [Argent Sphinx](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Argent+Sphinx), with [Chrome Steed](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chrome+Steed) not far behind. Nakamura cast and then attacked with [Ferrovore](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ferrovore), with Landoni happy to take the damage. This was, after all, a race he was currently winning. [Tangle Angler](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tangle+Angler) threatened to change things somewhat, Landoni sending the Sphinx in for a second time before dropping a matching pair of [Auriok Replica](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Auriok+Replica)s.


For the first time in the match, the pace slowed, as Nakamura forced one of the Replicas to block his [Tangle Angler](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tangle+Angler), using [Trigon of Rage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Trigon+of+Rage) to raise the Angler to lethal on the Replica. Landoni equipped his [Chrome Steed](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chrome+Steed) with [Bladed Pinions](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bladed+Pinions) and piled in once more. 16, 12, 4, dead.


Now that was brutal.


**Nakamura 0 – 1 Landoni**

The Japanese former Player of the Year had seen little cause for optimism in game one, which a mulligan from Landoni did little to change. Mana Myr traded in the early going of game two, Nakamura assembling an average [Ferrovore](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ferrovore) and [Wall of Tanglecord](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wall+of+Tanglecord), Landoni bringing a distinctly not-average [Grand Architect](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grand+Architect), plus [Auriok Replica](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Auriok+Replica) equipped with [Bladed Pinions](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bladed+Pinions). The [Trinket Mage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Trinket+Mage) from Landoni that followed was decent, fetching [Darksteel Axe](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Darksteel+Axe), which also joined [Bladed Pinions](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bladed+Pinions) on the [Auriok Replica](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Auriok+Replica).


[Turn to Slag](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Turn+to+Slag) must have been the fear, but Nakamura contented himself with back to back [Molder Beast](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Molder+Beast)s. Nakamura had [Wing Puncture](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wing+Puncture) for the [Auriok Replica](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Auriok+Replica), using a [Molder Beast](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Molder+Beast) to deal it five damage. [Trinket Mage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Trinket+Mage) became the new bearer of assorted equipment.


For the third time, Nakamura spent five mana on a creature, this time the 4/2 [Saberclaw Golem](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Saberclaw+Golem). Now Landoni sent the equipment to yet another new home, the [Grand Architect](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grand+Architect), while Nakamura cast the [Tangle Angler](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tangle+Angler) that had struggled in game one. Still, this time the 1/5 might be able to sculpt an enormous attack in a classic 'yoo-hoo, look at meeeee everybody!' moment. In came the Angler, the [Ferrovore](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ferrovore), the [Saberclaw Golem](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Saberclaw+Golem), both [Molder Beast](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Molder+Beast)s. With no tricks, Landoni took a humungous sixteen damage, dropping to two, and there was no comeback from there.

Surely Nakamura wasn't about to pull out yet another victory, against a deck that looked clearly superior?


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Tempered%20Steel)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tempered%20Steel)
[Perilous Myr](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Perilous+Myr) and [Snapsail Glider](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snapsail+Glider) was a good opening for Landoni, with [Chrome Steed](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chrome+Steed) on turn four. By then all Nakamura had was three land and a [Throne of Geth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Throne+of+Geth). Still, his fourth turn tilted things more favorably, with [Oxidda Scrapmelter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oxidda+Scrapmelter) destroying the [Chrome Steed](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chrome+Steed) before it could overrun him entirely.


Landoni continued aggressively, attacking before adding [Vedalken Certarch](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vedalken+Certarch) to the battlefield, with Metalcraft already online. Nakamura Imprinted [Clone Shell](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Clone+Shell), and passed. He used [Throne of Geth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Throne+of+Geth) to sacrifice the Shell, revealing a second [Clone Shell](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Clone+Shell) underneath, which Landoni aimed [Disperse](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Disperse) at. Nakamuia was still in big trouble, though, as Landoni pounded into the red zone once more with [Snapsail Glider](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snapsail+Glider), [Auriok Replica](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Auriok+Replica), and [Perilous Myr](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Perilous+Myr), with [Riddlesmith](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Riddlesmith) up next.


Nakamura returned [Clone Shell](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Clone+Shell) to play, but Landoni had a big fat [Tempered Steel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tempered+Steel) just around the corner, straight from the top of his deck, which drew a breath from the large crowd. [Snapsail Glider](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snapsail+Glider) dropped Shuhei to just four life. He checked. He checked again. And he extended the hand in, as always, gracious defeat.
