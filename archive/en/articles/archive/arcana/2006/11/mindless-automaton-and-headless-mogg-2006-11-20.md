[Mindless Automaton](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Mindless%2BAutomaton), an *Exodus* card enjoying new life in the current Standard alongside its other *Time Spiral* timeshifted brethren, is an artifact creature on a rampage. The brainchild of some mad Rathi artificer, it shreds its way through a crowd of [fleeing moggs](http://ww2.wizards.com/gatherer/index.aspx?term=mogg&Field_Name=on&Field_Rules=on&Field_Type=on&typefilter=Creatures). Its skullcap crackles with stolen intellectual energy, the fuel on which it runs. If it feeds on thoughts, then why is it hunting moggs, a race known for its *lack* of, let's say, mental tastiness?

Brian Snoddy's art depicts the automaton engaged in gob-clamping frenzy. We can see evidence of its frustration (if an iron-riveted artifact creature can feel such a thing) in the high-res art, below. One of its pincers has clipped the head of a mogg clean off, and sent it flying! That's what you get when your species' mental capacity doesn't even qualify as an appetizer.
