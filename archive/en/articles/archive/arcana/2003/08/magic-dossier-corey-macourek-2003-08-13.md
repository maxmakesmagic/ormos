**Name:** Corey Macourek

**Job title and duties:** Senior New Media Designer. I’m responsible for designing cool interfaces and developing interactive demos for Wizards’ and Hasbro’s products. I have also completed several animations and original soundtracks for various products and online experiences.

**Age:** 31

**Education:** BA Graphic Design/Illustration

**Began working at Wizards:** Fall 1995

**Previous job:** Freelance Designer

**How you got your job here:** I had a well-designed resume… and I knew Photoshop pretty well.

**Expansions or projects you've worked on:** I’ve helped develop several expansion logo and symbol concepts, but my main accomplishment is the award I won for the *Odyssey* logo design in the *2003 Logos of the World* book.

**Favorite part of your job:** Seeing the original artwork come in months before the public sees it.

**Least favorite part of your job:** Unrealistic deadlines.

**Thing you've worked on that you're most proud of:** What haven’t I touched in recent years? I created the logo for *Odyssey*, developed the interface and logo for ***Magic** Online*, redesigned the **Magic** website a number of times including the most recent (Fall 2003), animated the backgrounds for several Pro Tours as well as composed the Pro Tour music that played on ESPN2, and illustrated two cards--one for *Onslaught* and one for *Mirrodin*. Working with the ***Star Wars*** brand has got be one of cooler things I’ve done for Wizards. I was responsible for the ***Star Wars*** TCG and RPG online demos as well as the newly designed Hasbro ***Star Wars*** toy website. I’ve also composed original soundtracks and animations for the **Forgotten Realms** CD-ROM, **Magic** Encyclopedia CD-ROM, **Magic** *Eighth Edition* CD-ROM intro animation (with the help of Dan Gelon) and all of the animated Wizards logos through out the years.

**Other games you currently enjoy playing:** *Unreal 2, Life*, hide the mouse with my four cats.

**Favorite Magic card(s):** [Slate of Ancestry](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Slate+of+Ancestry) because I did the art and [Warrior Angel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Warrior+Angel) because I own the original Brom art.
