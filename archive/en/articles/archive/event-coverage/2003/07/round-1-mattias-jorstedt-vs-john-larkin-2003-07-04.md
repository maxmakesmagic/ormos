![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/euro03/a990.jpg)Both these players are on hot streaks at the moment. Mattias Jorstedt has made it to the top 8 at three out of the last four Pro Tours finally taking a title at the last one in Yokohama. Currently he's breathing down Kai's neck in the player of the year race. Larkin has also had a good year following his quarter-finals finish at last year's World Championships.

Jorstedt is running red-white-green Slide while Larkin is running blue-green Madness.  
 Jorstedt won the die roll and elected to go first.

### Game 1

Larkin came out of the blocks with a turn one Rootwalla, but his deck didn't provide him with a madness outlet. He attacked with a pumped Rootwalla for a couple of turns and added a second before Jorstedt took them both out with a cycled [Slice and Dice](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Slice+and+Dice).

The Swede had laid a morph card on turn 3, but was in no hurry to flip it over. After Slicing the 'Walla's he dropped a [Lightning Rift](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Rift) and cycled to shock a freshly summoned [Merfolk Looter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Merfolk+Looter).

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/euro03/a991.jpg)From then on the game started to go away from Larkin as Jorstedt unmorphed the [Exalted Angel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Exalted+Angel) and started swinging. The Irishman dug for answers with [Deep Analysis](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deep+Analysis) but none were forthcoming and they were swiftly onto Game 2.

Jorstedt 1-0 Larkin

### Game 2

Larkin admitted he should have mulliganed the last game. His hand for this game seemed better as [Wild Mongrel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Mongrel) entered play on his second turn and then he found an answer for Jorstedt's second turn Rift by Quiet Speculating for [Ray of Revelation](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ray+of+Revelation), [Roar](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Roar) and a [Deep Analysis](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deep+Analysis).

Larkin left the Rift where it was for the moment. He flashed back [Roar](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Roar), taking 2 damage from [City of Brass](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=City+of+Brass) and then took another 2 when Jorstedt cycle-shocked him end of turn.

The Swede cleared the board with [Wrath](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wrath) and then it seemed like Larkin's blue-green deck had run out of gas. He took more damage to flashback a [Deep Analysis](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deep+Analysis). He Rayed away the Rift and then Careful Studied a Rootwalla into play.

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/euro03/a992.jpg)Then the Irishman seemed to draw a bunch of land and not a lot else. Jorstedt got rid of the 'Walla with a [Slice and Dice](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Slice+and+Dice) and then started serving with [Teroh's Faithful](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Teroh%27s+Faithful) and [Nantuko Monastery](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nantuko+Monastery).

Larkin wasn't out of it though as he cast [Upheaval](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Upheaval), floating enough mana to follow it with an [Aquamoeba](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aquamoeba). In his end step madness brought a discarded Rootwalla into play and it seemed like the game had been turned round for the Irishman.

Jorstedt dropped a plains and discarded a bunch of cards while Larkin slapped him back for 6 and madnessed a second Rootwalla into play.

The Swede dropped his third land, a mountain. Larkin was careful to play around [Slice and Dice](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Slice+and+Dice) and only lost a Rootwalla. He had to race as he was only on 5 life and [Nantuko Monastery](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nantuko+Monastery) was about to come online on the Swede's side. It bashed for 4 and then Larkin was brought to an ignominious end as Jorstedt sent a lowly [Spark Spray](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spark+Spray) to the dome for the one point of damage that was required.

**Final Result:** Mattias Jorstedt beat John Larkin 2-0
