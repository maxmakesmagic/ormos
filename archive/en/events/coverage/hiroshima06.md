![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gphiro06/trophy.jpg)Grand Prix Hiroshima is over! After facing typhoon scares and 17 rounds of fierce opposition, Shuuhei Nakamura is the champion. His snow strategy was a success for him all weekend, and it carried him to the finals against Portuguese student Andre Coimbra. Some poor draws and unusual decision from Andre gave Shuuhei the openings he needed, and he exploited those opportunities to the fullest. In two straight games, Shuuhei dispatched his final opponent and claimed the winner's trophy. Congratulations to Shuuhei Nakamura, the 2006 Grand Prix Hiroshima winner!
