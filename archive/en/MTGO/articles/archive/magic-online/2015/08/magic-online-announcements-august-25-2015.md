**Announcing the *Magic Online* Tumblr**


It's tough to answer every question that we get about *Magic Online*. There's a lot of scheduling required before we publish an article, so it makes it hard to respond to hot topics as they come up. Twitter is a great place for an open dialogue with players, but we're stuck with only 140 characters to answer with—not great for complex questions.


We wanted to make a place where you could ask questions and see what's on the minds of other players too so, a few weeks ago, we launched the [Official *Magic Online* Tumblr](http://wizardsmtgo.tumblr.com/)!


Read about some of the highlights from our first few weeks [here](http://magic.wizards.com/en/MTGO/articles/archive/magic-online/introducing-magic-online-tumblr-2015-08-24).

**Leagues on the Horizon!**


Starting Wednesday, August 26, you'll start seeing this in *Magic Online*:


![](https://media.wizards.com/2015/mtgo/8-17-2015_img_2.png)


As mentioned in Chris Kiritz's latest [article](http://magic.wizards.com/en/MTGO/articles/archive/magic-online/magic-online-leagues-update-2015-08-17), the basic Constructed Leagues infrastructure will be deployed during tomorrow's downtime. This deployment included a few changes to *Magic Online*.


First, the Home Scene will be updated to include a Featured Leagues area. At first, this will likely be empty or contain a test league. Once Leagues are available to the public, our Featured League will be displayed in this spot and you'll be able to view League Details and join right from the Home Scene.


If you're already in a League or two, the Leagues you've joined will be displayed here instead, and will show a brief summary of your progress.


![](https://media.wizards.com/2015/mtgo/8-17-2015_img_1.png)


Second, the Play Lobby will be updated to include buttons for Leagues in both the Constructed Tournaments and the Limited Tournaments room. All available Leagues, including the Featured League, can be found here and all the normal Play Lobby filters will work.


![](https://media.wizards.com/2015/mtgo/8-17-2015_img_2.png)


Finally, the Help section has been updated to include some basic League information. For more information after Leagues are available to the general public, check out the [resources page](http://magic.wizards.com/en/en/gameinfo/products/magiconline/resources) on [MTGO.com](http://magic.wizards.com/en/game-info/products/magic-online).
