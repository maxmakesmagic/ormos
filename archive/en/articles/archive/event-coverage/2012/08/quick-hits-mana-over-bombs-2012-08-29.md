"At what point in the draft is mana fixing more important than the bombs?"

*Luis Scott-Vargas: "If you're mono-red, it's not really important. There's nothing wrong with taking a second-pick dual land if you need it. Basically, I'd look at taking a mana fixing land over a mid-level pick every time until you have like two or three."*

*Reid Duke: "When the card is something replaceable, like another win condition. For example, if I'm going to be upgrading my [Sphinx of Jwar Isle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sphinx+of+Jwar+Isle) to a [Frost Titan](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Frost+Titan), I'd rather be upgrading my [Island](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island) to an [Underground Sea](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Underground+Sea)."*

*Shuhei Nakamura: "Generally, the land-taking strategy goes one of two ways: you either take no lands or you take all of the lands. I will almost always take the good card over the land, since most decks are no more than two colors, and fixing mana isn't quite as important."*

*Jon Finkel: "First pick, first pack."*
