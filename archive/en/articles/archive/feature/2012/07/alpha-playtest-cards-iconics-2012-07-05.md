Before **Magic** went on sale, it was playtested with cards made with clip art. We've shown them several times:


* **[Alpha Playtest Cards](/en/articles/archive/alpha-playtest-cards-2003-05-22)** (May 22, 2003)
* **[More Alpha Playtest Cards](/en/articles/archive/more-alpha-playtest-cards-2008-06-09)** (June 9, 2008)
* **[Alpha Playtest Art](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/magazine/article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/arcana/1665)** (August 28, 2008)
* **[Alpha Cards That Didn't Make It](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/arcana/218)** (June 24, 2009)
* **[Alpha Cards That Didn't Make It](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/arcana/308)** (October 28, 2009)
* **[They Didn't Make It](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/arcana/527)** (May 19, 2010)
* **[Return of the Alpha Playtest Cards](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/arcana/527)** (August 31, 2010)
* **[Alpha: Setting the Record Straight](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/arcana/542)** (September 21, 2010)
* [**Alpha Playtest Cards: Flavorless Edition**](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/magazine/article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/arcana/807) (September 27, 2011)

That doesn't count the times [Mark Rosewater](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/magazine/article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/mm/81) has shown them. It's just Arcanas. And probably not all of the Arcanas, either.


Today, we're going to look at iconic **Magic** cards (a couple of which are in ***Magic** 2013*) and then show the original version. Don't be confused by the mana costs; during playtesting, "4RR" would mean that a card cost a total of four mana, of which two had to be red.
