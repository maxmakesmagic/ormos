The year is almost over, and at *Magic Online* we like to bring out some exciting special events to close out the year! Here's what we've got in store for the rest of the year:


SPECIAL *VINTAGE MASTERS* FLASHBACKS
====================================


First, we're going to do a week of *Vintage Masters* flashbacks December 13–20. We're going to introduce a new *Vintage Masters* booster, though, where some of the cards will have different borders and art that we think will be exciting. For example, you could open this card:

That's right, this one-week run of *Vintage Masters* lets you play with and collect the Power Nine featuring the original art and the classic *Magic* card frame! You can see all of them here:

To be clear on how this works, there will be two *Vintage Masters* boosters: the original with the *Vintage Masters*art for [Time Walk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Time+Walk), and the new *Vintage Masters* (Alt.) with the [Lion's Eye Diamond](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lion%27s+Eye+Diamond) art. The original [Time Walk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Time+Walk) version (below left) is just how you remember it and will contain a chance to open the Power Nine with modern frames and newer art. The new alternate [Lion's Eye Diamond](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lion%27s+Eye+Diamond) version (below right) gives you a chance to open Power Nine with the classic frame and original art. The Power Nine cards (both premium foil and non-foil versions) will appear at the same rate in both types of boosters, it's just a question of which version you can receive. Otherwise, the non–Power Nine cards use the same versions in both boosters.

For the Intermediate Draft League, you can use three of either type of booster (plus 4 event tickets) to enter, though you must use three of the same type of booster. Regardless of which type you enter with, any Power Nine cards opened in the drafts come from the new alternate Lion's Eye Diamond version featuring the classic frame and original art. Any boosters earned as prizes will also be the new *Vintage Masters* (Alt.) boosters. Here are the full event details:


***VINTAGE MASTERS* INTERMEDIATE DRAFT LEAGUE**

This will take the place of flashbacks originally scheduled for *Lorwyn*. Hopefully *Lorwyn* fans still like the *Vintage Masters* events, but don't worry, we now plan to run the *Lorwyn* flashbacks early in 2018.


*VINTAGE CUBE*
==============


*Vintage Cube* events will begin December 20 and will run longer than we've ever run *Vintage Cube* before, lasting until *Rivals of Ixalan* events begin on January 15. Below is a list of changes *Magic* R&D is making to the *Vintage Cube* for this run.
