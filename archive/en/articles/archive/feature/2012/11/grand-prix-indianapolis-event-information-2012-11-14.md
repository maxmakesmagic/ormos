Grand Prix Indianapolis will be the feature event of this fun weekend and to make it even better, it is *Return to Ravnica* Sealed Deck.

* Deck lists are required.
* If product is not stamped or preregistered, deck registration and deck swap will be performed for the Swiss Sealed Deck.


**Tournament Structure** 


* Modified Swiss-style (50-minute rounds).
* If 799 or fewer players register for the event, all players with an X-2-0 or better record OR the top 64 players—whichever number is greater—will advance to the second day of the event.
* If 800 or more players register for the event, all players with an X-2-0 or better record OR the top 128 players—whichever number is greater—will advance to the second day of the event.
* The Top 8 players after the final Swiss round on Day 2 will advance to the Top 8 single-elimination finals.
* The Top 8 players will be seated randomly at the draft table immediately prior to drafting. The Top 8 bracket will be determined using this random seating.
* Top 8 playoff matches will be best 2 of 3, and have no time limit. (Players are still expected to play at a normal pace and complete playoff matches in a reasonable amount of time.)
* Where necessary, the standings after the Swiss rounds will still be used to determine final order in the standings.
* For the first game of each match in the Top 8, the player that finished higher in the Swiss rounds chooses either to play first or to play second. For subsequent games in each Top 8 match, the usual Play/Draw rule applies (loser of the previous game decides whether to play first in the next game).

### Sleep-In Special


Got some byes? Want to get an extra couple hours of sleep instead of showing up at the venue early for the player meeting? Have we got a deal for you! If you have byes and register Friday night, you will be allowed to verify your byes during registration. Once confirmed, you will be eligible for the “Sleep-In Special" for an additional charge of $20. As this is a Sealed Deck event, we will register your card pool for you. All you need to do is build your deck!


You may ONLY skip the player meeting if you paid for the Sleep-In Special.


 Required reporting time on Saturday, based on number of byes: 

* 1 Bye: 11 a.m.
* 2 Byes: 12 p.m. (noon)
* 3 Byes: 1 p.m.



**Pastimes VIP Program (Very Important Player)**
  
 Want to make the Grand Prix weekend a little easier? We have come up with a great way to make that happen. Consider it an upgrade… 


 This package includes: 

* A special VIP line for registering for events throughout the weekend. No need to wait – you’re a VIP!
* Sleep-in Special (Player must have earned the appropriate byes. If you do not have byes, no Sleep-in Special)
* Additional room to sit. Always wished you had a bit more space at your table? VIPs get this!
* Fixed seating through the first day. (To keep the integrity of the event, the software to run **Magic**  Events may pair fixed-seated players together. If this is the case, fixed seating for one player may be broken for that round. There may be some restrictions in later rounds. We apologize for any inconvenience)
* Bottles of water through the weekend (10 bottles provided)
* Artist signing service. We can bring cards to the artists for you. We will also be arranging a special time for VIPs to meet with the artists in a closed setting.
* Everyone should know you are a VIP, so you will also receive a special VIP playmat from the event.

 If you would like to sign up for the VIP Program, head straight to the VIP line to register. Cost of the VIP Program is $60 (this does not include your Grand Prix Entry).
