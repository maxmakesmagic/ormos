![Teferi's Imp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Teferi%27s+Imp)**[Teferi's Imp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Teferi%27s+Imp)** – *Mirage* rare. Cards that phase out do not go to the exile zone. Instead, the game treats them as though they do not exist. They can’t affect or be affected by anything else in the game except for rules and effects that specifically mention phased-out permanents.
 ![Urza's Blueprints](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Urza%27s+Blueprints)**[Urza's Blueprints](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Urza%27s+Blueprints)** – *Urza's Legacy* rare. The blueprints in [Urza's Blueprints](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Urza%27s+Blueprints) are for the creation of the [Skyship Weatherlight](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skyship+Weatherlight). When Urza had built it, he needed the perfect captain, so he started a long-term breeding plan that eventually produced [Gerrard Capashen](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gerrard+Capashen).
 ![Whippoorwill](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Whippoorwill)**[Whippoorwill](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Whippoorwill)** – *The Dark* uncommon. Despite its name, creature type, and art, [Whippoorwill](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Whippoorwill) does not have flying.
 ![Hunting Moa](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Hunting+Moa)**[Hunting Moa](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hunting+Moa)** – *Urza's Destiny* uncommon. According to [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moa), the moa were eleven species of flightless birds endemic to New Zealand. They're said to have gone extinct by around six hundred years ago, although some cryptozoologists believe there are still a few out there.
 ![Zodiac Rooster](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Zodiac+Rooster)**[Zodiac Rooster](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Zodiac+Rooster)** – *Portal Three Kingdoms* common. When it was printed, [Zodiac Rooster](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Zodiac+Rooster) was only the third Plainswalker, after [Giant Slug](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Giant+Slug) and [Righteous Avengers](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Righteous+Avengers). For the first time, there were more Plainswalkers than cards that [Great Wall](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Great%2BWall) [Lord Magnus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Lord%2BMagnus)!
 ![Dong Zhou, the Tyrant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Dong+Zhou%2C+the+Tyrant)**[Dong Zhou, the Tyrant](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dong+Zhou%2C+the+Tyrant)** – *Portal Three Kingdoms* rare. The storyline of *Portal Three Kingdoms* is much more elaborate than most sets', since it's based on the Three Kingdoms Romance. For example, [Dong Zhou, the Tyrant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Dong%2BZhou%252C%2Bthe%2BTyrant) was killed by [Lu Bu, Master-at-Arms](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Lu%2BBu%252C%2BMaster-at-Arms) after [Diaochan, Artful Beauty](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Diaochan%252C%2BArtful%2BBeauty) convinced each man that she was in love with him and being abused by the other.
 ![Planeswalker's Mischief](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Planeswalker%27s+Mischief)**[Planeswalker's Mischief](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Planeswalker%27s+Mischief)** – *Planeshift* rare. The handsome fellow on [Planeswalker's Mischief](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Planeswalker%27s+Mischief) is Bo Levar, also seen on [Gainsay](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gainsay). Bo Levar is one of the old-timey planeswalkers like Commodore Guff and Lord Windgrace.
 ![Gaddock Teeg](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Gaddock+Teeg)**[Gaddock Teeg](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gaddock+Teeg)** – *Lorwyn* rare. As originally designed, [Gaddock Teeg](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gaddock+Teeg) had only the top ability. But it wasn't clear how that should apply to X spells, so a second ability was added to just prohibit X spells entirely. Simple!
 ![rathi Berserker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=rathi+Berserker)**[rathi Berserker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=rathi%2BBerserker)** – *Legends* uncommon. Strangely, this card is unrelated to the other [Rathi cards](http://gatherer.wizards.com/pages/search/default.aspx?name=+%5B%22rathi%22%5D). Although it's printed as "rathi Berserker," the actual name of is [rathi Berserker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=rathi%2BBerserker). Apparently the typesetter didn't know what to do with Æ (which is called a ligature, if you're interested) so it didn't make it onto the card. 
 ![Tor Giant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Tor+Giant)**[Tor Giant](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tor+Giant)** – *Ice Age* common. Although [Hill Giant](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hill+Giant) has appeared in almost every core set, it was replaced with the identical [Tor Giant](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tor+Giant) in *Ice Age*. Even the name is a functional reprint, since a "tor" is a "high craggy hill."
 ![Frankenstein's Monster](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Frankenstein%27s+Monster)**[Frankenstein's Monster](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Frankenstein%27s+Monster)** – *The Dark* rare. [Frankenstein's Monster](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Frankenstein%27s+Monster) combines two things that no longer happen on **Magic** cards: direct references to the real world and combining different kinds of counters. What a weird card.
 ![Invisibility](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Invisibility)**[Invisibility](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Invisibility)** – *Eighth Edition* uncommon. [Invisibility](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Invisibility) was responsible for one of the weirder decisions from the early days of the DCI. Because it created a combo that was considered dangerously powerful, the powers that be decided to ban ... [Juggernaut](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Juggernaut).
 ![Cyclopean Mummy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Cyclopean+Mummy)**[Cyclopean Mummy](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cyclopean+Mummy)** – *Fourth Edition* common. Although "[Selecting Xth Edition](/en/articles/archive/selecting-eighth-edition-wrapup-2002-11-25)" was a web feature invented for *Eighth Edition*, the public sort of had a say in an earlier set. [Cyclopean Mummy](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cyclopean+Mummy) was voted "Worst Card in *Fourth Edition*" in a consumer survey, then mysteriously disappeared from *Fifth Edition*.
 ![Lesser Werewolf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Lesser+Werewolf)**[Lesser Werewolf](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lesser+Werewolf)** – *Legends* uncommon. Both [Lesser Werewolf](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lesser+Werewolf) and [Greater Werewolf](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Greater+Werewolf) are 2/4. The difference is in the size of the counters that they create.
 ![Vampire Aristocrat](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Vampire+Aristocrat)**[Vampire Aristocrat](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vampire+Aristocrat)** – ***Magic** 2010* common. [Vampire Aristocrat](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vampire+Aristocrat)'s specific type of aristocracy is left undefined, so it's not clear if it's a Duke, a Marquess, or even a traditional Count. Considering the stats, though, it's doubtful that the [Vampire Aristocrat](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vampire+Aristocrat) outranks [Baron Sengir](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Baron+Sengir).
 ![Frazzled Editor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Frazzled+Editor)**[Frazzled Editor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Frazzled+Editor)** – *Unhinged* common. Although it's printed as "Creature — Human Bureacrat," [Frazzled Editor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Frazzled+Editor) is actually a Bureaucrat. The editor in the art just hasn't gotten up to the type line yet. Unfortunately, other [Aysen Bureaucrats](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Aysen%2BBureaucrats) aren't bureaucrats anymore, so it doesn't really matter either way.
 ![Spellbook](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Spellbook)**[Spellbook](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spellbook)** – ***Magic** 2010* uncommon. [Spellbook](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spellbook) was originally designed as a "cleaned up" version of the Alpha card [Library of Leng](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Library+of+Leng). They kept the easy-to-understand part and got rid of the complicated second clause. Much better!
 ![Cursed Scroll](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Cursed+Scroll)**[Cursed Scroll](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cursed+Scroll)** – *Tempest* rare. [Cursed Scroll](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cursed+Scroll) was designed to have a mini-game feel, with a built-in moment of tension as its controller activates it and hopes to pull the named card. Like many such cards, of course, it was at its best and most efficient when the mini-game was rigged. Thus, most memories of [Cursed Scroll](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cursed+Scroll) involve not fun and tension, but repeatable burn to the face. 
 ![Barrin's Codex](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Barrin%27s+Codex)**[Barrin's Codex](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Barrin%27s+Codex)** – *Urza's Saga* rare. [Barrin's Codex](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Barrin%27s+Codex) belongs to [Barrin, Master Wizard](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Barrin%2C+Master+Wizard), the father of [Hanna, Ship's Navigator](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hanna%2C+Ship%27s+Navigator), who was part of the crew of [Skyship Weatherlight](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skyship+Weatherlight). Because Barrin and Hanna didn't get along, Barrin didn't join the crew, instead sending his apprentice, [Ertai, Wizard Adept](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ertai%2C+Wizard+Adept). Much later, Phyrexians managed to turn Ertai into [Ertai, the Corrupted](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ertai%2C+the+Corrupted).
 ![Mangara's Tome](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Mangara%27s+Tome)**[Mangara's Tome](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mangara%27s+Tome)** – *Mirage* rare. Many of the early [tomes](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?action=advanced&name=+%5Btome%5D+!%5Bnightmare%5D) had names that were references to real people. [Jalum Tome](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jalum+Tome), for example, was named for Joel L. Mick's initials. [Mangara's Tome](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mangara%27s+Tome) took it a step farther, since Mangara is an anagram ... for "anagram."
