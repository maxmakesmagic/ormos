Alternate Play Schedule Updates
-------------------------------


We've heard a significant amount of feedback on the previously announced alternative play schedule, and we're making a few changes that most of you will likely be quite happy about. The classic *Vintage Cube* draft will now be running over Christmas Day!


► The new addition to the Spotlight Cube Series, previously scheduled for the week beginning December 16, will be moved to the week beginning January 13.


*► Vintage Cube* Supreme, previously scheduled for the week beginning December 23, will be moved to the week beginning December 16.


► The classic *Vintage Cube* draft, previously scheduled for three weeks beginning December 30, will still last for three weeks but will begin on December 23 instead.


**Updated Calendar**


* November 4–19: ***Vintage Cube***. Don't worry, this isn't replacing our end-of-year tradition of more *Vintage Cube*. But we've got a little event called the MOCS happening during this two-week run's second weekend, and it uses *Vintage Cube* as part of the competition. So, to ensure players have the ability to practice for the event, everyone gets an extra two weeks of *Vintage Cube*.
* November 25–December 2: This week, a popular cube from the Spotlight Cube Series returns: Kyle O'Neill's ***Core Set Cube***, now updated through *Core Set 2021*! (Not to be confused with the kor set *Zendikar Rising*, which will still have full events running.)
* December 2–9: **Chaos Draft: *Masters* Sets**. For just this week, our Chaos Drafts are going to take only the top sets! Every set in this draft will be a *Masters* set, and it'll be glorious.
* December 9–16: **Supreme Draft: CHAOS!** Combining the fun of Supreme Draft with Chaos Draft, you'll draft a deck from 18 different packs. Which packs? Who knows? Enjoy the chaos!
* December 16–23: **Supreme Draft: *Vintage Cube***. What happens when you combine one of the most powerful formats ever with the most powerful Draft style? Yep. A week of that.
* December 23–January 13: ***Vintage Cube***. Another update in, this time with *Commander Legends* cards in the mix. This is easily the most common request we get, so . . . we hear you. More *Vintage Cube*. This will last for a few weeks, until . . .
* January 13–20: **A brand-new addition to the Spotlight Cube Series**. As usual, more details will come later, but this one promises to be a wheel of a good time.
* January 20–28: ***Vintage Masters* Flashback**. One of the most popular Draft formats of all time is back to round out *Zendikar Rising* season. We'll have a little more than a week of that, and then . . . well, it's not quite time to talk about *Kaldheim* just yet.
