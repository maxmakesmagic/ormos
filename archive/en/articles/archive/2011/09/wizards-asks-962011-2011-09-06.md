*We've got a slight change of pace this week, with a tough Magic 2012 draft question that stumped no less a player than Luis Scott-Vargas at this weekend's Pro Tour Philadelphia. Read on, and ask yourself: What would you do in LSV's shoes?*


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/mtgcom/authorpics/authorpic_stevesadin.jpg)**Steve Sadin:** Pro Tour superstar Luis Scott-Vargas went into his first draft at Pro Tour Philadelphia with a 5-0 record. When he sat down, he opened a pack that looked like this:


[Æther Adept](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=%C3%86ther+Adept), [Amphin Cutthroat](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Amphin+Cutthroat), [Consume Spirit](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Consume+Spirit), [Cudgel Troll](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cudgel+Troll), [Drifting Shade](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Drifting+Shade), [Dungrove Elder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dungrove+Elder), [Gorehorn Minotaurs](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gorehorn+Minotaurs), [Harbor Serpent](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Harbor+Serpent), [Lava Axe](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lava+Axe), [Naturalize](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Naturalize), [Plummet](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plummet), [Pride Guardian](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pride+Guardian), [Stampeding Rhino](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stampeding+Rhino), [Vampire Outcasts](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vampire+Outcasts), [Plains](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plains)


Luis took the [Consume Spirit](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Consume+Spirit), and went on to have a rocky draft. (You can read about it [here](/en/articles/archive/event-coverage/feature-it-aint-easy-drafting-green-2011-09-03) or check out the [draft viewer directly](http://gatherer.wizards.com/magic/draftools/draftviewer.asp?draftid=9_2_2011_1&player=3&pack=1&pick=1&showpick=true&alwaysshowpick=false).) We caught up with LSV later on in the weekend, and asked him to explain why he took [Consume Spirit](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Consume+Spirit), and what he would do if he were presented with this decision again.


![Consume Spirit](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Consume+Spirit)"I took [Consume Spirit](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Consume+Spirit+)  because I was looking to force Mono-Black," Luis explained. I think that black is really strong in this format, and I wind up winning a lot whenever I put together heavy black decks.


"If I opened this pack again, I would take the [Vampire Outcasts](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vampire+Outcasts+)  out of it. It requires far less of a color commitment than [Consume Spirit](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Consume+Spirit), and it's almost as good even in Mono-Black decks. If I didn't want to take a black card out of this pack, then I would have taken [Gorehorn Minotaurs](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gorehorn+Minotaurs). But I think that [Æther Adept](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=%C3%86ther+Adept), [Cudgel Troll](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cudgel+Troll), and [Dungrove Elder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dungrove+Elder+)  are all reasonable picks depending on what you want to do."


What would you have taken in LSV's spot? Would you have gone for one of the black cards? Or would you have drafted the [Dungrove Elder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dungrove+Elder), and taken advantage of the fact that green is one of the less popular colors in ***Magic** 2012* Limited?
