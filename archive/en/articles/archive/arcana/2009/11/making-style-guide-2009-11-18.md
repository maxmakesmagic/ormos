When it came time for the first *Zendikar* style guide images to be made, Richard Whitters knew he had to assemble a crack squad of artists.

Mark Tedin! A **Magic** artist from way back.

Vincent Proce! The new guy on the block.

Matt Cavotta! He's done it before and he'll do it again.

Here they are, along with Richard, after having covered the whiteboard behind them with sketches and ideas. Ideas like this:

Of course, you don't get ideas out of nowhere. Mark, Vincent, Matt, and Richard spent much of their time in consultation with key people. Like Mark Rosewater!

The best thing about Style Guide Time is that the area around the Creative Team is covered with fascinating things.

The tricky part is that we always have to hold onto these cool pictures for months before it's okay to show them off!
