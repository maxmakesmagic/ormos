You're familiar with the color pie, right? That's the thing that assigns what each color of **Magic** is good at, as well as where the mana comes from.

The current definition of each color's strengths is found in the ***Magic** 2011* Player's Guide, where it looks like this:

Now, perhaps you're wondering how it's changed since the earliest days of **Magic**. Well, good news! A few years ago, we [transcribed the *Alpha* rulebook](/en/articles/archive/original-magic-rulebook-2004-12-25), so we can see how they were originally defined!

Black magic is the magic of death. The often self destructive lore of black magic is regarded by most as best left unknown. The traditional enemies of black are white and green.

Blue magic is mental in nature. The fortes of the blue magician are artifice, illusion, and deception, as well as the elemental forces of air and water. The traditional enemies of blue are red and green.

Many magicians have been lulled into complacency by green magic's peaceful exterior, the magic of life, and have been caught unaware by the vast destructive capability of its nature. Green's traditional enemies are blue and black.

Red magic is a destructive magic, the magic of earth and of fire, of chaos and of war. The traditional enemies of red are blue and white.
