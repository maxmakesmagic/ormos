**Comments:**


Muraganda builds on the popular tribal theme of Onslaught and Lorwyn while casting its own unique spin. The two sides of the conflict in *Escape* both care about creature types, but the natives care about quality while the rebels care about quantity.


I scrapped almost everything and started rebuilding from scratch, considering myriad possibilities. Approaching, hybrid, living auras and bind familiar didn't make the transition. Spell morphs are uncommon and may not appear until the second set.


I knew the land had to have power that the Empirians could invade for in the last set but I didn't like the idea of an exact retread of Snow via Sacred / Mystic. Eventually I found that the Tribal type I had so quickly discarded would define the entire block. Tribal will exist on lands and artifacts from common and up, enabling type-checking and sentience-matters effects. Counting effects have been scaled back and types-in-play threshold effects are right out.


The next set sees Rebels adopting the Morph tactics of the local fauna and putting the power of Muraganda's land to use: They will use Tribal mana. I'm thinking, Spider mana, Frog mana and the like. Any mana produced by a permanent with creature type Bird is Bird mana. These symbols will match the petroglyphic watermarks of each tribe. I love the hidden-hybrid implications (each of five tribes belong to two colors each) but could also just use Tribal mana? This is the block to flaunt the word Tribal rather than hide it.
