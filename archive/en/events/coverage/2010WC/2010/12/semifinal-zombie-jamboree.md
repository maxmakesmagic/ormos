### Paulo Vitor Damo da Rosa (Blue-Black Control) vs. Guillaume Matignon (Blue-Black Control)


We like to talk about Player of the Year implications, but we rarely get a match where things are so stark. If Paulo Vitor Damo da Rosa won this Worlds Semifinal match, he'd be the Player of the Year. If Guillaume Matignon won, he could go on to win in the Finals, at which point he would not only be the 2010 *Magic* World Champion but would tie Brad Nelson for Player of the Year, forcing a playoff at Pro Tour–Paris in February. If Matignon won in the Semifinals but lost in the Finals, Brad Nelson would be Player of the Year.

Both players are playing Blue-Black Control decks with slightly different land and spell configurations. Damo da Rosa has a [Mystifying Maze](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mystifying+Maze) that Matignon doesn't, and Matignon has a main-deck [Duress](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress) that Damo da Rosa doesn't. In their sideboards, Damo da Rosa has [Mindbreak Trap](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mindbreak+Trap), [Skinrender](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skinrender), [Spell Pierce](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spell+Pierce), [Stoic Rebuttal](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stoic+Rebuttal), and [Vampire Nighthawk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vampire+Nighthawk); Matignon has [Memoricide](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Memoricide) and [Sorin Markov](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sorin+Markov).


**Game 1**


Things started, as Blue-Black Control Mirrors often do, with an [Inquisition of Kozilek](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inquisition+of+Kozilek). This one was from Matignon, since Damo da Rosa had started the game with a land that entered the battlefield tapped (Creeping Tar Pit). The [Inquisition](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inquisition) took out a [Cancel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cancel), and then it was Dama da Rosa's turn to play [Inquisition of Kozilek](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inquisition+of+Kozilek) on Matignon, hitting a [Preordain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Preordain).


Matignon had another one, and was soon [Preordain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Preordain)ing to his heart's content. Damo da Rosa played [Spreading Seas](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spreading+Seas) on a Matignon [Creeping Tar Pit](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Creeping+Tar+Pit) and tried to cast [Jace, the Mind Sculptor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace%2C+the+Mind+Sculptor). Matignon [Mana Leak](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak)ed it and played one of his own, thus establishing Jace Superiority. After some [Brainstorm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brainstorm)ing, he [Duress](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress)ed an [Inquisition of Kozilek](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inquisition+of+Kozilek) out of Damo da Rosa's hand and [Preordain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Preordain)ed again.


Damo da Rosa also [Preordain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Preordain)ed, which is the sort of thing that happens in a mirror match. When Damo da Rosa activated a [Creeping Tar Pit](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Creeping+Tar+Pit) and sent it after Matignon's [Jace, the Mind Sculptor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace%2C+the+Mind+Sculptor), Matignon had a [Disfigure](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Disfigure). And he kept up the pressure on Damo da Rosa's land by using [Tectonic Edge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tectonic+Edge) on another [Creeping Tar Pit](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Creeping+Tar+Pit), and a [Spreading Seas](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spreading+Seas) on a third.


Matignon used another [Preordain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Preordain), which you may or may not be interested to know is called "Predestination" in French. He proceeded to [Tectonic Edge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tectonic+Edge) a land, but Damo da Rosa was still at five land. Matignon was [Brainstorm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brainstorm)ing every turn, keeping his hand full of only the finest cards. Another [Spreading Seas](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spreading+Seas) deactivated Damo da Rosa's fourth [Creeping Tar Pit](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Creeping+Tar+Pit).


With three Swamps and two Islands (via [Spreading Seas](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spreading+Seas)), Damo da Rosa now played [Spreading Seas](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spreading+Seas) on his own Swamp, This got [Cancel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cancel)led, and Matignon could tell that Damo da Rosa wanted blue mana for something, so he used [Tectonic Edge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tectonic+Edge)s to kill the two [Creeping Tar Pit](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Creeping+Tar+Pit)s that were Damo da Rosa's only source of blue mana. Down to three lands (all Swamps), Damo da Rosa drew a [Misty Rainforest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Misty+Rainforest) and soon turned it into an Island.


Matignon at this point had eight land and a [Jace, the Mind Sculptor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace%2C+the+Mind+Sculptor) with four loyalty counters. He his Damo da Rosa with [Inquisition of Kozilek](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inquisition+of+Kozilek) and took a [Disfigure](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Disfigure) before sending in a [Creeping Tar Pit](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Creeping+Tar+Pit) to put Damo da Rosa at 14. Another [Inquisition of Kozilek](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inquisition+of+Kozilek) took out a [Mana Leak](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak), and Matignon played a [Grave Titan](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grave+Titan) unmolested.


This was enough to convince Damo da Rosa to scoop.


Matignon 1, Damo da Rosa 0


**Game 2**


Damo da Rosa's first land was an Island, which is not conducive to an early discard spell. Matignon had a Swamp, which powered a [Duress](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress). He looked at [Jace Beleren](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace+Beleren), two [Jace, the Mind Sculptor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace%2C+the+Mind+Sculptor)s, [Mindbreak Trap](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mindbreak+Trap), [Mana Leak](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak), and a land. He chose [Jace Beleren](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace+Beleren).


![](https://media.wizards.com/legacy/mtg/images/daily/events/worlds10/sf1_matignon.jpg)  



When Matignon put [Spreading Seas](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spreading+Seas) on Damo da Rosa's [Drowned Catacomb](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Drowned+Catacomb), it didn't appear to bother Damo da Rosa at all, since he just played the mono-blue [Sea Gate Oracle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sea+Gate+Oracle) with the blue mana. Matignon's card filtering came in the form of two [Preordain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Preordain)s on consecutive turns. Once Matignon had rearranged his hand, Damo da Rosa hit him with an [Inquisition of Kozilek](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inquisition+of+Kozilek). The hand that was revealed had an [Inquisition of Kozilek](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inquisition+of+Kozilek), [Jace, the Mind Sculptor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace%2C+the+Mind+Sculptor), [Mana Leak](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak), [Preordain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Preordain), and land. Damo da Rosa chose to win the discard war and removed the [Inquisition of Kozilek](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inquisition+of+Kozilek). Then he cast [Preordain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Preordain) with only two mana open, but Matignon chose not to [Mana Leak](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak) it.


Matignon cast a [Preordain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Preordain) of his own and agonized over his decision. It's plays like this, on the biggest stage of *Magic*, that separate the top players, so Matignon wanted to be absolutely sure he had the decision correct. After selecting a card, Matignon activated a [Tectonic Edge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tectonic+Edge) to destroy Damo da Rosa's [Spreading Seas](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spreading+Seas)–enchanted [Drowned Catacomb](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Drowned+Catacomb).


Damo da Rosa cast a [Sea Gate Oracle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sea+Gate+Oracle) and started to attack with it. And with his [Tectonic Edge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tectonic+Edge)s, he began to whittle at Matignon's lands. At this point, each player had seen [Jace, the Mind Sculptor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace%2C+the+Mind+Sculptor) in the other's hand, so neither wanted to play one just to have it destroyed. The [Sea Gate Oracle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sea+Gate+Oracle) got Matignon to 14, then stopped attacking.


Matignon counted his eight land and went with [Jace Beleren](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace+Beleren), leaving five mana untapped. Damo da Rosa [Mana Leak](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak)ed it, and Matignon paid the three mana, leaving himself with two untapped Islands. Damo da Rosa tried another [Mana Leak](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak), but Matignon had a [Mana Leak](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak) of his own, and [Jace Beleren](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace+Beleren) resolved. Matignon drew a card to put the loyalty at 2, and Damo da Rosa took his turn to attack Jace with the [Sea Gate Oracle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sea+Gate+Oracle), dropping it to 1.


Matignon cast [Grave Titan](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grave+Titan), which Damo da Rosa tried to counter with a full-price [Mindbreak Trap](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mindbreak+Trap). Unfortunately, Matignon had a [Cancel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cancel), so the [Grave Titan](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grave+Titan) resolved. On Damo da Rosa's turn, he cast a GraveTitan of his own, and the board became a zombie jamboree.


Matignon worked on Damo da Rosa's lands with [Tectonic Edge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tectonic+Edge) and [Spreading Seas](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spreading+Seas), took [Jace Beleren](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace+Beleren)'s last loyalty counter to draw a card, then cast [Jace, the Mind Sculptor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace%2C+the+Mind+Sculptor) and bounced the opposing Titan. An attack reduced Damo da Rosa to 13, and a [Duress](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress) helped keep the way clear. Damo da Rosa was able to afford a [Jace, the Mind Sculptor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace%2C+the+Mind+Sculptor) of his own to kill Matignon's, but he was losing the [Grave Titan](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grave+Titan) race.


The next turn, Matignon sent in the [Grave Titan](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grave+Titan), [Spreading Seas](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spreading+Seas), and three Zombies. Damo da Rosa worked on his blocks and ended up only taking 4, but Matignon was left with [Grave Titan](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grave+Titan) and five Zombie tokens, and he added [Jace, the Mind Sculptor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace%2C+the+Mind+Sculptor) to the mix.


Damo da Rosa cast a [Grave Titan](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grave+Titan) of his own, and Matignon proceeded to do combat math. He bounced the opposing [Grave Titan](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grave+Titan) with [Jace, the Mind Sculptor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace%2C+the+Mind+Sculptor) and attacked with everything. This turned out to be the correct play, as Damo da Rosa scooped up his cards.


Matignon 2, Damo da Rosa 0


**Game 3**


Damo da Rosa led with a [Creeping Tar Pit](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Creeping+Tar+Pit), and neither player cast any discard spells until Matignon's third turn. And that met with a [Mana Leak](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak) from Damo da Rosa. Damo da Rosa used a [Spreading Seas](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spreading+Seas) to neutralize the danger of Matignon's [Tectonic Edge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tectonic+Edge), and Matignon used it for the honorable purpose of fueling a [Preordain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Preordain). Matignon's next [Tectonic Edge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tectonic+Edge) went unchallenged, as Damo da Rosa was more interested in casting a [Sea Gate Oracle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sea+Gate+Oracle) and putting one card on the bottom of his library.


![](https://media.wizards.com/legacy/mtg/images/daily/events/worlds10/sf1_damodarosa2.jpg)  



Matignon traded his [Tectonic Edge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tectonic+Edge) for Damo da Rosa's [Drowned Catacomb](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Drowned+Catacomb) and cast [Jace, the Mind Sculptor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace%2C+the+Mind+Sculptor). Damo da Rosa attacked with his [Sea Gate Oracle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sea+Gate+Oracle), and he dealt damage to Matignon, not Jace. This made Matignon assume that his opponent was going to do something to kill [Jace, the Mind Sculptor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace%2C+the+Mind+Sculptor), and he was correct: Damo da Rosa cast [Jace Beleren](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace+Beleren). All Matignon could do on his turn was [Spreading Seas](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spreading+Seas) something.


Damo da Rosa continued to attack with the [Sea Gate Oracle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sea+Gate+Oracle) and went for an [Inquisition of Kozilek](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inquisition+of+Kozilek). And it landed, so he saw [Consume the Meek](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Consume+the+Meek), [Deprive](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deprive), two [Mana Leak](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak)s, and a [Sea Gate Oracle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sea+Gate+Oracle). He chose the [Sea Gate Oracle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sea+Gate+Oracle) to be discarded. On Matignon's turn, he answered with a [Duress](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress), hitting [Jace, the Mind Sculptor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace%2C+the+Mind+Sculptor) but seeing a [Sea Gate Oracle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sea+Gate+Oracle) and a [Grave Titan](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grave+Titan).


Damo da Rosa [Tectonic Edge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tectonic+Edge)d away a [Creeping Tar Pit](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Creeping+Tar+Pit) and continued the [Sea Gate Oracle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sea+Gate+Oracle) beatings, which had reduced Matignon to 16, then 15. Damo da Rosa played a [Creeping Tar Pit](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Creeping+Tar+Pit) that could possibly have joined the attack, but it fell victim to [Spreading Seas](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spreading+Seas). Matignon was able to use [Inquisition of Kozilek](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inquisition+of+Kozilek) to knock a [Sea Gate Oracle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sea+Gate+Oracle) out of Damo da Rosa's hand, but the one on the battlefield got him down to 14.


Matignon went for a [Jace, the Mind Sculptor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace%2C+the+Mind+Sculptor), and it resolved. He invoked the +2 ability to look at the top of Damo da Rosa's library, and allowed the card to stay. After going up to 5 loyalty, Jace fell to 4 after the [Sea Gate Oracle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sea+Gate+Oracle)'s attack. Then Jace switched to [Brainstorm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brainstorm) Mode and the [Sea Gate Oracle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sea+Gate+Oracle) got him to 3.


Damo da Rosa cast an [Inquisition of Kozilek](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inquisition+of+Kozilek), and Matignon allowed it. He had two [Mana Leak](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak)s, [Deprive](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deprive), [Consume the Meek](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Consume+the+Meek), and [Spreading Seas](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spreading+Seas). Damo da Rosa chose the [Deprive](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deprive).


With a great deal of mana untapped, Damo da Rosa cast [Jace Beleren](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace+Beleren), which Matignon declined to counter. Matignon's [Jace, the Mind Sculptor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace%2C+the+Mind+Sculptor) died, and the [Sea Gate Oracle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sea+Gate+Oracle) continued its attacks, putting Matignon at 13. Another of Damo da Rosa's lands was targeted with [Spreading Seas](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spreading+Seas), and he gave Matignon some of the same. The [Sea Gate Oracle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sea+Gate+Oracle) dealt another point of damage to Matignon. 13.


Matignon cast a [Jace Beleren](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace+Beleren) and used it to draw a card. He had six cards in hand and five lands untapped when Damo da Rosa went for a [Grave Titan](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grave+Titan). This drew out both of Matignon's [Mana Leak](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak)s, but Damo da Rosa had a [Mana Leak](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak) of his own. Damo da Rosa had no cards in hand, but he had gotten a [Grave Titan](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grave+Titan) to enter the battlefield. The [Sea Gate Oracle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sea+Gate+Oracle) attacked Matignon's [Jace Beleren](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace+Beleren) down to 1 loyalty, and Matignon used that final point to draw a card for himself.


Matignon cast a [Grave Titan](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grave+Titan) of his own. Damo da Rosa sent his [Grave Titan](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grave+Titan) in, but kept his Zombies at home. All of Matignon's creatures died while blocking. But he had a [Duress](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress) for the last card in Damo da Rosa's hand, and a [Consume the Meek](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Consume+the+Meek) for all the creatures on the battlefield.


Matignon cast [Jace, the Mind Sculptor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace%2C+the+Mind+Sculptor) and was feeling confident. But Damo da Rosa, with no cards in hand, drew a [Jace, the Mind Sculptor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace%2C+the+Mind+Sculptor) of his own and destroyed it. Damo da Rosa's next draw was a [Grave Titan](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grave+Titan), but Matignon [Cancel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cancel)led it.


![](https://media.wizards.com/legacy/mtg/images/daily/events/worlds10/sf1_matignon3.jpg)  



Matignon had a [Grave Titan](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grave+Titan) of his own, and displayed a killer elbow. But Damo da Rosa wasn't done drawing great cards off the top of his deck. He drew and cast a [Grave Titan](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grave+Titan) himself! But Matignon had far more cards in hand and cashed in his massive Zombie advantage to put the game away. Then he ran over to the other Semifinal match to scratch Guillaume Wafo-Tapa's head, and took a victory lap, high-fiving the front row of the crowd.

*... and the crowd goes wild—Brad Nelson, whose Player of the Year chances now hinge on a loss for Matignon in the Finals, emphatically among them.*
