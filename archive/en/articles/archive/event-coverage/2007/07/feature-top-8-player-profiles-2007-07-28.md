 Blink touch red - Because it's wicked fun and all the cards are awesome.

 No Urzatron 9 can't play blue-white-red 'Tron, so I played blue-white-red fun cards

 Not really, just responded to signals.

 



**How did you prepare for the event? Who did you prepare with?** 
  

 Came up with the decklist in the car on the ride up, variant of the blue-white-black Blink decks that did well at Australian Nationals. No playtesting, but my friend Mike M. helped me build it.
