I hope everyone's been enjoying these sweet, sweet [*Commander (2016 Edition)* card previews](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/card-image-gallery/commander-2016). Today I'm bringing you a preview of a different kind, in that it's not related to *Commander* at all. Instead, I'm revealing the new Regional Pro Tour Qualifier and Grand Prix promos for 2017!


But first...


Last Round's Regional Pro Tour Qualifier Attendance
===================================================


Looking back to the last round of Regional Pro Tour Qualifiers, we received requests surrounding the attendance numbers of the August events. Yesterday, we posted the attendance at each of the tournaments that qualified Top 4 finishers for [Pro Tour *Kaladesh*](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/ptkld) over on the [*Magic* Organized Play Tumblr](http://magicorganizedplay.tumblr.com/). You can check them out over there.


The next round of Regional Pro Tour Qualifiers will qualify Top 4 finishers for Pro Tour *Aether Revolt* in Dublin, Ireland, February 3–5, 2017. Participants in these RPTQs get the [Snapcaster Mage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snapcaster+Mage) promo card while supplies last (this will be the last RPTQ round that awards the [Snapcaster Mage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snapcaster+Mage) promo). More information on that round can be found on the [event information page](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/instoreplay/rptqaer).


2017's Regional Pro Tour Qualifier Promo
========================================


Okay, with that out of the way, I now bring to you 2017's Regional Pro Tour Qualifier promo.

Starting with the [Regional Pro Tour Qualifiers for Pro Tour *Amonkhet*](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/instoreplay/rptqakh), all players who compete in an RPTQ will receive an [Emrakul, the Aeons Torn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Emrakul%2C+the+Aeons+Torn) promo card (while supplies last). Perhaps the most famous of the Eldrazi titan's iterations, [Emrakul, the Aeons Torn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Emrakul%2C+the+Aeons+Torn) regularly sees play in Modern and Eternal formats as the best possible card that you can [sneak](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=413690) into play, [show](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=416878) to your opponents, and use to wreak [vengeance](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=74475) on opposing boards. She's also a popular inclusion alongside [Nahiri, the Harbinger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nahiri%2C+the+Harbinger) in Modern Jeskai decks.


Looking to pick up a copy of the old-school Emrakul? You can qualify for the first RPTQ where she'll be the promo by playing in a [Preliminary Pro Tour Qualifier for Pro Tour *Amonkhet*](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/instoreplay/pptqakh), starting you on your path to the Pro Tour. Events have already begun and run all the way until January 8, 2017, so find a [local store near you](http://locator.wizards.com/) that's hosting one and maybe we'll see you on the Pro Tour in April!


2017's Grand Prix Promo
=======================


While we're showing off upcoming promo cards, I've also got next year's Grand Prix main event participation promo to bring you. In keeping with the giant monstrosity theme, 2017's Grand Prix promo is [Progenitus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Progenitus)!


![](https://media.wizards.com/2016/images/daily/Ez0HUBzrSb.png)


You can get a copy of [Progenitus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Progenitus) by competing in the main event of any Grand Prix from December 2016 until the end of November 2017 (while supplies last, of course). That means your first chance to pick up this new promo is by competing in the main event for either [Grand Prix Denver](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/premierplay/grandprix/fact-sheet-gpden16) or [Grand Prix Madrid](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/premierplay/grandprix/fact-sheet-gpmad16).


This Weekend's Grand Prix
=========================


We've got two Grand Prix taking place this weekend, both featuring Standard main events. [Santiago](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/premierplay/grandprix/fact-sheet-gpsan16) and [Warsaw](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/premierplay/grandprix/fact-sheet-gpwar16) will continue our dive into the post-*Kaladesh* Standard as we see if any new metagame shifts emerge. The big decks out of last weekend were undeniably white-blue decks along with black-green delirium strategies. Will that change this weekend?
