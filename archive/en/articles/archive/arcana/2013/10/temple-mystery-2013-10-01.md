The five Temple Cards in *Theros* are very exciting. They mix allied and enemy color pairs and when they enter the battlefield, though they enter tapped, the ability to scry early can be really beneficial to players.

Let's take a look at one of those Temples today: [Temple of Mystery](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Temple+of+Mystery). Well-known **Magic** artist [Noah Bradley](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&artist=+%5b%22Noah+Bradley%22%5d) was tasked with creating a temple that embodied the feeling of awe and mystery. Here's what the art description for the card said:

The Greeks believed that there was an end to the world where the sea drained off a sharp edge and formed an epic waterfall. The camera is facing this epic waterfall. At the top of the waterfall, there is a massive tree growing up out of the water. We can see water cascading down over its roots and into the abyss below. This tree is a shrine to the enigmatic god of horizons. The tree should be a fantastical version of an olive tree.

The "enigmatic god of horizons" refers to Kruphix, a deity of Theros who you haven't gotten to know yet, but who you might recognize from [Prophet of Kruphix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Prophet+of+Kruphix) and from [Agent of Horizons](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Agent+of+Horizons)'s flavor text.

Let's see what Noah did with this art description. Here is his sketch:

And here's the final art, which turned out awe inspiring indeed!
