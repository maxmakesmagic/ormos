It's the most wonderful tiiiiime… of the yeeeeear! Well, at least if you love watching people play awesome digital *Magic*. The *Magic Online* Championship takes place March 2–4 right here at Wizards HQ in Renton, Washington. Featuring 24 of the best MTGO players in the world, a $200,000 prize pool, and a roster of great coverage personalities, this really is the biggest MTGO moment of the year.


All three days of the tournament will stream live on [twitch.tv/magic](https://www.twitch.tv/magic). Check out [Mike Rosenberg's article here](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/organized-play/magic-online-championship-soon-2018-02-15) for more information.

It's time to return to the land of gods and heroes, enchantments and myths. That's right: *Theros* Flashback Drafts are here! Strive to show how heroic you are by bestowing a blessing on one of your monstrosities! Something about devotion!


*Theros* Flashback Drafts run February 21 to 28, and can be found in the Limited Leagues area of the *Magic Online* Play Lobby. Enjoy, and may all your Gods be creatures when you need them!

Another Streamer Showdown is approaching, and this time the streamers will be drafting *Theros*! Instead of Dinosaurs and Pirates, the battlefields will be filled with Gods and fabled beasts. See what your favorite streamers make of the format, and you might even learn some things that'll give you a leg up in your own *Theros* Draft adventures!


If you've never watched one before, Streamer Showdowns consist of two eight-player events (one at 1 p.m. PT, the other at 5 p.m. PT) featuring talented streamers from all across the *Magic* community. The two pods are detailed below:
