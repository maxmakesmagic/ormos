Welcome to the latest look at the **Magic** Top 25 Pro Rankings. A snowy [Grand Prix Dallas](/en/events/coverage/gutierrez-seizes-victory-fort-worth) was the setting for the latest tussle at the top, with both No. 1 Ben Stark and No. 2 Josh Utter-Leyton looking to sit atop the **Magic** pile. 

Things looked good for the former No. 1 and reigning Player of the Year Utter-Leyton, as he powered his way into Day Two, and ultimately fell just short of the Top 8. Stark, though, didn't let the Swiss rounds spell the end of his tournament. He made it all the way to the elimination rounds, where he beat Eric Centauri in the quarterfinals before missing out on yet another Grand Prix final when losing to eventual champion, Marlon Gutierrez.

Elsewhere, the field was decimated by weather, meaning many of the leading lights were left cooling their heels at home. Although Christian Calcano, Jon Stern, and World Champion Shahar Shenhar all made it into Day Two, only Stern converted into a points finish, winding up in 63rd place. That was good enough, however, for the Canadian to return to the Top 25 rankings, replacing one of the most beloved members of the Hall of Fame, Luis Scott-Vargas, who falls out of the rankings for the first time.

 After a whirlwind series of Grand Prix, the Pro **Magic** world gets to draw breath before Grand Prix Shizuoka in Japan closes out the year. It's looking increasingly likely that, having fought off the Josh Utter-Leyton challenge in Dallas, Ben Stark will end 2013 as the No. 1-ranked player. Join us again next week as we go inside the **Magic** Top 25 Pro rankings.
