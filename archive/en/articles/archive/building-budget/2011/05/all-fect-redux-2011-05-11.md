All-In-Fect Redux

Jacob Van Lunen began playing Magic in 1995. He has participated in organized play at every level of competition and was a member of the winning team at Pro Tour San Diego in 2007, thanks to an innovative draft strategy. As a writer, Van Lunen has had more than three hundred Magic strategy pieces published 






Infect is a strategy that has been widely avoided in Standard. A lot of readers have been excited about the potential strength of All-In-Fect; I [wrote about](/en/articles/archive/building-budget/all-fect-2010-11-03) All-In-Fect a few months ago. The deck quickly garnished a decent following. People really like decks that are capable of winning on the third turn. Now, after the introduction of *New Phyrexia*, the deck is capable of winning on turn two. [Glistener Elf](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glistener+Elf) makes the deck very dangerous, especially when it wins the die roll.

I don't think anyone expected a one-mana infect creature in *New Phyrexia*. As a result, no one has really paid much attention to the archetype. Some really absurd things happen when you have a [Glistener Elf](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glistener+Elf) and an [Assault Strobe](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Assault+Strobe) in your opening hand. A single [Groundswell](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Groundswell), or a [Mutagenic Growth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mutagenic+Growth) and a [Prey's Vengeance](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Prey%27s+Vengeance) or [Giant Growth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Giant+Growth), will be enough to close the game on the second turn.



|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Glistener Elf | Assault Strobe |

[Mutagenic Growth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mutagenic+Growth) gives this deck a whole new angle of attack. The amount of "burst" poison you're able to output without any mana available makes the game very scary for opponents, especially if they don't have spot removal.

I decided to start things off by giving you a very budget-friendly deck list that's capable of turn-two kills.

You'd be surprised how often this deck just offs someone on the second or third turn. People are often frustrated by the blisteringly fast draws this deck is capable of. The card choices are all pretty obvious and the deck functions exactly how you would expect it to.

I played a few matches with the above deck list. Here's an example:

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/boab/boab142_header1.jpg)  
![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/boab/boab142_bolt.jpg)(Pyro-Twin features the [Deceiver Exarch](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deceiver+Exarch) / [Splinter Twin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Splinter+Twin) combo in a [Pyromancer Ascension](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyromancer+Ascension) shell.)

I lost the roll and kept [Copperline Gorge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Copperline+Gorge), [Forest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest), [Glistener Elf](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glistener+Elf), [Blight Mamba](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blight+Mamba), [Groundswell](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Groundswell), [Mutagenic Growth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mutagenic+Growth), and [Giant Growth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Giant+Growth). My opponent played a [Scalding Tarn](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scalding+Tarn), cracked it for an [Island](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island), cast [Preordain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Preordain), and passed the turn. I drew a [Prey's Vengeance](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Prey%27s+Vengeance), played my [Copperline Gorge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Copperline+Gorge), cast [Glistener Elf](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glistener+Elf), and passed the turn. My opponent played a [Mountain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mountain) and passed the turn. I drew a [Flame Slash](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flame+Slash), played my [Forest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest), and attacked. I decided to go for it and cast [Giant Growth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Giant+Growth) on the [Glistener Elf](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glistener+Elf). My opponent responded with a [Lightning Bolt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt), but I responded to the Bolt with a [Groundswell](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Groundswell). My opponent let the [Groundswell](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Groundswell) resolve, I cast a [Mutagenic Growth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mutagenic+Growth) for the cost of 2 life, and my opponent had ten poison counters.

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/boab/theCardsFooter.jpg)  
While I was impressed with its ability to close games, like the above, on very early turns, I was often frustrated by the fashion in which it sputtered out when I didn't kill my opponent immediately. This was one of the first games I played against Pyro-Twin, and my opponent didn't quite understand what my deck was designed to do. If my opponent had used an [Into the Roil](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Into+the+Roil) or had a [Spell Pierce](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spell+Pierce), then that game would have ended very differently.

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/boab/boab142_glistener.jpg)  
I wanted the deck to have more late-game resilience. I didn't want to depend on the random win factor as much as I wanted the ability to win some real games of **Magic**. I decided to try a mono-green version of the deck again and see how it went.

Initially, I began building the mono-green deck in a similar fashion to the red-green list. Then a friend brought an interesting deck list from **Magic Online** to my attention. I was impressed with the deck's resilience and defense. I don't have the exact list on hand, but the player chose not to play with any actual infect creatures. Instead, the player played a full playset of [Inkmoth Nexus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inkmoth+Nexus), [Expedition Map](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Expedition+Map)s to find more copies of [Inkmoth Nexus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inkmoth+Nexus), pump spells, proliferators, and artifacts that benefit from proliferate.



|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Inkmoth Nexus | Expedition Map |

The deck I had seen was from pre-*New Phyrexia* Standard; the deckbuilder didn't have access to cards like [Mutagenic Growth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mutagenic+Growth) or [Glistener Elf](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glistener+Elf). I still wanted to include [Glistener Elf](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glistener+Elf), though, as having this card on the play can make for some very scary situations on your opponent's end. In fact, a lot of decks just fold to a [Glistener Elf](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glistener+Elf) on the play. I've never been hugely impressed with the two-drops, and I wouldn't be upset if I had to leave all of them on the bench.

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/boab/boab142_thecards1.jpg)  
[Inkmoth Nexus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inkmoth+Nexus) is the most impressive threat here. This card isn't exceptionally difficult to trade for and it's the only non–[Contagion Engine](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Contagion+Engine) rare in the main deck. The sideboard will likely have a few [Obstinate Baloth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Obstinate+Baloth)s, but that doesn't seem like the end of the world. They shouldn't be too hard to trade for.

[Inkmoth Nexus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inkmoth+Nexus) and [Glistener Elf](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glistener+Elf) should be all the win conditions I need. I'm going to play a healthy suite of pump spells. I want to make the game very dangerous for my opponent. I don't want anyone to feel safe when they tap out against me.

Now I need to build a support shell. [Tumble Magnet](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tumble+Magnet) is the most obvious inclusion. [Tumble Magnet](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tumble+Magnet) does excellent work against opponents who plan on using equipped creatures to dominate the battlefield. (Boros and Caw-Blade). [Tumble Magnet](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tumble+Magnet) is also an excellent way to clear a path through your opponent's blockers to win with a lethal attack from an [Inkmoth Nexus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inkmoth+Nexus) or [Glistener Elf](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glistener+Elf). [Tumble Magnet](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tumble+Magnet) is especially strong here because it works so well with the proliferate mechanic. I want the deck to have an inevitability in the late game that's based around using proliferate cards to up my opponent's poison count while charging up my Magnets and keeping the board in a state of calm.



|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Tumble Magnet | Tezzeret's Gambit |

[Tezzeret's Gambit](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tezzeret%27s+Gambit) is another obvious inclusion. For three mana I get to cast [Sign in Blood](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sign+in+Blood) in a green deck. I already love that idea, but [Tezzeret's Gambit](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tezzeret%27s+Gambit) is so much more. It charges up [Tumble Magnet](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tumble+Magnet)s and increases my opponent's poison count. It also fuels my ability to close games with scary quickness by filling my hand with pump spells for the key attack.

[Contagion Clasp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Contagion+Clasp) is necessary here. I need [Contagion Clasp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Contagion+Clasp) to deal with [Lotus Cobra](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lotus+Cobra) draws. [Contagion Clasp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Contagion+Clasp) is also an excellent tool that I can use to keep my [Tumble Magnet](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tumble+Magnet)s live. Again, it's not unreasonable to kill an opponent with a few Clasp activations after a single healthy attack from a [Glistener Elf](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glistener+Elf) or [Inkmoth Nexus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inkmoth+Nexus).



|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Contagion Clasp | Contagion Engine |

I decided that I wanted access to a single copy of [Contagion Engine](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Contagion+Engine). It may seem silly, but I feel like it's necessary against a lot of midgame positions that come up when fighting against the [Tempered Steel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tempered+Steel) decks. It's also nice to have access to a "kill all [Squadron Hawk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Squadron+Hawk)s" effect. The double proliferate presents a fast clock that also ensures your [Tumble Magnet](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tumble+Magnet)s will never run out of juice.

I was pretty worried about [Gideon Jura](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gideon+Jura) when I initially started working on this deck, but I quickly learned how to play around the bomby white planeswalker. The most important card is [Tectonic Edge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tectonic+Edge). I've included a playset of [Tectonic Edge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tectonic+Edge) that will help us keep our opponents off five lands. It's usually safe to assume you've gotten one clean hit in by the time your opponent resolves a Gideon. From this point, you can simply proliferate your way to victory. I also included a miser's copy of [Beast Within](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Beast+Within) to help deal with the Gideon problem.

This deck is all but immune to [Day of Judgment](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Day+of+Judgment). In fact, usually you shrug off Day and just bash back in with an [Inkmoth Nexus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inkmoth+Nexus). People will probably have trouble sideboarding against the mono-green list, too. They need to mold their deck to deal with a noncreature-spell-based strategy, but at the same time they need to deal with the potential for a lethal attack on the second turn of the game.



|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Beast Within | Nature's Claim |

I decided to play a few copies of [Nature's Claim](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nature%27s+Claim) in the main deck. I think [Nature's Claim](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nature%27s+Claim) is a main-deck-worthy card in this type of strategy. It deals with Swords, [Pyromancer Ascension](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyromancer+Ascension), [Splinter Twin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Splinter+Twin), [Tumble Magnet](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tumble+Magnet)—heck, it even deals with [Khalni Heart Expedition](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Khalni+Heart+Expedition)s from [Valakut](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Valakut) players.

I also decided to include a single copy of [Dismember](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dismember). It's nice to have more action against turn-two [Lotus Cobra](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lotus+Cobra) and the ability to off a blocker for a colorless mana is very impressive.

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/boab/theCardsFooter.jpg)  
Here's the final list once I worked out all the kinks.

I was able to acquire all the cards from *New Phyrexia* by borrowing them from friends. My good friend Chris Lachmann was kind enough to play a match against me with an updated Caw-Blade deck.

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/boab/boab142_header2.jpg)  
![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/boab/boab142_condemn.jpg)I won the roll and kept [Inkmoth Nexus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inkmoth+Nexus), [Forest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest), [Tectonic Edge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tectonic+Edge), [Expedition Map](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Expedition+Map), [Groundswell](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Groundswell), [Mutagenic Growth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mutagenic+Growth), and [Tezzeret's Gambit](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tezzeret%27s+Gambit). I played my [Inkmoth Nexus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inkmoth+Nexus), cast [Expedition Map](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Expedition+Map), and passed the turn. Chris played a [Seachrome Coast](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seachrome+Coast), cast [Preordain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Preordain), and passed the turn. I drew a [Forest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest), played it, activated the [Inkmoth Nexus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inkmoth+Nexus), and attacked. I decided to use my [Mutagenic Growth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mutagenic+Growth) immediately and put Chris up to three poison counters. Chris cast a [Squadron Hawk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Squadron+Hawk), searched up some Hawkage, and passed the turn. I drew a [Tumble Magnet](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tumble+Magnet), cast it, and passed the turn. Chris played a [Celestial Colonnade](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Celestial+Colonnade), thought for a moment, and passed the turn. I drew a [Glistener Elf](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glistener+Elf), cast it, and attempted to cast a [Tezzeret's Gambit](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tezzeret%27s+Gambit), which also resolved. Chris went to four poison and I drew a [Groundswell](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Groundswell) and [Forest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest).

Now I knew what Chris had in hand. He chose not to cast another [Squadron Hawk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Squadron+Hawk), so he had to have had a play on my turn. He didn't counter my [Tezzeret's Gambit](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tezzeret%27s+Gambit), even though I tapped out to cast it. I could be sure, then, that Chris had at least one [Condemn](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Condemn) in his hand. Chris played a [Plains](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plains), cast [Sword of Feast and Famine](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sword+of+Feast+and+Famine) leaving the [Plains](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plains) untapped, and passed the turn. This was a strong play from Chris; he left a basic land untapped, which prevented me from using [Tectonic Edge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tectonic+Edge) to blow up his [Condemn](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Condemn) mana. I tapped his Hawk on his end step. I drew a [Giant Growth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Giant+Growth), played my [Forest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest), activated my [Inkmoth Nexus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inkmoth+Nexus), and attacked with both infect creatures, I cast [Groundswell](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Groundswell) on the [Glistener Elf](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glistener+Elf) and Chris used a [Condemn](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Condemn) to deal with that. Then I cast [Groundswell](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Groundswell) and [Giant Growth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Giant+Growth) on the [Inkmoth Nexus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inkmoth+Nexus) and we were off to Game 2.

**Sideboarding:** I'm going to take the [Glistener Elf](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glistener+Elf) out of my deck when I'm on the draw. It seems very dangerous to waste slots on a card like this when it isn't going to be capable of very early wins.

-4 [Glistener Elf](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glistener+Elf), +1 [Nature's Claim](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nature%27s+Claim), +2 [Beast Within](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Beast+Within), +1 [Dismember](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dismember)

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/boab/boab142_hawk.jpg)I mulliganed and kept 2 [Forest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest), [Tectonic Edge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tectonic+Edge), [Tezzeret's Gambit](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tezzeret%27s+Gambit), [Tumble Magnet](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tumble+Magnet), and [Contagion Clasp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Contagion+Clasp). Chris led things off with a [Celestial Colonnade](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Celestial+Colonnade). I drew an [Expedition Map](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Expedition+Map), cast it, and passed the turn. Chris played a [Seachrome Coast](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seachrome+Coast), cast [Stoneforge Mystic](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stoneforge+Mystic), grabbed a [Sword of Feast and Famine](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sword+of+Feast+and+Famine), and passed the turn. I drew a [Mutagenic Growth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mutagenic+Growth), played my [Forest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest), and passed the turn. Chris played a land and passed the turn with three mana open. I cracked my [Expedition Map](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Expedition+Map) and found an [Inkmoth Nexus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inkmoth+Nexus). I drew [Beast Within](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Beast+Within), played my [Inkmoth Nexus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inkmoth+Nexus), and attempted to cast a [Tumble Magnet](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tumble+Magnet), Chris had the [Spell Pierce](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spell+Pierce). He dropped the [Sword of Feast and Famine](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sword+of+Feast+and+Famine) with [Stoneforge Mystic](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stoneforge+Mystic)'s ability on my end step.

On his turn, Chris equipped the Sword to [Stoneforge Mystic](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stoneforge+Mystic), cast a [Squadron Hawk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Squadron+Hawk), and attacked me. I discarded [Tezzeret's Gambit](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tezzeret%27s+Gambit), and he untapped all his lands, cast a second [Squadron Hawk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Squadron+Hawk), and passed the turn. I drew a [Groundswell](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Groundswell), played my fourth land, and passed the turn. Chris played a fifth land and cast [Jace, the Mind Sculptor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace%2C+the+Mind+Sculptor). I tried to [Beast Within](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Beast+Within) the [Sword of Feast and Famine](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sword+of+Feast+and+Famine) in response, but Chris had another [Spell Pierce](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spell+Pierce). He attacked me with his [Stoneforge Mystic](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stoneforge+Mystic) and a single Hawk, used Jace's 0 ability, cast another Hawk searching up the Hawk he'd just put on top of his library, and passed the turn. I drew a [Groundswell](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Groundswell), and he showed me two [Mana Leak](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak)s and a [Condemn](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Condemn). I decided it was time to pack it up.

**Sideboarding:** I want to bring the [Glistener Elf](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glistener+Elf) back into the deck now that I'm on the play. The potential of very quick wins is enough for me to happily pack some number of this spell.

Chris cast the [Mortarpod](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mortarpod), and passed the turn with [Condemn](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Condemn) and [Spell Pierce](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spell+Pierce) mana open.

I drew a [Forest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest), and figured I would play around everything. I played my land, cast [Contagion Clasp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Contagion+Clasp), and put a counter on Chris's Germ token. Chris used the Germ to shoot my [Glistener Elf](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glistener+Elf), and I activated my [Inkmoth Nexus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inkmoth+Nexus) and attacked. Chris drew the [Condemn](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Condemn) cast the [Condemn](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Condemn) he'd drawn last turn. Chris cast a [Squadron Hawk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Squadron+Hawk), searched up a few Hawks, and passed the turn with two mana open. I drew a [Tectonic Edge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tectonic+Edge) and activated my [Contagion Clasp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Contagion+Clasp) for the last poison counter.

All-In-Fect wins the match 2-1.

This is a very real deck that has some exceptionally dangerous draws. If you're a fan of poison like I am, then this should be a very fun and interesting deck to play at your local tournaments. I know I'll continue working on this deck in the future, and I'd love to hear what you guys have decided to include in your lists in email or in the forums using the links below.
