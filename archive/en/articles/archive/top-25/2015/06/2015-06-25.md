Welcome to another look at the *Magic* Top 25 Pro Rankings. Constructed was very much the order of business last weekend, with [Modern in Copenhagen, Denmark](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/gpcop15), followed hours later by [Standard in Providence](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/gppro15), USA. Let's see what happened to our chart-toppers.



In Copenhagen, the presence of Tournament Organizer [ChannelFireball](http://www.ChannelFireball.com/) meant the attendance of Jacob Wilson, William Jensen, and Ben Stark. Neither of the Hall of Famers made it out of Day One, but Wilson—piloting the same Grishoalbrand deck as Jensen—put his head down after an early Day Two loss and kept on winning until he ran out of rounds, coming up just short in eleventh place. He now enters the Top 10, at No. 10. Meanwhile, Ondrej Strasky of the Czech Republic slipped down one place to No. 16, primarily as a result of one outstanding performance across The Pond at Grand Prix Providence…



…which belongs to Steve Rubin. He has been one of the most interesting developing stories of this season. Having been very much below the radar last year, whilst still being the kind of player that those "in the know" within the pro scene valued highly, Rubin has worked his way up the leaderboard with stunning regularity. His fifth place finish in Providence sees him catapult up the rankings, past no fewer than five Pro Tour champions, en route to his new slot at No. 16.



In a moment of transatlantic symmetry, while Jacob Wilson was finishing eleventh at Copenhagen, fellow Canadian standout Alexander Hayne was *also* finishing eleventh at Providence. With so many points already in the bag, this actually saw Hayne fall one slot—he was one of those PT champs passed by Rubin. Elsewhere in Providence, it proved to be tough going for our road warrior superstars. No. 5 Owen Turtenwald finished 67th, No. 14 Shahar Shenhar was 102nd, and No. 7 Ari Lax was 116th. The likes of Craig Wescoe, Paulo Vitor Damo da Rosa, Josh Utter-Leyton, Christian Calcano, and Brad Nelson all failed to make Day Two.



Calcano, not for the first time, slips out of the Top 25, replaced by another regular on our chart, Willy Edel of Brazil. That leaves Yuuki Ichikawa looking over his shoulder at No.25. This coming weekend, Modern comes to the Asia-Pacific region wih Grand Prix Singapore hosting both William Jensen and Jacob Wilson, who continuing their globe-trotting adventures, while Argentina continues the story of Standard with Grand Prix Buenos Aires.



Join us next week to see their impact on the *Magic* Top 25 Pro Rankings.
