![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/Worlds2001/991.jpg)*Tommi Hovi vs. Tomi Walamies*Round one Feature Matches don't have the drama of later matches that decide Top 8 spots, but some of them tell a story all their own. In this case, the story was very simple: the current Finnish National Champion played against the best player in the history of Finland. Hovi is well-known as the first player to ever win two Pro Tours, and in this first round Feature Match, he played against his own country's National Champion. What's interesting about this matchup is that both players are running nearly identical decks, yet they playtested with separate groups. Both decks are black-blue-white Nether-Go, with the usual assortment of countermagic, Probe, Fact or Fiction and Vindicate. An interesting development is that both players are running Gerrard's Verdict as well for additional card advantage. This spell is certainly very powerful, but has not been seen in Standard permission decks yet.


### Game 1


Walamies went first, and opened with island, while Hovi played an Underground River. Play was slow for the first few turns, as both players were hesitant to walk into countermagic. Hovi made the first move of the match, playing Gerrard's Verdict, and Walamies targeted it with Counterspell. Hovi added his own Counterspell to the stack, allowing the Verdict to resolve. Walamies discarded Wrath of God and Dromar's Charm. Hovi followed up strong on the following turn with yet another Verdict, which caused Walamies to lose Coastal Tower and his own Verdict. Hovi played Fact or Fiction a few turns later, and the piles presented were Absorb/Island/Probe and Probe/Fact or Fiction. Hovi took the three card pile.


At this point, Hovi had put himself far ahead in the card advantage race. Two Verdicts had resolved, in addition to Fact or Fiction. With a hand full of spells and plenty of land, he seemed to be capable of handling any threat Walamies could come up with. To make matters worse, Walamies was stuck at four land. Hovi continued to gain card advantage as he played Probe with kicker, and got a Nether Spirit into his graveyard. A second Probe was played by Hovi shortly after, leaving Walamies with only one card in hand. Meanwhile, Nether Spirit was going to work, and things seemed bleak for Walamies. Every time he played a threat, Hovi was waiting with countermagic.

Dromar's Charm was used to gain life and buy some time, but Hovi came right back with another Verdict, bringing Walamies down to only one card in hand. Hovi played Fact or Fiction, and decided to take Counterspell and Dismantling Blow, which put Nether Spirit in his graveyard. This gave him an extra damage clock, but the play was slightly risky. If Wrath of God resolved, Hovi would have his Nether Spirit win condition nullified. However, this was not the case, and Walamies soon conceded, moving onto the second game.


Hovi- 1 Walamies- 0


### Game 2


Walamies went first again, and played Dromar's Cavern on turn two, allowing him to play Gerrard's Verdict. Hovi discarded Underground River and Absorb. This play by Walamies was interesting. The Verdict would obviously resolve because Hovi only had a tapped Salt Marsh in play at the time, and Walamies felt it was worth it to be set back a turn in mana development if it meant resolving a Verdict. This proved to be correct, as neither player did much for the next few turns.


Hovi played Fact or Fiction, and Walamies responded with his own. This Fact or Fiction was all gas, and contained no land, but plenty of solid spells. The piles presented were Absorb/Dromar's Charm/Counterspell and Fact or Fiction/Gerrard's Verdict. Walamies took the three card pile. Hovi's Fact or Fiction now resolved, and was not nearly as spectacular as Walamies's. It revealed two Nether Spirits, which is never a positive thing for a Nether-Go player. They were put in a pile by themselves, and Hovi had to take them, or his Nether Spirit recursion would be stopped.


Duress was played by Walamies on his next turn. He saw three Counterspells, Fact or Fiction, Gerrard's Verdict, Duress and Nether Spirit. After some thought, Walamies forced Hovi to lose Fact or Fiction. Nether Spirit came into play on Hovi's turn, and started to go to work. A second Nether Spirit showed up in Hovi's graveyard, giving Walamies the green light to stop Hovi's win condition. He played Vindicate on the Spirit in play, which resulted in a massive counterwar that Walamies won. However, this left his resources depleted, and Hovi was able to take full advantage of the situation with an explosive turn, using Duress and Gerrard's Verdict to strip Walamies's hand.

The missing piece of the puzzle? With two Nether Spirits in the graveyard, Hovi still needed a way to win the game. He had full control, but it wouldn't mean anything without some sort of win condition. One of Hovi's Probes resulted in him discarding Disrupt, which got a small laugh out of both players. Walamies turned to me and said, "He always plays one Disrupt in any blue deck he plays."


Nether Spirit was hard cast by Hovi, who now had a win condition. It wasn't much more than a Gray Ogre, but it was still a win condition. Meanwhile, Walamies played his own Nether Spirit, which was less than impressive due to Dromar being in his graveyard. Hovi used Vindicate to take out the opposing Spirit, and Walamies followed up by doing the same to Hovi on his turn. Hovi decided to Counterspell it, and continued to send his Nether Spirit into the Red Zone. Hovi summoned Dromar a few turns later, and things started to look very bad. Indeed, the 6/6 Dragon was enough for Walamies to concede.


**Final Result:** Hovi 2, Walamies 0
