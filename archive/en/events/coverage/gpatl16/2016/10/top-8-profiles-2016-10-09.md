**Age:** 32


**Hometown:** San Jose, CA


**Occupation:** Penetration Tester He's in security, and tests systems for vulnerabilities. Maybe "ethical hacker" might also describe the occupation. -Ed]


**Previous Magic Accomplishments:**


Top 16 GP Vegas 2015, successfully casting Unlicensed Disintegration off two Prophetic Prisms in my green-blue deck.


**What colors did you play in Sealed Deck on Day 1? What cards most impressed you?**


Me and Kambal represented the Orzhov guild investigating Kaladesh. Cataclysmic Gearhulk was incredible and bailed me out of whatever situations looked . . . cataclysmic. Snare Thopter is the True-Faither Censor of the format representing incredible strength against what the card reads as.


**What colors did you play in the first Draft of Day 2? What cards most impressed you?**


We played B/R haste with all the removal. I was lucky enough to open a gearhulk and even though it came up seldom it won a critical game or two. Harsh Scrutiny did much more than it read as it allowed me to control my opponents’ removal choices and sequencing. In a conditional removal format the reveal was way better than I thought especially against green.


**What colors did you play in the second Draft of Day 2? What cards most impressed you?**


I played base-green take every good card and hope.dek. Oviya is just green Pack Rat. That card was amazing through and through.


**What is your favorite Limited rare, uncommon, and common in *Kaladesh*? Why?**


Rare - Cultivator’s Caravan because it fights game in and out against power droughts.


Uncommon - Snare Thopter, it steals momentum and can control the pace of the game


Common - Prophetic Prisms make the world go ‘round. They solve the mana issues of the format and play well with a lot of cards in Kaladesh, like Aviary Mechanic, Shrewd Negotiation, and Aether Tradewinds, AND draws a card. Plus your Dhund Operatives facepunch with it.
