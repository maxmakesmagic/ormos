In Japan, Wizards distributes provides extra prize support for "**Magic** Premier Shops" that contribute to the game and the community above and beyond the level of a normal retail store. That means keeping a certain level of inventory on hand, running more than the usual number of in-store events, and periodically pulling in new players.

What form does that extra prize support take? We're glad you asked!

MPS stores are encouraged to use these unique, alternate-art basic lands as top prizes in events, but they're free to distribute them however they want.
