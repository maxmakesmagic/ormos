*What's your favorite **Magic** set and why?*

![Alexis Janson](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/mtgcom/authorpics/authorpic_alexisjanson.jpg)**Alexis Janson:** My favorite **Magic** set is [*Alara Reborn*](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/arcana/1702)—I felt like I had a significant impact on everything that went into it and I'm extremely happy with where everything in the set ended up. I was going to tell you all about why its new mechanic is so awesome and then rattle off my favorite cards, but apparently I don't have the authority to spoil a set half a year before it's released.

With that in mind, my backup answer depends on whether you ask my designer side or my player side. As a designer, my next favorite set is definitely *Planar Chaos*. I'm a big fan of the theory behind the color pie, but I'm always looking for ways to stretch the reality of it. I found *Planar Chaos* to be a delightful breath of fresh air on each color's pie perspective, both philosophically and mechanically. While I don't think we want to do a set like that often, I do enjoy finding ways to philosophically respect the color pie while challenging its current mechanical boundaries.

As a player, my favorite set is *The Dark*. Until then, my decks were full of high fantasy and legendary beasts, but now I had the opportunity to fill them with creepy, scary things that go bump in the night. The flavor really drew me in, and definitely led me to play with some cards that are laughably weak by today's standards. But back then? [Shivan Dragon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shivan+Dragon) was too busy getting lost in [Maze of Ith](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Maze%2Bof%2BIth) to stop my army of [Banshee](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Banshee)s and [The Fallen](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=The%2BFallen).
