### SERIOUS FUN


Such Article, Very Meme
=======================



![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/styles/auth_small/public/images/person/authorPic_GavinVerhey.jpg)

Gavin Verhey

When Gavin Verhey was eleven, he wanted a job making Magic cards. Ten years later, his dream was realized as his combined success as a professional player, deck builder, and writer brought him into Wizards R&D during 2011. He's been writing Magic articles since 2005 and has no plans to stop.


 







Is the coast clear? Is he gone?


 


Perfect.


Gavin Verhey, your usual ReConstructed specialist here. I told Bruce I was a little under the weather—but here I am! It's time to unfold my master plan.


![](https://media.wizards.com/images/magic/daily/sf/2014/sf_wk13_293_pilferedplans.jpg)
 


According to the *Everyday Dimir Villain's Evil Takeover Handbook*, I believe this is the step where I'm supposed to explain my master plan. Tired of Bruce taking up half of the page with his Serious Fun column, I snookered him into writing ReConstructed this week so I could finally sabotage Serious Fun and have Tuesdays all to myself.


And how am I going to do that, exactly? By harnessing the power of the Internet. All in good time...


Of course, I brought my loyal companion and man's best friend along with me. He will no doubt help me sniff out whatever I need to on the Internet. In fact, he has a lot of Internet experience himself! Say hello to my loyal doge, Wuv Muffin!


![](https://media.wizards.com/images/magic/daily/sf/2014/sf_wk13_293_doge.jpg)
 


With Wuv Muffin at my side, I'm sure he can scour out anything we need. And look! He's already off! Away we gooooooooooooooo!



![](https://media.wizards.com/images/magic/daily/sf/2014/sf_wk13_293_doge2.jpg)

What's that? Timmy fell down the well?


Wait, what else? The key to the Internet is to start by getting to the top of Reddit? Well, let's do it!


And what other way than via the power of imagination. And... deck building!


![](https://media.wizards.com/images/magic/daily/sf/2014/sf_wk13_293_deckbuilding.jpg)
 


Okay, so what are we looking for? Well, a card that upvotes. You want to get as many upvotes as possible and you'll win... hey, I know a card like that! It's [Helix Pinnacle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Helix+Pinnacle)!


![](https://media.wizards.com/images/magic/daily/sf/2014/sf_wk13_293_theysaid.jpg)
 


Okay, well, let's see. What can we do here?


Well, we're definitely going to want to start with [Helix Pinnacle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Helix+Pinnacle). Mana ramp is good, and [Heartbeat of Spring](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Heartbeat+of+Spring) helps up the ante to get you there even faster as well. But that still is going to take a while—[Helix Pinnacle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Helix+Pinnacle) is hard to get working!


![](https://media.wizards.com/images/magic/daily/sf/2014/sf_wk13_293_simply.jpg)
 


It's not *really* upvoting if the creatures aren't helping as well, right? Well, fortunately, between [Earthcraft](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Earthcraft), [Heartbeat of Spring](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Heartbeat+of+Spring), and [Eternal Witness](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eternal+Witness), combined with something like [Cloudshift](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloudshift), you can use your [Eternal Witness](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eternal+Witness) for infinite mana. Your land taps for two white mana, Witness untaps it, you [Cloudshift](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloudshift) your Witness, Witness gets back [Cloudshift](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloudshift), and you're just up a mana from where you were before. Bingo! One million [Helix Pinnacle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Helix+Pinnacle) counters.


Also, appropriately, the deck can just win with the classic [Squirrel Nest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Squirrel+Nest) and [Earthcraft](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Earthcraft) combo. Why is it appropriate? Because *Squirrels*.


Additionally, I added in some counters to help protect the combo. No, not counters to put on your combo. I mean counters to help aid your combo. No not that kind, I mean... you know, why don't I just let this nice guy explain it to you:

When the deck all comes together, it ends up looking something like this:

Okay, we did it! We officially got upvoted. What do we do now? Tell me, trusty Wuv Muffin!


![](https://media.wizards.com/images/magic/daily/sf/2014/sf_wk13_293_doge3.jpg)
 


Well, it's all too clear what the next step is. I trust Wuv Muffin on this. It's time to recruit the trolls!


The trolls are always the trickiest ones to get on your side—but I think we can manage it.


There aren't any true troll tribal cards... but there are a few unique cards that can be used to help out all tribes—even Trolls. [Adaptive Automaton](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Adaptive+Automaton) is a sure bet that fits well in the deck as an inexpensive creature, and [Descendants' Path](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Descendants%27+Path) helps get you Trolls out for free. Most Trolls are green, but stretching into Jund colors gives us a few cool ones as well, plus some on-theme spells. Some burn spells to properly flame people, of course.


Sometimes trolls work together... but not always. What would a Troll deck be without some of the *Avacyn Restored* loner cards like [Homicidal Seclusion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Homicidal+Seclusion)? Some trolls, are well...

Wait a second! I get that it's a Jund deck, but still... Sarkhan, how did *you* get in here?


![](https://media.wizards.com/images/magic/daily/sf/2014/sf_wk13_293_scumbag.jpg)
 


Okay, so I think that about wraps it up, right? We're at the top of the Internet and have all of the trolls on our side. Now Serious Fun is firmly under our command and... and....


You know what? That actually *was* pretty fun! I can see why Bruce does this every week. Maybe I'll let him have his column back for now. I guess that makes me Good Guy Gavin.


![](https://media.wizards.com/images/magic/daily/sf/2014/sf_wk13_293_givesitback.jpg)
 


All right, well, I guess that's it then. Internet, you can go home. Bruce can have his column back, and I can go back to writing about... cats, or whatever it was that I was supposed to write about this week. Hey, I wonder why it was that I couldn't find any [cat memes](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/rc/293)...


For me and Wuv Muffin, that's it for this week. I'll be back next week at my usual ReConstructed timey-wimey time, usual ReConstructed timey-wimey channel. (And I'll have a *Journey into Nyx* preview card for you to boot!)


Until then, have fun. And remember:
