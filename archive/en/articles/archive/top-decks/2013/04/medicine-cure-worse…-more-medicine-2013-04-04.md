Medicine, Cure, (Worse?)… More Medicine

Once upon a time, there was [Delver of Secrets](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Delver+of+Secrets); sometimes it would blind-flip on the second turn with a [Mana Leak](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak), and other times you had to put in a little elbow grease (or tap ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161115194122im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/blue.gif) for a [Ponder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ponder)) to produce an [Insectile Aberration](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Insectile+Aberration). In any case, it was a 3/2 flier for just one mana and won a laboratory full of tournaments... and was perhaps a little too good, at least for what it cost. 


 "This [Delver of Secrets](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Delver+of+Secrets) seems to be winning a lot," commented one overlord of Research and Development. 


"Agreed," agreed another. "Best put a bullet in that one (and it's little dog too)."


 The little dog being, of course, [Vapor Snag](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vapor+Snag). 


A solution was rendered and it was good.



At first, the many mages didn't know what to make of the beastly five-drop. A 5/3 for five? I guess that is okay. And 5 life too? I guess that seems *aesthetic*[\*](#a).



[Thragtusk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thragtusk) was a beastly Beast that got along well with the lands that could cast it. [Cavern of Souls](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cavern+of+Souls) gave the five legs against counterspells where otherwise it might be on the wrong tempo-end.

![Thragtusk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Thragtusk)[Kessig Wolf Run](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kessig+Wolf+Run) gave it the ability to trample over annoying 1/1 creatures. *No chump blocking for you, little Spirit*. [Thragtusk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thragtusk), unassuming at first, played well with the tools surrounding it, and won out of the gate with [Birthing Pod](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Birthing+Pod). 
  But more than any of these interactions or synergies was a little self-contained capability. What could be worse for a five-mana Beast (even one that gained 5 life and could, at least when in concert with [Cavern of Souls](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cavern+of+Souls), always resolve) than being bounced back to hand by a [Vapor Snag](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vapor+Snag) for just ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161115194122im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/blue.gif)? Not only was [Thragtusk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thragtusk) fundamentally resilient against regular removal, but not even a bounce spell, [Oblivion Ring](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oblivion+Ring), or good block would generally prove effective against it. [Thragtusk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thragtusk) always left a little something behind. 


 A solution to [Vapor Snag](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vapor+Snag) was rendered and it was good.

Was the medicine perhaps too good for the problem at hand?


 A solution was rendered and it was good. *Perhaps a little too good.* But at least it didn't cost just ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161115194122im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/blue.gif). 


 Although, of course, today, mages jump through all kinds of hoops to make [Thragtusk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thragtusk) cost less than five. Oftentimes it is the target of an [Unburial Rites](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Unburial+Rites). Other times the big beast sacrifices itself to [Garruk, the Veil-Cursed](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Garruk%2C+the+Veil-Cursed) to (I presume) find another [Thragtusk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thragtusk). One thing is for certain: [Thragtusk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thragtusk) continues to battle on, while tumbleweeds roll past [Delver of Secrets](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Delver+of+Secrets)'s house in Standard. 


 "I am thinking perhaps there is something that needs to be addressed in the [Thragtusk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thragtusk)-department," whispers one overlord to another. 


![Boros Reckoner](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Boros+Reckoner)
 "Are we thinking [Red Elemental Blast](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Red+Elemental+Blast) here; [Circle of Protection: Black](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Circle+of+Protection%3A+Black); or, I dunno, just a [Great Sable Stag](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Great+Sable+Stag)?" 


"I was thinking Sable Stag."


"3/3 it is!"


And so, a solution presented itself.


And perhaps, again, the solution would become a flagship.



[Boros Reckoner](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Boros+Reckoner) could lock arms with [Blasphemous Act](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blasphemous+Act), a one-minotaur bloodbath-to be, or join forces with [Azorius Charm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Azorius+Charm) and [Boros Charm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Boros+Charm), a triumph of resilience and life itself. It could be played in all different kinds of decks: beatdown, control, other beatdown,... even midrange! Although an ostensibly offensively packaged card, [Boros Reckoner](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Boros+Reckoner) was perhaps more effective *against* offensive strategies when played in control decks: a veritable stop sign. 


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/td/td241_stop.jpg)  
 Might we in some future state require a solution to [Boros Reckoner](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Boros+Reckoner)?

Maybe. Probably not. But if so? There is, after all, a long and proud tradition; and it is not always obvious.


 Some nineteen years ago, I was consuming my first blink of **Magic**: The Gathering strategy. It was, if memory serves, the liner notes to the *Revised* rulebook, an apology as to why [Berserk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Berserk) had not been reprinted. I am paraphrasing here, but it said something like, "Failure to have a [Fog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fog) doesn't mean you should lose on the spot," (or some such). 



[Fog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fog)? 


![fog](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Fog)
  

*[Fog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fog) is mighty!* 



At least that is what I was thinking back then.



[Berserk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Berserk) was good. No. [Berserk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Berserk) was *great*. So great it was too powerful to print! And [Fog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fog) was the solution to great [Berserk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Berserk). And—this meant something to me at the time—a fairly *budget* solution. [Berserk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Berserk) was good (no, great) and [Fog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fog) was trump (for cheap). 


 Four [Fog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fog)s went into many a 1994 Flores deck. 


 It turns out, at least at the time, that [Fog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fog) might not have been the best solution. Yes, it kept a man from dying for a turn, but it often amounted to discarding a card. But apparently, in 2013, its window has opened!

![](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Alchemist%27s+Refuge)


















  
 BReal2 finished second at a recent **Magic Online** Standard PTQ with a [Fog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fog) deck! 


 From one angle this is a WU Control deck that happens to play the card [Fog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fog) (rather, [Fog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fog) and [Clinging Mists](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Clinging+Mists), and [Snapcaster Mage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snapcaster+Mage)s to re-buy the [Fog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fog)s and [Clinging Mists](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Clinging+Mists)). But while this is a true statement, the deck has many layers of synergies that make the whole more powerful than any one part. 


 So... why [Fog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fog)? 


 We have spent many editions of Top Decks in recent months recounting the adventures of Naya Blitz, Experiment Jund, and The Aristocrats. Quite simply, when the format starts with [Champion of the Parish](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Champion+of+the+Parish) and [Experiment One](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Experiment+One), powers out Burning Tree Emissary and [Flinthoof Boar](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flinthoof+Boar) on the second turn, and wants to mop up with [Ghor-Clan Rampager](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ghor-Clan+Rampager) or [Falkenrath Aristocrat](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Falkenrath+Aristocrat)... that is a lot of rumbling in the red zone. Games can end very quickly with the right [Cartel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cartel) of attackers. Many of these decks do a great job at one thing—offense—but that hyper-specialization might leave them exposed to defenses that are good at stopping that one thing. 


 Bigger decks—Ramp decks and Tokens decks for instance—might not get there quite as quickly, but they are largely locked down by the same anti-strategies on account of [Fog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fog) knows where they live (or rather where they are trying to go). How does a big [Kessig Wolf Run](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kessig+Wolf+Run) deck win? Attacking. What about a [Gavony Township](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gavony+Township) making lots of little guys bigger and bigger? Card advantage they might have... but in order to finish the game, *they still have to attack.*



 Can it really be [Fog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fog)? 


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/td/td241_fog.jpg)  
 Honestly... not *just* 
[Fog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fog). 


 Even if [Fog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fog) is good against [Boros Elite](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Boros+Elite)—rather, it cuts [Boros Elite](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Boros+Elite) and its triple-creature battalion beatdown down a peg, for a turn... it can really be thought of as... discarding a card. 


 The genius of this deck is that it doesn't *just* use [Fog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fog) (and [Clinging Mists](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Clinging+Mists)) to keep you alive for another turn, but to keep your sidekicks alive as well. Look at all those Planeswalkers! Most decks interact with Planeswalkers by—you guessed it—attacking them. And what is this deck good at doing? Keeping attackers at bay. 


 Against a singular creature, there isn't much in the world you would rather have than [Tamiyo, the Moon Sage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tamiyo%2C+the+Moon+Sage). [Tamiyo, the Moon Sage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Tamiyo%252C%2Bthe%2BMoon%2BSage) can force the opponent to play multiple creatures, which can set up card advantage with [Supreme Verdict](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Supreme+Verdict).

| Tamiyo, the Moon Sage | Supreme Verdict |

 From the very first *Return to Ravnica* Standard tournaments we saw how effective [Jace, Architect of Thought](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace%2C+Architect+of+Thought) and [Tamiyo, the Moon Sage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tamiyo%2C+the+Moon+Sage) could work together: the Batman and Robin of defensive Planeswalkers. Add in a little [Azorius Charm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Azorius+Charm), a pinch of [Fog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fog), and a couple of [Clinging Mists](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Clinging+Mists)? The red zone remains decidedly un-dangerous, while the opponents' creatures have serious problems gaining any traction. 




|  |  |

| Azorius Charm | Clinging Mists |

 Of course, [Augur of Bolas](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Augur+of+Bolas) and [Snapcaster Mage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snapcaster+Mage) are the glue that makes the cheap defensive instants at all compelling. What is better than [Fog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fog)? How about two [Fog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fog)s thanks to [Snapcaster Mage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snapcaster+Mage)? Perhaps followed up with a [Snapcaster Mage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snapcaster+Mage) suicide dive keeping [Tamiyo, the Moon Sage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Tamiyo%252C%2Bthe%2BMoon%2BSage) on the table? What is better than the synergy between [Fog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fog) and Planeswalkers? How about an [Augur of Bolas](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Augur+of+Bolas) that not only finds the [Fog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fog) for you, but jumps in front of an attacker headed for your Jace? 



[Sphinx's Revelation](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sphinx%27s+Revelation) is still good; as an instant, it is in fact very good at finding more defensive instants. 


 ...but what is really new and special and different about this Planeswalker configuration is the card [Gideon, Champion of Justice](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gideon%2C+Champion+of+Justice). 


![Gideon, Champion of Justice](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Gideon%2C+Champion+of+Justice)
  
 This might be the first time we've really seen Gideon in a competitive deck. Interesting note here: Gideon is not only a Planeswalker—synergistic in its way with [Fog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fog) and [Clinging Mists](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Clinging+Mists), capable of hand-holding into a [*Super Friends*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superfriends)-like battlefield position with other Planeswalkers—but offers a great way to win that pushes the envelope specifically against the kinds of opponents where the deck should already be effective. 


 Here is a deck that is well set up against just one or two creatures. One [Lightning Mauler](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Mauler) or [Burning-Tree Emissary](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Burning-Tree+Emissary)? You can trade with your [Snapcaster Mage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snapcaster+Mage) or block all day with [Augur of Bolas](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Augur+of+Bolas). [Tamiyo, the Moon Sage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tamiyo%2C+the+Moon+Sage) can lock down one bad guy, even if it is an absolutely huge [Champion of the Parish](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Champion+of+the+Parish) or seemingly unkillable [Experiment One](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Experiment+One). No harm, no foul, no problem at all as long as that thing stays tapped. 


 So the opponent has to commit more and more to the 'field. Not only is that very good for [Supreme Verdict](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Supreme+Verdict), but it allows Gideon to level up quickly... and, of course, Gideon can attack for however big he is. Or, you can use your [Fog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fog)s and [Clinging Mists](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Clinging+Mists) to protect Gideon and other Planeswalkers, manage how many lands you play (versus how many permanents the opponent is committing), and destroy quite a lot of material once [Big G](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Big+G) goes ultimate. What might not be obvious if you haven't played with a lot of [Fog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fog) effects is that preventing *all* combat damage really means –ALL– the combat damage... no matter where that damage would have ended up. Ergo, one [Clinging Mists](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Clinging+Mists) can defend, say, Gideon, Jace, and [Tamiyo, the Moon Sage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Tamiyo%252C%2Bthe%2BMoon%2BSage) simultaneously. (And you!) 


 For the beatdown: Misery. 


For the control? Not so much. At least not main deck.


 While this deck is obviously positioned against a particular kind of way to win—attacking—whether that is a fast [Experiment One](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Experiment+One), a reasonably fast [Craterhoof Behemoth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Craterhoof+Behemoth), or a slow [Angel of Serenity](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Angel+of+Serenity)... it might be quite a bit less effective against other routes to victory (e.g., decking). 



[Nephalia Drownyard](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nephalia+Drownyard) is a clear threat to this strategy. In the main deck? The only recourse is really to race. [Nephalia Drownyard](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nephalia+Drownyard) isn't a spell, so you can't point the one [Dissipate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dissipate) at it. And not only does it not attack, but cards like [Urban Evolution](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Urban+Evolution) and [Sphinx's Revelation](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sphinx%27s+Revelation) just let the opponent kill you faster. *You've really got to race.* You know, with your three 1/3s and your two 2/1s. 


 The sideboard can offer some solutions (or at least put some distance between now and that point in the future when you *would have been* decked by a [Nephalia Drownyard](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nephalia+Drownyard)). [Witchbane Orb](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Witchbane+Orb) prevents the opponent from targeting you, meaning he or she can't point the [Nephalia Drownyard](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Nephalia%2BDrownyard) at your library. [Psychic Spiral](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psychic+Spiral) does one better. Say the worst has happened and most of your deck is in the graveyard... 




|  |  |

| Witchbane Orb | Psychic Spiral |

 How about putting most of the *opponent's* library in his or her graveyard? With [Snapcaster Mage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snapcaster+Mage)s, you really only need the one. 


Both cards give you some resistance to Human Reanimator as well!


 The rest of the sideboard can be thought of as catch-all cards with a number of different and unique functions. [Curse of Echoes](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Curse+of+Echoes) is awesome against opposing [Sphinx's Revelation](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sphinx%27s+Revelation)s... [Dispel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dispel), [Dissipate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dissipate), and [Negate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Negate) are great against control (and in some cases Reanimator) as well. 



[Centaur Healer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Centaur+Healer) and [Thragtusk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thragtusk) are good blockers that buy time and kind of counterspell a [Searing Spear](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Searing+Spear) or [Brimstone Volley](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brimstone+Volley). 



[Detention Sphere](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Detention+Sphere) makes problem permanents disappear. Ready to have your mind blown? You can play a [Detention Sphere](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Detention+Sphere) *on your own Planeswalker* just moments before you blow up the world with [Gideon, Champion of Justice](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gideon%2C+Champion+of+Justice). The [Detention Sphere](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Detention+Sphere) will go the way of the dodo, and your powerful Planeswalker will return to the battlefield alongside Ultimate Gideon. When there is nothing else on the table, it is hard to imagine a better re-upped turn one.

 The [Fog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fog) deck, I hope, gives you something a little bit different to chew on after all this time of blitz decks and Reanimators (and infinite Reanimators). Although clearly a little bit different from some of the other decks you are used to looking at (even the various other flavors of Bant Control), it is a deck that has already proven capable of a second-place finish in a 354-person PTQ. 


 Firestarter: How do you feel about giving this brew an actual first at [FNM](http://www.wizards.com/Magic/TCG/Events.aspx?x=events/magic/fnm)... or a shot at the biggest game and a passport to [Pro Tour *Dragon's Maze*](http://www.wizards.com/magic/tcg/events.aspx?x=mtg/event/protour/dragonsmaze13)? 


 Speaking of *Dragon's Maze*: Starting next week, Top Decks will bring you the latest in the long line of [Cryptic Command](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cryptic+Command), [Flame Javelin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flame+Javelin), and [Sphinx's Revelation](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sphinx%27s+Revelation)! 



\* Not actually a great use of the word "aesthetic," to be honest. [(return)](#ab)
