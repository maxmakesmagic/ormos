Because of continued manufacturing delays due to COVID-19, *Jumpstart*'s previously announced release date will be shifting to July 17. This shift does not affect the release of *Core Set 2021*, which is June 25 on digital and July 3 on tabletop, with tabletop Prereleases taking place the weekend of June 26.


Additionally, *Jumpstart* will release on *Magic: The Gathering Arena* on July 16. *Jumpstart* cards will be released on *Magic Online* June 25 through Treasure Chests only.


The delay of *Jumpstart* is certainly unfortunate, and we look forward to a return to normalcy once we can ensure the continued health and safety of those who help make our game possible.
