 Until recently, (7) Ari Lax was widely considered one of the best *Magic* players in the world without a Pro Tour Top 8. That all changed earlier this month when Lax was able to break through the Pro Tour Top 8 barrier, defeat Yuuya Watanabe in the quarterfinals, overcome Thiago Saporito in the semis, and secure his place in history as the Pro Tour *Khans of Tarkir* Champion by dispatching of Shaun McLaren in the finals. Today, Lax will be competing in the Legacy Championship, an event he won last year. There's a buzz about his presence in the room and he's at the top of everyone's list of potential winners here this weekend. I had the opportunity sit down with the defending champion between rounds for an interview.
