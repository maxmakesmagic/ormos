Join us at [twitch.tv/magic](https://twitch.tv/magic) for video coverage all weekend long with some of the toughest competition anywhere in the *Magic* world, brought to you by the all-star coverage team of Randy Buehler, Athena Froehlich, Maria Bartholdi, Eric Froehlich, Marshall Sutcliffe, Paul Rietzl, Huey Jensen, and Reid Duke. All times listed here are Pacific.


On Friday, May 17, we start at 10 a.m. with a draft of *War of the Spark* followed by four rounds of Standard.


Saturday, May 18, we start at 8 a.m. with another *War of the Spark* draft, then take a break while the *Magic* Pro League's weekly show airs from noon to 4 p.m. We return right after that with four rounds of Modern, ending with a cut to the Top 4.


On Sunday, May 19, coverage of the Top 4 begins at 10 a.m. During each semifinal and final match, the players will play up to three best-of-three matches, with the first to two match wins advancing. The first match each round will be Standard. The second match will be Modern. If there's a third match, the player with the higher seed will choose which of those two formats to play again. Every match will be played live on camera. Every match will determine what happens next. Will there be six matches? Nine? Who will emerge victorious from the most prestigious *Magic Online* event each year?


You'll have to watch to find out.

Vintage Cube Returns May 15
---------------------------


That's right! Vintage Cube is almost back, and it's nothing like any other cube out there. It's simply overflowing with iconic cards from *Magic*'s entire 25-year history, and you can draft the super-deck of your dreams when it arrives May 15.


To see the full card list and most recent changes, click [here](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/vintage-cube-cardlist).

Banned & Restricted List Update Window
--------------------------------------


Next week, at 8 a.m. PT on Monday, May 20, R&D will make an announcement regarding the banned and restricted lists for each format. If there is a change to any format, *Magic Online* will implement that change at 12 p.m. PT on the same day as the announcement.


If a card is banned or restricted, players using the newly banned card in a league can finish their league courses in the intervening four hours. At noon, however, any remaining players with newly illegal decks will be removed from the league with their entry option returned to their collection. If a card is unbanned or unrestricted, players can join existing leagues with decks containing those cards after the update.

Mythic Championship Qualifier Test Results
------------------------------------------


This past Friday, we tested a new time slot for Premier Events targeted at players who might not be able to fit a morning event into their schedules. The results were promising, so we're going to try this again in a few months with a *Core Set 2020* MCQ Finals. If players would like to see us continue to offer events in this time slot, the best way to let us know is by participating in the Friday event. All you need to do is earn a Red Limited MCQ Finals Token from any of our Limited MCQ Preliminaries between now and August 9.





---


Limited MCQ Saturday & Sunday
-----------------------------


On both Saturday and Sunday, May 18 and 19, there will be a Limited MCQ Finals at 7 a.m. PT. The set will be *War of the Spark*, and the event will cost 1 Limited MCQ Finals Token. The winner will receive an invitation to Mythic Championship Barcelona.

Build Notes
-----------


Duel Scene | If a player toggles on "No possible plays: yield all" they will no longer need to pass priority through stops when they indeed have no possible plays.


General | [Steel Hellkite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Steel+Hellkite) now correctly respects the converted mana cost of transformed permanents.
