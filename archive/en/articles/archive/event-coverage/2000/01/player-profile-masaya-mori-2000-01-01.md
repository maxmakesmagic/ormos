### Magic Origins


"I began playing Magic about two years ago. My friends at school taught me how to play; I learned fast."


### New Player Experiences


"One of the first games I played was with a land destruction deck. I was a new player, and I didn't really know the rules. My opponent's islands looked blue, so I tried to destroy them with Pyroblast."


### Influential People as Novice


"I've been influenced most by my friend Chikara Hayashi, who builds my decks for me."


### Favorite Formats


"Extended is my favorite format, mostly because it allows me to play with Tempest. I think Tempest is one of the most powerful expansions ever printed, and I also really enjoy its look and feel."


### Favorite Deck


"I won last year's APAC championship playing Living Death. Just like this year, the metagame consisted of lots of weenie decks, and I feel that Living Death did a great job of handling them."


### Favorite Opponent


"I enjoy playing with Chikara Hayashi. I've learned a lot from him."


### Best Player in the World


"Jon Finkel is the best player. Isn't it obvious?"


### Favorite Cards


"Counterspell and Impulse. Counterspell should be obvious-it can stop any spell! Impulse can help you if you're mana-hosed and it will help you set up the hand you want."


### Favorite Magic Mechanic


"Well, I'm a big Tempest fan, so I guess my favorite mechanic is buyback."


### Favorite Moment in Magic History (that doesn't involve you)


"I was impressed with Jakub Slemr's performance in the 1999 World Championships. He was a previous world champion and he managed to make another Top 8 the next year. Repeat finishes like that are proof that Magic is a game of skill, not luck."


### Favorite Moment in Magic History (that does involve you)


"Becoming the first two-time continental championship winner. It's a bit of history for ya."


### Favorite Place in Magic Travels


"I like Singapore. The food was good-nothing in particular, I'm from Asia, I like Asian food, better than American food."


### Deck Building Accomplishments


"I don't really make any decks myself."


### Greatest Magic Accomplishment


"Winning this years APAC championships was a vindication of lots of playtesting and practice. Last year's win wasn't too shabby either."


### Magic Playing


"I play **Magic** five or six days a week, three or four hours at a time. Whenever there's going to be an event that features draft, we increase the amount of drafts we do. Otherwise, we play Standard.


### Playtesters


"I playtest regularly with a group of ten friends, including Hayashi. We call ourselves Team John."


### Favorite Historical Magic Development


"I'm really excited that there's going to be a Standard Pro Tour. I think that Standard is the most accessible format to people across the world, so it makes sense that it should have a big impact on the tournament scene."


### Reputation


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/APAC00/Images/FinalsF.jpg)"I am famous for being late to tournaments and I've been late to several PTQ's. I'm not a morning person, so I have trouble getting up. Luckily, I've never been late to a major tournament. That's because all my friends come to wake me up.


I also have a reputation for playing as quickly as possible, so as not to waste time. I don't want my match to time out-I want to win or lose, not draw."


### Other Interests


"I play the guitar, and I often play Mah Jongg. When I was in junior high and high school, I played some baseball, but not any more."
