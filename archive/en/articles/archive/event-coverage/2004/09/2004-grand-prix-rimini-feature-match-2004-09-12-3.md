Rather than play any of the usual suspects Austrian amateur Andreas Jagereder brought a novel blue-red [March of the Machines](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=March+of+the+Machines) deck with him to the tournament. It's doing rather well for him as he played the last round on the top table for the honour of finishing day one with a perfect record. That didn't happen but he's still keeping pace with the leaders. His opponent, the Italian Andrea Paselli, has the much more conventional Affinity deck. Jagereder led off with [Mountain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mountain)s and traded removal, an [Electrostatic Bolt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Electrostatic+Bolt) and [Magma Jet](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Magma+Jet), for Paselli's [Arcbound Worker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arcbound+Worker) and [Frogmite](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Frogmite). A [Thoughtcast](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtcast) found a bit more juice as a Ravager entered play.


Jagereder reached turn four with an island, but didn't have a [March of the Machines](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=March+of+the+Machines). Instead he played a [Darksteel Ingot](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Darksteel+Ingot) that would give him the mana to fetch another mountain with his [Wayfarer's Bauble](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wayfarer%27s+Bauble).


Jagereder cost himself an extra point of life when he allowed Paselli to resolve a Disciple before sac'ing the bauble. The Ravager ate a land and knocked off 3 more points with the help of the Disciple.


Jegereder had nothing more interesting to do in his turn than an AEther Spellbomb. Jegereder couldn't allow a second Disciple to hit play and tapped out to [Condescend](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Condescend) it. He was now open to whatever Paselli could do. Paselli summoned a fresh artifact and they did the maths for a while before it came up with the scoop result for Jagereder.


Paselli 1-0 Jagereder


Game 2 started quietly enough as the Jagereder [Condescend](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Condescend)ed a Ravager on turn two. Paselli followed it with a second Ravager and [Frogmite](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Frogmite).


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gprim04/fm12_2.jpg)The game went worse for Jagereder when he missed a land drop. Paselli looked to take advantage with [Cranial Plating](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cranial+Plating). Jagereder stopped that with a [Magma Jet](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Magma+Jet).


A [Seething Song](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seething+Song) powered [Granulate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Granulate) gave him a lifeline only for Paselli to quickly recover with a second Plating and Worker to put it on.


Two hits and the match was the Italian's.


Andrea Paselli beats Andreas Jagereder 2-0
