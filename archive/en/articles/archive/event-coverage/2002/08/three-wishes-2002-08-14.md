[Obliterate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Obliterate). [Cabal Pit](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cabal+Pit). [Tombfire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tombfire). The introduction of the Wishes from Judgment into the Standard environment has allowed many previously-shunned "niche" cards to finally earn slots in players' sideboards. And some of the stories that have come from these cards have players slapping their foreheads in disbelief.

### [Living Wish](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Living+Wish)

Chris Benafel, playing the Mini-Colony's "Red Zone 2K2" deck, used [Living Wish](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Living+Wish) to fetch [Intrepid Hero](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Intrepid+Hero) against his round 3 opponent. The Hero, a white 1/1 that never saw play back when it was legal in the Urza block, taps to destroy a creature with a power of 4 or greater, making it a great weapon against blue/green [Roar of the Wurm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Roar+of+the+Wurm) decks.

### [Burning Wish](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Burning+Wish)

![Reprocess](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Reprocess)  
 Ed Fear has a horror story involving [Burning Wish](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Burning+Wish). In round two, Ed's opponent (Yuuki Murakami) [Burning Wish](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Burning+Wish)ed for [Reprocess](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reprocess), cast it, defended it with a [Counterspell](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterspell), and then sacrificed all of his permanents except his [Psychatog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psychatog), drawing a huge number of cards. All the fresh cards plus the full graveyard allowed him to kill [Fear](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fear) with one 'Tog hit when [Fear](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fear) figured he was safe.### [Cunning Wish](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cunning+Wish)

Andrew Wolf has been telling a story of his match against Scotland's Douglas Penman in which both players were packing [Cunning Wish](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cunning+Wish). Penman had earlier wished for an [Opportunity](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Opportunity), but hadn't had a chance to cast it. Wolf had also wished, but for a [Mana Short](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Short) to try and force an [Upheaval](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Upheaval) through. At one point, Wolf cast a Fact Fiction. Penman tried a [Circular Logic](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Circular+Logic), but Wolf had a Logic of his own. Penman, out of counter, announced [Opportunity](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Opportunity), hoping to draw more permission. But Wolf had other ideas. He responded with the [Mana Short](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Short), tapping Penman out, and then Wolf wished... for a [Divert](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Divert). "Thank you, but I'll be drawing four cards, not you." On top of that, his [Fact or Fiction](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fact+or+Fiction) resolved, and winning the game was just a formality.
