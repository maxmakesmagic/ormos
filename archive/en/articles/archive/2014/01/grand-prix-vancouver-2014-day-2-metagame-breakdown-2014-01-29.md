GRAND PRIX VANCOUVER 2014 - DAY 2 METAGAME BREAKDOWN
====================================================



 Posted in [NEWS](/en/articles)
 on January 29, 2014 










Thanks to the latest pseudoscientific advances, we are able to bring you a breakdown of the 128 decks that made it into Day 2 here at Grand Prix Vancouver. We hope that this will provide you insight into the texture of the current standard metagame, and perhaps spark some innovation here in the last weeks before *Born of the Gods*.


### Mono-Blue Devotion: 25


After arriving with thunderous success at Pro Tour *Theros*, the Mono-Blue Devotion deck has been one of the decks to beat. Combining some of the most powerful cards in *Theros*, it comes out fast and can easily overwhelm the opponent. When [Master of Waves](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Master+of+Waves) shows up with five friends, the game often doesn't last much longer. [Thassa, God of the Sea](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thassa%2C+God+of+the+Sea) keeps the good cards coming, and also lets you slip through for the last few points of damage. She can also beat the opponent about the face and neck, provided you are sufficiently devoted.


### Mono-Black Control: 22


It wasn't until the discovery of [Pack Rat](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pack+Rat) as a constructed powerhouse that the Mono-Black deck went from Threat to Menace. No less a player than Owen Turtenwald declared that the opening of [Thoughtseize](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtseize) into [Pack Rat](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pack+Rat) was the most powerful in the format, then backed it up by winning Grand Prix Albuquerque. The ability of the deck to shift gears from aggro to control, and its multiple angles of attack make it a daunting opponent.


### Blue-White Control: 16


There's no denying the power of [Sphinx's Revelation](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sphinx%27s+Revelation). However, players have yet to agree on the right way to harness that power. Earlier in the format, Esper Control was the gold standard. These days it's trimmed down to just blue-white, with a bunch of black scry-lands to help smooth out draws and provide some narrow sideboard options, like [Dark Betrayal](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dark+Betrayal).


### Mono-Black Splashing White: 14


One day you're the new hotness, the next you're old and busted. The numbers say that compromising the Mono-Black machine to fit in cards like [Last Breath](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Last+Breath), [Blood Baron of Vizkopa](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Baron+of+Vizkopa) and [Elspeth, Sun's Champion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elspeth%2C+Sun%27s+Champion) just isn't worth it, but maybe a more varied toolbox suits a metagame with so many decks?


### Red-Green Monsters: 12


Don't mistake this for Masahiko Mihara's Colossal Gruul deck from Pro Tour *Theros*. This deck hits the ground running and doesn't mess about with [Nykthos, Shrine to Nyx](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nykthos%2C+Shrine+to+Nyx). Efficient attackers backed by [Ghor-Clan Rampager](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ghor-Clan+Rampager) and planeswalkers make for very short games.


### Mono-Red Devotion with [Chained to the Rocks](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chained+to+the+Rocks): 9


Now here's a deck that cherishes a Nykthos. Early attackers with plenty of red mana symbols, then [Purphoros, God of the Forge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Purphoros%2C+God+of+the+Forge), [Stormbreath Dragon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stormbreath+Dragon), and [Fanatic of Mogis](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fanatic+of+Mogis) to set the opponent on fire. [Chained to the Rocks](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chained+to+the+Rocks) provides an answer for otherwise troubling creatures.


### [Young Pyromancer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Young+Pyromancer) Burn: 5


A new addition to the metagame, this Red-White deck does what its name implies. Both Chandra and her Phoenix help give it staying power.


### Esper "Humans": 4


This deck made a splash at Grand Prix Shizuoka, surprising everyone with its mix of aggressive humans and control elements. [Xathrid Necromancer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Xathrid+Necromancer) is the all-star here.


### The Rest: 21


Plenty of other options made it into Sunday if none of those strike your fancy, including Naya Midrange, Colossal Gruul, Golgari Control, White-Black Humans, White-Weenie with Red, [Maze's End](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Maze%27s+End), Agent of Fates Aggro, and Blue-White-Red Control.
