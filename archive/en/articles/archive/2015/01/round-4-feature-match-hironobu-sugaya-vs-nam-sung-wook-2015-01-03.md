 Hironobu Sugaya surprised everyone when his Kithkin deck took down the dominant Faeries archetype at GP Manila in 2008. Seven years later he had returned to Manila for a repeat performance with another aggressive deck, Abzhan Aggro. However his opponent, Nam Sung Wook, the first South Korean player to win a Grand Prix, GP Melbourne last year, was equally determined to take his opponent down with [Jeskai Ascendancy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jeskai+Ascendancy).



Game 1
======


Hironobu won the roll and elected to play first, with both players keeping a grip of seven. Hironobu found his colours early, but missed his Turn 3 drop, leaving himself attacking with a lone [Heir of the Wilds](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Heir+of+the+Wilds). Nam, not facing significant pressure, developed his mana with land and a [Sylvan Caryatid](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sylvan+Caryatid). Nam played a Commune with Gods. When Hironobu saw an [Altar of the Brood](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Altar+of+the+Brood) hit the graveyard off the Commune he laughed, finally recognising his opponent's deck. 



Hironobu found a [Courser of Kruphix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Courser+of+Kruphix), while Nam demonstrated the power of his deck, using Taiga's Scheming to fill his graveyard, cast a [Treasure Cruise](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treasure+Cruise) for a single mana, then cast a [Dig Through Time](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dig+Through+Time) for two blue mana. Hironobu continued to swing in and played out a [Wingmate Roc](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wingmate+Roc), hoping to close out the game next turn. 



With an exile pile almost as large as his library, Nam tapped his two [Sylvan Caryatid](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sylvan+Caryatid) and [Rattleclaw Mystic](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rattleclaw+Mystic) to play [Jeskai Ascendancy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jeskai+Ascendancy). He quickly followed up with a Briber's Purse for zero and untapped the two mana creatuers. Noting Hironobu was without open mana, Nam showed his [Retraction Helix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Retraction+Helix) and [Altar of the Brood](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Altar+of+the+Brood) in hand, and Hironobu conceded.




**Hironobu 0 - Nam 1**



Game 2
======


Again, Hironobu chose to play, with both players keeping. This time Hironobu 's two drop was a Fleecemain Lion, and was followed up by a Turn 4 [Anafenza, the Foremost](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Anafenza%2C+the+Foremost), putting significant pressure on Nam. Nam played a Satry Wayfinder but whiffed on hitting land, and by Turn 4 was stranded on two lands, plus a [Rattleclaw Mystic](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rattleclaw+Mystic).

Turn 5 Hironobu dopped a [Wingmate Roc](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wingmate+Roc) plus his Roc token buddy, threatening lethal the following turn. Nam went into the tank. After considering his options, Nam tapped his Mountain to play a [Dragon Mantle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragon+Mantle) on the [Rattleclaw Mystic](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rattleclaw+Mystic). Nam drew into [Yavimaya Coast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Yavimaya+Coast), which he played out, then cast a Briber's Purse for 1.



Hironobu swung for lethal. Nam blocked Anafenza, then attempted to cast a [Retraction Helix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Retraction+Helix) on the [Satyr Wayfinder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Satyr+Wayfinder). Hironobu responds with a removal spell and it was all over.




**Hironobu 1 - Nam 1**



Game 3
======


With Nam on the play, Hironobu considered his hand. With no removal, but a 2 drop and a 3 drop, could he beat his opponent fast enough to prevent him comboing off? Hironobu choose to keep.




![](https://media.wizards.com/2014/events/gpman15/FM4-Nam-Sung-Wook.jpg)  



Hironobu cast a Turn 2 Rakashasa Deathdealer and Turn 3 [Anafenza, the Foremost](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Anafenza%2C+the+Foremost), calculating he could kill his opponent by Turn 5. On Turn 4 Nam considered his board of lone Rattleclaw Shaman and four lands. With a tapped out opponent, Nam decided to go for the combo. Nam played a [Jeskai Ascendancy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jeskai+Ascendancy), followed by a [Dig Through Time](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dig+Through+Time), untapping the [Rattleclaw Mystic](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rattleclaw+Mystic). Nam cast a Briber's Purse for zero, tapped the [Rattleclaw Mystic](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rattleclaw+Mystic) for blue, and cast Retration Helix. Hironobu laughs and concedes with the combo on the stack.



"This deck has so many [Treasure Cruise](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treasure+Cruise) and [Dig Through Time](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dig+Through+Time), it's very important to mill myself." Nam said afterwards. "Turn 2 is very important, without either a Mystic, Caryatid, Commune or Taiga I have to mulligan."




**Hironobu 1 - Nam 2**
