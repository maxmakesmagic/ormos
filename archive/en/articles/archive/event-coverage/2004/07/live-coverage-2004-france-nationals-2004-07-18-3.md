Franck was one of only three players with a perfect record coming into this draft. The others, Olivier Ruel and Alexandre Peset were also at his table, which was as follows Yann Hamon - Steven Gouin - Emilien Barth - Olivier Ruel - Remi Lacorre - Franck Canu - Romain Clere - Alexandre Peset


He opened a decent pack giving him the choice of [Arrest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arrest), [Pyrite Spellbomb](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyrite+Spellbomb), [Slith Firewalker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Slith+Firewalker), [Leaden Myr](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leaden+Myr) and [Barter in Blood](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Barter+in+Blood). He chose the white card. The second pack that came had no playable white cards at all but a host of red ones, [Wizard Replica](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wizard+Replica), [Neurok Spy](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Neurok+Spy), and [Somber Hoverguard](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Somber+Hoverguard), and nothing else of note, from which he took the Spy. A shallow third pack gave him a red Myr. Black began to show up in large quantities in the boosters, his fourth pack had an [Irradiate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Irradiate) and a [Nim Shambler](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nim+Shambler) in addition to the [Leonin Scimitar](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leonin+Scimitar) he took.


Fifth pick gave him a [Soldier Replica](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soldier+Replica) over another [Irradiate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Irradiate), followed by a [Soul Nova](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soul+Nova) over a [Nim Shambler](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nim+Shambler) and a [Frogmite](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Frogmite). It was noticable that apart from his second pack, there had been very few blue cards coming his way. It appeared that noone wanted black, as his twelfth pack had a choice between [Irradiate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Irradiate), [Nim Shambler](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nim+Shambler), and [Necrogen Spellbomb](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Necrogen+Spellbomb). By the end of *Mirrodin* he really only had one color, white, with a couple of black cards and the [Neurok Spy](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Neurok+Spy) keeping his options open for *Darksteel*.


He had a tough choice between [Greater Harvester](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Greater+Harvester) and [Loxodon Mystic](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Loxodon+Mystic) first up. The Harvester is a much better card (and rare !), but the Mystic is pretty good and it would be a major commitment to black. In any case he went with the black card. A [Loxodon Mystic](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Loxodon+Mystic) and [Razor Golem](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Razor+Golem) followed but then the quality picks dried up. He got a couple of arcbound mediocrities and a Pulse of the Field (nowhere near as good in draft as in constructed), a [Whispersilk Cloak](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Whispersilk+Cloak) and approximately 4 [Darksteel Citadel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Darksteel+Citadel)s, these being the only playable cards he picked.


Because of the miserable *Darksteel* cards, he needed a large number of playables to round out his deck from *Fifth Dawn*. He was not in a position to take Sunburst cards, being just two colors with only an [Iron Myr](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Iron+Myr).


His first five picks were all fine and beyond rebuke - [Auriok Salvagers](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Auriok+Salvagers), [Devour in Shadow](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Devour+in+Shadow), [Fill with Fright](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fill+with+Fright), Wayfarerers Bauble, and [Lose Hope](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lose+Hope). Sixth pick gave him an actual choice between a second [Lose Hope](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lose+Hope) and a Mephidross Crocodile. Perhaps because he already had one [Lose Hope](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lose+Hope) he chose the 5/1. I've got to admit I'm not the biggest fan of this guy as it trades for a [Myr Moonvessel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Myr+Moonvessel). At least he got plenty of cards he'd be happy to play after the miserable *Darksteel* packs. His deck was rounded out by 7th-9th pick [Cackling Imp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cackling+Imp), [Fill with Fright](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fill+with+Fright) and [Fleshgrafter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fleshgrafter)s.


Canu's deck is definitely solid, and at 6-0 he'd be perfectly happy with 2-1 out of this pod. It seems likely he'll manage it.
