Welcome to the standard portion of this years competition. This round sees Farid Meraghni, winner of Pro Tour San Diego, take on Florent Jeudon of the famous Black Ops team. They both made it through the draft portion at 5-1, quite a respectable record. Farid has been testing draft heavily on Magic Online. In fact, if you've played a draft in the last few months, the chances are Farid was in it. With more accounts than most small countries, he's famous for running multiple drafts at the same time.

### Game 1

![Opposition](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Opposition)Farid got a strong start with his [Opposition](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Opposition) deck busting out a first turn [Llanowar Elves](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Llanowar+Elves) and a second turn [Squirrel Nest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Squirrel+Nest). As Jeudon laid a [Forgotten Cave](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forgotten+Cave) and a [Plains](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plains), Farid chose [Astral Slide](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Astral+Slide) with [Cabal Therapy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cabal+Therapy). This missed and a [Squirrel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Squirrel) allowed him to flash it back on the two [Wrath of God](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wrath+of+God)s in Florent's hand.Meraghni busted out a [Wild Mongrel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Mongrel) to put the pressure firmly on Florent. Jeudon drew [Living Wish](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Living+Wish) to fetch [Aven Cloudchaser](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aven+Cloudchaser), but Farid had another [Cabal Therapy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cabal+Therapy) to remove it. He then dropped [Opposition](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Opposition). This wasn't quite a hard lock against Florent as he could [Slice and Dice](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Slice+and+Dice) away any number of [Squirrel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Squirrel)s.

Farid didn't have enough creatures in play to tap all of Florent's land and this allowed Florent to play his topdecked [Lightning Rift](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Rift). Farid cast [Quiet Speculation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Quiet+Speculation) to fetch [Roar of the Wurm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Roar+of+the+Wurm) and two [Call of the Herd](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Call+of+the+Herd)s that could survive the Rift. After flashing back all of these, and using his [Squirrel Nest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Squirrel+Nest) a few times, Meraghni easily had enough creatures to tap all of Florent's lands in his upkeep. Jeudon didn't find [Slice and Dice](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Slice+and+Dice) in time, and the [Roar of the Wurm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Roar+of+the+Wurm) and [Call](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Call)s ended the game fairly quickly.

Farid Meraghni 1 – Florent Jeudon 0

### Game 2

Sideboarding was fairly easy for both players – Florent's Slide deck can take out superfluous creatures such as [Teroh's Faithful](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Teroh%27s+Faithful) and one [Exalted Angel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Exalted+Angel) for [Ray of Revelation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ray+of+Revelation), and Farid took out his [Smother](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Smother)s for Rays, since they can only target face-down Angels. He also took out all of his Cabal Therapies for [Envelop](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Envelop), which is probably not correct – you want to leave one in against everyone and probably more versus Slide.

![Lightning Rift](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Lightning+Rift)Florent played a turn two [Lightning Rift](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Rift) and Farid had a [Ray of Revelation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ray+of+Revelation) ready for it with some help from a fortunate [City of Brass](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=City+of+Brass). Jeudon played a morph on turn three, but didn't have the white mana to unmorph.Florent repaid the complement with an immediate [Ray of Revelation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ray+of+Revelation) on [Squirrel Nest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Squirrel+Nest), and then Farid dropped [Opposition](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Opposition) which was also Rayed. Meraghni was having some mana problems and took a lot of damage from [City of Brass](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=City+of+Brass).

Meraghni played a [Static Orb](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Static+Orb) but it wasn't particularly frightening for Jeudon without an [Opposition](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Opposition) in play and Florent had plenty of time to find his [Plains](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plains) and unmorph [Exalted Angel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Exalted+Angel), for which [Opposition](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Opposition) was the only answer in Farid's deck. Meraghni made a [Phantom Centaur](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phantom+Centaur), but as he had already taken a few points of pain from his lands, and Florent was gaining four lives a turn, it wasn't even a race.

Farid Meraghni 1 – Florent Jeudon 1

After sideboarding this matchup swings a lot. Without [Ray of Revelation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ray+of+Revelation), Florent's deck can virtually scoop to [Opposition](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Opposition), but with it he can buy a lot of time to find [Exalted Angel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Exalted+Angel). Meraghni doesn't really have much chance of putting enough pressure on without his enchantments. On the other hand, Farid's [Ray of Revelation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ray+of+Revelation)s are more of an annoyance than a real problem for Florent.

### Game 3

![Exalted Angel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Exalted+Angel)Farid got a much better start this game, playing a first turn [Birds of Paradise](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Birds+of+Paradise), then Speculating and playing a second Bird on turn two. He then played an [Opposition](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Opposition). Florent didn't have a third land and discarded [Ray of Revelation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ray+of+Revelation). "Combo!" said Farid. He [Duress](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress)ed away a [Slice and Dice](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Slice+and+Dice) and made a pair of [Call of the Herd](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Call+of+the+Herd)s.Jeudon was having severe mana problems, with only one [Plains](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plains) and two [Forest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest)s in play, as well as a face-down Angel. A second [Plains](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plains) would have allowed him to play any of his three [Wrath of God](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wrath+of+God)s or unmorph [Exalted Angel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Exalted+Angel). He did draw a land but it was a [Mountain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mountain), and Farid added a [Phantom Centaur](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phantom+Centaur) and two more [Call of the Herd](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Call+of+the+Herd)s.

Jeudon drew another non-[Plains](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plains) card and conceded; Farid showed him the [Envelop](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Envelop) in hand meaning that Florent couldn't have [Wrath](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wrath)ed anyway.

****Final Result:**** Farid Meraghni 2 – Florent Jeudon 1
