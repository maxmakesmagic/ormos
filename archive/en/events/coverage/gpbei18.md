Day 1 Coverage



*Dominaria* is a historic plane with a deep and fascinating history, where primordial dragons clashed, and planeswalkers fought cataclysmic duels. 909 Dominarians showed up to compete for the champion trophy, and after nine rounds of Swiss, four players rose to the top, namely Wu Kon Fai, Wang Haokang, Ken Yukuhiro, and Liu Tianyu.


Close behind were a horde of stalwarts at 8-1, such as (5) Shota Yasooka, Ryoichi Tamada, Takuma Morofuji, Toru Inoue, Lu Chao, (14) Kelvin Chew, Yam Wing Chun, Zhang Zhiyang, and Sato Rei. The top four draft pods were looking rather stacked indeed, owing to the veteran-dense field


Going down the list, more familiar names catch our attention. Riku Kumagai, Lee Shi Tian, Kazuyuki Takimura, Kenta Harane, Yoshihiko Ikawa, (5) Yuuya Watanabe, Sugaya Hironobu, Teruya Kakumae, Yuki Matsumoto, as well as Chinese household names Yu Yin, Gao Tan, Du Xuetong, Lei Qiang, and Liu Yuchen all survived the 6-2 cut before advancing to 7-2 after the ninth round.


180 players will return tomorrow for six rounds of *Dominaria* Booster Draft before the Top 8 cut determines who will make the Final Draft table. Check back tomorrow as the action unravels. Meanwhile, Skittering Surveyor continues to rule the day and win everybody's hearts!
