 Mike Rosenberg is a writer and gamer and has been part of the Magic text coverage team since 2011. He joined Wizards as organized play’s content specialist in June 2014. 






The 2015–16 season will come to its conclusion this weekend with [Pro Tour *Eldritch Moon*](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/ptemn), as players compete for World *Magic* Cup captaincies, Pro Tour Players Club levels, World Championship seats, and the title of Pro Tour Champion.


Pro Tour *Eldritch Moon* Basics
===============================


Curious what a Pro Tour is? Look no further.


This Pro Tour is a three-day, invitation-only event featuring Regional Pro Tour Qualifier winners, top Grand Prix finishers, Hall of Famers, and players who have secured invitations through the [Pro Tour Players Club](http://magic.wizards.com/en/content/pro-players-club), all competing for a share of $250,000 in a test of Standard deck building and piloting as well as Booster Draft skill.


And to make things even more exciting, this Pro Tour is at the end of a premier play season (which encompasses all events from the first Grand Prix following [Pro Tour *Magic Origins*](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/ptori) last year all the way up to this Pro Tour), so there's even more on the line than usual. The end of the season determines seats in the 2016 *Magic: The Gathering* World Championship, captaincy for the 2016 World *Magic* Cup, and Pro Players Club levels for the next season!


* The formats for Friday and Saturday are three rounds of Booster Draft—two packs of *Eldritch Moon* and one pack of *Shadows over Innistrad* in that order—and five rounds of Standard Constructed.
* The following sets are legal for this tournament: *Dragons of Tarkir*, *Magic Origins*, *Battle for Zendikar*, *Oath of the Gatewatch*, *Shadows over Innistrad*, and *Eldritch Moon*.
* All players with 12 or more match points (a 4-4 record or better) at the end of Day One advance to Day Two of the tournament.
* The Top 8 players at the end of Saturday advance to Sunday's single-elimination playoff.
* Sunday play is single-elimination Standard Constructed with players using their decks from Friday and Saturday, featuring a round of quarterfinals and semifinals before the final match of the event.
* All matches played on Sunday are best-three-out-of-five, with the first two games featuring pre-sideboard action. The quarterfinals will be played two at a time, with the live video broadcast showcasing the climactic games from each match under the camera.
* The semifinals will be played one at a time, capturing the entirety of their matches under the camera.
* The winner receives $40,000, Platinum status in the Pro Players Club (netting them invitations with airfare and hotel covered for Pro Tours through the 2015-16 and 2016-17 seasons along with appearance fees), and an invitation to the 2016 *Magic: The Gathering* World Championship.

End-of-Season Races
===================


As mentioned above, there are a *lot* of things on the line at this Pro Tour. Such as:


* Seats in the 2016 *Magic: The Gathering* World Championship
* National captaincies to represent their countries in the 2016 World *Magic* Cup
* Pro Tour Players Club levels for the 2016–17 season
* 2015–16's Player of the Year
* 2015–16's Rookie of the Year
* And much, much more!

I could write a whole article about all the races that conclude with this Pro Tour, but fortunately for me, [Rich Hagon already did that on Tuesday](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/organized-play/pro-tour-eldritch-moon-preview-part-2-2016-08-02), so I recommend giving that a read if you haven't.


Needless to say, this will be a weekend of *Magic* that fans won't want to miss out on.


When Does Coverage Start?
=========================


You can watch all three days of Pro Tour *Eldritch Moon* LIVE on [twitch.tv/magic](http://www.twitch.tv/magic) on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday beginning at 9 a.m. local time.


Of course, local time means Sydney, Australia, time. What does that mean for you if you're not in Australia?


Well, here you are.




| Time Zone | Day One | Day Two | Day Three |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Pacific Time (PT) | 4 p.m. (Thursday) | 4 p.m. (Friday) | 4 p.m. (Saturday) |
| Eastern Time (ET) | 7 p.m. (Thursday) | 7 p.m. (Friday) | 7 p.m. (Saturday) |
| Universal Coordinated Time (UTC) | 11 p.m. (Thursday) | 11 p.m. (Friday) | 11 p.m. (Saturday) |
| Central European Time (CEST) | 1 a.m. | 1 a.m. | 1 a.m. |
| Japan Time (JT) | 8 a.m. | 8 a.m. | 8 a.m. |

We will replay the broadcast after each day concludes as well, so if you're asleep when the action's happening, you'll be able to catch all of it during the rebroadcast.


The Coverage Team
=================


A couple of weeks ago, Greg Collins listed out the full teams for coverage during this *Eldritch Moon* "trilogy" of weekends. Below you'll be able to find the full coverage team and their roles for Pro Tour *Eldritch Moon*.


* Play-by-Play Commentators: Marshall Sutcliffe, Tim Willoughby, and Gaby Spartz
* Color Commentators: Randy Buehler and Ian Duke (with a possible Sunday cameo by Luis Scott-Vargas)
* News Desk: Rich Hagon and Brian David-Marshall

* Photographer: Craig Gibson
* Content Managers/Editors: Blake Rasmussen, Mike Rosenberg, and Chris Gleeson

Where Else Can I Experience the Coverage?
=========================================


You can also watch live coverage of Pro Tour *Eldritch Moon* on a few other platforms, such as our [YouTube page](https://www.youtube.com/user/wizardsmtg), NicoNico (in both English and Japanese), and BiliBili (Chinese Simplified only).


You'll also be able to find round-by-round content, decklists, articles, and more on the [Pro Tour *Eldritch Moon* coverage page](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/ptemn).


When Will Decklists Be Published?
=================================


Always a popular question, and of no surprise since the Pro Tour features a *ton* of decks for viewers and readers to look through.


Every Constructed feature match write-up will highlight the decklists of the players from those games once Round 16 is underway. Other articles might get decklists around that time, too. Just look for the text that says, "*Decklists will be available after Round 16*" at the top of the page, and you'll know to check back later in the weekend for more content!


As for our top Standard decklists, those will go up on Sunday by the lunch break (if not earlier).


Where Can I Find Out More?
==========================


If you are out and about and can't stay tuned in to the coverage the whole time (or are asleep and want a quick reference for updates), you can get the latest updates from Sydney by following [@MagicProTour](http://www.twitter.com/magicprotour) on Twitter. The latest pairings, results, and standings are posted there as well.


Join the conversation using the hashtag [#PTEMN](https://twitter.com/hashtag/ptemn), and follow the [*Magic: The Gathering* Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/MagicTheGathering) for photos, additional stories, and very likely some live interviews from the show floor that give you a look at the Pro Tour from a different perspective.


And of course, you can always just stay tuned into [twitch.tv/magic](http://www.twitch.tv/magic) for all the latest.


The end of the season is here. I'm excited to see who emerges triumphant. How about you?
