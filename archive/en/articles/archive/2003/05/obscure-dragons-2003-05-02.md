If you are interested in building a casual Dragon deck and need more Dragons, the *Portal* (and *Starter*) sets are full of some little-known gems. Here are six Dragons you may not have heard of. No, they are not tournament-legal, but if you're playing just for fun, they can really bring the hurt…

| 
Ebon Dragon
 |  | 
Fire Dragon
 |
| **[Ebon Dragon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ebon+Dragon)***Portal* rare
 The art on this card, done by [Donato Giancola](http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=mtgcom/feature/144), is one of the most popular pieces from the *Portal* series. |  | **[Fire Dragon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fire+Dragon)***Portal* rare
 Fire Dragon comes with a built-in [Spitting Earth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spitting+Earth)… and a hefty mana cost. |
| 
Cloud Dragon
 |  | 
Brimstone Dragon
 |
| **[Cloud Dragon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloud+Dragon)***Portal* rare
 Cloud Dragon was printed as [Cloud Djinn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloud+Djinn) in the *Weatherlight* set. |  | **[Brimstone Dragon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brimstone+Dragon)***Portal Second Age* rare
 Brimstone Dragon is a bigger version of [Volcanic Dragon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Volcanic+Dragon), which appeared in *Mirage* and the first *Portal*. |
| 
Zodiac Dragon
 |  | 
Thunder Dragon
 |
| **[Zodiac Dragon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Zodiac+Dragon)***Portal Three Kindgoms* rare
 Zodiac Dragon has a built-in regrowth function like [Squee, Goblin Nabob](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Squee%2C+Goblin+Nabob), but suffers from poor wording. (See today's [Card of the Day](http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=mtgcom/cotd/0503).) |  | **[Thunder Dragon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thunder+Dragon)***Starter 1999* rare
 Thunder Dragon's comes-into-play ability is devastating; it can wipe out entire weenie decks in one blow. |
