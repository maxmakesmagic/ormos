**Standard Super League Finals Tonight**


Stop by tonight for the Standard Super League finals! Over the course of the past season, *Magic* Hall of Fame members Randy Buehler and Luis Scott-Vargas, have hosted eight-player single-elimination tournaments every Tuesday night to see which competitor emerges as the first Standard Super League Champion. The deciding match starts at 6:00 p.m. Pacific (UTC-7) on [twitch.tv/magic](http://www.twitch.tv/magic)!


For a recap of what happened in last week's episode of the Standard Super League, head over to Randy Buehler's latest [article](http://magic.wizards.com/en/MTGO/articles/archive/magic-online/standard-super-league-episode-9-recap-2015-06-30).


Remember, we'll be posting each player's deck lists for the Standard Super League finals to [MTGO.com](http://magic.wizards.com/en/game-info/products/magic-online) at 6:00 p.m. Pacific (UTC-7) so that viewers can follow along at home!

***Magic Online* Collection Performance Upgrades Coming July 8**


We have made a number of behind-the-scenes changes designed to improve the speed, efficiency, and accuracy of *Magic Online* that will be rolling out during the Wednesday, July 8, downtime. These changes have several practical benefits, many of which help reduce the amount of time you have to spend waiting for *Magic Online* to respond. There are three main changes that you should see immediately.



1. Log in time is greatly reduced. That means if you get disconnected during a draft or a game, you’ll be able to rejoin the action faster!
2. Moving large groups of cards is much smoother. Practically, this lets you create massive trade binders or organize a large collection with less headache.
3. We have reduced many cases where a “Waiting for Main Navigation” message or a crash would occur due to memory or performance issues.


There are a few other changes that we’d like to highlight as well:



* We have improved our performance when moving, sorting, and filtering cards for display. *Magic Online* should remain responsive while these actions occur. If there is a delay, it will be indicated by a momentary light grey overlay.
* We have updated of a number of error messages that might display while navigating your collection to make these errors more helpful.
* We no longer pop up a progress bar while waiting for deck, collection, or active trade binder synchronization to the server to complete.
* It is not necessary to clear binders between trades and re-add items.
