 Josh McClain, the Iowa native and Grand Prix Detroit winner, sat down and shuffled in the feature match area. He was one of the few top players slinging Abzan Midrange today. It's slightly teched out, with [Ajani, Mentor of Heroes](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ajani%2C+Mentor+of+Heroes), and two [Anafenza, the Foremost](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Anafenza%2C+the+Foremost), but it looked familiar.




 "I like the Anafenza against the [Whip of Erebos](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Whip+of+Erebos) decks," he told me. "Also, it helps attack planeswalkers against decks like Mardu. Getting a couple more 'haste' creatures can really help out," he said as he made finger quotes around "haste."




 Jason Hernandez is a San Antonio local, and this is his first Grand Prix ever. A long-time player, he's finally gotten to a point with his work and family that he can really afford to take the time to get in some mage battling. He'd been playing since *Mirage* and seemed pretty excited to be hanging out. A policeman when he's not a wizard, he's really looking forward to coming to events more often. That's definitely a feeling you get when you're sitting 4-0. He's yet to lose in a Grand Prix.



"Didn't y'all get hit with a lot of snow recently?" Hernandez asked McClain.


"Yeah, but actually when I left it was like 40 degrees. I really left at the wrong time." They both laughed.



 The two bantered about weather patterns, the cluster-hell that was Grand Prix Dallas-Fort Worth last year, and the scary potential for Grand Prix Omaha coming in January. They presented their decks, both kept their opening seven cards, and battled.




**The Games**




 McClain cast a turn-one [Thoughtseize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtseize) to get a look at what he was up against. Playing the Abzan deck, the most consistently powerful deck around, McClain wanted to clear the way for his big ol' Rhinos and Rocs.
