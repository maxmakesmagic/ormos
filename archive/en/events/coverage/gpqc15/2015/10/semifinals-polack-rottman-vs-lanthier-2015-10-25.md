Two former Grand Prix Champions. Both former National Champions of their respective countries. Both playing what many believe is the best deck to come out of Pro Tour *Battle for Zendikar*. Only one of them would advance to the finals.


Canada's Dan Lanthier is a member of Team Face-to-Face Games and a fixture on the Grand Prix circuit. Earlier this year he finally cracked the Top 8 at Vancouver and made the most of it by walking away with the trophy. He's looking to shake the dust of a disappointing Day 2 at the Pro Tour and notch his second championship.


Austria's Oliver Polak-Rottmann is no stranger to GP Top 8's. This was his fourth, and a fine follow-up to his Top 64 finish at the Pro Tour last weekend, and most importantly locked up Silver for him, earning him hearty cross-Atlantic congratulations from Matej “Big Z” Zatlkaj via Twitter.

**The Decks**


Both players are playing extremely similar versions the Jeskai Black deck that propelled both Jon Finkel and Owen Turtenwald to the Top 8 of Pro Tour Battle for Zendikar. Polak-Rottmann has [Dragonlord Silumgar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragonlord+Silumgar), [Negate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Negate), and an extra [Kolaghan's Command](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kolaghan%27s+Command) where Lanthier has [Sarkhan, the Dragonspeaker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sarkhan%2C+the+Dragonspeaker), an extra [Wild Slash](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Slash) and an extra [Dispel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dispel). The decks are packed to the gills with reactive two-for-ones. It was unlikely to be a quick affair.

**The Games**


Polak-Rottmann led out, and got on the board with a third-turn [Mantis Rider](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mantis+Rider). Lanthier took the hit, then passed his third turn after playing his land. Polak-Rottmann played a land and hit again, content to wait on his single threat. Another land-go from Lanthier, but he pulled the trigger on [Crackling Doom](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crackling+Doom) when the Rider swung in for the third time.


It was all land, all the time for the next few turns. Finally Lanthier gave them something to fight over, a [Dragonmaster Outcast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragonmaster+Outcast). Polak-Rottmann tapped four for [Ojutai's Command](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ojutai%27s+Command) and it went uncontested. Lanthier waited and undid the advantage with [Kolaghan's Command](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kolaghan%27s+Command), getting back his Outcast and forcing a discard. The 2-for-1 tug-of-war continued on the next turn with a [Kolaghan's Command](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kolaghan%27s+Command) from Polak-Rottmann, gunning down the replayed Outcast and getting back [Mantis Rider](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mantis+Rider). They matched a pair of [Dispel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dispel)s fighting over it, but it resolved.


Of course, Polak-Rottman wasn't about to play it, not when he had perfectly good instants he could be spending his mana on. He resolved [Dig Through Time](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dig+Through+Time), pulling further ahead. Lanthier tried [Jace, Vryn's Prodigy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace%2C+Vryn%27s+Prodigy), but it fell immediately to [Crackling Doom](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crackling+Doom). Still Polak-Rottmann was content to wait. A few turns later Lanthier tried [Soulfire Grand Master](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soulfire+Grand+Master). Polak-Rottmann cashed in his [Ojutai's Command](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ojutai%27s+Command). Lanthier had no follow-up.


And so it went as they worked their way through their libraries. Polak-Rottmann tried to stick both Jace and [Soulfire Grand Master](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soulfire+Grand+Master), but neither lasted. Nor did the Jace that Lanthier brought back. Lanthier did manage to successfully resolve a pair of [Dig Through Time](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dig+Through+Time)s, but Polak-Rottmann was sitting on a grip of six cards. Lanthier grabbed for yet another small edge, delving his graveyard down to just [Ojutai's Command](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ojutai%27s+Command) and [Dispel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dispel) to summon [Tasigur, the Golden Fang](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tasigur%2C+the+Golden+Fang). Polak-Rottmann tried to remove it with [Utter End](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Utter+End), but Lanthier had the [Dispel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dispel). He fired a second barrel with [Crackling Doom](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crackling+Doom), and this time Lanthier could not defend. He activated Tasigur, getting back [Ojutai's Command](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ojutai%27s+Command), then put him in the bin and passed the turn.


This was the moment Polak-Rottamann had been waiting for. He tapped six and brought out a pair of hasty [Mantis Rider](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mantis+Rider)s, and Lanthier's ravaged life total couldn't survive a hit from even one of them.


*Polak-Rottmann 1 – Lanthier 0*


Game two started poorly for Polak-Rottman. He stalled on two lands and a [Dragonmaster Outcast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragonmaster+Outcast) while Lanthier resolved [Jace, Vryn's Prodigy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace%2C+Vryn%27s+Prodigy). A third land showed up only a turn late, but by then Lanthier had resolved a [Dig Through Time](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dig+Through+Time) thanks to fetchlands and looting. Still, Polak-Rottmann had a grip of powerful weapons, and a fourth land helped unlock it. When Lanthier went to loot at end of turn, Polak-Rottman dropped [Kolaghan's Command](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kolaghan%27s+Command), killing Jace and forcing a discard. Lanthier tried to return the favor on the Outcast, but the fourth mana meant Polak-Rottmann could [Dispel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dispel).


Lanthier wasn't done yet. The last of his mana and most of his graveyard went into [Dig Through Time](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dig+Through+Time), and then he untapped and played [Painful Truths](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Painful+Truths) for thee cards. A [Duress](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress) revealed Polak-Rotmann's hand of [Mantis Rider](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mantis+Rider), two [Crackling Doom](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crackling+Doom), [Exert Influence](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Exert+Influence) and [Kolaghan's Command](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kolaghan%27s+Command). Lanthier stole the Influence and tapped out to summon Jace.


Polak-Rottmann found a [Mystic Monastery](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mystic+Monastery) waiting for him and as expected fired off his Command to kill Jace and force a discard. That was fine by Lanthier, as he had [Exert Influence](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Exert+Influence) to steal away the [Dragonmaster Outcast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragonmaster+Outcast), a perfect fit with his six lands. Even more perfect was the [Dispel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dispel) in his hand to stop [Crackling Doom](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crackling+Doom), and Polak-Rottmann was unable to fetch a black source to cast the second one in his hand. He played [Mantis Rider](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mantis+Rider) and passed.


Lanthier untapped, got a free dragon, and now the end was in sight. [Duress](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress) took Polak-Rottmann's last card, and not even a topdecked Tasigur could save him.

*Oliver Polak-Rottmann*


*Polak-Rottamnn 1 – Lanthier 1*


For the first four turns there was nothing but fetching and shuffling, then Lanthier broke the silence with a delved [Tasigur, the Golden Fang](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tasigur%2C+the+Golden+Fang), one blue mana left conspicuously open. It resolved and he passed the turn. [Duress](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress) from Polak-Rottmann revealed a hand of [Exert Influence](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Exert+Influence), [Dispel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dispel), [Prairie Stream](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Prairie+Stream), [Painful Truths](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Painful+Truths) and two [Crackling Doom](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crackling+Doom). He took the [Dispel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dispel) to clear a path for his own [Crackling Doom](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crackling+Doom), getting rid of Tasigur.


Lanthier untapped and pressed the offensive with [Mantis Rider](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mantis+Rider). Polak-Rottmann fell to fourteen. On his turn he cast a [Dig Through Time](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dig+Through+Time), leaving himself three untapped mana. It resolved, and he added [Jace, Vryn's Prodigy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace%2C+Vryn%27s+Prodigy) to his board before passing it back. Lanthier took a moment to think things over. He decided to spend three on [Crackling Doom](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crackling+Doom) and hit for three more, then passed. Polak-Rottmann cast [Kolaghan's Command](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kolaghan%27s+Command), dealing two damage to the [Mantis Rider](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mantis+Rider) and forcing a discard. It resolved, and so did the second one, sending the Rider to the graveyard along with [Fiery Impulse](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fiery+Impulse) and [Crackling Doom](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crackling+Doom).


The only bright side to this for Lanthier was that Polak-Rottmann was down to just two cards in hand. [Painful Truths](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Painful+Truths) let Lanthier get way ahead on cards. Polak-Rottmann brought out Jace, and Lanthier removed it with [Utter End](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Utter+End) on his turn. When Polak-Rottmann passed another blank turn, Lanthier got back [Mantis Rider](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mantis+Rider) with Kolaghan's command and started attacking. Unable to answer the aerial beats, Polak-Rottmann was forced to act. He delved out Tasigur and activated it. Lanthier was happy to give him [Kolaghan's Command](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kolaghan%27s+Command) over [Dispel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dispel), and untapped to steal the legend with [Exert Influence](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Exert+Influence). Polak-Rottmann bricked on his draw step and extended the hand in defeat.
