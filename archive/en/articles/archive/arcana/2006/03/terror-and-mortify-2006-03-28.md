Ron Spencer's art for the Alpha [Terror](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Terror) was submitted with the dimensions reversed. Jesper Myrfors, the art director for Alpha, just turned the art sideways. He thought it looked cool and kept it that way: 

![Terror](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Terror)Thirteen years later, Glen Angus submitted this sketch for the Orzhov guild's flexible removal spell, **[Mortify](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mortify)**:

Look familiar? The creative team thought so, too. And they made a similar maneuver in the finished art:

Flip!

To distance [Mortify](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mortify) slightly from that original [Terror](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Terror), since they are so similar in concept (a spell that frightens a creature to death) and now in art, the creative team wanted to emphasize a slight emotional difference in the mood of [Mortify](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mortify). They wanted to crank up the sense of sorrow -- that curl-up-in-the-fetal-position, oh-god-no, I-wish-I-could-unsee-what-I've-just-seen sort of feeling -- rather than the direct-to-the-loony-bin, abject terror in Ron Spencer's [Terror](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Terror). Note how the open-eyed freak-out of the sketch has turned into horrified weeping in the final art. Think of that next time your Orzhov deck Mortifies a critter!
