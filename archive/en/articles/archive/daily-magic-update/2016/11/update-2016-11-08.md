The November 8, 2016 Update
===========================

The Daily *Magic* Update is a roundup of everything *Magic* you should know on November 8, 2016. Today's Update is brought to you by voting. Do it, particularly if you live in the United States today.


Today's Must
============


1. [The *Kaladesh* Draft Guide](http://www.channelfireball.com/home/the-kaladesh-draft-guide/) | ChannelFireball | Ben Stark

Ben Stark might just be the best Limited player in the world, and even if you contest that ranking (after all, Márcio Carvalho was last year's Draft Master), he's certainly one of the most invested. So when he writes an article titled "The *Kaladesh* Draft Guide," you should pay attention.


After That, Read, Watch, or Listen to These
===========================================


1. [The 5 Best New Cards from *Commander 2016* for *Magic: The Gathering*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaHWFFANhJg) | Tolarian Community College | TCC

The Professor picks out the best five cards for *Commander (2016 Edition)*, which releases this Friday (assuming the world doesn't end after the election). Think of it as your reward for partaking in the democratic process.


1. [Knowledge of Gods—Kydele, Chosen of Kruphix](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtyeVHt_S0c&feature=youtu.be&a) | Seibenlore

It's been a while since we've featured a Seibenlore video, which is a minor tragedy. But a good way to get hyped for the impending release of *Commander (2016 Edition)* is to listen to some of the lore behind the new characters. Today is Kydele, but Seiben has highlighted several of the new legends over the past few weeks. Check 'em out before the purge.

1. [Drake Fall and a Mailbag](http://www.gatheringmagic.com/alexullman-11082016-drake-fall-and-a-mailbag/) | Gathering Magic | Alex Ullman

From the department of "articles you could have bet your life on," Ullman covers the Pauper ban.


1. [146: In Chase of Silver with Christian Cespedes](http://www.mtgprotutor.com/christiancespedes/) | MTGPro Tutor | Shaun Penrod

With the World *Magic* Cup coming up, we're going to be hearing more and more about the Christian Cespedeses of the world—Silver-level and lower players from around the world who have the skills and the drive to get there, and are just looking for their shot at breaking through. Here, Penrod interviews Cespedes, who correctly identifies *Time Spiral* as his favorite set. Good on you, Christian. Good on you.


1. [In Praise of Pump Spells](http://www.hipstersofthecoast.com/2016/11/praise-pump-spells/) | Hipsters of the Coast | Zach Barash

Yeah, so this article focuses on a bit of minutiae—white, Limited-focused, one-mana combat tricks—but it highlights a cool evolution in *Magic* Limited, and does so with an eye to the finer things. If you're a Limited player or just like noticing trends in the game's design, this is an interesting article for you.


Streaming Tonight
=================


1. SaffronOlive on [twitch.tv/mtggoldfish](https://www.twitch.tv/mtggoldfish)

Here's something I'm going to try to do more of—highlight streamers when I know they're happening. Now, streamers, almost as a rule, are often tough to nail down. But not always. For example, SaffronOlive is pretty good about sticking to his schedule, as are others like Neal Oliver (usually streaming on [twitch.tv/channelfireball](https://www.twitch.tv/channelfireball)) and Kenji Egashira (on [twitch.tv/numotthenummy](https://www.twitch.tv/numotthenummy))—in fact, I wouldn't be surprised if Kenji were streaming now. When I know someone is streaming at a time later in the day, I'll do what I can to highlight it. So, streamers, let me know if you plan to stream and I'll highlight it here!


Look for SaffronOlive at 5 p.m. ET/2 p.m. PT "to avoid as much politics as possible."


What People Are Talking About
=============================


1. [Magic the Savaging (How Scummy Are These Plays?)](https://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/5bpkf3/magic_the_savaging_how_scummy_are_these_plays/)

Pretty scummy (and in several cases, illegal). Check out the [top comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/5bpkf3/magic_the_savaging_how_scummy_are_these_plays/d9qbafg/) from Paulo Vitor Damo da Rosa for a good take on all of the situations.

Compared to this election year, yeah, sure, why not?


Deck of the Day
===============


1. [White-Black Florida States Control](http://decks.tcgplayer.com/Magic/deck/search?format=Standard&location=2016-tcgplayer-standard-state-champs-fl)

Florida is a pretty important swing state in tonight's election, so why not give them their due in the Daily Update as well? Especially when Vincent Marchica did so much work to resurrect an archetype thought dead with the release of *Kaladesh*.


Marchica won the TCGPlayer Standard State Championship with White-Black Control last weekend, featuring a heaping helping of planeswalkers and removal. In fact, that's really all his deck is, minus [Kalitas, Traitor of Ghet](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kalitas%2C+Traitor+of+Ghet) and [Archangel Avacyn](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Archangel+Avacyn), two of the most objectively powerful creatures in Standard today.


Marchica played a whopping 11 planeswalkers, spread across four different names—Liliana, Gideon, Ob Nixilis, and Sorin—and even supported them with [Oath of Liliana](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oath+of+Liliana).


The wild thing is, his sideboard was basically just *more removal*. And since so much of his cheap removal can interact with [Smuggler's Copter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Smuggler%27s+Copter)—[Blessed Alliance](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blessed+Alliance), [Immolating Glare](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Immolating+Glare), and [Grasp of Darkness](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grasp+of+Darkness)—even his planeswalker-heavy deck is relatively safe from the Copter's reign.
