Get ready to see three days of 40-card mastery and the finest inventions to emerge from the Standard format as [Pro Tour *Kaladesh*](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/ptkld) kicks off on Friday, October 14, and features some of the world's top *Magic* players competing for their share of a prize purse totaling a quarter of a million dollars!


Pro Tour *Kaladesh* will be Standard's big debut since the rotation of *Dragons of Tarkir* and *Magic Origins*. It's the event many professional players have been waiting for to showcase their new approaches to Standard Constructed, and millions of eyes will be peeled to the results of this tournament to see what directions the world's top players go in building decks for the fresh format.


Whether this is your first time diving into the Pro Tour (in which case, hello and welcome!) or you're a veteran of Pro Tour coverage, I'll be going through the basics of this event and will also provide some answers to some of those frequently asked questions we receive with every Pro Tour. Read on!


Pro Tour *Kaladesh* Basics
==========================


Here's all you need to know about Pro Tour *Kaladesh*:


* The Pro Tour is a three-day, invitation-only event featuring top *Magic* pros, top Grand Prix finishers, Hall of Famers, and players who found success in August's Regional Pro Tour Qualifiers. These players will be competing for a share of the $250,000 prize pool, with $50,000 going to the winner along with an invitation to the 2017 *Magic: The Gathering* World Championship. Pro Tour *Kaladesh*, this weekend's big event, takes place October 14–16.
* The formats for Friday and Saturday are three rounds of Booster Draft—using three *Kaladesh* boosters—and five rounds of Standard Constructed. All matches on Friday and Saturday are best two-out-of-three games.
* The following sets are legal in Standard Constructed for this tournament: *Battle for Zendikar*, *Oath of the Gatewatch*, Shadows *over Innistrad*, *Eldritch Moon*, and *Kaladesh*.
* All players with 12 or more match points (a 4-4 record or better) at the end of the first day will advance to Day Two of the competition.
* The Top 8 players at the end of Day Two will advance to Sunday's playoff, featuring a modified single-elimination playoff (more on that in a minute).
* All matches played on Sunday are best three-out-of-five, with the first two games featuring pre-sideboard action.
* The winner gets $50,000, Platinum status in the Pro Players Club (which will give that player invitations with airfare and appearance fees through the 2016–17 and 2017–18 seasons), and an invitation to the 2017 *Magic: The Gathering* World Championship.

So there you have it! Now, about that modified single-elimination playoff.


New Top 8 Bracket
=================


This Pro Tour will be the first one to introduce a modified single-elimination bracket, a transition away from the traditional single-elimination format you see on Sunday.

With the switch to the new bracket, the players seeded in 5th through 8th place at the end of sixteen rounds of Swiss will be put into stage 1 of the quarterfinals and will have four matches ahead of them to claim the trophy. Meanwhile, the 1st- and 2nd-seed players at the end of sixteen rounds of Swiss are automatically placed into the semifinals, guaranteeing them $15,000 in prize money with their finish and a maximum of two matches to win a trophy.


The switch to this modified single-elimination bracket will make for some interesting games to close out Day Two as players aim for the top spots at the end of sixteen rounds.
