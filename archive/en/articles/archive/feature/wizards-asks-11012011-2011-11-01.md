*What's your favorite piece of flavor text in Innistrad?*

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/mtgcom/authorpics/authorpic_kellydigges.jpg)**Kelly Digges:** The flavor of *Innistrad* is rich, managing to hit both brooding and fun, as appropriate. You've got holy soldiers, mad alchemists, demon worshippers, debauched vampires, and some *really* crazy necromancers. Sometimes it's eerie, sometimes it's sad, sometimes it's grimly hilarious.

If "grimly hilarious" were my thing, I'd have to go with [Ludevic's Abomination](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ludevic%27s+Abomination). Its logic is so straightforward, almost inescapable. But there's one piece I like even more: [Gatstaf Shepherd](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gatstaf+Shepherd):

*"What is worse than a wolf in sheep's clothing?"*  
*—Wolfhunter's riddle*

The back face doesn't have flavor text; the art does all the work on that side. But what I love about this piece is that it manages to put a twist on a really tired old saying—that is completely true and more than a bit chilling.
