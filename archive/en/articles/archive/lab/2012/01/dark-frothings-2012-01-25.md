Ascension. A fascinating concept, to ethereally rise into a vortex spun from mind fibers. Intriguing, right? Now imagine that, but with dark. All around. A black mass of nothingness... or is it everythingness? Could ascension truly be at the tip of our fingers? Yet without ignition, we brush past it, only scraping it in dreams, unable to detect it, catching the merest glimpses of it like shades in a mirror.

For now, humanity remains ignorant of the supreme exhilaration, a bleakness reflected by our compatriots of Innistrad. The *Dark Ascension* spoiler has been out for days now, and every time I stray near it, it yanks me inside and onward to a journey where these questions pop up like natural attractions on the side of the path.

![](https://media.wizards.com/images/magic/daily/ftl/ftl179_skaab.jpg)Screeching Skaab | Art by [Clint Cearley](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoileramp;method=visualamp;action=advancedamp;artist=+[%22Clint+Cearley%22])

My favorite **Magic** sets tend to be the ones that appeal to not just my Johnny side (well advertised by now) but my Vorthos side as well. I thought Innistrad (the plane) was incredibly expansive and well-sculpted. The mechanical innovations seemed to me very promising—particularly transform. The various sun-and-moon cards in the set, however, were all creatures (excepting [Garruk Relentless](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Garruk+Relentless), of course). I knew, then, to save my hyper excitement for the real wackiness, of which Garruk was but a precursor.

Right: Receive this exclusive promo version at [Prereleases](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/TCG/Events.aspx?x=mtgcom/events/prerelease-facts) this weekend! (While supplies last)

For me, *Dark Ascension* delivers. This is the set where really dark, twisted stuff happens to Humans (right on the card text!). They're being diced and drained by various Vampires, sacrificed to Ravenous Demons (a neat and bloody good riff on [Lord of the Pit](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lord+of+the+Pit)), attacked by psychotic members of their own race (Skirsdag Flayer, Deranged Outcast), betrayed by their former ringleader (Mikaeus, the Unhallowed... just wait for a certain theme week, folks), and completely consumed in an actual Zombie Apocalypse. This is the set where you can bust out the scariest thing to ever grace a game board (Withengar Unbound. You know this to be true.). THIS is the Gothic Horror set. This is the set to play *Paranoid* to. (Or insert your favorite metal album. That's mine.)

Now that the whole set is opened up, I officially sound the Johnny conch shell. I will probably need lots of help uncovering the secrets of this set. If you think of a wacky way to use a *Dark Ascension* card, let me know in a shapely email. Judging by the email responses to both of my preview cards, I should be in luck for a month or so of material.

![](https://media.wizards.com/images/magic/daily/ftl/ftl179_sudden.jpg)Sudden Dissapearance | Art by [Cliff Childs](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoileramp;method=visualamp;action=advancedamp;artist=+[%22Cliff+Childs%22])

Lots of people emailed me in response to Sudden Disappearance, for example. The most common combo in these inboxes is indeed the one that seems well circulated around **Magic**al forums. Why, some wanted to know, did I not think of using [Sundial of the Infinite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sundial+of+the+Infinite), one of my well-frothed-about previews from last year? If you end your turn prematurely, the exiled cards never come back! Yep, that makes [Leyline of Anticipation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leyline+of+Anticipation) + [Magus of the Disk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Magus+of+the+Disk) seem a bit clumsy. I can only surmise that the combo simply didn't occur to me. Either that or I thought of it but purposely left it out of the article to prompt a flood of emails about the Sundial combo that I missed, and in fact, ensure the existence of this paragraph. I guess you can't know, can you?

In a way, I'm still happy with that [Magus of the Disk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Magus+of+the+Disk) deck, despite the slight lapse of my combo sense. How often does that card pop up into your spellscape? I'd hazard a guess as: Not a lot. And here's the thing: that guess is indeed a guess, flimsy and potentially inaccurate. Maybe [Magus of the Disk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Magus+of+the+Disk) was the frustrating nuclear weapon in an early **Magic** buddy's deck. Maybe you have one in a Commander deck. My point, basically, is that due to the infinity of cards placed under the lens of the finite amount of **Magic**al minds, the obscurity of some cards becomes irrelevant. Gaze through your **Magic**al spyglass. If you only see the words "Limited" and "Constructed" there, you are still plugged into the notion that **Magic** is just another game, defined by winning and losing. You *could* be seeing a streaming kaleidoscope of color and possibility, a windblown natural universe in which patterns can be discerned to spell out a sought-after message.

Really, though, I'd put [Sundial of the Infinite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sundial+of+the+Infinite) in that exclusive group of Johnny cards that are just too stupidly good. Adding them to any deck, even just a lone copy, is an act of supercharging the deck, giving it ridiculous potential fireworks to blast off. A recent example came in the barrage of Havengul Lich emails. Noting my use of [Bloodline Keeper](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodline+Keeper) in that deck, one person wanted to know why I didn't just skip the Lich antics and use [Intruder Alarm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Intruder+Alarm)? Maybe 'cuz [Intruder Alarm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Intruder+Alarm) is totally broken with so many cards ([Imperious Perfect](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Imperious+Perfect) and [Llanowar Elves](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Llanowar+Elves) comes to mind) and is so nuts that it broke through the misty boundaries of normal combination cards and is now part of this exclusive group. Club *Borken*. Other members include [Doubling Season](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Doubling+Season) ("What's that?" says someone out there, perhaps new to **Magic** but with an early deckbuilding kick, caressing his or her black-green Zombie token deck with [Parallel Lives](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Parallel+Lives) as its centerpiece. "Only a card that's about to wreck your mind," I reply.), [Rite of Replication](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rite+of+Replication) (five copies of any creature is nearly always amazing—I've seen it cast on creatures up and down the power scale, from [Sea Gate Oracle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sea+Gate+Oracle) to [Rune-Scarred Demon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rune-Scarred+Demon)), and [Knowledge Pool](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Knowledge+Pool) (for six colorless mana COMPLETELY DISTORT THE GAME).

I think I mentioned a certain "barrage of Havengul Lich emails." Yep, they were clogging up my inbox a couple weeks ago. Leo Schwarz hit me up with a tasty turn sequence in Standard that could lead to a quick game. As he put it: "Turn 1: Faithless Looting, pitching the Lich and [Devil's Play](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Devil%27s+Play). Turn 2: [Heartless Summoning](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Heartless+Summoning). Turn 3: ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227195556im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/black.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227195556im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/black.gif) for [Necrotic Ooze](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Necrotic+Ooze). ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227130159im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/red.gif) for [Priest of Urabrask](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Priest+of+Urabrask). It dies, you have ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227130159im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/red.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227130159im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/red.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227130159im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/red.gif) in pool. Ooze can activate Lich's ability, you pay ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20211201201921im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless1.gif) to recast, you pay ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227130159im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/red.gif) to cast, giving you ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227130159im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/red.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227130159im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/red.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227130159im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/red.gif) again, and the loop only takes ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20211201201921im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless1.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227130159im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/red.gif). Flashback [Devil's Play](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Devil%27s+Play) for the win." I love the use of Faithless Looting, one of many commons in the new set that I just adore. (Nothing tops Sanctuary Cat, though.)

This scouring of the Lich emails leads to me to today's first deck. Reader Isc laid down a neat riff on further implications of returning a [Grimgrin, Corpse-Born](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grimgrin%2C+Corpse-Born) with the Lich.
