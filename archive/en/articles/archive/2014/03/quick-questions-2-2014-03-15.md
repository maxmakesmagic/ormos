**What Common is the Lynchpin of your Deck?** 



![](https://web.archive.org/web/20151122002740im_/http://archive.wizards.com/mtg/images/daily/events/gpmon14/Duke.jpg)***(2) Reid Duke** : [Wingsteed Rider](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wingsteed+Rider). It's one of the fastest ways to win a game in this format.* 

![](https://web.archive.org/web/20151122003320im_/http://archive.wizards.com/mtg/images/daily/events/gpmon14/Costa.jpg)***Matt Costa**: [Gods Willing](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gods+Willing). A powerful heroic enabler and a cheap answer to removal, as well as giving my big green creatures a way to push through late.* 



![](https://media.wizards.com/legacy/mtg/images/daily/events/gpmon14/qq_hayne.jpg)***(11) Alexander Hayne** : [Bronze Sable](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bronze+Sable). I'm playing two of them because I need to hold the fort early. Twice I've traded it off for Agent of Horizons.* 

![](https://web.archive.org/web/20151122000150im_/http://archive.wizards.com/mtg/images/daily/events/gpmon14/Vidugiris.jpg)***(23) Gaudenis Vidugiris** : Probably just [Wingsteed Rider](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wingsteed+Rider). It's the best common, and it's in my deck, so it's the best common in my deck.* 



![](https://media.wizards.com/legacy/mtg/images/daily/events/gpmon14/utterleyton.jpg)***(8) Josh Utter-Leyton**: [Sudden Storm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sudden+Storm). Though I'd happily trade it for a Griptide or Voyage's End. It gives me a way to deal with big creatures.* 

![](https://media.wizards.com/legacy/mtg/images/daily/events/gpmon14/cueno.jpg)***Andrew Cuneo**: Probably just [Wingsteed Rider](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wingsteed+Rider). I bet a lot of people have said that.*
