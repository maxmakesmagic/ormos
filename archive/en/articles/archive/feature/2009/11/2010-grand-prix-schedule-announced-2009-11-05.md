![Grand Prix](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/grandprix/images/NEW_GP.jpg)Whether you're a Friday Night **Magic** regular or a big name on the Pro Tour, Grand Prix provide an opportunity to join the **Magic** community, earn big prizes, take home a cool foil card, and be a part of the biggest **Magic** festival in your area!


The 2010 Grand Prix season features 18 stops across 12 different countries, highlighted by stops in Madrid, Kuala Lumpur, Sydney, Toronto, and Florence. Along with playing **Magic** next to hundreds of other players in your region, Grand Prix offer Pro Tour invitations to the top 16 finishers and a $30,000 prize purse. This season's schedule features Grand Prix located in the same region as each Pro Tour a week prior to the big event to make it easier for traveling players to combine both tournaments into one trip. 


The first six Grand Prix of the year provide invitations to Pro Tour–San Juan (May 28-30). Kicking off the 2010 season is Grand Prix–Oakland, taking place one week before Pro Tour–San Diego to make for an easy GP-PT combination trip. Madrid, Kuala Lumpur, Yokohama, Brussels, and Houston round out the rest of the San Juan set of Grand Prix from February to April, featuring Extended, Legacy, and Standard formats.


The middle set of Grand Prix feeds Pro Tour–Amsterdam (September 3-5) and runs from May to early August. Lyon, Washington D.C., Sendai, Manila, and Columbus host Grand Prix in this stretch, with the event in Washington D.C. the week before Pro Tour–San Juan for easier travel coordination. Formats in this set include "Prosper" Sealed Deck/Booster Draft, Standard, and Legacy.


The final set of Grand Prix in 2010 runs from late August to November and feeds the first Pro Tour of 2011 (date and site to be determined). All seven of these Grand Prix are Limited, split between **Magic 2011** and "Lights". For travelers en route to Pro Tour–Amsterdam, stop over in Gothenburg, Sweden the week before to make it a two-week **Magic** adventure. Portland, Sydney, Toronto, Bochum, Nashville, and Florence round out the season.

From Pro Tour Qualifiers and other major public events down to 8-man pick-up drafts, it's wall-to-wall **Magic** when a Grand Prix comes to your town. You can also meet prominent **Magic**  artists at each Grand Prix and have them sign your cards for an unforgettable memento of your tournament experience. Plus, every participant in each Grand Prix receives a special foil promotional [Umezawa's Jitte](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Umezawa%27s+Jitte+)  (while supplies last).
