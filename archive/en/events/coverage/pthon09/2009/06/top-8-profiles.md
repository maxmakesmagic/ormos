**Age:** 28


**Hometown:** San Diego


**Occupation:** Game Designer


**Number of times playing on the Pro Tour:** Lots


**How did you qualify for Pro Tour-Honolulu:** PTQ!

**Other previous Magic accomplishments:** Once upon a time I Cloaked a Rith.


**What was your record by format?**  
**Block Constructed:**8-1-1  
**Booster Draft:** 4-2


**How did you prepare for Pro Tour Honolulu?**  

I tested mostly with Ben Rubin. Lots of other testing with other Baller Beach House members, including Williams, Reitzl, Parke, Wiegersma, Herberholz, Boeken, and Burdick.


**What deck are you playing and why?**  

Esper beatdown- "Esper Stoneblade." I got the list from Neil Reeves two days before the event and wanted to play something besides Jund.


**How did dealing with [Bloodbraid Elf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodbraid+Elf) affect your Block Constructed preparation?**  

Bloodbraid totally warps the format. I had maindeck Ethersworn Canonists and Vedalken Outlanders and lots of evasion creatures.

Try to draft aggressive Esper blue-white, but mostly play an aggressive deck with good mana. Two colors with a light splash.

I’m playing five colour control because with control you can control the game.
