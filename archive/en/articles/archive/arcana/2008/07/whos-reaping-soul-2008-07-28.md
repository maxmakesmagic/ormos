The *Eventide* card [Soul Reap](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soul+Reap) shows a Kithkin being sucked away to a gruesome death. But what exactly is he being sucked into? The art description has the answer:


> Color: Black spell  
> Location: Unimportant  
> Action: Show the "Grief Tyrant" from Art ID# 111611, or atleast enough of him for us to see that hes somehow absorbing a victim to be a new 'face' in his gross belly. maybe we just see his hands pulling the struggling victims head and shoulders into the stomach (which has traces of other faces) which is starting to envelope the victime like pressing a lego man into jello.  
> Focus: The Grief Tyrant and his victim's absorbtion.  
> Mood: I feed on your soul.

Here's what artist Izzy came up with:
