**Changing Decks between matches.**  

The new Penalty Guide included a short notation under Failure to Desideboard.


Prerelease tournaments may specifically allow for a player to change their deck configuration between matches. Note this exception is only available to official Prerelease events and is at the discretion of the Tournament Organizer. Check with officials at Prereleases if they are using this option.


The DCI has now made official option that organizers once had to personally request of their territory manager.


Two significant items the players need to understand however.


1. Players can only modify in this manner at this event, and not any other sanctioned event, including possibly other or future prereleases;
2. The cards that players acquire during the day (prerelease foil, prizes, booster rounds or via trade) may never be added to your card pool.

If you use this option its vital that your players understand these two items. Any player who later shows up for a PTQ and is changing their deck every round, and defends himself with "but I was allowed to change it at the last tournament" The DCI is going investigate the organizer and head official of that pre-release for possible sanction if random samples of other players reveal these two items were not well communicated.


Officials will need to determine if they will require full deck registration, only card pool registration (recommended), or no form of deck verification.


A useful new penalty; 114 - Improper Registration of Limited Card Pool


**Awarding Penalties**


The new Penalty Guide states about upgrading...


The recommended penalty for the first offense is listed in the "Penalty" portion of each infraction. At Competitive and Professional RELs, unless suggested otherwise in the penalty procedure, the next highest penalty should be awarded for the second offense of the same infraction during the tournament. Penalties at Regular events may be upgraded at the Head Judge's discretion. Penalties continue to be upgraded with further offenses and are upgraded in the following order:


...and the following about downgrading...


Judges should be seen as a benefit to the players, helping to ensure the consistent and fair running of a tournament. Players should be encouraged to use judges as needed, and should not be afraid to call a judge if they feel one is required. If a player commits an infraction, realizes it and calls a judge over immediately before they could potentially benefit from the infraction, the Head Judge has the option to downgrade the penalty without it being considered a deviation, though they should still follow any procedure recommended to fix the error. For example, a player offers his deck to his opponent and while cutting his opponent's deck discovers that a card that should be in his deck is in a previously removed from game pile. If he calls the judge over immediately, the Head Judge may choose to issue a Warning rather than a Game Loss.


**Education:**  

If you have a player needing a DCI number it's very likely they do not know tournament policy. Take some effort to explain things to these persons through a small collective briefing, flyers, or by printing Brian David-Marshall's Prerelease Primer (the *Planar Chaos* one is [here](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/feature/planar-chaos-prerelease-primer-2007-01-15))


Please attempt to educate players *before* they commit common infractions, especially common *disqualification* ones. Once they commit the infraction do not deviate from the guideline penalties in the interest of education. The penalty is part of the education they then receive.


You could announce the following and/or have it quoted on registration materials to assist players from committing common violations.


*Please be aware that even though this is a fun and casual event, there are things that judges and players take very seriously. Please remember that you have the following responsibilities: To play fairly and honestly. To never offer or accept anything in exchange for a match result. That if your match ends because of time, and the result is a draw â€“ you must report it as a draw and not flip a coin to see who won. To shuffle your deck very well at the start of each round. To make sure that you only play with the cards that were provided in the sealed deck. If all of you can do that, this will be a fun day for everyone. If you aren't sure how something works or if you're playing something correctly, PLEASE call a judge.*


And some interesting signage we encourage officials to post will help keep players from receiving some common and preventable penalties too.
