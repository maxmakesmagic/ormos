Boggarts are naturally drawn to new sensations, which causes them to be sort of accidental kleptomaniacs. They don't *mean* to steal the delicious pie cooling on the kithkin windowsill—they just couldn't help themselves.


But there's one important rule among the boggarts: you have to share any new sensation you find with the rest of your warren.


The art of the card [Hoarder's Greed](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hoarder%27s+Greed) shows a boggart finding a coveted trinket in the woods of Lorwyn. He's definitely not sharing—he's letting his greed take precedence over the rules of his warren's Auntie.

But that's not the end of the story for our little friend. If we look on another card in *Lorwyn*, we can see the same greedy boggart suffering the punishment for not sharing the trinket—a sentence of exile.
