### Game 2

Meyer chose to play first, both players kept their hands. His green/red deck managed a turn 2 [Wellwisher](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wellwisher), but no face down card on turn 3, which Jedlicka's red/blue deck didn't miss. Jed's secret agent turned out to be [Skirk Commando](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skirk+Commando), who killed Meyer's freshly cast [Wirewood Channeler](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wirewood+Channeler) once he went through. Meyer's [Wall of Mulch](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wall+of+Mulch) held the ground for some time, while Jedlicka went to the air with [Airdrop Condor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Airdrop+Condor) and [Sage Aven](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sage+Aven).

[Hundroog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hundroog) hit the table turn 7, but lost his use as a blocker, as Jedlicka played [Frenetic Raptor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Frenetic+Raptor) next turn. Meyer's plan was to race and he cast a hasted [Macetail Hystrodon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Macetail+Hystrodon), which promptly went to the red zone with his beast brother, putting Jedlicka at 12. [Essence Fracture](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Essence+Fracture) managed some tempo advantage for Jedlicka, who swung with his army, trading a [Skirk Commando](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skirk+Commando) for a [Wellwisher](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wellwisher) while [Wall of Mulch](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wall+of+Mulch) blocked the 6/6 beast.

[Hundroog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hundroog) came back to the board, still unable to block and Meyer took 9. A morph was played in the second main phase, which turned out to be echo tracer, ready to bounce [Hundroog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hundroog) and block the recast [Macetail Hystrodon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Macetail+Hystrodon). A second [Wall of Mulch](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wall+of+Mulch) was Meyer's last defense line, but [Echo Tracer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Echo+Tracer)'s twin was waiting in Jedlicka's hand to bounce the wall and let the Red/Blue rush come to an end.

**Final Result:** Stefan Jedlicka won 2-0
