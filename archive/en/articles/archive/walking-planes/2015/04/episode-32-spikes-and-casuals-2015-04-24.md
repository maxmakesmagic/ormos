Are you a Spike or a casual player? Or both? What do you enjoy more: The handshake after winning a sanctioned match? Or casting a spell you've always wanted to cast for the first time? At Pro Tour *Dragons of Tarkir*, Walking the Planes learns that the competitive mindset and a care-free, fun-loving attitude are not mutually exclusive. Most players enjoy a variety of ways to experience *Magic*. Some spells are fun to cast no matter what setting you're playing in. Like Dragons, for instance. I mean, who doesn't love dragons?
