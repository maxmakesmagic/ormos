Would you rather be the one to ask the questions, or the one struggling to come up with the answers? For Josh Utter-Leyton, the only good questions are the ones left on the table.


It took less than twenty minutes for Josh Utter-Leyton and his Boros Blitz deck to mow over a frustrated Reid Duke, moving to 11-3 and keeping his Top 8 hopes alive in the process.


"Good game."


Despite mulliganing into oblivion and getting absolutely drubbed in the first game of the match by Utter-Leyton, Duke was still nice enough to offer the traditional game ending to his opponent. Even Utter-Leyton sympathized with the way things broke for Duke.


"If you want to call it that," Utter-Leyton responded with a grimace.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/ptdgm13/r14_duke_leyton.jpg)  
*Reid Duke's Bant Control has a lot of powerful cards, but Josh Utter-Leyton's Boros Blitz deck blasted through Bant in this match.* 
The first "game" lasted under five minutes, and at least three minutes of that was spent resolving Duke's mulligans. Ultimately, he kept a hand with [Temple Garden](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Temple+Garden), [Selesnya Keyrune](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Selesnya+Keyrune), [Supreme Verdict](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Supreme+Verdict), [Sphinx's Revelation](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sphinx%27s+Revelation), and a random fifth card.


"I figured that keeping a hand that could cast [Supreme Verdict](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Supreme+Verdict) if I could draw a couple lands was much better than mulliganing again into a hand that couldn't," he explained to Utter-Leyton after the match.


Utter-Leyton completely agreed with the decision. Still, though the game was clearly a miserable experience for Duke, games similar to this are what Utter-Leyton's deck thrives on. Boros Blitz and the other ultra-aggressive decks in the format exist to capitalize on stumbles that opponents make, be it failing to draw a [Supreme Verdict](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Supreme+Verdict) early enough, missing a land drop or two, or mulliganing to five, as in this case.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/ptdgm13/r14_leyton.jpg)  
*Utter-Leyton's deck is fast enough to punish any opponent who stumbles with their draw.* 
His deck performed that task a second time in the second game of the match. This time, things went a little better for Duke. His opening seven cards gave him a bevy of great cards in the matchup, including [Loxodon Smiter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Loxodon+Smiter) and a duo of [Centaur Healer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Centaur+Healer)s. He even managed a fifth-turn [Supreme Verdict](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Supreme+Verdict) to clear the board while at a reasonably safe life total. Unfortunately, his deck began to provide land after land soon thereafter, while Utter-Leyton was fed threat after threat. Soon, the flood became too much for Duke, and he succumbed to a lone [Firefist Striker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Firefist+Striker).


"We spent the game trading one for one, and he ended up flooding while I drew three lands and all spells," Utter-Leyton said, attributing his win to an overabundance of lands on the behalf of Duke.


Duke certainly agreed, but he pointed to one key moment that prevented him from taking a big lead over Utter-Leyton.


"The key turn in that game was when he managed to kill my Jace before I could get any card advantage off of it," he said.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/ptdgm13/r14_duke.jpg)  
*Duke tried to stay in the game, but his draws were unable to provide him the defense needed to stave off his opponent's attacks.* 
[r14\_duke.jpg cap="Duke tried to stay in the game, but his draws were unable to provide him the defense needed to stave off his opponent's attacks."]


The turn in question occurred just after a [Supreme Verdict](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Supreme+Verdict) had cleared the board. Utter-Leyton was low on cards and had nothing on the board. He drew and played a [Legion's Initiative](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Legion%27s+Initiative) and a [Legion Loyalist](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Legion+Loyalist), attacking for 2. Duke untapped and put a [Jace, Architect of Thought](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace%2C+Architect+of+Thought), into play, immediately gaining loyalty to both kep him safe and blunt Utter-Leyton's attack. Unfortunately for Duke, he was never able to get another activation, as Utter-Leyton used a [Boros Charm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Boros+Charm) and another attack to take care of Jace before things got out of hand.


This was incredibly important to Utter-Leyton's victory, as Duke soon revealed a pair of [Detention Sphere](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Detention+Sphere)s in his hand, one of which removed a pair of Loyalists from play no less than a turn later. Had he been able to make that play with a Jace still in play, it is unlikely that Utter-Leyton would have been able to close things out.


Sitting at 11-3, Utter-Leyton is still eyeing a Top 8 berth, while Duke's fourth loss will very likely relegate him to a Top 16 finish at best.


Match Notes:


The finish of this tournament is very important for the outcomes of a couple of important milestones.


First, a Top 16 finish has a good chance to put Reid Duke into one of the at-large slots at the World Championships later this year.


In addition, a Top 24 finish will secure Platinum Pro Club status for Duke next year.


Duke called a judge over to check the wording on [Legion's Initiative](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Legion%27s+Initiative). After conferring with the judge, Duke chose to sideboard in a [Cyclonic Rift](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cyclonic+Rift) to combat the enchantment.


"Since it returns the creatures at the beginning of the next combat, not just your next combat, I figured I could cast it at the end of his turn. If he sacrificed it in response, his creatures would come back during my attack, and I could clear the board with [Supreme Verdict](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Supreme+Verdict)," Duke explained. "In retrospect, I don't know how good an idea that was. I almost wish I'd kept in another expensive spell like [Syncopate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Syncopate) instead. But I'm not sure."
