As the Swiss Rounds draw close, the Top 8 is starting to shape up. At the time of print, it has been determined that the Top 2 Tables are most likely locked for the Top 8, but the next few tables need to play out their win-and-in match.


Here's a quick recap on four of the most important matches of the final round of Grand Prix São Paulo.


Table 3: Claudio Barrientos (Abzan Aggro) VS. Luiz Ferreira da Silva (Atarka Red)
=================================================================================


![](https://media.wizards.com/2015/events/gpsao15/T3.jpg)  
*Claudio Barrientos (Abzan Aggro) vs. Luiz Ferreira da Silva (Atarka Red)*


Da Silva struck the opposing [Warden of the First Tree](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Warden+of+the+First+Tree) with lightning and generated three tokens with [Hordeling Outburst](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hordeling+Outburst). That was not quite fast enough and Barrientos was able to take game one easily with the help of double [Siege Rhino](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Siege+Rhino) and [Wingmate Roc](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wingmate+Roc). I heard those cards are pretty good against little red men.

Game two did not go well for Da Silva either, since Barrientos was able to quickly assemble [Fleecemane Lion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fleecemane+Lion) and [Anafenza, the Foremost](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Anafenza%2C+the+Foremost). A timely [Dromoka's Command](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dromoka%27s+Command) followed by [Whip of Erebos](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Whip+of+Erebos) secured Barrientos' spot in the Top 8.


**Claudio Barrientos 2 - Luiz Ferreira da Silva 0**


Table 4: Maximiliano Ramiro Sanchez Pinilla (RG Dragons) VS. Fabio Barroso (Abzan Control)
==========================================================================================


![](https://media.wizards.com/2015/events/gpsao15/T4.jpg)  
*Maximiliano Ramiro Sanchez Pinilla (RG Aggro) vs. Fabio Barroso (Abzan Control)*


Despite Pinilla putting up a speedy beatdown of [Boon Satyr](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Boon+Satyr) and Surrak, the Hunt Caller, Barroso was able to stabilize the board with the help of a pair of [Hero's Downfall](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hero%27s+Downfall), [Tasigur, the Golden Fang](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tasigur%2C+the+Golden+Fang) and [Ugin, the Spirit Dragon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ugin%2C+the+Spirit+Dragon).


However, it was Pinilla who had the last laugh as he climbed back from that loss to win the match.

He accelerated into a pair of [Thunderbreak Regent](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thunderbreak+Regent) with the aid of [Rattleclaw Mystic](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rattleclaw+Mystic) and Barroso was unable to find any elegant solution to both dragons without dying to their triggers. In the rubber game, Barroso gummed up the ground with [Siege Rhino](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Siege+Rhino) and Tasigur, the Golden Fang, but did [Hero's Downfall](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hero%27s+Downfall) to deal with Pinilla's [Stormbreath Dragon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stormbreath+Dragon)


**Maximiliano Ramiro Sanchez Pinilla 2 - Fabio Barroso 1**


Table 5: Pablo Ioppolo (WG Aggro) VS. Mateus Batista de Melo (Esper Dragons)
============================================================================


![](https://media.wizards.com/2015/events/gpsao15/T5.jpg)  
*Pablo Ioppolo (WG Aggro) vs. Mateus Batista de Melo (Esper Dragons)*


De Melo quickly nabbed the first game with the help of an early [Dragonlord Ojutai](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragonlord+Ojutai) while Ioppolo was stuck on two land and could only manage [Warden of the First Tree](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Warden+of+the+First+Tree) and [Fleecemane Lion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fleecemane+Lion).


In Game Two, Ioppolo retaliated with [Den Protector](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Den+Protector), [Hidden Dragonslayer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hidden+Dragonslayer), [Brimaz, King of Oreskos](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brimaz%2C+King+of+Oreskos) and [Fleecemane Lion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fleecemane+Lion). However, those threats were dealt with respectively by double [Bile Blight](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bile+Blight), [Ultimate Price](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ultimate+Price) and [Foul-Tongue Invocation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Foul-Tongue+Invocation). The Esper Control deck is well-known for having that much removal.

[Ashiok, Nightmare Weaver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ashiok%2C+Nightmare+Weaver) and [Silumgar, the Drifting Death](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Silumgar%2C+the+Drifting+Death) eventually convinced Ioppolo to extend the hand as he wished de Melo good luck in the Top 8.  
  
**Pablo Ioppolo 1 - Mateus Batista de Melo 2**


Table 6: Ricardo Nunes Martins (Esper Dragons) VS. Douglas Romani (Esper Dragons)
=================================================================================

*Ricardo Nunes Martins (Esper Dragons) vs. Douglas Romani (Esper Dragons)*


After taking the first game, Martins was the one with the trump for the sideboarded game.


Romani thought he was doing fine with his sideboard tech of [Risen Executioner](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Risen+Executioner), but unfortunately that was no match for Martins' [Monastery Mentor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Monastery+Mentor). A lonely 4/3 zombie was no match for a horde of monk tokens!

**Ricardo Nunes Martins 2 - Douglas Romani 0**
