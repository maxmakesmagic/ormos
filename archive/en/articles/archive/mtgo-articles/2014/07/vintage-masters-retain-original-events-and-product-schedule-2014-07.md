*Vintage Masters* to Retain Original Events and Product Schedule on *Magic Online*
With the exception of the two events listed below, the *Magic Online* team has decided to remain on the previously messaged *Vintage Masters* events and product schedule. We apologize for the confusion, and are happy to announce that the majority of *Vintage Masters* events will remain on *Magic Online* until the release of *Khans of Tarkir* in the fall. Vintage events will continue indefinitely. Currently, there will be no change to entry fee or prizes. Again, we apologize for the miscommunication.


We will continuously review and analyze event performance, and plan to address prize payouts for Vintage and Legacy events after Friday, October 3.
