*By Liam Coltman*


Despite Australia having a sparse population, it is only a 3 hour drive from Canberra, the home town of Anatoli, to Sydney where the GP was being held. After traveling up with his friend Tristan, who was also playing in the GP and Tristan's parents, he finished with a 10-2-1 record, ID'ing in the last round to get him into the Top 8.



Having won a GP Trial in Canberra, Anatoli started the day with 3 byes which although he was happy to have, he believed they skewed the GP matches and was not totally convinced if they should actually be a part of the GP systems. Anatoli won the Trial in Canberra with a Sligh deck, which he thought was amazing for the environment down there, as it is mostly comprised of weenie and rogue decks. But in the more diverse field of the GP, he chose to run a Trix deck, which he confessed he had not actually played before the 4th round.



"I just kinda picked it up and went with it" Anatoli stated, "that's why I went 2-2, I had to learn exactly how to play the deck." He had extensively tested the format though and believed that Trix was the best deck, despite all the hate that people were packing in their sideboards. Despite this baptism by fire, Anatoli was happy with his performance overall, but was unsure how he would fare in the finals as he was unsure about the match up he was playing.



Of late, Anatoli had been playing quite a lot of tournament Magic, winning the Territorial event in Canberra, and drafting several Friday nights at the local store, "Logical Choice." "The Magic scene in Canberra is really great," said Anatoli, "we really don't deserve the title of the "town of scrubs."



Although interested in the Invitational, Anatoli couldn't really take any time out to see what was happening downstairs, with most of his energy focused on day 1 and 2 of the GP.



I wished Anatoli good luck with his quarterfinal and gave him 5 more minutes to gather his thoughts before the big game.
