It's fall, and just like the changing season, Standard has gone through its yearly rotation. This creates new dynamics as older sets move out of the format and new strategies and deck builds vie for dominance.


This is also a perfect time to host the Arena Open in Standard! The two-day event, running October 16–17, features fierce competition as players jockey to prove who is the best—and who will claim the top prize of $2,000!


So, start polishing up those new Standard decks, because this is your chance to prove your mastery of the latest sets and level up into the big leagues.


But before we get into the details:


* You must be 18 years or older to participate.
* Regional eligibility restrictions apply, void where prohibited.
* Receiving monetary rewards requires having or creating Wizards, DCI, and i-Payout accounts. *(**i-Payout accounts cannot be created in advance.)*
* Refer to [the official Terms and Conditions](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/arena-open-terms-and-conditions) for complete details.
