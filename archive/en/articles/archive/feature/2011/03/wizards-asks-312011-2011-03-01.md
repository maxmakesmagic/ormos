*What's your favorite piece of Equipment, and why?*

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/mtgcom/authorpics/authorpic_kellydigges.jpg)**Kelly Digges:** That's a tough call, but thumbing through my enormous pile of Commander decks suggests that I've got a few clear favorites. [Lightning Greaves](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Greaves) is widely considered a near-mandatory one-of in Commander, and every copy of that card I own is indeed in a deck somewhere. Same with [Sword of Fire and Ice](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sword+of+Fire+and+Ice), [Sword of Light and Shadow](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sword+of+Light+and+Shadow), [Sword of Body and Mind](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sword+of+Body+and+Mind), and [Sword of Feast and Famine](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sword+of+Feast+and+Famine), as well as some less tournament-worthy favorites such as [Behemoth Sledge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Behemoth+Sledge) and [Argentum Armor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Argentum+Armor). 

Meanwhile I've had tons of fun in their respective Limited environments wrecking people with [Infiltration Lens](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Infiltration+Lens) (and never mind the time I accidentally decked myself....), [Sword of Vengeance](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sword+of+Vengeance) (especially on [Greater Basilisk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Greater+Basilisk)!), and [Explorer's Scope](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Explorer%27s+Scope). My deck in our current Sealed Deck league at work does absurd things with two [Bonehoard](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bonehoard)s. Heck, I even managed to draft a [Deathrender](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deathrender) deck once....

But all else being equal, there's one Equipment that wins my affection more than any other: [Basilisk Collar](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Basilisk+Collar).

![Basilisk Collar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Basilisk+Collar)  
It's cheap. It's easy. It turns creatures big and small into must-deal-with issues for a whole table, and it even helped turn a card I designed—[Cunning Sparkmage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cunning+Sparkmage)—into an unlikely Pro Tour hero.

And someday, I swear it, I'll successfully stick one on [Brigid, Hero of Kinsbaile](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brigid%2C+Hero+of+Kinsbaile) and blow up (or at least lock down) a whole table of creatures. Someday!
