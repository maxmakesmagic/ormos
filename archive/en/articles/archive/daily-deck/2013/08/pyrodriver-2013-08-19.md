Today, we've got another token Travis Woo deck, which utilizes the dual engines of [Young Pyromancer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Young+Pyromancer) and [Ogre Battledriver](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ogre+Battledriver). Travis wrote about the deck [here](http://www.channelfireball.com/articles/woo-brews-pyrodriver/), and I was drawn to the near-infinite amount of damage the deck can deliver (doing 50 damage is basically infinite, right?). 

 Travis's deck can be divided into a few distinct groups. The first group is the token makers, which provide the actual mechanism for killing the opponent. He's chosen to go with [Young Pyromancer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Young+Pyromancer), which combines with almost every other token maker, [Lingering Souls](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lingering+Souls), [Gather the Townsfolk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gather+the+Townsfolk), and [Krenko's Command](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Krenko%27s+Command). With all of these cards making at least two tokens, and most of them many more than that, running out of gas is going to be difficult. 

 The next group of cards are the enhancers, the cards that turn the army of 1/1s into an unstoppable force. The least flashy of these is [Intangible Virtue](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Intangible+Virtue), which has the benefit of being incredibly hard to kill. At four mana, both [Hellrider](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hellrider) and [Ogre Battledriver](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ogre+Battledriver) provide massive amounts of damage, especially in concert, although that's usually overkill. Any one of the token makers deals 4â€“6 damage when paired up with one of the four-drops, and it isn't difficult to assemble many more than two tokens at once. Lastly, [Burn at the Stake](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Burn+at+the+Stake) skips the combat step altogether, delivering upwards of 15 damage in one fell swoop. 

 Besides all the engine cards, [Faithless Looting](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Faithless+Looting) and [Pillar of Flame](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pillar+of+Flame) round out the deck, and are a concession to bad draws (Looting) and the opponent potentially playing threats (Pillar). 

I like the idea of dealing a million damage (again, 50) in a single turn, and combining a bunch of solid cards into a machine like this appeals to me.
