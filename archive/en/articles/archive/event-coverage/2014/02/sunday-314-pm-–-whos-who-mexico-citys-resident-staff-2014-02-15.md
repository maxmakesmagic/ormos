 Mike Rosenberg is a writer and gamer and has been part of the Magic text coverage team since 2011. He joined Wizards as organized play’s content specialist in June 2014. 






It's easy to look past the faces of those who make these events what they are. The staff that helps make a Grand Prix possible, or the judges that help enforce fair and balanced play during each round. However, holding an event on this scale just wouldn't be possible without an experienced event staff, including judges.


This event features three judges (and one Tournament Organizer) that reside in Mexico City, with the Grand Prix taking place on their home turf.


More to the point, each one of these staff members has been involved with *Magic* for a long time. They love the game, which in part is why they have ended up on the staff. After all, making *Magic* happen at home takes precedence over simply playing in your local Grand Prix.


I sat down to talk to each of these four people to learn a little bit more about their *Magic* backgrounds. In addition to that, as residents of Mexico City, they also offered up some recommendations for places that visitors should check out.

**Role this weekend:**  

Level 2 Judge, and judge manager for this event


**How long have you been playing *Magic*? What was your biggest accomplishment?**  

I've been playing *Magic* for 14 years. My biggest accomplishment was being team captain for Mexico in last year's World *Magic* Cup. I also finished in the Top 64 at Pro Tour Nagoya 2011.


**How long have you been judging/TOing?**  

I've been judging for 3 years.


**How long have you been living in Mexico City?**  

All my life.


**What is the one thing that you absolutely insist that visiting *Magic* players/judges/friends must see when they come to Mexico City?**  

Probably the downtown area and Coyocan.

### Alvaro Ibañez



 

**Role this weekend:**  

Level 2 Judge


**How long have you been playing *Magic*? What was your biggest accomplishment?**  

Since Mirage block. I've Top 8'd three PTQs, as well as a 160 person Grand Prix trial.


**How long have you been judging?**  

I've been judging since Fifth Dawn.


**How long have you been living in Mexico City?**  

I was born here, but I lived three years in Germany for work.


**What is the one thing that you absolutely insist that visiting *Magic* players/judges/friends must see when they come to Mexico City?**  

Xochimilco, but Coyocan is also high on my list. If they like museums, then the National Museum of Anthrology is an excellent choice.

### Hector Fuentes



 

**Role this weekend:**  

Level 3 Judge


**How long have you been playing *Magic*? What was your biggest accomplishment?**  

I started playing in 1998. I was Mexico's National Champion in 2000.


**How long have you been judging?**  

I started judging in 2001, and started doing international judging in 2004 with the World Championship in San Francisco.


**How long have you been living in Mexico City?**  

I've been living in Mexico City all my life. I come from the south part of the city known as Coyocan.


**What is the one thing that you absolutely insist that visiting *Magic* players/judges/friends must see when they come to Mexico City?**  

They should really go to Coyocan. It's a nice area to have food and drink, and it's a great place to visit for those who want to learn more about the art and life of Frida Kahlo.

### Saul Arreola



 

**Role this weekend:**  

Tournament Organizer


**How long have you been playing *Magic*? What was your biggest accomplishment?**  

It was around Revised and Fourth Edition that I began playing. I was part of the Mexican National Team in 1999, where we almost made Top 4, missing out in the final round before the cut and finishing in 9th overall. As a player I also attended a couple more Pro Tours around that time.


**How long have you been involved as part of the event staff?**  

I started judging in 1999, and I eventually became a level 3 judge. I have head judged a few National Championships in Mexico, and I started organizing events when Prophecy was released. I've been organizing tournaments for over 12 years now, and I still find time to play. I'll even be going to Pro Tour Born of the Gods to compete next weekend.


**How long have you been living in Mexico City?**  

I was born here, then moved to Costa Rica and then Encinada, and I also lived once in Central America. I moved back here for college and have been living here ever since.


**What is the one thing that you absolutely insist that visiting *Magic* players/judges/friends must see when they come to Mexico City?**  

I'd recommend Chapultapec Castle, the National Museum of Anthropology, the Teotihuacan pyramids, Xochimilco, and Coyocan.
