[Stone Rain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stone+Rain) is the most frequently-reprinted card in **Magic**. This champion of reprinting appeared in 18 sets, beating out other cardboard-happy contenders like [Counterspell](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterspell) and [Disenchant](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Disenchant) (neither of which made the cut to *Eighth Edition*). Specifically, [Stone Rain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stone+Rain) was printed in:


* all the base sets from *Alpha* to *Eighth Edition*,
* plus the large sets *Ice Age*, *Mirage*, *Tempest*, and *Mercadian Masques*,
* plus the starter-level sets *Portal*, *Portal Second Age*, *Portal Three Kingdoms*, *Starter 1999* and *Starter 2000*.
