 Coming off Pro Tour *Khans of Tarkir*, there was no doubt that Jeskai and Abzan were the clans to beat. [Mantis Rider](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mantis+Rider) and [Siege Rhino](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Siege+Rhino) have proved to be current pillars of the format. When asking why to play the deck, "Because you don't really have a bad match-up," or "Because the cards are just so good," are common replies. But I think there's also a different part of the equation: The decks are known. There are other overtly powerful cards that are just as good, or that could have just as solid matchups that have yet to make their mark. But some players here today are ahead of the curveâ€”and are using those cards to make serious dents in their opponents and the metagame.



As Hall of Fame member Brian Kibler said, players played Abzan and Jeskai because they "knew the decks were safe." Abzan is a morphed version of a Block deck, and Jeskai had a coming out performance at and SCG Open before the Pro Tour. It's not necessarily because the decks are better, but known. Patrick Dickmann told me that some cards "need solid shells to be good."
