 Brian David-Marshall is a New York–based game designer who has been involved with Magic since 1994, when he started organizing tournaments and ran a Manhattan game store. Since then, he has been a judge, a player, and one of the longest-tenured columnists on DailyMTG.com, as he enters his second decade writing for the site. He is also the Pro Tour Historian and one of the commentators for the Pro Tour. 






Jeff “Zan-man” Zandi is a true Texas original. He is one of the founding members of the Texas Guildmages and a regular contributor to Brainburst.com. The Guildmages are a group of players that have been meeting every Tuesday since 1996. The recently commemorated their 300th meeting. How would they know it was their 300th you might wonder. The answer would be Jeff Zandi. Jeff keeps detailed notes and attendance figures for each practice—which he posts in the Event Horizons forums. He has only missed 11 Tuesdays since they began meeting and the Tuesday his Sunday was born was not one of those!

In addition to writing for Brainburst, Jeff has his own business selling toilet paper on the Internet—“Everyone needs toilet paper!”—and also works as an office manager at his local Baptist Church. I asked him for some comments on the various participants and organizers of the event.

Dave Williams: “The most talented player in the room. Amazing personality! Impossible not to love him!”

Neil Reeves: “Very charming and talented. Loves to game more than anyone in the world. He desires respectability to free him of ‘gamer guilt’.”

Carl Lobato: “Honest with everyone. Careful with his opinions.”

Aaron Rzepka: “A Genius, a thinker, and an original! He might seem smarmy sometimes but really a good guy!”

Donald Paul: “The Governor is faithful, honest and true. Plus, you can trust him with your money!”

Haibing Hu: “He hides nothing. An extremely quick thinker!”

Rob Lawing: “He is the Sam Houston of Texas Magic. The only stories about him that are NOT true are the ones he tells himself!”

Jeff Taylor: “A creative genius who is going to make a billion dollars in Hollywood.”

Adam Bernstein: “A born fighter with good instincts and a good heart. Great attitude and a great work ethic.”

Sceadeau D’Tela: He may seem self absorbed but he loves to game and has his hands in everything. Great game concentration!”

Sterling Savage: “A gentlemanly Magic player.”

Jeff Zandi: “A little too wishy-washy! Zanman tries too hard to walk right down the middle on every subject. Honest and trustworthy, Zanman wants the best for everyone!”

Bryan Lyons: “Error free Magic player. Lyons has a great smile and a winning personality. Bryan would never do you wrong.”

Trent Boneau: “Intelligence and wit together in one person. A man of reason and perspective.”

Jonathan Pechon: “Great strategic thinker; Jonathan is what Charlie Brown would grow up to be if Lucy did not keep pulling the ball away. A great and trustworthy friend!”

Michael Musser: “The ultimate cynic, Michael has elevated his game in the past year like few others can.”

Event Horizons Point Man Don James: “Ultimate Sergeant-at-Arms, Don is able to handle any situation. Burly yet smart, Don is the type of man you would go to war alongside!”

Event Horizons Head Honcho Tim Weissman: “Perfect personality for his brand of intellectual leadership. Tim has amazing observational skills, strong emotional stability, and well-honed organizational skills. His incredible lifemate (Sheila Weissman) completes the picture!”
