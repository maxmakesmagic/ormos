I'm obligated at least [once every few columns](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/daily/mr110-once) to stress that I do read every letter sent to me. Due to the high volume of mail, I do not have the time to respond to ever letter I get, but I do read them all. So if you ever wanted to have the ear of someone high up in **Magic**, to quote Frasier Crane, I'm listening.
