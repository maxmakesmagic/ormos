How's your **Magic** trivia kung fu? How many firsts, greatests, and mosts of the color black do you know?

All these questions are about straight black cards as of the release of *Darksteel* -- no multicolor cards. *Portal* and *Starter* sets are considered, but *Unglued* is not (otherwise [bfm left](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=bfm%2Bleft) would be the answer to a lot of the questions!). Some questions may have more than one answer.

* What black card comes first in the alphabet (in English)?
* What black card comes last in the alphabet (in English)?
* What black creature has the highest sum of power/toughness (again, *Unglued's* 
[bfm right](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=bfm%2Bright) aside)?
* What black card has the highest converted mana cost (outside of *Unglued*)?
* What is the most common black creature type?
* What card has the most creature types of any black creature?
* What black Wall has the highest sum of power/toughness?
* What monoblack Legend has the highest sum of power/toughness?
* What card is the most-reprinted black creature?
* What card is the most-reprinted black sorcery?
* What card is the most-reprinted black instant?
* What card is the most-reprinted black enchantment?
* What card was the first black card banned from **Magic** tournaments?
* What black card generally has the highest value on the secondary market?
* What black card has the "blackest" art -- meaning, having the most black filling up the card's illustration frame?

The answers will appear tomorrow, along with a very special Wallpaper of the Week!
