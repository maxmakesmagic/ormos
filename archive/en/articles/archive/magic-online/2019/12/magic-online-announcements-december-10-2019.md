2020 Premier Play on *Magic Online*
-----------------------------------


For 2020, *Magic Online* is introducing a revamped Premier Play Program that incorporates both the Players Tour system and *Magic Online* Championship Series (MOCS) into a single program. For further rules info, check out the [MTGO Premier Play Program Rules](https://magic.wizards.com/en/mtgo/premier-play-2020). For everything you need to know about changes in 2020, check out [Chris's announcement article](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/magic-digital/introducing-new-magic-online-premier-play-program-2019-12-05). Or, if you just want the gist, see below:


* The *Magic Online* Championship Series and the Players Tour Qualifier system have been combined into a single, seasonal program.
* Seasons will be about seventeen weeks and will culminate in an in-person Champions Showcase with a prize pool of $70,000 and a Players Tour Finals invitation.
* Players earn a single Qualifier Point to unlock access to *Magic Online* Premier Play events in either the PTQ path, the *Magic Online* Champions Showcase path, or both.
* The new Premier Play Program starts on December 10, so there will be a small overlap where players will briefly be accumulating both kinds of QPs.
* Blue Limited PTQ Entry Tokens are good through December 29, and Red Tokens are good until April 12.
* All earned Format Points (FPs) will expire after their Q4 Playoff begins.
* The new Premier Play Program doesn't have a leaderboard structure, so this program will be eliminated after the 2019 MOCS Championship finalists have been locked in.
* Digital Event Coordinator (DEC) coverage will continue to be available for some event types.

*Vintage Cube* December 11
--------------------------


The *Vintage Cube* returns starting tomorrow and will run until January 16! *Magic*R&D's Reggie Valk has this to say about the latest update:


*"As December rolls on,* Magic Online *players know what's coming:* Vintage Cube*. If you're unfamiliar,* Vintage Cube *is one of the most powerful cubes you can play, headlined by the Power Nine and other members of the Vintage reserved list. While considering how to update the Cube for this year's December iteration, I decided that this update wasn't going to attempt any major overhauls, just include some of the most powerful cards to be printed this year. Fortunately, there were quite a few!* War of the Spark *brought powerful new planeswalkers that have made a splash even in Vintage, and* Modern Horizons *and* Throne of Eldraine *were no slouches either. Still, the core of the Cube experience remains the same: there's [Tinker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tinker)-fueled artifact decks, Storm combo, and blistering fast mono-red aggro to name a few. Happy cubing! Here's hoping you all get to open a [Black Lotus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Black+Lotus)!"*

Pioneering a New Ban Cadence
----------------------------


For the new Pioneer format, R&D has announced that all changes to the banned list will happen on Mondays. Since we know that many Pioneer fans play on *Magic Online*, we wanted to make it clear how this will work with *Magic Online* league play.


Until the Pioneer format is placed on the normal ban cadence, Pioneer bans will take effect the day after the announcement, at noon Pacific time on Tuesdays.


If a card is banned, players using the newly banned card in a league can finish their league courses up until the ban takes effect. At noon PT on Tuesday, any remaining players with newly illegal decks will be removed from the league with their entry option returned to their collection. If a card is unbanned, players will be able to join the Pioneer league with decks containing those cards after the changes are made effective at noon PT on Tuesday.


For more information about Pioneer, check out [Blake's announcement article](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/news/announcing-pioneer-format-2019-10-21).
