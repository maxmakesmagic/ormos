Every year since 2006, Wizards of the Coast has made special holiday-themed cards as a gift for employees and associates. Last year's was [Yule Ooze](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/arcana/852), 2010's was [Snow Mercy](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/magazine/article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/arcana/605), and the [four before that](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/magazine/article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/arcana/340) were Fruitcake Elemental, Gifts Given, Evil Presents, and Season's Beatings.


So it will come as no surprise that there's a new one this year.
