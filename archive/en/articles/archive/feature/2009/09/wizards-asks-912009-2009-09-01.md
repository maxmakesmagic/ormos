**Elaine Chase:** As with most things in life, that really depends upon the person. Our official age-grade is for 13+, which has to do with both the mental skills necessary to comprehend game play as well as the maturity level that is appropriate given some of the card imagery. We find that in general, people get the most out of **Magic** when they start playing in high school. Players younger than 13 (even very intelligent ones) often play a game that is almost the **Magic** we know and love, but with some game-play elements ignored. But there are some extraordinary kids out there who can pick up the full game at a younger age.
