Mike Turian vs. Anton Jonsson
-----------------------------


![Michael Turian](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/ptsd04/fm24_1.jpg)This is Mike Turian's last Pro Tour. Don't even try to tell him to stick around for Worlds. He's having none of it. He's even going to be *in* Seattle for the Pro Tour, but won't be competing. He's currently working on going out with a bang, sitting at a very strong 10-2 record. Sitting opposite him is the mighty Anton Jonsson, who would be due for another Top 8 if he hadn't just gotten one at Pro Tour - Amsterdam.


### Game 1


Turian's quick start of Transfixer and [Copper Myr](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Copper+Myr) was shut down by Jonsson's turn-two [Leonin Den-Guard](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leonin+Den-Guard). He missed his third land drop and added a [Pteron Ghost](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pteron+Ghost) and [Viridian Longbow](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Viridian+Longbow) to the table. Jonsson seized on the opportunity and [Arrest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arrest)ed Turian's Myr. But today was a good day for The Potato, and he pulled a plains off the top. He equipped his Transfixer and flew over with the Ghost for damage.


Jonsson dropped a [Leonin Battlemage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leonin+Battlemage) into play, but Turian was about to make his life very difficult. Another land off the top, and then the [Sword of Kaldra](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sword+of+Kaldra). Jonsson slumped.


"I guess I'll try." - Anton Jonsson


He attacked again and made some guys, then watched as Turian's Transfixer picked up the Sword and shot down the Battlemage. Jonsson hit with [Frogmite](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Frogmite) and Den-Guard then summoned a [Razor Golem](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Razor+Golem) and a [Pteron Ghost](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pteron+Ghost), but the farce wouldn't last long. He picked up his cards after another draw.


Turian 1- Jonsson 0


### Game 2


Jonsson's deck did what it was supposed to do in the second game. Turn one [Auriok Glaivemaster](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Auriok+Glaivemaster), turn two [Bonesplitter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bonesplitter), equip, bash for four.


"Yeah, that's gooood, yeah." - Mike Turian



![Echoing Calm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Echoing+Calm)

He had only a [Leonin Elder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leonin+Elder) in play, and nothing to do on his second turn. That meant another four to the grille. Jonsson played a [Great Furnace](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Great+Furnace), giving Turian one life, and then a [Pteron Ghost](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pteron+Ghost). Turian Raised the Alarm at end of turn, then untapped and slammed down an [Arrest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arrest) on Glaivemaster. Jonsson moved his axe over and hit for three, then stopped Turian's 1/1 with [Frogmite](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Frogmite).


Turian brought out Vulshok Morningstar and got in for three. Jonsson made himself a [Duskworker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duskworker). Turian continued the pain with [Vulshok Gauntlets](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vulshok+Gauntlets) for his Elder and smashed in. Jonsson took it all, falling to five. He untapped and [Arrest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arrest)ed the token and got back for some damage of his own, putting Turian within range of a lethal attack.


Little did he suspect that Turian was holding [Fireball](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fireball), and just needed to peel a land to take the game. He didn't get it. He moved his Morningstar onto his untapped token, then played [Wirefly Hive](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wirefly+Hive), tapping out. His Elder put him to a very important six life. Jonsson could only do five. He moved the axe to his [Duskworker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duskworker), forcing Turian to throw away his token and dropping him to three. He added an [Alpha Myr](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Alpha+Myr) to his team, putting Turian to four.


Turian drew … [Sword of Kaldra](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sword+of+Kaldra). He bluffed a trick, hoping Jonsson would blow his attack, but he did not.


Turian 1 - Jonsson 1


### Game 3


Jonsson led of with [Leonin Elder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leonin+Elder), prompting a chuckle from Turian.


"Oh, fighting fire with fire, I see." - Mike Turian


Turian played a Morningstar, and after Jonsson dropped a Den-Guard, a three-mana [Razor Golem](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Razor+Golem). Jonsson brought out a [Bonesplitter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bonesplitter) and got in for four while the getting was good. Turian returned the favor for five and added a [Copper Myr](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Copper+Myr). Jonsson was ready, though, and [Arrest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arrest)ed the [Razor Golem](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Razor+Golem) to take control.


Turian brought out his [Taj-Nar Swordsmith](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Taj-Nar+Swordsmith) and fetched [Viridian Longbow](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Viridian+Longbow) before taking another four from the Den-Guard. Jonsson kept the pressure up with a [Razor Golem](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Razor+Golem) of his own. Turian tried to hold the ground with [Vulshok Gauntlets](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vulshok+Gauntlets) on his Swordsmith, but Jonsson moved the 'Splitter to his Golem and played a [Pteron Ghost](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pteron+Ghost), so it could tangle with the Swordsmith and survive. He swung. Turian fell to one. Turian calmly moved his bow onto his Myr and gave it back.


Jonsson dropped a [Duskworker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duskworker) and swung all out. Turian flipped up a sideboarded [Echoing Calm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Echoing+Calm), shocking a nearby Kai Budde.


"Was that [Echoing Calm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Echoing+Calm)?" - Kai Budde


"Yes." - Mike Turian


"What does that do?" - Kai Budde


![Anton Jonsson](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/ptsd04/fm24_2.jpg)The freed Golem and big Swordsmith took care of business. Turian had to lose his Bowed-up Myr, but Jonsson lost his Ghost, Den-Guard and Elder. It was devastating. Worse for Jonsson, the Golem picked up the Gauntlets and started hitting for nine. Jonsson thought hard. He put the Splitter on [Duskworker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duskworker) and swung with both his men. He lost his [Razor Golem](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Razor+Golem) but took care of the Swordsmith. His [Frogmite](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Frogmite) came on board and took the axe.


Another Golem hit took Jonsson to five. Turian played [Loxodon Mystic](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Loxodon+Mystic). [Skyhunter Cub](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skyhunter+Cub) was a turn too late. Another turn, and the match was Turian's.


Mike Turian defeats Anton Jonsson 2-1
