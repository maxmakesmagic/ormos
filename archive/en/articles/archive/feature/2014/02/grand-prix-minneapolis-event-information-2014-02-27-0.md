**Registration**: $40   
 Preregistration available from April 10th – May 9th, 12:00 p.m. CST 


There will be no Saturday registration for this event.


 Many Grand Prix offer additional services to participants, such as Sleep-In Specials and VIP packages. Sleep-In Specials allow players with byes to skip the player meeting on Saturday and arrive shortly before their first round begins. VIP packages provide various perks such as complimentary bottled water, special seating, and exclusive artist signings. Details of these services vary from event to event; please check the organizer's site for specifics.





![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/promo/batterskull.jpg)*Get your promo card by playing in the Grand Prix (while supplies last).* Welcome back to Minneapolis! #GPMINN will feature a custom playmat designed by Tom Baxa given to the first 750 players on site on Friday afternoon (first come, first served). We'll have a free Mini Master event Friday afternoon as further incentive to show up and get your weekend of **Magic** started on Friday! Artists Tom Baxa and rk post will both be onsite, and we expect to add 1 or 2 more artists as we draw closer to the event. 


The group hotel rate is at the [Westin Minneapolis](https://www.starwoodmeeting.com/StarGroupsWeb/booking/reservation?id=1309276317&key=B02DA), which is 7 blocks away from the Convention center, but is located conveniently on the light rail line coming in from the airport and the downtown Nicollet free shuttle. The light rail line will run you from downtown to the airport for only $2.25 each way. The same rail runs all the way to the Mall of America (south of the airport). Just outside of the Westin is Nicollet Avenue, a pedestrian avenue that plays host to lots of great shops and restaurants. There is a free shuttle running the length of Nicollet Avenue that picks up every 15 minutes and drops off right at the front door of the convention center. Super convenient!







 *The **Magic: The Gathering** Grand Prix tournament series is a great reason to step up your game, catch up with old friends, meet some new ones, and play **Magic**. Grand Prix tournaments are world-wide open events that allow all **Magic** players to participate and experience the thrill of a large-scale competition over three days. In addition to cash prizes, a high Planeswalker Points multiplier, and exclusive foil promo cards for participants, the Grand Prix features a host of other activities, including side events and artist signings. Side-event tournaments begin Friday, with the Grand Prix main event running Saturday and Sunday.

**Tournament Format**
  


* [Modern Constructed](http://www.wizards.com/Magic/TCG/Resources.aspx?x=judge/resources/sfrmodern)
* Visit [this page](http://www.wizards.com/Magic/TCG/Resources.aspx?x=judge/resources/sfrmodern) to see a list of cards banned in Modern tournaments.
* Deck lists are required.
* Players must use the same deck on Day Two that they used on Day One.


**Tournament Structure** 


* Modified Swiss-style (50-minute rounds).
* Day One will consist of a maximum of 9 Swiss rounds. Day Two will consist of 6 Swiss rounds and the Top 8 single-elimination finals.
* If 799 or less players register for the event, all players with an X-2-0 record (or better) or the top 64 players – whichever is greater – advance to the second day of competition for prizes and invitations.
* If 800 or more players register for the event, all players with an X-2-0 record (or better) or the top 128 players – whichever is greater – advance to the second day of competition for prizes and invitations.
* The Top 8 players after the final Swiss round on Day Two will advance to the Top 8 single-elimination playoff.
* Top 8 playoff matches will be best 2 of 3.
* Top 8 playoff matches will have no time limit. (Players are still expected to play at a normal pace and complete playoff matches in a reasonable amount of time.)
* Standings after the Swiss rounds will be used to determine final order in the standings for losing players in the quarterfinal and semifinal playoff rounds.
* For the first game of each match in the Top 8, the player that finished higher in the Swiss rounds chooses either to play first or to play second. For subsequent games in each Top 8 match, the usual Play/Draw rule applies (loser of the previous game decides whether to play first in the next game).


**Judges**
  
 The head judge for Grand Prix Minneapolis will be Toby Elliott (Level 5, UK). Judges interested in applying for this event should do so through the [Judge Center](http://apps.magicjudges.org/events/983/).

 Byes earned through Planeswalker Points are calculated using the Planeswalker Point totals from all reported events as of the Wednesday immediately before the Grand Prix. (For Grand Prix Minneapolis, the cutoff date will be March 5th.) Points earned in tournaments held at the Grand Prix event site do not count toward earned byes at that Grand Prix. Byes will be given to players in the Grand Prix based on the following criteria:

Byes are not cumulative throughout the season or year. Byes do not pass down under any circumstances. Players who accumulate multiple byes to a particular Grand Prix tournament receive only the bye for the greatest number of rounds.

If you are flying into Minneapolis, the airport code is MSP. The least expensive transportation from MSP to downtown is [light rail](http://www.metrotransit.org/metro-blue-line), which has a stop right outside the player block hotel at the Nicollet mall station. If cabbing downtown, expect a cab to run between $30 and $40. The player room block is set at the [Westin Minneapolis](https://www.starwoodmeeting.com/StarGroupsWeb/booking/reservation?id=1309276317&key=B02DA) at a rate of $110 and the block is held and rate guaranteed through April 14th, while rooms are still available.


Players driving in daily can choose multiple parking facilities right around the convention center. The most convenient parking ramp for our hall location is located next to the Central Lutheran Church across the street from the convention center on 3rd avenue. Free parking is available on the street between 6:00 p.m. Friday and 8:00 a.m. Monday; if you get there early enough you could park for free!
