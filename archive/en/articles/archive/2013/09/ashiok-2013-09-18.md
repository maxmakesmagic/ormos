ASHIOK
======



 Posted in [NEWS](/en/articles)
 on September 18, 2013 










Ashiok uses fear to terrorize foes with their own darkest, most closely guarded nightmares. He delights in having the upper hand and watching superior beings reduced to screaming and quaking.


Because all sentient beings feel fear, Ashiok believes his power is the great equalizer. For Ashiok, fear is a feeling given form by the mindâ€”a quasi-elemental force that can be shaped and wielded to his benefit.


Once his Planeswalker spark ignited, Ashiok discovered that, in addition to culling the nightmares of others, he could also make their fears manifest in reality. As such, he sees himself as an engineer, constructing twisted architectures of torment and sorrow. The dread vapors that emanate from him are an extension of his magic, enabling him to more easily access and manipulate the fears of those they enshroud.


He now travels the Multiverse in search of designs for the perfect embodiment of fear. In his search, Ashiok came to Theros, where dreams seem more vibrant than the other planes he has visited.
