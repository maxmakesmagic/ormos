Antoine Ruel has no need for any introduction as he is one of Magic's finest players. With a win at Grand Prix Porto, experience with this format is one thing that he shouldn't lack.

Carlos Barrado also has a history of high finishes and is one of Spain's top representatives.

### Game 1

Both players wished each other luck and it worked out with zero mulligan on either side. Carlos started more aggressively with a turn two Crypt Keeper while Antoine remained quiet in his corner with three mana. The Spanish summoned a [Childhood Horror](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Childhood+Horror) to join the attack on the Frenchman who had four mana open. 

Fearing an [Elephant Ambush](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elephant+Ambush), which Antoine had he chose not to attack with his Keeper and hit Ruel for two. Ruel then attacked with his Elephant, cast a [Nantuko Calmer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nantuko+Calmer) and stared at a three-creature army.

A [Faceless Butcher](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Faceless+Butcher) soon took care of the calmer and opened way for six damage bringing the Frenchman down to eight life. 

To find a solution, Ruel played a [Diabolic Tutor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Diabolic+Tutor) and took a [Chainer's Edict](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chainer%27s+Edict) that netted him a Crypt Keeper. 

When Carlos enchanted his [Childhood Horror](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Childhood+Horror) with [Shade's Form](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shade%27s+Form) It was just about enough to finish off the tapped out Frenchmen.

Ruel 0 – 1 Barrado

### Game 2

Antoine summons a [Filthy Cur](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Filthy+Cur), which gets met by a Baskin Rootwalla and a Crypt Keeper. The Rootwalla got afflicted but Carlos played out another Keeper and a [Diligent Farmhand](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Diligent+Farmhand). Carlos kept bringing creatures into play like there was no tomorrow and his opponent tried to hang on with [Gloomdrifter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gloomdrifter). 

Barrado didn't make it easy though by enchanting his [Springing Tiger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Springing+Tiger) with [Shade's Form](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shade%27s+Form). Still, Ruel was able to kill it, but it got back in the game and it was too much for him to handle and he conceded.

**Final Result:** Ruel 0 – 2 Barrado
