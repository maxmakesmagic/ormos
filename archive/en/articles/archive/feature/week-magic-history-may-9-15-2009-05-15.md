### May 11-15, 2004: The **Magic** Invitational Goes Online and on the Road!

For the first time, a top-level **Magic** tournament was played in two different cities as the [2004 **Magic** Invitational](/en/events/coverage/live-coverage-2004-magic-invitational) started at E3 in Los Angeles, then moved south for Pro Tour–San Diego, with the finals of the Invitational being played on the stage during the Pro Tour's Top 8.

The Invitational was conducted entirely on **Magic Online**, which meant that fans could follow the action live as it unfolded through the five formats. And when the dust settled, Bob Maher, Jr. was the winner, although his original submission, a sorcery that read "Target player gets nine poison counters," had to be replaced by a later card, which became [Dark Confidant](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dark+Confidant). You can see the other submissions [here](/en/articles/archive/event-coverage/invitational-grand-prize-card-submissions-2004-05-12).
