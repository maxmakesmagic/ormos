 Stybs has played Magic the world over, writing and drafting as part of the event coverage team and slinging Commander everywhere his decks will fit. 





It was a solid 2-1 Day 1 start for the number one target of competitors at the World Championship. Rattling off a Modern record of 3-1, twelfth-ranked Yuuya Watanabe finished Day 1 at 5-2, setting himself up for yet another Top 4 run to the surprise of absolutely no one.


Assuming, of course, his draft could deliver as well or better than it did the day before.


Tenth-ranked Owen Turtenwald was similarly positioned at 5-2, looking to add to his impressive performance to start the first day of the World Championship. Focused and disciplined, he poured hours of practice into *Magic Online* for each of the formats for this year's competition. The initial payoff—a great Day 1 record—was just the first step in his plan to earn a Top 4 appearance.


But as every competitor was keenly aware, defeating Watanabe was far easier said than done.

**The Decks**


A first pack, first pick [Deadbridge Shaman](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deadbridge+Shaman) was a draft decision that caused discussion. Watanabe had his choice of [Soulblade Djinn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soulblade+Djinn) and other "more powerful" cards but elected to push into a plan he had going into the draft. Following his controversial first pick with the pieces of an aggressive black and red deck that included [Dragon Fodder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragon+Fodder), [Shambling Ghoul](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shambling+Ghoul), and [Cobblebrute](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cobblebrute), Watanabe looked to end games quickly and efficiently. At the top of his aggressive plan laid [Priest of the Blood Rite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Priest+of+the+Blood+Rite), and the game-ending 5/5 flying Demon that came with it.


Turtenwald on the other hand had a more typical draft experience. Waving between colors early in the first pack, he settled into black first before confirming white—to the benefit of his first pack, first pick [Consul's Lieutenant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Consul%27s+Lieutenant)—as the pairing. He was rewarded to start off Pack 3 with back-to-back-to-back picks of [Hixus, Prison Warden](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hixus%2C+Prison+Warden), [Kothophed, Soul Hoarder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kothophed%2C+Soul+Hoarder), and [Tragic Arrogance](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tragic+Arrogance). With cards like [Shadows of the Past](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shadows+of+the+Past) that set him up to go long, he would win by stopping the opposition swinging over the top of everyone else.


**The Games**


The first game was a slow affair. Watanabe didn't have a second turn play, but Turtenwald leading off with [Shadows of the Past](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shadows+of+the+Past), but had [Angel's Tomb](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Angel%27s+Tomb) into [Deadbridge Shaman](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deadbridge+Shaman) to follow. Turtenwald killed the Angel with [Celestial Flare](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Celestial+Flare) before casting [Fleshbag Marauder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fleshbag+Marauder) to answer the Shaman. It took Turtenwald down a card but set up through scry triggers and left Watanabe with an empty battlefield.


[Veteran's Sidearm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Veteran%27s+Sidearm) was all that followed for the Japanese star.


From there, Turtenwald began to take off. [Read the Bones](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Read+the+Bones) set up his next turn to cast [Kothophed, Soul Hoarder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kothophed%2C+Soul+Hoarder) against [Mage-Ring Bully](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mage-Ring+Bully) with the Sidearm equipped. Watanabe paused—he had to attack—and used [Fiery Impulse](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fiery+Impulse) to get the flying Demon off the battlefield when Turtenwald blocked.

[Shadows of the Past](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shadows+of+the+Past) kept the scry triggers going for Turtenwald, and both [Cleric of the Forward Order](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cleric+of+the+Forward+Order) and [Knight of the Pilgrim's Road](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Knight+of+the+Pilgrim%27s+Road) followed. Turtenwald attacked into an empty battlefield—though [Shambling Ghoul](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shambling+Ghoul) was a blocker presumed for the next turn—but it wasn't enough. [Weight of the Underworld](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Weight+of+the+Underworld) ensured Watanabe's options had run out.


The second game was a faster start as Watanabe had [Goblin Glory Chaser](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Glory+Chaser) on the first turn, with Turtenwald playing [Bonded Construct](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bonded+Construct). They traded, and [Mage-Ring Bully](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mage-Ring+Bully) was matched by [Cleric of the Forward Order](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cleric+of+the+Forward+Order). [Shambling Ghoul](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shambling+Ghoul) began to grow Watanabe's side as Shadows of the past came down again.


Now with scry triggers coming from every creature's death, Turtenwald traded off against the [Mage-Ring Bully](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mage-Ring+Bully) to pull out of the land deficit he was in before playing a [Returned Centaur](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Returned+Centaur) to hold the fort. Watanabe elected to keep his [Cobblebrute](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cobblebrute) back against the 2/4. Quickly catching up, Turtenwald played [Blood-Cursed Knight](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood-Cursed+Knight) next.

But Watanabe revealed one of his rares: [Priest of the Blood Rite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Priest+of+the+Blood+Rite). A 5/5 flying demon would be much more problematic for Turtenwald than an array of creatures on the ground.


Leaving all his mana up Turtenwald passed the turn and the Priest began to scratch at Watanabe's life total. [Fetid Imp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fetid+Imp) turned his [Angel's Tomb](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Angel%27s+Tomb) on again and the flying monsters attacked. Turtenwald took the damage and cast [Hixus, Prison Warden](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hixus%2C+Prison+Warden) afterwards, exiling the Demon token and artifact Angel.


[Blood-Cursed Knight](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood-Cursed+Knight) attacked for Turtenwald, and the resulting trade gave two scry triggers and 4 life for him. It also, just as importantly, turned [Shadows of the Past](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shadows+of+the+Past)'s activated ability on. The [Priest of the Blood Rite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Priest+of+the+Blood+Rite) kept eating away at Watanabe's life, but Turtenwald finally blocked to send it away. Activating [Shadows of the Past](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shadows+of+the+Past), Turtenwald put a firm clock on Watanabe while outracing the incoming damage from [Fetid Imp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fetid+Imp).


It was a slow grind that turned impossible for Watanabe to come back from when [Orbs of Warding](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Orbs+of+Warding) entered the battlefield for Turtenwald. Without a way out from under the defensive lock, Watanabe extended the hand a few turns later.
