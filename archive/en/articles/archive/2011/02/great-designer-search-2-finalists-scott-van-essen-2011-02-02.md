### Comments


Jailbreak showcases the Breakout mechanic. Breakout is an ability word for a combat trigger, modeled on Frenzy, that triggers after blockers are declared if the Breakout creature is attacking and there are any unblocked attacking creatures. It's designed to make opponents need to block every attacking creature or suffer nasty saboteur effects and stronger attackers, evoking the disruption caused by creatures "rampaging behind enemy lines". As breakout cards build up, your opponent must choose between racing or holding back creatures to contain you. This leads to an escalating board state and the eventual carnage of a riot (attack) breaking through containing forces.


Jailbreak has 10 Breakout creatures and over 20 cards which enable Breakout through haste, evasion, removal, and cards that are just annoying to block. Other subtler synergies are layered throughout the deck for players to discover.


To reduce unfun and degenerate play states, Breakout creatures do not have inherent evasion. You must put them at risk or combine them with an enabler. To reduce the complexity of breakout creatures, commons only improve themselves, and most higher rarities have effects other than changing combat math.


Games often play out with an early rush, a buildup phase, and then one or several breakout attempts. Tools are included to win races as well as to achieve breakout.


Breakout increases interactivity by encouraging attacking and blocking (as opposed to just racing), it makes both players approach combat from a new perspective, and builds up organically to exciting high-risk, high-reward plays.
