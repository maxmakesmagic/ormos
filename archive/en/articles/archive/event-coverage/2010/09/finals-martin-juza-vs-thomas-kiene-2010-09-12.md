**Game 1**


Martin Juza won the die roll and chose to play first – both players kept their seven card hands, and Juza cast [Augury Owl](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Augury+Owl), leaving all three cards on top of his library. It was an ominous sign for any opposing mage.


Kiene started his offense with [Silvercoat Lion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Silvercoat+Lion), then boosted it the next turn with an [Honor of the Pure](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Honor+of+the+Pure). When Juza tried to put a roadblock up by casting [Azure Drake](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Azure+Drake), Kiene Bolted it after blocking the 3/3 Lion.


Martin dropped a [Rotting Legion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rotting+Legion) and the players tried racing, but Thomas's Lone Missionaries put him slightly ahead. When the American's [Silvercoat Lion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Silvercoat+Lion) met its end via [Deathmark](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deathmark) and the Missionaries was [Diminish](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Diminish)ed in combat, Martin pulled even leaving Kiene with just a [Gargoyle Sentinel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gargoyle+Sentinel).

With both players at 3 life, Martin chose not to risk dying to Kiene topdecking one of two [Lightning Bolt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt)s, and opted to draw the game by playing [Howling Banshee](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Howling+Banshee).

**Game 2**


Pretending like the first game never happened, Juza chose to play. Thomas looked pained while contemplating his hand. "You're going to keep," Juza said.


"That's all I needed. It was just a nudge in the right direction." Kiene replied.


Thomas's hand was light on early action as he cast an [Honor of the Pure](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Honor+of+the+Pure) but had no creatures through turn three. His turn four [Assault Griffin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Assault+Griffin) was [Doom Blade](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Doom+Blade)d and his [Blinding Mage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blinding+Mage) was [Deathmark](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deathmark)ed.


Juza cast a [Diabolic Tutor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Diabolic+Tutor) to fetch [Call to Mind](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Call+to+Mind), which he used the next turn to re-buy the [Doom Blade](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Doom+Blade) that killed Kiene's [Azure Drake](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Azure+Drake), leaving his opponent with only a Lone Missionaries and [Phantom Beast](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phantom+Beast) to mount an offense. The Lone Missionaries became an immediate threat when it was enchanted with an [Armored Ascension](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Armored+Ascension).

Juza had the answer for the Ascension in Æther Adept, bouncing the Missionaries.


"You hit the one-outer for my [Armored Ascension](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Armored+Ascension). How nice," Thomas complained.


"I had more than one. . ."


"Oh. I guess you had two. But still. . ."


Unfazed, Martin continued to mount an assault. Though his [Conundrum Sphinx](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Conundrum+Sphinx) was [Pacifism](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pacifism)ed, the Czech had enough of an offense to attack and put Thomas at 2 life.


Usually [Sign in Blood](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sign+in+Blood) is used to draw cards, but when your opponent is at 2, it's also a lethal burn spell, and that's how Juza used it to win the second game.

**Game 3**


Neither player liked their seven card opener, but six was good for both as they prepared for the final game of the tournament (barring another [Banshee](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Banshee) draw).


Kiene started out strongly with a turn-two [Stormfront Pegasus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stormfront+Pegasus) and turn-three [Honor of the Pure](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Honor+of+the+Pure), but Juza felt fine racing with his [Child of Night](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Child+of+Night) since turn-four [Azure Drake](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Azure+Drake) made for a good blocker against the Pegasus. Kiene got stuck on three land, and Juza used [Alluring Siren](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Alluring+Siren) to run Kiene's [Stormfront Pegasus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stormfront+Pegasus) into Martin's [Azure Drake](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Azure+Drake).


A [Conundrum Sphinx](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Conundrum+Sphinx) came down for Juza and he followed that with an [Augury Owl](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Augury+Owl), ensuring that the Sphinx's ability would be successful for Juza when it attacked. [Alluring Siren](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Alluring+Siren) kept running Kiene's creatures into Juza's larger creatures, and with Kiene lacking any sort of offense, the [Conundrum Sphinx](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Conundrum+Sphinx) was able to take the game, the match, and the tournament.
