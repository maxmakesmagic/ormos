### 


### Loren Eakins



**Age:** 25




**Hometown:** Sacramento, CA





**Previous Magic Accomplishments:**


30th at Grand Prix Sacramento





**What did you play this weekend, and why?**


Green-White Megamorph. I felt it was the most well-positioned deck in the format.





**What was the best card in your main deck, and why?**


[Den Protector](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Den+Protector). The card lets you go long with any deck and can force through a lot of damage.





**What was the best card out of your sideboard, and why?**


[Hangarback Walker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hangarback+Walker). The card is so difficult for opponents to deal with. It sets up so many situations where the opponent has no visible plays because the Thopters are coming.

### Corey Burkhart



**Age:** 23




**Hometown:** Alta Loma, CA




**Previous Magic Accomplishments:**


Losing playing for SCG Top 8s, a MOCS finals, and one Pro Tour appearance





**What did you play this weekend, and why?**


Abzan Aggro. The deck applies heavy pressure to the linear decks while having game against other control strategies. Cutting all the [Hero's Downfall](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hero%27s+Downfall)s was a big part of the deck.



**What was the best card in your main deck, and why?**


[Herald of Torment](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Herald+of+Torment). The card steals so many games. After that, [Sandsteppe Citadel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sandsteppe+Citadel).





**What was the best card out of your sideboard, and why?**


[Self-Inflicted Wound](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Self-Inflicted+Wound)s in the sideboard are fantastic. I had four this week on Magic Online up until Friday night where I added a [Duress](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress).

### Dan Ward



**Age:** 30




**Hometown:** Jefferson Height, NY





**Previous Magic Accomplishments:**


Grand Prix Top 8 Vancouver, phoenix  



**What did you play this weekend, and why?**



Black-Red (Over-the-Top) Dragons. Well-positioned for the metagame. [Stormbreath Dragon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stormbreath+Dragon); need I say more?





**What was the best card in your main deck, and why?**


Strombreath Dragon! It's hard to kill and it kills quick. A lot of removal played currently doesn't line up well against it.





**What was the best card out of your sideboard, and why?**


[Duress](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress). It made the matchups with less creatures better. Basically, takes the card I need to prevent my Dragons/[Goblin Rabblemaster](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Rabblemaster)s from dying.

### Paul (Soohwang) Yeem



**Age:** 24




**Hometown:** San Diego and Berkeley, CA





**Previous Magic Accomplishments:**


PTQ win for Pro Tour *Journey into Nyx*


11th at Grand Prix Atlanta





**What did you play this weekend, and why?**


Esper Dragons. I won a Grand Prix Trial with it (and I expected more Green-red Devotion).





**What was the best card in your main deck, and why?**


Draognlord Ojutai. It finds [Dig Through Time](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dig+Through+Time).





**What was the best card out of your sideboard, and why?**


[Jace, Vryn's Prodigy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace%2C+Vryn%27s+Prodigy). It can basically flashback [Dig Through Time](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dig+Through+Time).

### Ben Weitz



**Age:** 25




**Hometown:** St. Paul, MN





**Previous Magic Accomplishments:**


Grand Prix Toronto Top 8; finalist Grand Prix Portland


35th Pro Tour Khans of Tarkir


54th Pro Tour Magic Origins


Silver in Pro Players Club



**What did you play this weekend, and why?**


Jeskai Midrange because Blue-Red [Ensoul Artifact](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ensoul+Artifact) and Red Aggro can be soft to unanswered [Soulfire Grand Master](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soulfire+Grand+Master) or [Mantis Rider](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mantis+Rider), and Jace and [Dragonlord Ojutai](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragonlord+Ojutai) are very powerful cards.



**What was the best card in your main deck, and why?**


[Jace, Vryn's Prodigy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace%2C+Vryn%27s+Prodigy). Fantastic powerful card with applications early and late game. Jeskai has a lot of conditional removal like [Wild Slash](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Slash) or [Valorous Stance](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Valorous+Stance), and Jace lets you find the right one and even cast it again.





**What was the best card out of your sideboard, and why?**


[Tragic Arrogance](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tragic+Arrogance). It destroys Enchantress (Constellation) and Blue-Red [Ensoul Artifact](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ensoul+Artifact)s, and I played each of those decks twice.

### Michael Majors



**Age:** 24




**Hometown:** Augusta, Georgia





**Previous Magic Accomplishments:**



2 Grand Prix Top 8s  






**What did you play this weekend, and why?**



Blue-Red Tutelage; I trusted Seth Manfield's extensive testing—five matches against it on MTGO.






**What was the best card in your main deck, and why?**



Sphinx's Tutelage—can't actually win without it.  








**What was the best card out of your sideboard, and why?**


[Fiery Impulse](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fiery+Impulse) — Functional [Lightning Bolt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt) against [Fleecemane Lion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fleecemane+Lion) and [Mantis Rider](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mantis+Rider)

### Artur Villela



**Age:** 33




**Hometown:**


Juiz de Fora, Brazil




**Previous Magic Accomplishments:**


A couple of Grand Prix Top 8s (Rio 2013; Orlando 2014)






**What did you play this weekend, and why?**


Abzan Constellation, Jonathan “Jonais” Lobo told me to, and I trust him blindly.







**What was the best card in your main deck, and why?**


[Brain Maggot](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brain+Maggot). It's an incredibly powerful card in a field with a limited amount of removal spells. It also helped me a lot to win games where I didn't play my best.








**What was the best card out of your sideboard, and why?**


[Hero's Downfall](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hero%27s+Downfall). It's not spectacular, but it sees a lot of play after Game 1.

### Paul Rietzl



**Age:** 30




**Hometown:** Scottsdale, AZ by way of Boston, MA





**Previous Magic Accomplishments:**


Pro Tour Hall of Fame


11th Grand Prix San Diego 2011



**What did you play this weekend, and why?**


Abzan because it plays really good cards, gives you lots of decision points, and is very customizable after sideboarding.



**What was the best card in your main deck, and why?**


[Tasigur, the Golden Fang](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tasigur%2C+the+Golden+Fang). Doubles by allowing you to cast two spells in a turn versus aggro while winning you long games with his activated ability.








**What was the best card out of your sideboard, and why?**


[Ugin, the Spirit Dragon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ugin%2C+the+Spirit+Dragon). Great way to win unwinnable games and use all those extra lands from [Courser of Kruphix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Courser+of+Kruphix)/[Nissa, Vastwood Seer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nissa%2C+Vastwood+Seer) and card draw.
