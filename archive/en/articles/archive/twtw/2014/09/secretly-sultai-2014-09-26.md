 Since a little after midnight Friday, my local draft mailing lists have been percolating with pleas for people to not open any packs they might have won at their Prereleases this past weekend. We have a mix of people preparing for the Pro Tour, fiends looking for a new draft experience, and one coverage reporter with a little from column A and a lot from column B. I have had the chance to do a little drafting with the set and can't wait to get unfettered access to packs this weekend. I am pretty sure this is going to be my favorite draft format since *Innistrad*. Even as I type these words I am excited for our potluck draft tonight, which will feature two pods of drafters and possibly some reconstructed packs to cover everyone.

[Dutiful Return](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dutiful+Return) | Art by [Seb McKinnon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&artist=[%22Seb+McKinnon%22])




 I was visiting my family in Florida this past weekend and was worried that I would miss the Prerelease and come up short on my pack obligation for the upcoming draft. Fortunately, I was able to work out the timing so I could connect with the one and only Sheldon Menery, who lives within shouting distance of where I was staying. We worked out plans to attend the first Sunday flight at [Armada Games in Tampa, Florida](http://armadagames.com/forums/content.php). It started late enough that Sheldon and his lovely wife Gretchyn were able to show off their prodigious hosting skills and put together a lovely brunch.




 Fueled by thick slabs of French toast—that were nearly matched in thickness by the slabs of bacon—and a nutritious tomato-and-vegetable-laden beverage, I was prepared to unravel the mysteries of the Sultai at Armada Games. The turnout for the event was in excess of 50 people, and judging by the trade binders full of newly minted [fetch lands](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&type=+[%22Land%22]&text=+[search]+[your]+[library]&set=|[%22Khans%20of%20Tarkir%22]) it looked like many of the people had been at it since the midnight event on Friday.



It seemed like the veterans of the events were all asking for Mardu and Abzan, had cooled somewhat on Sultai and Jeskai, while Temur had held steady. Over the weekend, at Armada Games whenever a player notched three wins or more in a tournament—sometimes referred to as "flights"—they got to sign the banner of the clan they signed up to play. There was not a lot of room left on Mardu and Abzan, but fortunately, that meant there was a nice fat patch of open space on the Sultai banner that was itching for me to scrawl my signature on it. Here is what I had to work with:

 1 [Warden of the Eye](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Warden+of+the+Eye)




 I was happy to open [Villainous Wealth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Villainous+Wealth) as my clan promo, as it is the Sultai card I was most excited to play with. The card, which I have taken to calling Nemesis Wave, is just backbreaking when cast for nine mana—as it should let you cast just about anything in an opponent's deck in this format—but getting to nine mana is not an easy feat in Limited *Magic*, much less in a format where the Mardu banner was getting signed on the back in order to accommodate everyone who was winning. I had been hoping for a [Death Frenzy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Death+Frenzy) in my pool, but there was plenty of removal and I began assembling a Sultai deck that had some decent creatures and a fair amount of removal.

[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Death Frenzy)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Death Frenzy)




 Another card I was eager to try was [Retribution of the Ancients](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Retribution+of+the+Ancients), which seemed like it could do a good job of pinning down an aggressive deck. I even had a sweet little combo against all the 1/1 tokens the Mardu decks were spitting out with [Swarm of Bloodflies](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swarm+of+Bloodflies), which could let you just pay B to kill any 1-toughness creature and replenish the counter on the Bloodflies. The only problem was that I did not have enough in the way of outlast creatures to be able to turn it on reliably. I started looking at my white and, before I knew it, I was putting most of my blue cards to the side and playing around with a four-color Abzan build.




 White offered me one more outlast creature, access to two of my Abzan-colored rares—including [Anafenza, the Foremost](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Anafenza%2C+the+Foremost), which interacted well with [Retribution of the Ancients](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Retribution+of+the+Ancients)—and upped my removal count into double digits. Was I really going to abandon the Sultai for a few packs of the new set?




 Of course I was. Here is the deck I played. I had enough mana fixing that I was able to support two Sultai cards without even playing an Island. The plan was to kill everything and then mop up with whatever my opponent had left courtesy of [Villainous Wealth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Villainous+Wealth). I am happy to report that [Retribution of the Ancients](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Retribution+of+the+Ancients) was actually amazing for me against multiple Mardu opponents, even with only a handful of ways to turn it on.

 My first opponent was Mardu, and I managed to keep him at bay by working a pair of outlast creatures and [Retribution of the Ancients](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Retribution+of+the+Ancients) on his small hordeling army, and having a full quiver of hard removal for his bigger threats. As it turned out, all of my opponents were Mardu, and I only lost to the one player who cast [End Hostilities](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=End+Hostilities) against me in Game 3. I had been working the Retribution/outlast combo against him and he was able to take me from 20 to 0 in a couple of turns thanks to [Mardu Ascendancy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mardu+Ascendancy) swelling his ranks every turn. Had I ripped a [Swarm of Bloodflies](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swarm+of+Bloodflies) I might have been able to survive long enough to find my Nemesis Wave.

[Villainous Wealth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Villainous+Wealth) was amazing for me. Most times, my opponent just scooped up their cards, but my third-round opponent let me resolve it for five and I got to steal one of his TWO [Zurgo Helmsmasher](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Zurgo+Helmsmasher)s. I might have been hiding behind [Siege Rhino](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Siege+Rhino) and Anafenza, but [Villainous Wealth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Villainous+Wealth) and my abundant black removal propelled me to my 3–1 record, and I happily signed the Sultai banner.




 I was sitting next to Sheldon "Temur" Menery throughout the tournament, and naturally the topic of Commander came up often, as we discussed the cards we were playing with and against. I have been talking for a long time about building a Sultai deck that lets me play with my favorite strategy—putting cards into my own graveyard—and I set about trading for a [Sidisi, Blood Tyrant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sidisi%2C+Blood+Tyrant) to hang out in the command zone with 99 other cards. The only problem I have with building the deck—which just wants to kill people with [Beastmaster Ascension](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Beastmaster+Ascension) and [Spider Spawning](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spider+Spawning)—is getting it down to the mandatory size. Just look at a few of the cards sitting in front of me. I have to cut more than 150 cards from my playable box.




 And before you even say the words "[Bojuka Bog](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bojuka+Bog)" to me, I am packing [Deadeye Navigator](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deadeye+Navigator) solely so I can undo the damage of a Bog paired with a [Riftsweeper](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Riftsweeper). I almost want to get Bogged just so I can cross that off my lengthy imaginary achievement card. Pairing it with Sidisi might also be on that achievement list...





 At this point, my [Momir Vig, Simic Visionary](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Momir+Vig%2C+Simic+Visionary) deck is pretty well tuned, but I always try to add some new cards and swap a couple out with each set. Right now, the only creature card I know I am putting in is [Icefeather Aven](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Icefeather+Aven), but that card, and the new morph enchantments—[Trail of Mystery](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Trail+of+Mystery) and [Secret Plans](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Secret+Plans)—have me wanting to push the deck in a more morph-y direction overall. Maybe even bring [Fathom Seer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fathom+Seer) back into the fold. I will wait and see what the next set brings before making that change. I am also going to try out [See the Unwritten](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=See+the+Unwritten), but that could quite easily become [Secret Plans](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Secret+Plans) with a few more morphs finding their way into the list between now and then.



In the meanwhile, I have had people asking for an updated list for my Momir Vig, so here is what I will be bringing to Hawaii for late-night Commander games.
