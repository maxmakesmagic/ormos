 Mike Rosenberg is a writer and gamer and has been part of the Magic text coverage team since 2011. He joined Wizards as organized play’s content specialist in June 2014. 






We've got only two weekends remaining of live video coverage in 2017, with live video coming from [Grand Prix Oklahoma City](https://magic.wizards.com/en/events/premierplay/grandprix/fact-sheet-gpokc17) this weekend, and then [Grand Prix New Jersey](http://gpnj2017.com/) the next. After that, the next time you'll be hearing from me and the rest of the coverage team is in 2018, as DailyMTG goes on its holiday hiatus.


That said, we do have some news before then. My boss Greg Collins will be checking in on December 12 to give you a look at how 2017 went in terms of [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/magic), and what you'll have to look forward to (*i.e.*, what all we're covering) in 2018. Hint: it's a lot, just like this year!


But before we get to that, a look at the remaining two weekends of GPs.


Oklahoma City and Madrid
========================


This weekend features a little twist on a weekend of Modern. While Oklahoma City will feature Modern Constructed as a main event, Madrid will be Europe's chance to participate in the Team Unified Modern format that folks from North America got to play at [GP San Antonio](https://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/gpsa17) earlier this year.


Here's the coverage team for the weekend.


**December 8–10**: Grand Prix Madrid and Oklahoma City  
**Live Video from**: Oklahoma City ([twitch.tv/magic](https://www.twitch.tv/magic))  
**Start Times**: Saturday and Sunday at 7 a.m. PT/10 a.m. ET/3 p.m. UTC  
**Video Producer**: Rich Hagon  
**Video Director**: Rashad Miller  
**Camera and Graphics**: BJ Ogden  
**Play-by-Play Commentator**: Marshall Sutcliffe  
**Color Commentator**: Jake Van Lunen  
**Swing Commentator**: Ben Seck  
**Writer-Reporter**: Tobi Henke (Madrid), Corbin Hosler (Oklahoma City)


Tobi Henke holds down the fort for Madrid's Team Unified Modern action, while the video crew—including coverage newcomer Ben Seck—brings you live video featuring all of Modern's action.


Singapore and New Jersey
========================


The 2017 Grand Prix circuit wraps up the weekend of December 15–17, as GP main events in Singapore and New Jersey look at *Ixalan* Limited one last time before we head into the new year and the coming release of *Rivals of Ixalan*.


**December 15–17**: Grand Prix Singapore and New Jersey  
**Live Video from**: New Jersey ([twitch.tv/magic](https://www.twitch.tv/magic))  
**Start Times**: Saturday, December 16 at 7 a.m. PT/10 a.m. ET/3 p.m. UTC; and Sunday, December 17 at 6:30 a.m. PT/9:30 a.m. ET/2:30 p.m. UTC  
**Play-by-Play Commentator**:Brian David-Marshall  
**Color Commentator**:William Jensen  
**Swing Commentator**:Marshall Sutcliffe  
**Writer-Reporter**: Chapman Sim (Singapore), Marc Calderaro (New Jersey)  
**Video Production by**: ChannelFireball


ChannelFireball will wrap up [twitch.tv/magic](https://www.twitch.tv/magic) Grand Prix video coverage for the year, with live video from Grand Prix New Jersey bringing you two days of *Ixalan* Limited.


It's been a great year of coverage, and I'm excited for what 2018 is set to bring!
