Wizards of the Coast is excited to announce that Sean "Day[9]" Plott will be participating in Pro Tour *Dragon's Maze* on May 17-19.


A world-famous gamer and shoutcaster with one of the most passionate audiences on the Internet, Plott made his premier-play debut at [Grand Prix San Jose](/en/events/coverage/sperling-williams-and-rietzl-win-san-jose) in 2012. Plott has been awarded a Special Invitation, given at Wizards of the Coast's discretion to members of the **Magic** community for representing the game in a positive manner. 


"It's a great honor to be participating in the Pro Tour," Plott said. "I've spent many a weekend watching coverage via Twitch and I can't wait to see what it's like on the other side of the camera! I've played games competitively my whole life and I love the thrill of stepping into the arena to battle."


Other Special Invitations have been extended to David Williams (United States), Troy Thompson (United States), and Christopher Passow (Germany). Special Invitations do not include airfare to the Pro Tour. 


Wizards of the Coast is awarding Sponsor's Exemption invitations and airfare to Daniel Unwin (Australia), Matthew Tickal (United States), Caleb Durward (United States), Dean McLaren (Canada), and Josh McClain (United States). *(Editor's note: McClain's name was added to this announcement after initial publication. He was mistakenly overlooked due to a data issue compiling results across in-person and **Magic Online**  PTQs.)* Sponsor's Exemptions are awarded to players who showed excellence in play during the qualifying season but did not earn an invitation through other means. This consideration includes quantity and quality of finishes at Grand Prix, Pro Tour Qualifiers (including **Magic Online** PTQs), and **Magic Online**  Championship Series Finals during the qualifying season, and results from [Pro Tour  *Gatecrash*](/en/events/coverage/martell-calls-down-reckoning-pro-tour). 


At the conclusion of future qualifying seasons, Wizards of the Coast will examine the list of uninvited players and award Special Invitations and Sponsor's Exemption invitations at its sole discretion. The maximum number of Sponsor's Exemption invitations given to a particular Pro Tour is five.


For more information on the players earning Special Invitations and Sponsor's Exemptions, check out Brian David-Marshall's column ["The Week That Was"](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/twtw/241) on Friday, April 5.
