“What card are you most hoping to open at the Dragons of Tarkir prerelease? Why?”


**(17) Will Edel**


“Dragonlord Kolaghan. I first got on the Pro Tour around Onslaught and I always loved playing with [Rorix Bladewing](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rorix+Bladewing). This is an easier to cast version of the card with a lot of upside.”

**Gerard Fabiano**


“Dragonlord Silumgar. It doesn’t matter how good the opponent’s rares are if I can just steal them. This is always a bomb and it also steals my opponent’s bomb.”

**(1)Owen Turtenwald**


“Sarkhan Unbroken seems like a very reasonable card.”

**Josh Mcclain**


“Narset Transcendent seems like it would be a lot of fun to play with. I’m not sure it’s the greatest Limited card, but I’m looking to have some fun at my prerelease.”

**[10] Sam Black**
