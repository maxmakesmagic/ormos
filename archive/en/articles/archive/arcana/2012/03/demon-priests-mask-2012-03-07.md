Let's say you're wondering how to dress like a priest devoted to a demon on Innistrad. It doesn't matter why. It's probably for an upcoming convention or something. So here's [Skirsdag Flayer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skirsdag+Flayer) from *Dark Ascension*.

See that thing on the flayer's face? It turns out it's kind of a common thing on Innistrad. Check out [Disciple of Griselbrand](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Disciple+of+Griselbrand) from the *Innistrad* set.

By now, you're probably wondering what that face-thing looks like from the back. Right? Of course you are! And conveniently enough, that's *also* been shown. Specifically, it's on the alternate-art [Ravenous Demon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ravenous+Demon) that was [given out for *Dark Ascension* Prereleases](/en/articles/archive/alternate-art-2012-01-24)! As the demon prepares to consume its servant (and transform into [Archdemon of Greed](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Archdemon+of+Greed)), the back of the priest's head is clearly visible. Just before it gets bitten off, probably.
