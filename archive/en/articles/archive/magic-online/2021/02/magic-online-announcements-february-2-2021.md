*Kaldheim* Season Alternative Play Calendar
-------------------------------------------


For *Kaldheim* season's alternative play, we have quite the variety for you. Please note that events change over from one week to the next on Wednesday mornings and last for one week unless specified otherwise.


* **February 10: David McDarby's *Live the Dream* Spotlight Cube returns**. New set, new dreams. Don't let them be memes.
* **February 17: *Modern Horizons* Encore**. The set everyone loves, and back for one week only. This is an Encore Draft, not a Flashback, which means you'll keep the cards you draft!
* **February 24: *Ultimate Masters* Flashback**. One of the most underplayed yet incredibly fun Draft environments returns for a week.
* **March 3: *Vintage Cube***. We've got a three-week run of this classic experience from March 3 until March 24. March is a little unusual for this cube, but[nbsp] . . .[/nbsp] well, we live in unusual times. Life's too short not to have a little more *Vintage Cube*.
* **March 24: *Time Spiral Remastered* Supreme Draft**. *Time Spiral Remastered* comes out on March 19, but before everyone has mastered this remaster, let's draft some truly absurd decks.
* **March 31: A new Spotlight Cube**. As usual, we'll have more to share when we get closer.
* **April 7: Another new Spotlight Cube**. Again, details will come as the event approaches.
