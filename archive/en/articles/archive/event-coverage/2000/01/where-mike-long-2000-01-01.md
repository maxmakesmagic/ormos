Where is Mike Long?

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/USNAT00/images/R7MaherLong.JPG)*Mike Long at last year's National Championship*Historically, US Nationals has been Mike Long's tournament. He's made the Top 8 on four separate occasions, made the team three times, and all three of those teams went on to win the Worlds team title. To put this in perspective, Finkel has three Top 8's and no one else has more than two. US Nationals is also where Long rattled off eleven straight wins before being found (caught?) with a Cadaverous Bloom in his lap during the twelfth round. He received a match loss and Matt Linde later received the biggest ovation I have ever heard for defeating Long in the finals. Whether you love to hate him or just love to watch to see what he's going to do next, there's no doubt that Mike Long has been the center of attention at US Nationals.


But he's not here this weekend. Sideboard writer Gary Wise planned to talk about him in his Nationals preview, assuming that Long would be one of the favorites, but Long didn't even *qualify* for this event.


Long's amazing career might actually be over and the slide began last year at Nationals. This time last year, Long seemed to be on top of his game. The introduction of the Masters Series had reinvigorated him and he returned to the Pro Tour after 6-month hiatus. He put up a Top 8 at Pro Tour Los Angeles (his fourth Pro Tour Top 8) and he got invited to the $25,000 US Draft Challenge that was filmed the same weekend at US Nationals. He brought a bunch of kids from his new store down to Orlando to compete in the JSS, drafted a spectacular deck in the Draft Challenge, and beat Zvi Mowshowitz in the last round of the Swiss to advance to the Top 8 of Nationals itself. Saturday night he sat down to play Trevor Blackwell in the semifinals of the Draft Challenge with dreams of a $35,000 weekend sweep dancing in his head.


That's when everything came crashing down. A deck-check before his match with Blackwell resulted in Long being disqualified without prizes from the event for insufficiently randomizing his deck. Not only was Long not going to get to play in the finals on camera on Sunday, but he didn't even get to collect the two grand that he had already won. Worse still, Long had to once again face the public and the persecution that has followed him every time he gets accused of cheating. And all this while the kids from his store watched.


On Sunday, Long did still have a Top 8 to play. However, his mind just didn't seem to be into it and he got beaten twice. He failed to make the team for the first time in four trips to the Top 8 and he failed to win even a single dollar of prize money.


The ensuing DCI investigation into the Draft Challenge situation resulted in a one-month suspension for Long - the first suspension of his notorious career. Long received another slap in the face when he failed to qualify for the New York Masters - the first PT-level event he wasn't qualified for, ever. Shortly thereafter he was passed by Kyle Rose for second on the all-time money list. Long is currently down to fifth on that list.


Since coming back from his suspension, Long just hasn't had his "A-game." He's actually fallen off the "gravy train" and he only got to PT Barcelona thanks to his high Limited rating. After an 0-4, drop performance there, his rating was gone and he found himself unqualified for Nationals.


I'm not sure he would have played even if he had been Q'd. Quite simply, the fire has gone out. Long's ferocious, intense desire to win left him some time over the last year and he just isn't the same without it.


I don't know if we've seen the last of Mike Long, but I think we've seen the last of him for a while. I think Mike's going to take a break from competitive play, concentrate on his store and his fianc√©, and maybe someday he'll come to terms with himself and with professional Magic and he'll give it another go. That day is not today.


He's the most controversial player the game has ever know and he's also one of the most talented players to ever pick up a deck, but this weekend US Nationals is going on without him.
