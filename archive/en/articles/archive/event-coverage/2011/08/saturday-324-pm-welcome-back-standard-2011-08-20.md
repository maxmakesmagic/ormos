Use [Preordain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Preordain), [Lightning Bolt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt) talking about Cawblade and mono-red.


Six rounds of draft have seriously changed the standings, but from here on in it's Standard all the way. We enlisted the help of Rob Wagner to track down the top twenty players as we headed back to Standard, and take a look at the sixty cards they'll be using to try to secure a top 8 slot.

Stay tuned for more Standard news as we close in on the top 8.
