What does a Pro Tour Hall of Fame member play for? It's a question that's answered in many ways. For Jon Finkel, one of the game's all time greats, it's about continuing to rise to the challenge. The first Hall of Fame member to win a Pro Tour after being inducted, his consistency in the years that followed demonstrate just how talented he is. For years, past and present, he's been a dominant force on the Pro Tour.



 Of course, even he faces challenges that are a tall order: To maintain his Platinum status in the Pro Players club he'd have to win it all at Pro Tour *Magic* 2015. With enough Pro Tours under his belt it was an entirely plausible circumstance.




 For Melissa DeTora, she had been relatively quiet since her breakthrough Top 8 at Pro Tour *Gatecrash*. For her, a Top 100 this weekend would earn her Silver status for next season though Top 25 is her goal. "If I get Top 25 I'll be invited to two Pro Tours next year," she said, sagely looking to maximize her ability to earn Pro Points next season.






*Everybody was playing for something this weekend.*
