**Patron of the Orochi**, as [previewed on Saturday](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/daily/jc23) by John Carter, is a hulking 7/7 kami representing the spirit of the snakefolk race.

 As you can see in the art detail below, Christopher Moeller painted orochi faces and bodies right into the structure of the Patron's body -- a cool and somewhat creepy depiction of the relationship of the race to the legendary spirit.

The illustrations of the other Patrons, as you'll see when *Betrayers* releases, have this same feature. Check out the [wallpaper](/en/articles/archive/wallpaper-week-patron-akki-2005-01-14) of Patron of the Akki for a nice closeup of the bony-shouldered akki integrated into the red Patron's back.
