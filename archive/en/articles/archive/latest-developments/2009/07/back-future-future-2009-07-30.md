Tom LaPille makes things. Some of the things he makes are card sets, like Dark Ascension and Born of the Gods. Sometimes he makes stories, too. Sometimes he makes unexpected things, like 16th-century Japanese clothing. He's probably making something right now.

Everyone in **Magic** Ramp;D loves to play **Magic**, and we have the privilege of playing our game every day as part of our jobs. We often do this as part of the Future Future League, which is the format that we use to test Standard internally. The Future Future League contains all the sets that will be in real-world Standard on the release of the set that is currently in development. This means that at any given time it is many months ahead of the real world.

I was very active in the Future Future League while ***Magic** 2010* was in development. Although I was on the set's development team, I was still an intern at the time. That meant that a great deal of my job was playing Future Future League games. It was a dizzying time. Not only was I on my first development team, but I was also churning through many decks every week to make sure that the Standard environment we were creating was fun. Today's article will talk about some stories from that time.
