Mowshowitz has four Pro Tour Top 8s of his own, including one of the most decisive wins ever in Tokyo 2001, and nine Grand Prix Top 8s, including two wins.

**The Games**



Mowshowitz remarked on Damo da Rosa's deck choice while the players waited to start playing. "I thought about playing your deck, but I'm too old to learn how it works," he said.


Mowshowitz's [Precinct Captain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Precinct+Captain) was the first play of the game, but Damo da Rosa had [Detention Sphere](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Detention+Sphere) to keep the board clear. [Brimaz, King of Oreskos](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brimaz%2C+King+of+Oreskos) was next, but [Supreme Verdict](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Supreme+Verdict) sent the legendary cat to the graveyard right away. [Precinct Captain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Precinct+Captain) and [Pack Rat](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pack+Rat) came down in tandem, but Damo da Rosa had yet another [Supreme Verdict](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Supreme+Verdict).


[Precinct Captain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Precinct+Captain) and [Ajani, Caller of the Pride](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ajani%2C+Caller+of+the+Pride) came down and managed to survive the following turn. Ajani ticked up and Mowshowitz continued playing creatures, but [Azorius Charm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Azorius+Charm) stemmed the bleeding and the third copy of [Supreme Verdict](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Supreme+Verdict) once again cleaned up the board. Damo da Rosa cast [Jace, Architect of Thought](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace%2C+Architect+of+Thought), used the -2 ability and revealed the 4th [Supreme Verdict](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Supreme+Verdict), [Detention Sphere](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Detention+Sphere), and Elspeth, Sun's Champion. Mowshowitz split the Elspeth and the other two. Damo da Rosa took [Detention Sphere](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Detention+Sphere) and [Supreme Verdict](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Supreme+Verdict). Mowshowitz's [Mutavault](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mutavault) had been silently growing and it attacked Jace as a 4/4. [Detention Sphere](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Detention+Sphere) finally dealt with [Ajani, Caller of the Pride](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ajani%2C+Caller+of+the+Pride), but the [Mutavault](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mutavault) on Mowshowitz's side of the table continued to apply pressure.


Mowshowitz laughed, "five turns to draw an out!"

*Zvi Mowshowitz's aggressive white-black deck had the ability to disrupt his opponent's game plan, but it wasn't going to be easy.*

[Pack Rat](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pack+Rat) stuck on Mowshowitz's side of the table and Damo da Rosa was forced to use his fourth copy of [Supreme Verdict](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Supreme+Verdict). The 4/4 [Mutavault](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mutavault) continued to get into the red zone, but was dealt with via [Azorius Charm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Azorius+Charm) on the following turn as [Syncopate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Syncopate) kept [Desecration Demon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Desecration+Demon) off the table. Both players were running low on gas, but Damo da Rosa found [Sphinx's Revelation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sphinx%27s+Revelation) and established a big lead. Elspeth, Sun's Champion came down and Mowshowitz was forced to use both [Bile Blight](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bile+Blight) and Hero's Downfall to deal with the activation and planeswalker. Mowshowitz continued attacking with [Mutavault](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mutavault) and tried to resolve [Obzedat, Ghost Council](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Obzedat%2C+Ghost+Council), but Damo da Rosa had the obligatory counterspell. Mowshowitz's [Precinct Captain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Precinct+Captain) resolved, but Damo da Rosa had another [Sphinx's Revelation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sphinx%27s+Revelation) and drew six extra cards. [Ætherling](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=%C3%86therling) came down for Damo da Rosa. Mowshowitz cast [Thoughtseize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtseize) the following turn and, upon seeing Damo da Rosa's fist of relevant cards, he chose to concede and move on to a second game.



**Damo da Rosa 1 – Mowshowitz 0** 


Both players kept their hands in the second game. Mowshowitz led off with a turn one [Thoughtseize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtseize), plucking [Azorius Charm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Azorius+Charm) out of Damo da Rosa's stacked hand. Mowshowitz followed the [Thoughtseize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtseize) up with [Precinct Captain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Precinct+Captain). [Precinct Captain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Precinct+Captain) got in for damage and got his owner a Soldier. [Duress](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress) took [Supreme Verdict](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Supreme+Verdict) and [Soldier of the Pantheon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soldier+of+the+Pantheon) came down to continue applying pressure. Damo da Rosa cast one of the two copies of [Jace, Architect of Thought](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace%2C+Architect+of+Thought) in his hand and used the +1 ability, but Mowshowitz capitalized by using the opportunity to resolve [Obzedat, Ghost Council](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Obzedat%2C+Ghost+Council).


Damo da Rosa continued to +1 his Jace and Mowshowitz resolved [Desecration Demon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Desecration+Demon). [Sphinx's Revelation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sphinx%27s+Revelation) for two gave Damo da Rosa the sixth land he needed to cast Elspeth, Sun's Champion, giving him plenty of bodies to hold Mowshowitz's army at bay.


![](https://media.wizards.com/2014/events/ptm15/r8_pv.jpg)
*Damo da Rosa's White-Blue deck gives him plenty of cards and plenty of leverage.*

Elspeth and Jace continued to tick up, but Obzedat continued flickering and the race came down to the wire. Damo da Rosa only had two life remaining, but [Elixir of Immortality](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elixir+of+Immortality) or [Sphinx's Revelation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sphinx%27s+Revelation) could easily give him enough time to survive and get to the point where he could ultimate both planewalkers.



Damo da Rosa held his head with his left hand while fanning his cards in the right. Staring, "I'm not dead yet."


Mowshowitz snapped back with a smile, "Of course not, you have Jace. I was at least hoping you would have to dig."


"You're at 24?" asked Damo da Rosa.


"I believe so. I hope I didn't miscount." Mowshowitz laughed.


Then things got interesting; Damo da Rosa used the ultimate on Elspeth, Sun's Champion, ticked [Jace, Architect of Thought](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace%2C+Architect+of+Thought) up to eight, and attacked for seven with a single soldier and [Mutavault](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mutavault).


"What could you possibly have where attacking with exactly those two creatures is your play? I know you're too good to attack with the wrong number of creatures."


Mowshowitz sent a bunch of creatures at Jace and a pair of 3/3 soldiers hopped in front of [Obzedat, Ghost Council](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Obzedat%2C+Ghost+Council), giving Damo da Rosa a tremendous advantage. ticked down and found more gas, but it was soon replaced by another copy which ticked up to invalidate the army of 1/1s of Mowshowitz's side of the table. [Ajani, Caller of the Pride](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ajani%2C+Caller+of+the+Pride) came down for Mowshowitz soon after, but Damo da Rosa cast [Sphinx's Revelation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sphinx%27s+Revelation) for six, effectively closing the door on any possibility that Mowshowitz could ever get back into the game. [Ætherling](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=%C3%86therling) came next and the writing was on the wall. One more attack was all it took.


With this win, Damo da Rosa puts himself in excellent position to make a deep run in the second day of competition. Could this be the return of one of the game's greatest players? Stay tuned to continuing coverage of Pro Tour *Magic 2015* to find out!
