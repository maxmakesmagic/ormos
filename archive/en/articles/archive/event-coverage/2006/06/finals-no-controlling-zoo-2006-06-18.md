The Japanese knew going into this match that Willy Edel's Zoo deck was going to be tough to handle. Shota Yasooka has played like a champ thus far in the tournament, but few decks have tested his control deck in such an aggressive fashion. ![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/ptcha06/f_edel.jpg)*Despite the sour look, Edel was happy to roll over Yasooka in Game 1.*


### Game 1


Game 1 was utter annihilation on the part of the Brazilian. He started things off with a [Selesnya Guildmage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Selesnya+Guildmage), and then followed that with two [Birds of Paradise](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Birds+of+Paradise) and a bounce land. [Watchwolf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Watchwolf) hit the table a turn later, and then [Grand Arbiter Augustin IV](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grand+Arbiter+Augustin+IV) ate a [Lightning Helix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Helix) right to his officious face. [Rumbling Slum](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rumbling+Slum) followed that and Yasooka was dead practically before anyone noticed.


Edel 1, Yasooka 0


### Game 2


Game 2 was a much different affair. Yasooka was on the play this time, giving him a chance to stay ahead of the curve by using [Remand](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Remand)s to stave off the beats. Edel had to take a mulligan as well, keeping a hand of lands and spells, but not a whole lot of gas.


While Yasooka was resolving [Court Hussar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Court+Hussar), it gave Edel a chance to slip [Sunforger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sunforger) onto the table. He attached the equipment to his Bird a turn later and started to attack, turning the bird into a formidable flying clock and a reusable tutor as well. Yasooka killed the Bird with [Mortify](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mortify) a turn later, using a [Remand](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Remand) on Edel's [Bathe in Light](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bathe+in+Light). Edel just shrugged and cast another Birds.


The next play was perhaps the difference in this game. Instead of Yasooka using [Faith's Fetters](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Faith%27s+Fetters) on Edel's [Sunforger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sunforger), he used it on his [Birds of Paradise](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Birds+of+Paradise), thus leaving the Forger around to generate tutor-rific card advantage every single turn.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/ptcha06/f_yasooka.jpg)*Yasooka was on the losing end of serious burn.*
[Selesnya Guildmage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Selesnya+Guildmage) from Edel met a [Remand](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Remand), but that left the door open for [Loxodon Hierarch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Loxodon+Hierarch) to resolve. That was fine by Yasooka, since it just gave him a juicy target on the next turn for his [Angel of Despair](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Angel+of+Despair). Edel had a [Demonfire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Demonfire) in hand at this point and waited perhaps too long to use it on the Angel - he had a chance to make sure it left play when Yasooka was tapped out, but used it instead a turn later when he was sitting at a scant 5 life.


Another Angel kept the pressure on the Brazilian, killing a karoo, but Edel used a forged [Lightning Helix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Helix) targeting Yasooka's head to stay alive, absorbing the Angel attack and going to 3. He then attacked Yasooka down to 3, and conversed with teammate Paulo Vitor for a moment about what they should tutor for.


[Char](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Char) was quickly deemed the correct choice, and Yasooka was forced to concede, the [Trial/Error](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Trial%2FError) in his hand that would have stopped a [Lightning Helix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Helix) sadly impotent against the fiery redness of [Char](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Char).


Willy Edel took the match 2-0 and gave Raaala Pumba a one-match advantage in the finals.
