 *Mads Utzon (Green-Black) vs. Aleksa Telarov (Red-White)* 

  

 In the first game, Aleksa Telarov led with [Bronze Sable](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bronze+Sable) and [Cyclops of One-Eyed Pass](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cyclops+of+One-Eyed+Pass) whereas Mads Utzon's somewhat disappointing deck could only come up with its first play on turn five. Still, for a moment, it looked as if [Pheres-Band Centaurs](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pheres-Band+Centaurs), followed by [Nessian Asp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nessian+Asp), would allow Utzon to stabilize. However Telarov's [Purphoros, God of the Forge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Purphoros%2C+God+of+the+Forge), especially in combination with [Wild Celebrants](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Celebrants), proved quite the capable finisher.




 Telarov went off to a slow start for the second game, but his late game of [Cyclops of One-Eyed Pass](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cyclops+of+One-Eyed+Pass) and [Fanatic of Mogis](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fanatic+of+Mogis), with [Hopeful Eidolon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hopeful+Eidolon) for good measure, was enough to beat Utzon's mana flood.



**Mads Utzon 2-0 Aleksa Telarov**
  

  
 *Denniz Rachid (Red-Green) vs. (1) Jérémy Dezani (Green-Black)* 

  

 Although (1) Jérémy Dezani was forced to work with creatures like [Felhide Brawler](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Felhide+Brawler) and [Fleshmad Steed](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fleshmad+Steed) to get there, he was able to win the first game. Denniz Rachid was slightly flooded, then had his [Nylea's Disciple](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nylea%27s+Disciple) and [Ordeal of Purphoros](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ordeal+of+Purphoros) destroyed by [Sip of Hemlock](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sip+of+Hemlock), and finally succumbed to lots of 2/2s courtesy of [Raised by Wolves](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Raised+by+Wolves).




 The second game then really showcased the power of Rachid's deck: [Deathbellow Raider](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deathbellow+Raider) on turn two, [Bow of Nylea](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bow+of+Nylea) on turn three, [Ordeal of Purphoros](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ordeal+of+Purphoros) on turn four, activate Bow for a second +1/+1 counter. Next turn, Rachid's Ordeal killed Dezani's [Pheres-Band Tromper](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pheres-Band+Tromper) and [Bow of Nylea](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bow+of+Nylea) killed [Blood-Toll Harpy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood-Toll+Harpy) ... They quickly moved to game three.




 Unfortunately, this was extremely anticlimactic. After a mulligan, Rachid was stuck on two Forests and saw his [Voyaging Satyr](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Voyaging+Satyr) killed by Dezani's [Pharika's Cure](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pharika%27s+Cure). He only drew his third land, another Forest which didn't even help, when Dezani had already cast [Keepsake Gorgon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Keepsake+Gorgon). He never stood a chance.



**Denniz Rachid 1-2 (1) Jérémy Dezani**
  

  
 *Robert Jurkovic (Blue-Green) vs. Alexey Antonenko (Blue-Black)* 

  

 Robert Jurkovic led in the damage race early on, with among other things a constantly growing [Pheres-Band Tromper](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pheres-Band+Tromper), but then the Sirens went off for Alexey Antonenko: [Shipwreck Singer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shipwreck+Singer), [Siren of the Silent Song](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Siren+of+the+Silent+Song), and [Siren of the Fanged Coast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Siren+of+the+Fanged+Coast) threatened to take over the game, but in the end it was Jurkovic's [Meletis Astronomer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Meletis+Astronomer) which, triggered four times over the course of the game, provided enough material to overwhelm the opposition.




 In game two, Antonenko again assembled a few early fliers, while his [Sealock Monster](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sealock+Monster) held the fort against Jurkovic's ground creatures. At a crucial point, he also had [Nullify](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nullify) for an otherwise neck-breaking [Nylea's Emissary](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nylea%27s+Emissary), and when his [Sealock Monster](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sealock+Monster) turned monstrous, Jurkovic lost in short order.




 In the all-deciding third game, Antonenko had [Asphyxiate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Asphyxiate) for [Prophet of Kruphix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Prophet+of+Kruphix) but sadly no fifth land to cast the [Nullify](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nullify) in his hand for the [Nessian Wilds Ravager](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nessian+Wilds+Ravager) which followed. The Ravager took out [Returned Phalanx](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Returned+Phalanx), then acquired [Nyxborn Triton](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nyxborn+Triton), and started hitting for 8 a turn. Soon it was time for Antonenko to chump, and his attempts to race with fliers were summarily thwarted by a surprise appearance of [Horizon Chimera](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Horizon+Chimera) and [Triton Tactics](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Triton+Tactics).



**Robert Jurkovic 2-1 Alexey Antonenko**
  

  
 *Aniol Alcaraz (White-Blue) vs. Andreas Lesch (Black-Red)* 

  

 Andreas Lesch went off to an aggressive start into the first game and almost managed to push through lethal damage with the help of [Erebos's Emissary](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Erebos%27s+Emissary). But then Alcaraz stabilized at 3 thanks to [Hundred-Handed One](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hundred-Handed+One). [Fate Unraveler](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fate+Unraveler), with its ability to deal damage and not cause loss of life, died to [Spear of Heliod](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spear+of+Heliod), and that was the win for Alcaraz.




 The second game basically came down to one interesting combat phase: Alcaraz blocked a 3/3 creature with his [Wingsteed Rider](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wingsteed+Rider) carrying [Chosen by Heliod](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chosen+by+Heliod) and blocked [Flamespeaker Adept](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flamespeaker+Adept) with his 6/8 [Hundred-Handed One](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hundred-Handed+One). Lesch had [Magma Jet](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Magma+Jet) for the 3/5 [Wingsteed Rider](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wingsteed+Rider), which gave [Flamespeaker Adept](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flamespeaker+Adept) the necessary boost to take down [Hundred-Handed One](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hundred-Handed+One) via [Fall of the Hammer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fall+of+the+Hammer) and even live to tell the tale. Alcaraz almost recovered, but eventually lost his [Spear of Heliod](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spear+of+Heliod) to Lesch's sideboarded [Demolish](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Demolish) and the game to [Ill-Tempered Cyclops](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ill-Tempered+Cyclops).




 In the third game, Alcaraz's [Battlewise Hoplite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Battlewise+Hoplite) died to [Magma Jet](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Magma+Jet), his [Lagonna-Band Elder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lagonna-Band+Elder) died to [Searing Blood](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Searing+Blood), but his [Phalanx Leader](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phalanx+Leader) survived. More creatures followed as did [Chosen by Heliod](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chosen+by+Heliod) and [Ordeal of Heliod](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ordeal+of+Heliod) for the [Phalanx Leader](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phalanx+Leader). [Spear of Heliod](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spear+of+Heliod) and [Voyage's End](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Voyage%27s+End) sealed the deal.



**Aniol Alcaraz 2-1 Andreas Lesch**
