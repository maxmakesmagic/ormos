The **Magic** card with the longest name is obviously [The Ultimate Nightmare](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=The+Ultimate+Nightmare) of Wizards of the Coast Customer Service, a wacky direct damage spell from *Unglued*, clocking in at a whopping 54 letters.


But what cards claim the title among tournament-legal sets? There are two cards: [Circle of Protection: Artifacts](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Circle+of+Protection%3A+Artifacts), originally from *Antiquities*, and *Legends*' [The Tabernacle at Pendrell Vale](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=The+Tabernacle+at+Pendrell+Vale), both with 27-letter names. Mouthfuls indeed.
