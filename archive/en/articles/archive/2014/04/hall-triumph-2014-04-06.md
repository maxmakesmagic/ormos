What is the one thing heroes needs to check off their last item on their hero's path? A Hall of Triumph!

Oh sorry, that's the normal one. Here's the one you can get at the *Journey into Nyx* Game Day!

I don't know about you, but I just can't feel like a true hero until I have either a statue or am made into a grand mosaic of tile. I mean, can anyone feel like a hero without either of those things?

Oh. Well. I see. All right, well, that's awkward. Let's take a closer look at the promo version of Hall of Triumph, because there's a lot of awesomeness at work in it.

Hall of Triumph (Promo) | Art by [Chuck Lukacs](http://gatherer.wizards.com/pages/search/default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&artist=%5B%22chuck%20lukacs%22%5D)


Not only is there a statue honoring Elspeth, but behind her you can see art from the Hero Cards you've been collecting through the Hero's Path. Will you join the Hall of Triumph?


There are two other "normal" promos at Game Day. The promo Hall of Triumph will be available from your store and is up to the owner as to how they distribute it. I don't think any hero should accept the promo without first completing the final step on the Hero's Path, but that's just my opinion.


Your final three steps on the Hero's Path are fast approaching!


* Hero's Path #7 - The Prerelease is happening April 26-27, 2014.
* Hero's Path #8 - Launch FNM is on May 2, 2014
* Hero's Path #9 - Game Day is on May 24-25, 2014
