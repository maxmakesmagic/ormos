*Magic 2015* is a Core Set, meaning that the cards aren't as complicated as Expert Sets such as *Theros*, *Born of the Gods* or Journey Into Nyx. Nonetheless, new players may struggle with certain interactions and I'm here with Level 5 Judge Riccardo Tessitori to discuss some of the interesting things you can (or can't) do with cards from the latest Core Set to hit the shelves!

[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Turn to Frog)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Turn to Frog)


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Borderland Marauder)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Borderland Marauder)


[Turn to Frog](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Turn+to+Frog) is one of the few cards in *Magic 2015 Core Set* to feature updated wording. For simplicity, the term "base power and toughness" was introduced. What this means is that if you attack with [Borderland Marauder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Borderland+Marauder) and your opponent tries to turn it into a frog, it becomes a 3/1 frog (a 1/1 Frog with +2/+0).




[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Polymorphist's Jest)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Polymorphist's Jest)


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Soul of Theros)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soul of Theros)


Similarly, [Polymorphist's Jest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Polymorphist%27s+Jest) merely alters the base power and toughness and if I pump my creatures with [Soul of Theros](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soul+of+Theros), they will all become 3/3 Frogs with no abilities (1/1 Frogs with a +2/+2 buff).




[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Nissa, Worldwaker)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nissa, Worldwaker)


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Darksteel Citadel)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Darksteel Citadel)


I've always been a fan of Planeswalkers that protect themselves, [Nissa, Worldwaker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nissa%2C+Worldwaker) does a pretty good job as well. Churning out 4/4s turn after turn is a sure way to victory, not forgetting that she pairs very well with the indestructible [Darksteel Citadel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Darksteel+Citadel).




[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Goblin Kaboomist)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin Kaboomist)


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Hammerhand)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hammerhand)


Pretty much any aura granting additional toughness would work well in curbing [Goblin Kaboomist](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Kaboomist)'s suicidal tendencies, allowing you to generate a Land Mine every turn. You'll still need to watch out for flyers though, but at least you don't have to worry about the other creatures as long as you have untapped mountains.




[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Hushwing Gryff)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hushwing Gryff)


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Spirit Bonds)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spirit Bonds)


[Hushwing Gryff](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hushwing+Gryff) shuts down all triggered abilities when a creature enters the battlefield, including its own. Just remember, you will not be able to create Spirit tokens with [Spirit Bonds](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spirit+Bonds) as long as [Hushwing Gryff](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hushwing+Gryff) is on the battlefield. Probably not a good combo at all.


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Generator Servant)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Generator Servant)
Just in case you didn't realize it, [Generator Servant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Generator+Servant) has the potential to give two creatures haste! It sacrifices for two mana and all you need to do is properly declare how you use your mana. If the additional mana is channeled into two separate creatures, you'll be charging into the Red Zone with a pair of angry men.




[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Kinsbaile Skirmisher)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kinsbaile Skirmisher)


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Pillar of Light)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pillar of Light)


Are [Nimbus of the Isles](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nimbus+of+the+Isles), [Indulgent Tormentor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Indulgent+Tormentor) and [Constricting Sliver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Constricting+Sliver) causing you grief? Use Kinsbaile Skirmisher to grant your opponent's creature an extra point of toughness, then exile it with [Pillar of Light](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pillar+of+Light). Not superbly powerful, but you'll thank us when facing a three toughness creature you can't handle.




[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Nightfire Giant)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nightfire Giant)


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Paragon of Open Graves)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Paragon of Open Graves)


While the combo takes roughly a million years to set up, it's absolutely game-winning in a standstill. Giving [Nightfire Giant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nightfire+Giant) deathtouch with [Paragon of Open Graves](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Paragon+of+Open+Graves) makes it a killing machine worthy of Liliana's praise.




[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Rummaging Goblin)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rummaging Goblin)


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Vineweft)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vineweft)


Remember the days of [Whispers of the Muse](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Whispers+of+the+Muse)? Now you get to do that in a Red Green deck, and in Limited! For just 5 mana, you get to return [Vineweft](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vineweft) to your hand, pitching it to [Rummaging Goblin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rummaging+Goblin) for a free card. Not too bad when you're land flooding and need to dig for removal spells and threats!
