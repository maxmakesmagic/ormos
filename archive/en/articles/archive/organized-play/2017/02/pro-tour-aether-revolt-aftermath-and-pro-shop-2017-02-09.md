[Pro Tour *Aether Revolt*](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/ptaer) will go down as one of my favorite events in recent memory. Not only was it the debut of the Pro Tour Team Series—a program that will have a very special place in my heart—but it featured some big names and new faces who had big weekends.


Game Day
========


With the Pro Tour now in the books, players will have a chance to show off what they got at Game Day, a special weekend event at participating game stores all around the world. Game Day is a Standard Constructed event where players who participate have a shot at sweet full-art promos and a champion's playmat.


For *Aether Revolt*, all participants will receive an event-exclusive [Trophy Mage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Trophy+Mage) (while supplies last).

The Top 8 competitors at Game Day receive the incredibly cool [Yahenni's Expertise](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Yahenni%27s+Expertise) full-art promo.

Pro Shop!
=========


I've made a habit of sharing all the really cool stuff that is sold at our Pro Tour merch booth. *Kaladesh* and *Aether Revolt* featured some particularly badass Chandra gear that was sold at the 2016 *Magic* World Championship and both Pro Tours based around the set. I imagine that seeing people walking around with this swag can make a few of you envious. If you weren't able to come to the Pro Tour or didn't know anyone going (or if your friend simply got inundated with requests to pick up swag and you were late to the punch), then you're probably bummed that you'll never be able to own the Pro Tour gear for yourself.


Well, that's no longer true. I'm happy to say that Legion Supplies, the crew that runs the merch booth at our Pro Tours, has officially opened their online web store to bring the Pro Tour merch to *you*!


The [MTG Pro Shop](http://mtgproshop.com/) lets you order the cool non-playmat stuff you see at the Pro Tour's merch booth, such as the Torch of Defiance line of gear.

There is, of course, a whole lot more there than that. I recommend checking out the Pro Shop and seeing what tickles your interests. More items will be coming as they debut at upcoming Pro Tours, so keep your eyes peeled on this column usually two weeks before Pro Tours to get a preview of what will be at the Pro Tour merch booth and what you'll eventually find in the Pro Shop during the big Pro Tour weekend!
