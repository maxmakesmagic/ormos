Two well-known players get the ball rolling here in the feature match area. Shingou Kurihara came to global attention with his top 8 at Pro Tour Geneva in 2007, and also has a Grand Prix title to his name, winning in Bangkok in 2009. His opponent, meanwhile, has half a dozen Grand Prix top 8s, a Pro Tour top 8 from 2010 in San Juan, and a National title from back in 2003.


### Game 1


After Ootsuka began with a mulligan, Kurihara opened with [Ponder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ponder), sending all three cards away before drawing a card. Ootsuka's first turn was a [Mountain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mountain), with no play. [Preordain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Preordain) on turn two continued to send Kurihara to his library, with a [Drowned Catacomb](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Drowned+Catacomb) joining [Darkslick Shores](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Darkslick+Shores). A [Forest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest) led to [Explore](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Explore) for Ootsuka, who laid [Raging Ravine](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Raging+Ravine) as his extra land for the turn.


[Gitaxian Probe](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gitaxian+Probe) from Kurihara revealed three land, [Overgrown Battlement](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Overgrown+Battlement) and Oracle of Mul-Daya in Ootsuka's hand. Kurihara cast [Preordain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Preordain), before a [Mountain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mountain) and [Pyromancer Ascension](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyromancer+Ascension) finally revealed what he was playing. Ootsuka cast the Oracle, laying the [Mountain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mountain) it revealed, and passed.


[Burst Lightning](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Burst+Lightning) dealt with the Oracle, and Kurihara was in good shape, knowing (thanks to the [Gitaxian Probe](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gitaxian+Probe)) that Ootsuka had little to offer in hand. Ootsuka activated his [Raging Ravine](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Raging+Ravine), attacked, and laid a second [Raging Ravine](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Raging+Ravine) to end the turn. If left unchecked, the Ravines were going to do a lot of damage.

On Ootsuka's following turn, [Overgrown Battlement](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Overgrown+Battlement) met [Mana Leak](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak), and a second [Burst Lightning](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Burst+Lightning) from Kurihara at end of turn meant the [Pyromancer Ascension](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyromancer+Ascension) now had two counters. He cast a second [Pyromancer Ascension](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyromancer+Ascension) before passing back to Ootsuka, who was beating down hard with his [Raging Ravine](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Raging+Ravine). In it came again, pushing Kurihara to just three life. Ootsuka cast [Overgrown Battlement](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Overgrown+Battlement), which eventually Kurihara decided to [Mana Leak](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak). Ootsuka clearly did not have [Lightning Bolt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt)!


Kurihara fell to two when he cracked [Scalding Tarn](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scalding+Tarn), which brought him into [Shock](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shock) range, if Ootsuka was playing them (he wasn't). Kurihara untapped, and began with [Visions of Beyond](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Visions+of+Beyond). Whatever the visions he saw they were not to his liking, and the [Raging Ravine](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Raging+Ravine), which was all Ootsuka had meaningfully done all game, had gone all the way.


**Shingou Kurihara 0 - 1 Koutarou Ootsuka**


### Game 2


Ootsuka had taken the lead with almost none of the cards you might have expected from a Valakut deck, so now he would try to take the match in more conventional fashion. Game two began with Kurihara cracking [Scalding Tarn](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scalding+Tarn) and casting one of his many turn one plays, [Gitaxian Probe](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gitaxian+Probe). He saw two [Valakut, the Molten Pinnacle](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Valakut%2C+the+Molten+Pinnacle), [Explore](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Explore), [Thrun, the Last Troll](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thrun%2C+the+Last+Troll), [Overgrown Battlement](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Overgrown+Battlement), [Forest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest), and [Terramorphic Expanse](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Terramorphic+Expanse) in Ootsuka's opening seven. Kurihara continued his turn one with [Preordain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Preordain), which sent him into deep thought. Finally both cards were sent to the bottom, allowing Kurihara to get something random off the top.

Ootsuka had a much less involved turn one, laying Valakut, and within moments we were back to Kurihara. A second [Gitaxian Probe](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gitaxian+Probe) revealed that Ootsuka had drawn [Cultivate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cultivate), and when Ootsuka attempted to cast [Overgrown Battlement](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Overgrown+Battlement) on turn two it found [Mana Leak](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak) waiting. Kurihara cast [Ponder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ponder), and this time left the three cards on top, finishing his turn with [Pyromancer Ascension](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyromancer+Ascension). Ootsuka cast [Explore](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Explore) unopposed, and dropped the second Valakut, and [Terramorphic Expanse](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Terramorphic+Expanse) onto the battlefield.


[Coralhelm Commander](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Coralhelm+Commander) was next for Kurihara, immediately levelling it to two, making it a 3/3 flyer. Three mana from Ootsuka meant [Cultivate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cultivate), and he followed it up with [Rampant Growth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rampant+Growth). He now had three [Mountain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mountain)s in play alongside the threat of double Valakut. [Ponder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ponder) put the first counter on [Pyromancer Ascension](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyromancer+Ascension) for Kurihara. He attacked with [Coralhelm Commander](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Coralhelm+Commander), and cast [Memoricide](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Memoricide), taking [Primeval Titan](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Primeval+Titan)s, one of which was sitting in Ootsuka's hand, ready to cast next turn. That left Ootsuka with [Oracle of Mul Daya](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oracle+of+Mul+Daya), [Thrun, the Last Troll](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thrun%2C+the+Last+Troll), and a [Forest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest) in hand.


The former National Champion drew for the turn, and what a draw it was. [Gaea's Revenge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gaea%27s+Revenge) came off the top, the uncounterable 8/5 with Haste, and that was more than enough to take the game. It turned out that the Valakuts never did anything, but the Valakut player was still off to the perfect start, winning without dropping a game.


**Shingou Kurihara 0 - 2 Koutarou Ootsuka**
