![Boucek and Vefa 9-0 at GP Rimini](https://media.magic.wizards.com/images/featured/rim_d1closing_0.jpg)




Boucek and Vefa 9-0 at GP Rimini
================================




Jaroslav Boucek and Yusuf Kemal Vefa, both playing Bant Company, clinched a perfect 9-0 record on Day 1 of Grand Prix Rimini. Lukas Blohon (U/R Fevered Burn) and Simon Nielsen (G/R Ramp) are close behind at 8-1.
















GRAND PRIX RIMINI 2016
----------------------




* [DAY 1 COVERAGE](#tabs-0)


DAY 1 COVERAGE



After nine rounds of Standard, Day 1 is in the books. Out of the original 889 players, 272 have earned the right to come back tomorrow and compete for the winner's trophy.


We’ve seen all kinds of interesting cards and decks competing today. The biggest stories to come out of Day 1 were the continued dominance of Bant Company and G/R Ramp and the rise of U/R Fevered Burn (alternatively, U/R Alchemist, U/R Thermo-Thing, or however you like to call it). Several visionaries actually foresaw that and adding tech like Peace of Mind or Orbs of Warding to their decks.


Leading the field overnight with perfect records of 9-0 are two players: Jaroslav Boucek and Yusuf Kemal Vefa, both on Bant Company. Hot on their heels are five players with technically undefeated 8-0-1 records: Thomas Holzinger, Fabio La Martina, Mathias De Momi, and William Pizzi. But the competition isn’t far behind and includes Pro Tour Eldritch Moon champion Lukas Blohon (U/R Alchemist), the Danish trio of Simon Nielsen, Tina Dahl, and Martin Dang (all on the same R/G Ramp deck), and plenty of other top players at 8-1 records.
