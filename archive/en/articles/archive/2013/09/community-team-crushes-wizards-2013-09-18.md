Community Team Crushes Wizards!
===============================

The Community Team took an early lead, and never looked back at the 2013 **Magic Online** Community Cup – ultimately crushing the Wizards Team 233-201.


Going into the 2013 **Magic Online** Community Cup, the hopes of the entire **Magic** community rest in the hands of eight talented players: Reid Duke, Melissa DeTora, Michael Jacob, Matthew Watkins, Tom Delia, Kenji Egashira, Jan van der Vegt, and Keya Saleh. Standing in their way was the powerhouse Wizards team made up of Aaron Forsythe, Mike Turian, Dave Humpherys, [Wort](javascript:void())h Wollpert, Alexis Janson, Sam Stoddard, Ryan Spain, Sean Gibbons, and Brian Clinton. The teams battled across *Modern Masters* Draft, Wacky Draft, "Ironroot Chef" Constructed, and Cube Draft to determine the 2013 winner of the Erik "Hamtastic" Friborg Memorial trophy.


The 2013 Community Team did the **Magic Online** Community proud, earning not only bragging rights, but also granting every **Magic Online** player who logged in between Friday, August 30, at 10 a.m. PDT and Saturday, August 31, at 7 p.m. PDT, during the Community Cup a premium foil [Sliver Queen](javascript:void()) promo and a [Rakdos Cackler](javascript:void()) FNM promo.
