The December 5, 2016 Update

The Daily *Magic* Update is a roundup of everything *Magic* you should know on December 5, 2016. Today's Update is brought to you by Panharmonicombo. In a Grand Prix Top 8. Played by one of the best players in the world. Who was undefeated through twelve rounds.


I apologize in advance for how many times I'm going to bring that up.


What You Might Have Missed This Weekend
=======================================


1. [Top 5 Moments of Grand Prix Denver 2016](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/gpden16/top-5-moments-2016-12-04) | Wizards of the Coast

Denver was a fun one, and I encourage you to check out [all the coverage](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/gpden16). But if you've only got a little bit of time, the Top 5 moments covers five of the biggest stories from the weekend—including the emergence of Panharmonicombo on the competitive scene. Many clouds were blazed, many mages reflected, and [Panharmonicon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Panharmonicon) forged its way to our hearts. Well, your hearts. It's been in mine for months. At any rate, it also covers other wacky decks that made impacts, Emrakul's *big* impact, and Matt Severa's big Grand Prix win (more on this [below](#9)).


If you've got more than a little time, check out the video coverage on [our Twitch archive](https://www.twitch.tv/magic/videos/all) page.


1. [Top 5 Moments of Grand Prix Madrid 2016](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/gpmad16/top-5-moments-of-grand-prix-madrid%202016-2016-12-04) | Wizards of the Coast

They may not have had video coverage, and they may not have had [Panharmonicon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Panharmonicon) in the Top 8, but Grand Prix Madrid had plenty going on, from the breakout weekend of [Aetherworks Marvel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aetherworks+Marvel) to someone winning by casting a single spell, to [Metalwork Colossus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Metalwork+Colossus) crushing Delirium decks. It was a good weekend.


1. [StarCityGames.com Atlanta Invitational](http://www.starcitygames.com/events/021216_atlanta.html)

Finally we come to the StarCityGames.com Invitational, a mixed-format tournament taken down by Jacob Baugh and severely lacking in [Cloudblazer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloudblazer). Still, three days of Modern and Standard play left a lot to digest, so check out [all of the coverage here](http://www.starcitygames.com/events/021216_atlanta.html).


1. [Which Four-Color Commander is the Strongest? Commander Gameplay | Game Knights #01](http://collected.company/2016/12/04/game-knights-commander-2016-01/) | The Command Zone | Jimmy Wong and Josh Lee Kwai

The gameplay videos being produced by The Command Zone lately are some of the sharpest-looking, best-produced *Magic* videos around, and this one is no exception. Worth checking out whether you're an avid Commander fan, or just curious.


Could have used more [Panharmonicon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Panharmonicon), though. Just ask Seth Manfield.


After Those, Read, Watch, or Listen to These
============================================


1. [Tugboat Complex](http://www.gatheringmagic.com/andrewjessup-12052016-tugboat-complex/) | Gathering Magic | Andrew Jessup

Jessup gets personal in this introspective look at his own *Magic* journey, what winning means, and how he's turned toward the StarCityGames.com Players' Championship as his next goal to master. My advice? Play Panharmonicombo.


1. [Agents of Artifice](http://www.hipstersofthecoast.com/2016/12/agents-of-artifice/) | Hipsters of the Coast | Rich Stein

There's a lot of background in the *Kaladesh* and *Aether Revolt* stories that leans on the events in *Agents of Artifice*, the story of how Jace, Liliana, and Tezzeret all first got together. Stein reviews that novel and talks a bit about how it's connected to what's happening on Kaladesh right now. What it does not tell you is how [Panharmonicon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Panharmonicon) came to be.


Community Spotlight
===================


1. [Streaming Calendar](http://mrsmulligan.com/calendar/all-streamers/)

Mrs. Mulligan, an avid streamer herself, has put together something truly useful for people who like watching *Magic*—a streamer calendar. It doesn't cover all streamers and misses some of the big ones, but this is something sorely needed—a *TV Guide* of sorts for *Magic* streaming. I imagine it will only get more complete as time goes on. I guarantee at least one of the people on this list will be giving Panharmonicombo a try.

Cute kid, yeah. But from her father's description, I'm pretty sure she'd beat you in a heartbeat. Don't let the adorably oversized backward hat and big eyes fool you. This girl can play.

Yes, that's right—three Grand Prix *wins* in 2016. Some of the best players in the world have that many over their entire lifetimes. It's also a record for one calendar year—tied for the record anyway. And Severa will have a chance to break that record in his home state of Wisconsin at [Grand Prix Milwaukee Dec. 9–11](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/premierplay/grandprix/fact-sheet-gpmil16).


Deck of the Day
===============


1. [Seth Manfield's White-Blue Panharmonicombo](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/gpden16/top-8-decklists-2016-12-04)

Of course this was going to be the deck of the day, given my very obvious and super warranted bias, but, really, this *was* the surprise deck of the weekend. The deck is incredibly fun and very good in the midrangy metagame that we had coming into Denver. The deck beats up on Black-Green Delirium quite thoroughly, and thanks to its variety of tempo plays and card advantage, it has game against virtually anything.


For anyone who isn't familiar with the deck, the key interaction is [Panharmonicon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Panharmonicon) plus basically everything in the deck, but mostly [Cloudblazer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloudblazer) (draw four, gain 4) and [Eldrazi Displacer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eldrazi+Displacer) and [Drowner of Hope](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Drowner+of+Hope). With the last two in play plus a [Panharmonicon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Panharmonicon), the deck can generate as much mana and create as many Scions as it would like. Drowner creates four tokens when it comes into play, thanks to [Panharmonicon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Panharmonicon), and [Eldrazi Displacer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eldrazi+Displacer) can use three of them to blink the Drowner again, netting one each time. From there, you can use all of those Scions to either kill your opponent on your next attack step or blink anything you have in play. If [Thraben Inspector](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thraben+Inspector) or [Cloudblazer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloudblazer) are already in play, you can draw your entire deck, finding your single [Thought-Knot Seer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thought-Knot+Seer), which you can then blink as many times as needed to make your opponent draw their entire deck—winning immediately.


But most of the time you just land a [Panharmonicon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Panharmonicon) and drown your opponent in card advantage and tempo plays until they're dead. The deck has fantastic resiliency to [Emrakul, the Promised End](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Emrakul%2C+the+Promised+End), but can be a little rough against control decks.


Still, if it comes Seth Manfield–approved and Grand Prix–tested, it's certainly worth checking out...


...like I've been saying all along. (I had to get one "told ya so" in there.)
