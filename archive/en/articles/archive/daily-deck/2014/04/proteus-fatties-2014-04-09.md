Akira Asahara turned heads at Worlds 2010 with his Faeries/[Polymorph](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Polymorph) mashup. Smaland decided to bring it back, although it was before [Bitterblossom](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bitterblossom) was even unbanned!



![Proteus Staff](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?size=small&type=card&name=Proteus%20Staff&options=)In the grand scheme of things, I like [Proteus Staff](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Proteus+Staff) as a reusable [Polymorph](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Polymorph) effect over the one-shot spell. It's more mana overall, but it's easier to drop a Staff on turn three and use it on turn four, either with counterspell backup or a discard spell for protection. If things go wrong, you're free to try again on the next turn.

[Isochron Scepter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Isochron+Scepter) provides a reasonable backup strategy for stalling with either [Boomerang](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Boomerang) or [Vapor Snag](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vapor+Snag) and is another artifact to discard to [Thirst for Knowledge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thirst+for+Knowledge). Ashiok is yet another backup plan, capable of providing food for [Proteus Staff](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Proteus+Staff) or even an alternative win condition if you can steal an opponent's [Tarmogoyf](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf).


Overall, I think [Proteus Staff](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Proteus+Staff) has what it takes to be a contender in Modern, barring an abundance of artifact hate. Eight discard spells and a quick kill should be great against the plethora of combo decks. Plus there's a lot of resiliency in the deck, especially after you add some [Bitterblossom](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bitterblossom)s.
