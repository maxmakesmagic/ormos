S[phinx's Revelation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sphinx%27s+Revelation) fans can rejoice, because the powerful Azorius card-drawing instant is out in force at Pro Tour *Dragon's Maze*. 

 Out of 388 players battling at Pro Tour *Dragon's Maze*, a whopping 105 have come armed with some variation of Esper (WUB) Control, complete with a lot of [Sphinx's Revelation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sphinx%27s+Revelation)s in tow. 

 But Esper isn't the only deck equipped with the mythic draw spell. [Bant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bant) Control, the second most popular choice this weekend, is playing the ubiquitous instant, as are UWR Control variants, Azorius Control decks, and a few [Maze's End](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Maze%27s+End) decks. 

 All in all, in every Constructed round today, our pros have close to a 50% chance to play against [Sphinx's Revelation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sphinx%27s+Revelation) and its partners in crime, [Supreme Verdict](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Supreme+Verdict) and [Azorius Charm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Azorius+Charm). 

There is, however, significant variation after that, including a few wrinkles that could come to define not only the tournament, but the format itself.

### [Sphinx's Revelation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sphinx%27s+Revelation) Decks

 For one, the choice of finishers in the Esper Control (White-Blue-Black) decks varies. [Ætherling](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=%C3%86therling), [Blood Baron of Vizkopa](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Baron+of+Vizkopa), and [Obzedat, Ghost Council](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Obzedat%2C+Ghost+Council) are all taking turns, occasionally helped out by a [Jace, Architect of Thought](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace%2C+Architect+of+Thought)'s ultimate stealing...well, something. 

 A deck that isn't lacking for finishers is [Bant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bant) Control (White-Blue-Green), which can often be seen sporting [Ætherling](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=%C3%86therling), but they also often have [Advent of the Wurm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Advent+of+the+Wurm) just for value. The card is that good. 


[Bant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bant) decks also have a wide variety of types. The control decks have most of the typical control elements, often topping out with [Angel of Serenity](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Angel+of+Serenity). The [Bant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bant) Aggro decks usually end their curve at [Advent of the Wurm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Advent+of+the+Wurm), and [Prime Speaker Zegana](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Prime+Speaker+Zegana)[Bant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bant) decks play a ton of creatures while looking to take advantage of the Simic guild leader. 


[Maze's End](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Maze%27s+End) has also made its presence known, splitting into two camps. One camp chose to play a simple controlling game with a bunch of removal, card draw, and life gain. The other chose to play [Fog](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fog)s, which are variations on spells that prevent all combat damage. In this case, [Riot Control](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Riot+Control), [Ætherize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=%C3%86therize), and [Druid's Deliverance](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Druid%27s+Deliverance) all prolong the game until mass removal and [Maze's End](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Maze%27s+End) itself can steal the win. It'll be interesting to see which [Maze's End](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Maze%27s+End) strategy proves more productive as the weekend goes on. 

 To round out the [Sphinx's Revelation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sphinx%27s+Revelation) decks, there are good number of Blue-White-Red Control decks in the field, many of them looking to finish off games with [Boros Reckoner](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Boros+Reckoner)s, [Assemble the Legion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Assemble+the+Legion), [Ætherling](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=%C3%86therling), and [Aurelia, the Warleader](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aurelia%2C+the+Warleader). 

### Aggressive Strategies

But while many of the pros clearly love their blue cards, plenty of players have aligned themselves with other guilds in the hopes of disrupting or just plain running over the blue mages.

Various Selesnya, Naya (White-Red-Green), Jund (Black-Red-Green), Gruul, Boros, and even Mono-Red players have come gunning for control players' life totals with aggressive strategies aimed at knocking players down before they even get a chance to set up.

 The Blitz signifier you see in several of the deck names signals a very aggressive deck that utilizes [Burning-Tree Emissary](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Burning-Tree+Emissary) to dump a bunch of small beaters on the table quickly and efficiently. They resemble the Standard Naya Blitz decks and might be the fastest decks in the format. 

 However, that title might just belong to Mono-Red instead, a 19ish land strategy that can start hitting for damage on turn one, and it never lets up. The Boros Blitz decks are close cousins, often splashing just one or two key white cards. If you see a [Temple Garden](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Temple+Garden) next to a basic [Mountain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mountain), you might just be playing against Boros Blitz, strangely enough—the deck needs its [Plains](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plains) to be able to cast [Burning-Tree Emissary](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Burning-Tree+Emissary). The Gruul decks are often pretty similar as well, taking advantage of [Domri Rade](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Domri+Rade) to keep the gas flowing, plus [Ghor-Clan Rampager](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ghor-Clan+Rampager) for even more punch. 

 The Selesnya Aggro decks are a touch slower, but often a bit bigger. [Loxodon Smiter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Loxodon+Smiter)s and [Call of the Conclave](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Call+of+the+Conclave) easily outclass anything the Blitz decks have to offer in the early turns, and [Advent of the Wurm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Advent+of+the+Wurm) is about the biggest beating you can imagine for, well, anything. 

You might also notice a little notation for a deck we dubbed "Naya Doublestrike." That's a sweet little number that seeks to take advantage of a few double striking creatures and effects to get in a ton of damage in one or two big hits.

### Midrange

Too aggressive for control, too controlling for aggro, midrange decks take the in-between route, usually to take advantage of a number of powerful spells that can win the game on their own.

 The three flagship midrange archetypes in *Return to Ravnica* Block Constructed are Naya, Junk (Black-White-Green), and Borzhov (White-Red-Black), with a smattering of [Bant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bant) Midrange thrown in. 

 The Naya Midrange decks rely on several powerful permanents to put the game away, most notably [Aurelia, the Warleader](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aurelia%2C+the+Warleader), and [Assemble the Legion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Assemble+the+Legion). After that, the usual assortment of [Boros Reckoner](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Boros+Reckoner)s, [Advent of the Wurm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Advent+of+the+Wurm), and [Loxodon Smiter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Loxodon+Smiter)s put more than enough pressure on the opponent, while playing defense pretty well too. 

 Borzhov decks are essentially Black-Red-White goodstuffs decks, also leaning on Reckoner and Assemble at times, but mixing in the deadly [Blood Baron of Vizkopa](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Baron+of+Vizkopa), [Obzedat, Ghost Council](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Obzedat%2C+Ghost+Council), and the disruptive [Sin Collector](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sin+Collector). 

 Junk shares many of the Orzhov-based cards of Borzhov, but mixes in cards such as [Voice of Resurgence](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Voice+of+Resurgence), [Advent of the Wurm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Advent+of+the+Wurm), [Putrefy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Putrefy), and [Abrupt Decay](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Abrupt+Decay).
