Welcome to another edition of Sketches! Today we find out what happens in *Rise of the Eldrazi* when the meek get consumed!


  
### Artist Portfolio


Artist [Chippy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&artist=+%5BChippy%5D) has illustrated 88 **Magic** cards through *Worldwake*, and there's another seven in *Rise of the Eldrazi*.


### Art Description


The first step of the creation of a card's art is its art description. The art description tells the artist what the card will do, what its flavor is, and what the mood of the illustration should be. Here were the instructions given to Chippy for a card designed to wipe out all the small creatures on the board:



> 
> *Color: Black spell*
> 
> 
> *Action: A scene of epic destruction. The Eldrazi titan Emrakul floats over a forest that contains a large elvish settlement. The titan emits a "sphere of annihilation" -- a powerful field of magic that simply obliterates living things. At the bottom of the frame and in the foreground, we see indications of the devastation -- living things being swept away like dust.*
> 
> 
> *Mood: An entire community and its ecosystem, \*obliterated\* simply by the presence of the Eldrazi titan.*
> 
> 
> 

The next step is for the artist to submit sketches of his or her vision of the art description.


### Sketches


Here's Chippy's initial sketch.

The creative team liked the size of the Eldrazi but asked for the destruction to be shown a bit more clearly. Chippy revamped his sketch and turned this in.
