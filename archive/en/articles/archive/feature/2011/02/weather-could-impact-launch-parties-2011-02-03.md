As you may already be aware, much of the United States is currently underneath tons of snow and ice. Unfortunately, this includes a part of the United States where our warehouse is located. The *Mirrodin Besieged* Launch Parties are scheduled for this weekend, so here's what you should do:


> 
> 1) Check to see whether it's safe to leave your home.  
>  2) Check to see if your local game store is going to be open.  
>  3) Ask them if they've gotten their shipment of *Mirrodin Besieged*.

We're doing everything we can to get cards to stores, but the weather means that there is a chance that some stores won't receive the *Mirrodin Besieged* they need to run their tournaments.

You can contact your local store using the retail locator below. And if you weren't already planning on going to a Launch Party, consider this an opportunity to find out where your nearest one is!
