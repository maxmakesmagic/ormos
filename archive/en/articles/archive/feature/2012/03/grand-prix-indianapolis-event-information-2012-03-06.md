![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/promo/grandprix_2012.jpg)*Get a promo card by playing in the Grand Prix (while supplies last).*The NFL's big party is going to leave Indianapolis in February, just in time for the bigger show to arrive in March—The **Magic: The Gathering**  Grand Prix!. Maybe this is stretching it a bit, but we need them to clear out because the Grand Prix is over in Lucas Oil Stadium, home of the Indianapolis Colts. And, when we are talking about big events, Indianapolis has been the place. In 2008, the Grand Prix in Indianapolis crushed the previous North American Grand Prix attendance record with 1,121 players—the first domestic Grand Prix to bring in over 1000 players. What will the Grand Prix bring in 2012? That is up to you and your friends. You can be sure of getting a weekend to remember. So call your friends, fill the car, book your travel now because this is going to be a weekend you will not want to miss. 


 Join us for an incredible Grand Prix and the amazing array of public events, artists, contests and more. Things heat up on Friday with Last Chance Trials for byes starting at noon—but we will also be starting our Grand Prix Side Event Champion events at noon as well. You can play nothing but **Magic: The Gathering** Commander all weekend and still be the Side Event Champion, taking home a huge prize!


The first 500 players to register for the main event will receive an amazing Grand Prix Indianapolis playmat. Get there early on Friday—these are going to go fast! (We are going to have some additional mats for side event prizes—but not enough to fill demand—so make sure to keep your eyes peeled for other ways to get these great mats!)


The city is truly one of the best downtowns for an event—small in comparison to cities like Chicago, New York, Atlanta but full of all the great restaurants—everything from Steak and Shake to Fogo de Chao awaits in this great city, all within a few blocks of each other. So mark down the weekend on your calendar and plan to join us for a great, fun weekend of **Magic**!

*The **Magic: The Gathering**  Grand Prix tournament series is a great reason to get out into the **Magic** tournament community, catch up with old friends, meet some new ones, and play some great **Magic**. Grand Prix tournaments are world-wide open events that allow all **Magic**  players to participate and experience the thrill of a large-scale competition. In addition to cash prizes, a high Planeswalker Points multiplier, and exclusive foil promo cards for participants, Grand Prix feature a host of other activities, including public events and artist signings (prizes subject to change).
