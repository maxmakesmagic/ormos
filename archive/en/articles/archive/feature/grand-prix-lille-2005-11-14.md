Grand Prix are easily the biggest open events the DCI offers. They're high-energy and held around the world. Plus, no invitation is necessary -- anyone can attend.

Even if you don’t want to attend the main event, there are still plenty of reasons to come. A Grand Prix is not just a regular **Magic**  tournament… Grand Prix’s in Europe are true **Magic**  events. Besides the main tournaments, there’s plenty of excitement throughout the weekend that you can enjoy… There are loads of side events, **Magic**  artists on site to sign your **Magic**  cards, and lots more…

So you have plenty of reasons to come to one of the many GP stops in Europe.

[Next and last stop for this year is GP Lille on December 17-18th.](http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=grandprix/lille05/facts) 


You can’t make it to Lille? Don’t worry; we’ve got lots more lined up for you in 2006. We can already tell you that the first GP will take place in Belgium at the end of January, but more information will become available soon. Just keep an eye on the [GP schedule](http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=grandprix/schedule)

CU there!
