Taufik Indrakesuma won the die roll and elected to play first, keeping his opening hand without much deliberation. Naoki Nakada on the other hand, mulled it over for a while, before finally keeping it (I tricked you with the use of "mulled" there, didn't I?)


Nakada had a first turn [Birds of Paradise](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Birds+of+Paradise), and the turn two [Lotus Cobra](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lotus+Cobra), fetch land, three drop combo, summoning a [Dauntless Escort](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dauntless+Escort) alongside his snake. Indrakesuma made an [Everflowing Chalice](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Everflowing+Chalice) for one, but passed back his third turn with no play or green mana. Nakada attacked Indrakesuma down to 15. [Into the Roil](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Into+the+Roil) bounced the Cobra at end of turn, after Nakada had added a [Noble Hierarch](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Noble+Hierarch) to his team, but no further beaters. Indrakesuma [Ponder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ponder)ed, and chose to shuffle, before playing a Jace and bouncing the Escort. Nakada replayed his Cobra and recruited [Elspeth, Knight-Errant](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elspeth%2C+Knight-Errant), which in turn sent the Hierarch over to kill Jace. Still without green mana, Indrakesuma turned Nakada's [Plains](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plains) into an [Island](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island) with a [Spreading Seas](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spreading+Seas). The Cobra and the [Birds of Paradise](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Birds+of+Paradise) attacked Indrakesuma down to 10, but he [Deprive](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deprive)d the [Dauntless Escort](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dauntless+Escort) on the way back down, looking to reuse his [Halimar Depths](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Halimar+Depths). Luckily, there was a [Khalni Garden](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Khalni+Garden) on top of his deck, and that swiftly powered out an [Emrakul, the Aeons Torn](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Emrakul%2C+the+Aeons+Torn). Nakada played a Jace of his own, and returned Emrakul to Indrakesuma's hand. With no room left to win, Indrakesuma scooped up his cards with a mock shriek.

*Nakada sends in the clowns.* |


Nakada 1 – Indrakesuma 0


Indrakesuma had green mana game two, with a turn one [Khalni Garden](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Khalni+Garden). Nakada summoned a [Birds of Paradise](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Birds+of+Paradise), a [Lotus Cobra](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lotus+Cobra) and another Birds, thanks to a quick spot of [Celestial Colonnade](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Celestial+Colonnade) and [Lotus Cobra](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lotus+Cobra) interactivity. Elspeth was [Negate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Negate)d, and a [Noble Hierarch](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Noble+Hierarch) sent the Cobra in for 3. On his fourth turn, Indrakesuma looked sideways at Nakada's untapped Birds and his plant, and instead summoned the Mind Sculptor, [Brainstorm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brainstorm)ing. Nakada played a [Misty Rainforest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Misty+Rainforest), allowing him to hard-cast an [Eldrazi Conscription](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eldrazi+Conscription) on his [Birds of Paradise](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Birds+of+Paradise). He sent the Birds at the Jace, and the Cobra at the face. Indrakesuma sacrificed Jace and the Plant to the Annihilating Birds, and took 2 from the Cobra. He calmly untapped and [Unsummon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Unsummon)ed the Birds. Nakada attacked with his Colonnade and Cobra, Indrakesuma kicking an [Into the Roil](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Into+the+Roil) at the snake. On the following turn, Nakada replayed the Cobra, and played a land to also give him enough mana to attack with his Colonnade. With his opponent now completely tapped out, Indrakesuma played [Khalni Garden](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Khalni+Garden) and turned the plant into a 15/15 Tentacly Monstery thing. Nakada had no play on his turn, and Emrakul proceeded to eat every single one of the Bant player's lands. Nakada untapped, and played an [Oblivion Ring](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oblivion+Ring), bowing his head and putting himself at Indraesuma's mercy. Indrakesuma allowed it, and Nakada breathed a huge sigh of relief, attacking him down to 7 with the Cobra. When Nakada ended his turn, Indrakesuma pointed an [Into the Roil](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Into+the+Roil) at the Ring, and the audience went wild.

*Indrakesuma had the bounce all along.* |


Nakada 1 – Indrakesuma 1


Nakada started the decider with a second turn [Knight of the Reliquary](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Knight+of+the+Reliquary) that attacked for 3 the following turn, but was joined by nothing further from the Japanese player. Indrakesuma once again lacked green mana, and when he went to [Unsummon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Unsummon) the Knight on its next attack, he was thwarted by an [Emerge Unscathed](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Emerge+Unscathed). Nakada summoned a [Lotus Cobra](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lotus+Cobra), and [Negate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Negate)d Indrakesuma's [Deprive](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deprive), which at least allowed him to pick up his [Halimar Depths](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Halimar+Depths) to try and dig up some green. Nakada's graveyard was slowly filling up with fetch lands. While Indrakesuma [Deprive](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deprive)d a [Sovereigns of Lost Alara](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sovereigns+of+Lost+Alara), the Knight and Cobra dropping the Indonesian to a low 7 life. With Nakada tapped out, he [Unsummon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Unsummon)ed the Knight, but still lacked any green mana. The Cobra whittled him down to 5 and was rejoined by the Knight, only to be [Into the Roil](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Into+the+Roil)'d end of turn. Indrakesuma [Ponder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ponder)ed and again chose to shuffle, rounding out his turn with a little more library manipulation from his [Halimar Depths](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Halimar+Depths). The Cobra took him to 3 and Nakada resolved a [Linvala, Keeper of Silence](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Linvala%2C+Keeper+of+Silence). Indrakesuma finally played a [Khalni Garden](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Khalni+Garden), and once again turned the plant into an Emrakul. Nakada untapped, and slammed his [Jace, the Mind Sculptor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace%2C+the+Mind+Sculptor) into play. He bounced the Eldrazi and turned his team sideways, and Indrakesuma offered his hand in congratulations.
