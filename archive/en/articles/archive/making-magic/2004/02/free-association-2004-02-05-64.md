One day I hope to make Greased Weasel the name of a real card. (Although don't hold your breath.) And just as you can't stop the Greased Weasel, neither can you stop this column from ending. (Okay that segue gets a D-.) 

Yes, it's time to extract yourself from my warped mind. (Who knew the Three Stooges played **Magic**?)

Until then, may your weasel always be greased (okay, that sounds kind of dirty, but I honestly don't mean it to).
