Since 1990 Arnie's work has appeared in a variety of venues for many different role-playing and computer game companies. His 11-year affiliation with Dungeons and Dragons alone has been on covers, posters, maps and interior illustrations. Currently his art can be seen in every D&D rule book to be published since the 3rd edition players hand book, and on the cover of Dragon Magazine. 

Since 1998 his career has expanded to include conceptual illustrations for many different games at a design level. His toy creations have been produced and can be found in almost any major hobby or toy store. The work in "Magic" began in the *Mercadian Masks* set and he has been contributing with concepts and cards in each set since. He now works full time at Raven Software as a 2d, 3d and conceptual artist on Quake 4.

He lives in Wisconsin with his wife, two children and two cats. Some of his hobbies and interests include, gaming (role-playing, cards and computer), Archeology, movies, martial arts and story telling.

"Being involved in such a wonderful career and working with some of the most creative and imaginative people on the planet makes me one of the most fortunate people on earth."
