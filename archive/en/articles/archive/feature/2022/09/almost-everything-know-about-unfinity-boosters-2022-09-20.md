Welcome to the lights and excitement of [*Unfinity*](https://magic.wizards.com/products/unfinity)! *Magic*'s latest *Un-* set release is packed with attractions ([and Attractions](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/making-magic/making-space-part-1-2022-09-20)) to delight players—from the fresh-faced thrill seekers ready for something new to the venerable visitors making their latest trip through a set.


So, let's take a tour of the park and the (not-so) infinite cards to collect.


Foil Box Topper Borderless Shock Lands
======================================


![Unfinity Box Topper](https://media.wizards.com/2022/images/daily/2PaGVr4Yytme.png)


Each Draft and Collector Booster display of *Unfinity* comes with a Box Topper booster filled with one traditional foil shock land—the famous-from-*Ravnica* cycle of dual lands—themed with literally out-of-this-world borderless artwork:


![Hallowed Fountain](https://media.wizards.com/2022/unf/en_fj8quFvEfc.png)![Watery Grave](https://media.wizards.com/2022/unf/en_uvZyszDwjm.png)![Blood Crypt](https://media.wizards.com/2022/unf/en_Z4w51O8z4R.png)

These iconic lands are powerful additions to your favorite *Magic* deck and feature incredible artwork unlike any seen before. And beyond Box Toppers, there's also an opportunity to open traditional foil (and galaxy foil—see below!) shock lands in *Unfinity* Collector Boosters.


For Draft Boosters, roughly one out of every 24 Boosters contains a borderless shock land where you would find a basic land card.


For Collector Boosters, there are two slots where a basic land appears, and for each of those slots roughly one out of 24 appearances will be a borderless shock land instead. (Yes, that means it's possible to find *two* borderless shock lands in one *Unfinity* Collector Booster.)


Planetary Space-ic Basic Lands and Orbital Space-ic Basic Lands
===============================================================


Beginning with the first *Un-* set release in 1998's *Unglued,* each *Un-* set has offered an amazing new twist on full-art basic lands.


* [![9677](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&multiverseid=9677)](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=9677)
* [![73951](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&multiverseid=73951)](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=73951)
* [![439602](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&multiverseid=439602)](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=439602)
* [![479481](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&multiverseid=479481)](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=479481)

Since full-art basic lands, such as [the stained-glass versions found in *Dominaria United*](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/feature/collecting-dominaria-united-2022-08-18), are a frequent feature of *Magic* sets today, it was back to *Unfinity* to set its sights higher. This time, there are *two* amazing full-art basic land treatments to find!


The first is the bread and butter of *Un-* sets with the orbital space-ic basic lands, an outer space take on full-art basic lands. These are beautiful cards that bring the full-art treatment to an interstellar point of view:


![Orbital space-ic Plains](https://media.wizards.com/2022/unf/en_tszEM9PV35.png)![Orbital space-ic Island](https://media.wizards.com/2022/unf/en_VpHDqYti8b.png)![Orbital space-ic Swamp](https://media.wizards.com/2022/unf/en_k4nukqEqtK.png)


![Orbital space-ic Mountain](https://media.wizards.com/2022/unf/en_0l2vstRPrO.png)![Orbital space-ic Forest](https://media.wizards.com/2022/unf/en_1p5RA2X3w3.png)


The other is an atomic age reimagining with full-art planetary space-ic basic lands. These feature an atomic model-esque mana symbol (note: not an actual atomic model for mana) over a vibrant planetary-scale landscape:


![Planetary space-ic Plains](https://media.wizards.com/2022/unf/en_8g9d9ZQ1Zv.png)![Planetary space-ic Island](https://media.wizards.com/2022/unf/en_I1Nb8yoS1g.png)![Planetary space-ic Swamp](https://media.wizards.com/2022/unf/en_ejEdicz4qr.png)


![Planetary space-ic Mountain](https://media.wizards.com/2022/unf/en_0PdHckeYU4.png)![Planetary space-ic Forest](https://media.wizards.com/2022/unf/en_FbhCtNiRVx.png)


Both the orbital space-ic and planetary space-ic basic lands can be found in Draft and Collector Boosters, in both foil and non-foil treatments. In fact, *all* basic lands found in *Unfinity* boosters will be one of those two treatments!


You'll find planetary space-ic lands in both Draft and Collector Boosters of *Unfinity*, and roughly one in four Draft Boosters will contain an orbital space-ic land instead.


Galaxy Foil
===========


*Unfinity* also introduces a beautiful new foil treatment that's perfect for the cards that make you starry-eyed. Meet galaxy foils:


![Galaxy foil planetary space-ic basic lands](https://media.wizards.com/2022/images/daily/y2HwdyE2hy.jpg)


The galaxy foil treatment offers the similarly bright and reflective look of the traditional foil treatment but punctuates it with echoes of planets and stars across the foiling. The planetary space-ic basic lands shown above feature the galaxy foil treatment, but many more cards across the set can show off this new foil treatment—including borderless shock lands in Collector Boosters, both showcase styles of full-art basic lands, and many other cards across the set.


Galaxy foil cards can only be found in *Unfinity* Collectors Boosters. In each Collector Booster, you will receive between three and five galaxy foil cards. Note that the galaxy foil treatment is featured on cards numbered 287–537, which will be included (without a faux galaxy foil look) in our [*Unfinity* Variant Card Image Gallery](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/card-image-gallery/unfinity-variants).


There is a full breakout of how these galaxy foils are found in Collector Boosters later in this article.


Acorn Cards, Eternal, and Attractions
=====================================


Previously, all *Un-* set *Magic* cards appeared with a silver border instead of the typical black border. [As Mark Rosewater explained when introducing *Unfinity*](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/making-magic/unfinity-and-beyond-2022-09-19), many cards found in previous *Un-* sets were perfectly suitable (and even later became) black-border cards as part of a typical *Magic* release.


[![](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=The+Cheese+Stands+Alone)](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=The+Cheese+Stands+Alone)[![](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Barren+Glory)](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Barren+Glory)
[![](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Target+Minotaur)](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Target+Minotaur)[![](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Lightning+Visionary)](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Visionary)
*Magic* rules already handle many strange—and unique—mechanics and interactions, so in a first for *Un-* sets, cards you'll find in *Unfinity* boosters all have a black border (aside from a selection of silver-border reprints as part of *The List—*more on that below).


However, that doesn't mean the wildest cards of *Unfinity* are destined for the most competitive decks in the game.


![Acorn Security Seal](https://media.wizards.com/2021/images/daily/anqprYWzr1.png)


An acorn-shaped symbol on the bottom of *Unfinity* cards—shown above in the style of the security hologram that's featured on applicable rares and mythic rares—means that card isn't legal for tournament play. Cards without an acorn symbol are legal for Vintage, Legacy, and Commander.



![Killer Cosplay](https://media.wizards.com/2022/unf/en_kRexiXOVX9.png)Regular
 

![Galaxy foil Killer Cosplay](https://media.wizards.com/2022/unf/en_CP4BEvT6EO.png)Galaxy Foil

![Saw in Half](https://media.wizards.com/2022/unf/en_jaluieZZOV.png)Regular
 

![Galaxy foil Saw in Half](https://media.wizards.com/2022/unf/en_HTDnmxsxla.png)Galaxy Foil
Killer Cosplay features an acorn security stamp as a rare, and Saw in Half features the typical oval security stamp. While every card will find its home in decks, an acorn symbol will let you know if there are restrictions on where you can play the card outside of *Unfinity* Draft.


All acorn cards feature an acorn symbol or security seal placed at the bottom center. Eternal-legal cards that are commons and uncommons won't have any symbol there, and Eternal-legal rares and mythic rares will feature the typical oval security seal.


A new *Magic* card subtype appears with and without acorn symbols: Attractions!

![Fortune Teller (a)](https://media.wizards.com/2022/unf/en_3X0kpzYLPk.png)![Fortune Teller (b)](https://media.wizards.com/2022/unf/en_c6Zf1L7Ofa.png)![Fortune Teller (c)](https://media.wizards.com/2022/unf/en_dlXtnl3rHx.png)

Attractions are exactly what you think of when you visit a theme park: awesome locations, games, and experiences you can participate in and enjoy. Other cards will tell you when and how to interact with your Attractions, and they will be an important part of *Unfinity* Draft—so important that Draft Boosters (as well as Collector Boosters) have dedicated slots for you to open them. Plus, Attractions share a non-*Magic* card back featuring additional reminders on how they work in-game.


![Attraction card back](https://media.wizards.com/2022/unf/en_9mlHdXVI2m.png)


Plus, Attractions (except for one) come in several variations—both with and without acorn symbols, as you can see above—so you'll have plenty of ways to mix, match, and play with them!


Across *Unfinity*, here is the breakdown of acorn-symbol and Eternal-legal cards, including Attractions (but not each Attraction variation):


* 60 Eternal-legal commons (8 Attractions)
* 30 Acorn-symbol commons (2 Attractions)
* 43 Eternal-legal uncommons (7 Attractions)
* 29 Acorn-symbol uncommons (5 Attractions)
* 18 Eternal-legal rares (7 Attractions)
* 36 Acorn-symbol rares (6 Attractions)
* 4 Eternal-legal mythic rares
* 14 Acorn-symbol mythic rares
* 10 Basic lands (two treatments for each type; Eternal-legal reprints)
* 10 Borderless shock lands (Eternal-legal reprints)

Note that *Unfinity* Attraction cards can be found in a dedicated slot for Attractions in both Draft and Collector Boosters, as well as the traditional foil card that can replace a common in Draft Boosters.


Booster Fun: Showcase Cards of Tomorrow
=======================================


*Unfinity* also features its own showcase cards of tomorrow Booster Fun treatment, this one an homage to midcentury modern style with an aesthetic that's perfect for the atomic futurism-meets-*Magic* amusement park:



![Magar of the Magic Strings](https://media.wizards.com/2022/unf/en_LWoDR1KN7q.png)Regular
 

![Galaxy foil Magar of the Magic Strings](https://media.wizards.com/2022/unf/en_oF6tI02U8a.png)Galaxy Foil

![Showcase Magar of the Magic Strings](https://media.wizards.com/2022/unf/en_4scGmobKp8.png)Showcase
 

![Galaxy foil showcase Magar of the Magic Strings](https://media.wizards.com/2022/unf/en_jSy9o5m0dK.png)Galaxy Foil Showcase
These showcase treatments include the legendary creatures from uncommons, rares, and mythic rares—with and without acorns—across *Unfinity*. In the set there are:


* 10 Showcase uncommon cards
* 14 Showcase rare cards
* 6 Showcase mythic rare cards
* 2 Borderless planeswalker mythic rare cards (see below)

In Draft Boosters, whenever an uncommon, rare, or mythic rare appears, if it has a showcase treatment that treatment will appear roughly one out of four times.


In Collector Boosters, dedicated slots in the booster can include showcase cards.


Booster Fun: Borderless Planeswalkers
=====================================


Have you met the goodest boy in the *Magic* Multiverse?



![Comet, Stellar Pup](https://media.wizards.com/2022/unf/en_OpvSBZhaOX.png)Regular
 

![Galaxy foil Comet, Stellar Pup](https://media.wizards.com/2022/unf/en_M2q3od7tgN.png)Galaxy Foil

![Galaxy foil borderless Comet, Stellar Pup](https://media.wizards.com/2022/unf/en_KuOTseNwRu.png)Galaxy Foil Borderless
Comet, Stellar Pup is one of two planeswalkers in the set. Each planeswalker also features a borderless version, and both versions appear in traditional foil and galaxy foil treatments, too!


*The List* for Unfinity
=======================


*The List* takes a turn into the *Un-* side of *Magic* with *Unfinity*, featuring a set of 60 silver-border cards (58 individual cards and two cards with two variants each) from across *Un-* sets of the past.


[![](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&multiverseid=439519)](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=439519)[![](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&multiverseid=479421)](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=479421)[![](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&multiverseid=479451)](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=479451)
These cards, like all cards reprinted through *The List*, feature a small planeswalker symbol on the bottom left-hand corner. However, for *Unfinity*, these cards will be in traditional foil (some with a few updates to make them shine) and appear in each *Unfinity* Collector Booster (unlike the roughly one in every four Set Boosters of recent releases).


Check out [our complete breakdown of *The List* for *Unfinity* to get all the details](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/feature/list-unfinity-un-usual-twist-list-2022-09-20).
