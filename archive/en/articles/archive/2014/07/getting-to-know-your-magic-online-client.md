After the July 16 downtime, the *Magic Online* “V3” client will no longer be available to players, and the beta client will become *Magic Online’s* only supported client. To help with this transition, MTGO.com is running a series of daily “Tips & Tricks” articles every weekday from Monday, July 7, to Friday, July 18. You can find a directory of these articles below!
