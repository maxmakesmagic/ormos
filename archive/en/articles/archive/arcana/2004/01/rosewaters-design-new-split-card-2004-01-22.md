**Magic** rules manager Paul Barclay would like to announce an unofficial Oracle rules revision for the *Invasion* and *Apocalypse* split cards:


> *"If you need to know a split card's characteristic (like its birth weight or gender), you get two answers -- one for each twin on the card. But if you need to know whether or not a split card *has* a certain characteristic (such as whether it was over 18" long at birth or whether it's an Infant), you get a single yes or no answer based on the answers each half would give independently."*

Since we're not sure what that means either, let's just look at the card:

  
  
  
  
Twin siblings Adam and Sarah Rosewater were born on January 16, 2004. Congratulations to the proud creators of this new 2-for-1, Mark and Lora Rosewater! The family reports that everyone is healthy and is doing well.

(Leave it to Mark to design the first split creature card!)
