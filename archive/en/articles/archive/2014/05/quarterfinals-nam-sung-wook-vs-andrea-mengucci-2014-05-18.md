 Does the user name "nsw" mean anything to you? If you play **Magic Online** then you might know that nsw is firmly on top of the Constructed leaderboard, a player that consistently racks up wins across the digital realm. What team MTG Mint Card didn't know when they invited Grand Prix Melbourne champion Nam Sung Wook to the team was that he and nsw were one in the same.




 In hindsight, Nam Sung Wook abbreviating to nsw seems obvious. Not only did the team bring on a top competitor from their geography but tapped into the talent and skill of one of the best **Magic Online** players. Carrying the Junk Constellation deck to his team's best place of the weekend – Top 8, and potentially better – meant the translation of digital-to-paper skill was on display at the Pro Tour yet again.



With play capability among the greatest in the digital world what force could stop it?



 According to him, luck had been on Andrea Mengucci's side throughout the weekend. A mainstay of the feature match arena through dominance of the King of the Hill throne on Day One, Mengucci maintained his power and prowess on Day Two to steal back the title for a round and earn his first Pro Tour Top 8. His R/G Elspeth deck was a **Magic Online**
*Theros* Block Constructed deck – something Nam surely saw and prepared for in testing – and Mengucci wasn't thrilled about facing decks that weren't the same as his: It had been mirror matches in the Constructed rounds where he found the greatest success.






*While the match-up appeared to be between two players with little Pro Tour experience, both have been turning heads all weekend. Andrea Mengucci has been at the top of the standings all weekend, while Nam Sung Wook recently eon a Grand Prix and has been a mainstay on **Magic Online** as "nsw".*
