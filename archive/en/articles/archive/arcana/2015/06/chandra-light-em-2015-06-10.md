[Chandra Nalaar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=393821) | Art by [Kev Walker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&artist=+%5b%22Kev%20Walker%22%5d)



Chandra has been lighting things on fire for some time now, but her [origin story is laid bare today for the first time](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/uncharted-realms/chandras-origin-fire-logic-2015-06-10). First debuted in *Lorwyn* as part of the original five Planeswalkers, Chandra has been featured in numerous cards and flavor text since then. Check out some of our favorite pieces of Chandra art.

[Seal of Fire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=393869) | Art by [Christopher Moeller](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&artist=+%5b%22Christopher%20Moeller%22%5d)



Chandra's version of subtlety: fire that explodes LATER rather than right away.

[Act on Impulse](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Act+on+Impulse) | Art by [Brad Rigney](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&artist=+%5b%22Brad%20Rigney%22%5d)



She isn't just a pyromancer—she's a pyromancer with a sense of *style.*

Chandra doesn't just light things on fire. She also conjures creatures made of fire to light things on fire.

Chandra doing what Chandra does best. Also check out [Flames of the Firebrand](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flames+of+the+Firebrand) and [Chandra's Fury](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chandra%27s+Fury).
