Blake is the content manager for DailyMTG.com, making him the one you should email if you have thoughts on the website, good or less good (or not good). He's a longtime coverage reporter and hasn't turned down a game of Magic in any format ever. 






For those of you keeping track at home (both of you), we promised you a pretty cool promo for participating in August's Friday Night *Magic*. Like July, we have another Modern staple for you. Like July, you're far more interested in reading about that than whatever introduction I type here. I could tell you about my weekend. I could discuss my variation on Esper Dragons. I could preview a card from *Magic Origins*. No one would notice.



Well, maybe not that last one. People would probably notice.



So, without further ado (and I do love my ado), here are the FNM Promo cards for June through August.

**June**



It's warm outside, but it's getting frosty at Friday Night *Magic* as Frost Walker, a tragically terrifying 4/1 Elemental, comes bounding to a June FNM near you.

**July**



Participate in an FNM in July and you might just walk away with one of the best removal spells ever printed. [Path to Exile](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Path+to+Exile) is a near-universal staple in Modern, and July will grant you an opportunity to stand out further from the pack with this new version, now featuring art from Raf Sarmento. In celebration of *Modern Masters 2015 Edition*, both July and August FNM promos will be Modern staples. What will August's be? Well, that's kind of the point of this Arcana. Read on!

**August**



Do you see? Do you see? Your vision of the future will be 20/20 come August when Serum Visions, with art by Dan Scott, comes to an FNM near you.
