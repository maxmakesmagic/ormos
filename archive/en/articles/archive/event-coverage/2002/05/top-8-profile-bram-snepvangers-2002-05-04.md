He's been on the Pro Tour for ages now, and has four Grand Prix Top 8 finishes under his belt. Still, this is his first Top 8 in the big show, although he has come close in the past, coming in tenth at Pro Tour Los Angeles 2001. The 26 year old from The Netherlands made his way to his first Sunday appearance with a strategy that was rather simple. "I just look at what's coming and try to take the best cards. I prefer green, but I don't need to draft it." The veteran isn't looking too far ahead, and is going to take his first time under the hot lights of the Top 8 stage one step at a time. "I have no expectations. It's difficult to predict what's going to happen before the draft." Regardless of what happens, Bram can go home happy with the knowledge that after all these years, he finally made it to Sunday.
