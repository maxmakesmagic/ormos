Following the lead of [Monday's Arcana](/en/articles/archive/basics-setting-2005-08-29), today we explore more of *Ravnica* through its amazing basic land art. We should point out that selecting only one sample of the four pieces for each basic land was incredibly difficult -- they're all beautiful.

Without further adieu, [Mountain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mountain) and [Swamp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swamp), you're up.
