The seven remaining finalists of the Great Designer Search 2 got the judges' feedback on their [last week](/en/articles/archive/gds2-episode-2-common-ground-2010-11-24-0). They were also given, concurrently with the audience, the [second Design Challenge](/en/articles/archive/gds2-episode-2-design-challenge-second-times-charm-2010-11-24-0). Each designer was asked to submit a set name and "logline" (updated as appropriate) and eighteen common card designs in a single color. They're working within the constraints of the "world designs" they submitted for the initial design test, with tweaks based on the judges' feedback and design suggestions from people on the [GDS2 page](http://community.wizards.com/magicthegathering/wiki/labs:Gds/gds2) of the **Magic** Wiki.
