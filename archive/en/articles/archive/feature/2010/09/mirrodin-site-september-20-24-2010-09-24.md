Welcome back to "On the Mirrodin Site," where we show off the week's highlights from the [Mirrodin Site](http://www.wizards.com/magic/mirrodin/). This site is going to have a lot of content, so if you fall behind, just stop by here for the scoop.


There's a wallpaper of [Kuldotha Phoenix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kuldotha+Phoenix), which popped up in [the Mountains](http://www.wizards.com/magic/mirrodin/#mountains,hotspots;R10;0;). And in [the Swamps](http://www.wizards.com/magic/mirrodin/#swamps,hotspots;B4;0;), concept art of Kuldotha gave some context.


And we have it on very good authority that the [Mirrodin Site](http://www.wizards.com/magic/mirrodin/) is going to have a very interesting set of changes early next week. You won't want to miss it!
