Heading to the Temple
=====================



 Posted in **Daily Deck**
 on February 17, 2014 










I'm as big a fan of dual lands as the next **Magic** player, and while I like the [shocklands](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoileramp;method=visualamp;action=advancedamp;format=+%5B%22Return+to+Ravnica+Block%22%5Damp;type=+%5B%22Land%22%5Damp;text=+%5Bpay%5D+%5B2%5D) of Ravnica just fine, I adore the [Temples](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoileramp;method=visualamp;action=advancedamp;format=+%5B%22Theros+Block%22%5Damp;type=+%5B%22Land%22%5Damp;name=+%5BTemple%5D) of Theros. Whenever I draft *Theros* block, I never pass a Temple, even if it isn't in any of my colors (so I guess note that if you ever draft with me). 

 Anyway, part of their appeal to me, beyond being dual lands and effectively giving me scry 1 for ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20211201201921im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless1.gif), is the art. Trick "went deep" on the art of [Temple of Mystery](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Temple+of+Mystery) [in this Arcana](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/magazine/article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/arcana/1332), but I wanted to take this opportunity to "go wide" and show off the eight Temples we have available to us right now. 

 We'll look at these alphabetically, because that is fair. And also I am an editorâ€¦
