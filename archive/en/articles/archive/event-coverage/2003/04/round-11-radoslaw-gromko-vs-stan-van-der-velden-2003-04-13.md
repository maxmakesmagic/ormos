### Game 1

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gppra03/a917.jpg)Radoslaw chose to play first with his black/red deck. The game started with an [Embalmed Brawler](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Embalmed+Brawler) turn 3 amplified 3 times on Radoslaw's side, which hits pretty hard for both players, followed by a turn 4 morph. Meanwhile Stan was fighting with his blue/green deck for mana as he didn't see a third land on his fourth turn, but was helped out by [Wirewood Elf](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wirewood+Elf).

To make matters worse, Rado played [Lay Waste](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lay+Waste) on Stan's only island, and the board looked bad for the Dutchman. But with [Birchlore Rangers](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Birchlore+Rangers) and a blocking [Stonewood Invoker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stonewood+Invoker) he was able to play [Caller of the Claw](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Caller+of+the+Claw) for 1 bear, after damage was dealt. A [Timberwatch Elf](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Timberwatch+Elf) followed on Stan's next main phase and he could attack for lethal damage on his next turn with [Wirewood Pride](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wirewood+Pride), as the zombie had already eaten 2/3 of Radoslaw's life total.

Stan van der Velden 1-0

### Game 2

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gppra03/a916.jpg)Radoslaw mulliganed his opening hand going first, but a [Withered Wretch](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Withered+Wretch) hit his side of the board turn 2. Stan's curve wasn't too shabby, as a turn 2 [Wirewood Elf](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wirewood+Elf) accelerated him into turn 3 [Snarling Undorak](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snarling+Undorak) and turn 4 [Krosan Vorine](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Krosan+Vorine), both of them making an abyss-like combo.

A feeding frenzy on a blocked [Krosan Vorine](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Krosan+Vorine) stopped it, at the cost of 2 cards. After a couple of inactive turns, Radoslaw played a real threat: [Imperial Hellkite](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Imperial+Hellkite). The dragon's empire didn't last very long, as Stan cycled [Choking Tethers](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Choking+Tethers), leaving Radoslaw with a tapped out board, letting Stan attack without fear of surprise effects.

**Final Result:** Stan van der Velden wins 2-0
