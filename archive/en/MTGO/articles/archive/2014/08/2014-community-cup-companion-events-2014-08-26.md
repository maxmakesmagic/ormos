There has been a lot of talk about the 2014 Community Cup lately, but what about those of you who voted the Community Team into their positions of power? The Community Cup is an event forged in the fires of the community's passion for its favorite trading card game, so why not some events for everyone in the community? How will you fill your time while you pore over the Community Cup coverage? How about by playing some *Magic*? *Magic Online* is hosting several companion events throughout the course of 2014 Community Cup coverage that the whole community will have a chance to join in on while you track the status of your chosen team.


I know what you're really thinking, though, in your heart of hearts.


"Gee, I sure wish *I* could trounce someone who works at Wizards of the Coast in a rousing game of *Magic: The Gathering*."


You're in luck! We will be running two kinds of special events during Community Cup weekend, beginning Friday, September 12—one of which will allow the community to take on Wizards employees.


Think you have the *Magic* chops to beat the folks in R&D at their own game? Good, I like the cut of your jib. You're in. The time? High noon (Pacific). The place? The Scheduled Events room. The format? Vintage Constructed. The prize? *Magic 2015* booster packs. Except for R&D. They don't get the booster packs. Check out the event table [below](#r&d) for all of the event details!


Maybe you're not into wild west Vintage Constructed duels. You’d prefer to see the democratic process in action instead of brawling with a Wizards employee like a hooligan —you're not the confrontational type. You spend your afternoons perusing sets past, looking for uncommons that were tragically underused in their day, all while utilizing a brandy snifter. You know what a brandy snifter is actually used for. Chess? Chinese Checkers? No thank you sir or ma'am. Your favorite mental enterprises are making the most out of a sealed pool and a hearty debate. If only someone would provide a forum in which you could postulate on why your favorite set of old should see more play.


Today is your day! Starting tomorrow, you’ll be able to get your vote on with the 2014 Community Cup Companion Events, a series of Sealed events using boosters from sets that are voted upon by the community. The first vote will open tomorrow, August 27, with multiple 24 hour voting windows between now and the beginning of events on September 13. Keep an eye on [Daily MTG](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles) for more voting details coming soon. As mentioned, Community Cup Companion Events will begin on Saturday, September 13, and run through Sunday, September 14, on the [schedule below](#companion).
