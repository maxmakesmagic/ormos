This past weekend, at Toy Fair, Funko announced that they are creating new vinyl figures of our Planeswalkers. From the [press release](http://company.wizards.com/content/funko-announces-licensing-agreement-wizards-coast-produce-magic-gathering-planeswalker):


*The first series of Pop! Vinyl figures, set to release in April, will feature iconic Magic: The Gathering Planeswalkers Jace Beleren, Garruk Wildspeaker, Chandra Nalaar, Liliana Vess, Ajani Goldmane, and Nissa Revane. Funko Pop! Vinyl figures are 3.75 inch tall super stylized vinyl figures.*

**Figures shown are prototypes and are not final.** 

*Funko is also excited to announce that we have teamed up with talented sculptors at Gentle Giant to create Funko's new Legacy Collection line of 6 inch, deluxe action figures featuring 20+ points of articulation and removable accessories for ages 14+. Set to release in August, the Magic: The Gathering Planeswalkers will be among the first Legacy Collection figures released, and you can expect the same iconic Planeswalkers as those released in Pop! Vinyl.*
