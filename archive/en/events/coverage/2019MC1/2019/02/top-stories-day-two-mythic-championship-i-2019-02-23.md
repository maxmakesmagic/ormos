Three rounds of Draft, five rounds of Standard, and finally we have our Top 8 here at the first Mythic Championship of the season in Cleveland. But there's a lot more than that going on this weekend, and these are the moments that stood out to us on Day Two.


Top 8 Set
=========


Talk about a star-studded Top 8. *Magic* Pro League members Reid Duke and Márcio Carvalho. A Hall of Famer in Luis Scott-Vargas. The English National Champion in Autumn Burchett. Grand Prix Top 8 regulars Michael Bonde, Yoshihiko Ikawa, and Alex Majlaton. And up-and-comer Julien Berteaux, who made the Top 8 of Grand Prix Warsaw in a breakout performance and personal best that he's now eclipsed.

The Day Two metagame was remarkably balanced—you can find [full details here](https://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/2019MC1/mythic-championship-i-day-two-metagame-breakdown-2019-02-23)—and the Top 8 didn't disappoint.


* Azorius Aggro
* Mono-Blue Tempo
* Mono-Blue Tempo
* Esper Control
* Simic Nexus
* Mono-Blue Tempo
* Gruul Aggro
* Izzet Phoenix

Don't forget that the Top 8 decks are only a snapshot—Draft makes up six of the sixteen rounds of the tournament—but it's worth noting that the most-played deck in the room at the start of the tournament didn't convert any pilots into the Top 8. Has the format figured out Sultai and its [Hydroid Krasis](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hydroid+Krasis)? Only time will tell, but we're sure to have a fun ride Sunday.


Reid Makes It Four
==================


Just about anyone who follows *Magic* knows who Reid Duke is. Yes, he's one of the best players in the world, a prolific content creator, and has a dazzling competitive resume. He made three Pro Tour Top 8 appearances before this weekend and his 23 Grand Prix Top 8s put him in the Top 10 in history. But for a player everyone agrees will one day be in the Hall of Fame, the truth is Duke probably needed one more Top 8 appearance to lock it in.


Consider that challenge conquered.


There's no doubt Duke has much higher aspirations for Sunday than just the Top 8 appearance, but his joy at finally earning that fourth finish was infectious as his friends and supporters from across the *Magic* world watched one of the game's greatest ambassadors secure his spot.

LSV Extends Streak
==================


No would ever deny that the Hall of Famer is one of the best to ever play the game. But the run Scott-Vargas is on is something that almost no one in *Magic* has *ever* accomplished, and something that hasn't been done in a *very* long time.



> 
> LSV has 5 Top 8s in the last 8 PTs/MCs he has played. What?!?! I can’t remember anything resembling a run that strong since before Magic Online existed. <https://t.co/Eiek6I9MUb>

This is his tenth Top 8 at this level, breaking a tie with Gabriel Nassif for fourth-most of all time. It's also coming on the heels of a disappointing finals loss at Pro Tour *Guilds of Ravnica*. With yet another Sunday appearance to add to his list, he may be able to one-up his previous finish and add a second championship trophy to his mantle.

Draft Master at It Again
========================


LSV isn't the only one putting together a streak—Carvalho advanced to his third Top 8 in his last four major events. He's longed been looked at as one of the best Limited players in the world, and he showed why this weekend. A pair of 3-0 finishes with blue-green-red decks showcased his ability to [adapt on the fly](https://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/2019MC1/6-0-drafters-mythic-championship-i-2019-02-23), and at this point his Top 8 opponents must be glad it will be Standard played in the elimination rounds.


Raph Goes Rogue
===============


Speaking of Standard, there's even more intrigue if you work your way down the standings a bit. Most pros expected Sultai to be the most represented deck coming into the tournament, so Hall of Famer Raphaël Lévy decided he was going to bring a deck that had a positive matchup against it.


It's safe to say that decision paid off.


<https://player.twitch.tv/?autoplay=false&video=v385639512>


Lévy finished with an overall record of 11-5, but his fish deck went 8-2 in Standard and 6-1 against Sultai. Just keep swimming, Raph.

Bolas Makes a Cameo
===================


As serious as the Mythic Championship is, there's always time to have a little fun. There's not much explanation required on this one—MagicFest is being hosted alongside the Mythic Championship, and it seems one Nicol Bolas decided to visit.
