Gordon Lin finished the Swiss rounds in second place with an 11-and-2 record having only one bye due to his ranking. This Taiwanese native currently lives in New Zealand and is attending Auckland University studying architecture. Despite doing much better his fellow countrymen at the Grand Prix, Gordon insisted that he was not the best player in New Zealand.



While he made second day at Grand Prix Taipei, Gordon is not used to doing quite this well at major tournaments with only one PTQ Top 8 to his name. He has been playing since Mirage when his older brother showed him how to play, but took a break for a little while and only re-entered the competitive scene earlier this year. While he doesn't have an organized team of any sort, he often plays with friends. They normally play at a store called "Heroes for Sale" in Auckland, but unfortunately it's closing soon.



Gordon hoped to play in the Grand Prix Trial on Friday but due to a change in location from the Centrepoint Convention Centre to the Hotel hosting the Invitational, he was unable to arrive on time. As the tournament didn't finish until seven in the morning, and Gordon is in 2nd place, it cannot be said that he has any regrets.



Gordon played a Pandeburst Replenish deck using four Mystical Tutors and no Attunements with four Phyrexian Negators in the sideboard! Throughout the tournament he had no problems except for a warning for using clear sleeves with beat-up cards. Gordon isn't used to playing at high level tournaments so he had never had a problem before. He got his revenge, however, as his opponent was given a warning for unsportsmanlike behavior as he tried to rules lawyer Gordon into trouble.



When asked the random question "What would you ban from Extended if given the chance?" Gordon quickly replied "Necropotence" and I think most players would agree as the field is full of the Skull and its dark powers. Gordon wasn't overly confident but hopes he can win. Being under the 1700 ratings flag guarantees that no matter what happens, Mr. Lim will be coming away from this tournament with a smile!
