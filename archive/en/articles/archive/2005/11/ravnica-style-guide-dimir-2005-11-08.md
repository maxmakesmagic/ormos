The Dimir are cunning, unseen manipulators, so the Dimir chapter of the *Ravnica* style guide is full of unpleasant spooks and the dreary places they haunt. Today we look at a few concept sketches from that very chapter, and some of the final *Ravnica* art that was inspired by it.

Combine Blue's mastery of metamagic and Black's ready access to undead troops, and you get the Dimir skeleton: a enlightened regenerator that aids its master find a more appropriate spell when necessary. Note how the cool hovering skull details suggests a more mystically empowered undead minion.

The Dimir walk among us, unseen but detectable through what they manipulate and steal. It's tough to see in this screen-width ([click here for Kev Walker's full art](http://media.wizards.com/legacy/migration/DimirCutpurse.jpg)), but the [Dimir Cutpurse](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dimir+Cutpurse) has its ghostly, rags-dressed arm right in an unsuspecting Ravnican's pocket. Creepy.

Exoskeletons. Ribcages. Assassin's blades made from sharpened bone. There's a lot of emphasis on exposed skeletal structure -- a dramatic twist on the secrecy of the guild. It suggests that, if you were ever to actually catch a [Glimpse the Unthinkable](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Glimpse%2Bthe%2BUnthinkable) of [Dimir Infiltrator](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dimir+Infiltrator) or [Roofstalker Wight](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Roofstalker+Wight), you'd be out of your mind with horror. Right before you died.
