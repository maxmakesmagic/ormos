With no premier events last weekend, there were no changes to our Top 25 Rankings. Traditionally, we never know which of our ranked players will be in with a chance of improving their position from week to week. We wait for the start list from each Grand Prix and see who has made it to the starting line. This week, we have an excellent idea of who will be competing for Pro Points, cold hard cash, and—crucial to us—national pride. Yes, it's the most wonderful time of the year: the week of the World *Magic* Cup, featuring teams from no fewer than 73 countries, all converging on the truly stunning setting of Barcelona, Spain. Nearly a full dozen of our Top 25 will be in action:


* No. 6 Paulo Vitor Damo da Rosa—Team Captain, Brazil
* No. 8 Mike Sigrist—Team Captain, USA
* No. 9 Alexander Hayne—Canada
* No.11 Ondřej Stráský—Team Captain, Czech Republic
* No. 13 Antonio Del Moral León—Team Captain, Spain
* No. 13 Shahar Shenhar—Team Captain, Israel
* No. 16 Yuuya Watanabe—Team Captain, Japan
* No. 17 Martin Müller—Denmark
* No. 18 Lee Shi Tian—Team Captain, Hong Kong
* No. 20 Shaun McLaren—Team Captain, Canada
* No. 22 Fabrizio Anteri—Team Captain, England
* No. 24 Joel Larsson—Team Captain, Sweden

It's no coincidence that at least half a dozen countries in that list are among the favorites for victory in Barcelona. We'll bring you all the news seven days from now, when we'll see who was able to take advantage of Team Sealed and Unified Standard to climb the rankings chart. Join us then!
