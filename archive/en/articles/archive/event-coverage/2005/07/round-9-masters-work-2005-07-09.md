Less than 24 hours ago, I was saying that if all I ever did were eat, sleep, and cover Eugene Harvey in feature matches, my life would be complete. My dream has now come true.


At 7-1 he is now facing Japanese superstar Masashi Oiso, who has a Top 8 in Columbus from this season and recently took the Grand Prix-Boston title out from under the Americans. And Saturday, his deck is quite ridiculous. A [Shuriken](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shuriken) with a couple of ninjas, a Jitte, [Undying Flames](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Undying+Flames), [Honden of Seeing Winds](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Honden+of+Seeing+Winds), and plenty of burn as well.


### Game 1


They presented their decks and the judges swooped in for a deck check. During the wait, photographer Craig Gibson attempted to entice Eugene into posing for some photos, but he would have none of it. "Give me like two hours, I need to wake up."


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/ptlon05/fm9_harvey.jpg)*Eugene is not ready for his close-up.*
Fourteen minutes later, the game was under way. Well, was until Eugene needed to mulligan. A couple more minutes of shuffling later, I blinked, and Oiso already had a tapped [Ninja of the Deep Hours](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ninja+of+the+Deep+Hours) that had hit off of an [Akki Avalanchers](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Akki+Avalanchers). Eugene just had turn-three [Kodama's Reach](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kodama%27s+Reach), not the best play when facing down Ophidian Ninja. Oiso just hit, drew a card, and added [Soratami Rainshaper](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soratami+Rainshaper).


Eugene played a fifth land and [Okina Nightwatch](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Okina+Nightwatch), but it was quickly back in his hand due to a [Mistblade Shinobi](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mistblade+Shinobi). Oiso then added [Descendant of Soramaro](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Descendant+of+Soramaro) and took four from the replayed Nightwatch. His Shinobi then threw a [Shuriken](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shuriken) at Eugene's [Kitsune Blademaster](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kitsune+Blademaster). Nightwatch rumbled in again and was double-blocked by [Akki Avalanchers](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Akki+Avalanchers) and [Descendant of Soramaro](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Descendant+of+Soramaro), but it found some [Inner Calm, Outer Strength](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inner+Calm%2C+Outer+Strength) to stay alive.


Rainshaper continued to flit across for two at a time while Eugene deployed more ground forces and tried to get through. [Kiri-Onna](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kiri-Onna) attempted to put a damper on that plan by bouncing the Nightwatch, and Eugene lapsed into thoughts, considering whether or not to counter the ability by sacrificing his [Moonlit Strider](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Moonlit+Strider). Eventually he did.


He had two more attacks but was only to push through six damage, taking Oiso to 10, before another Rainshaper attack and a [Spiraling Embers](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spiraling+Embers) ended it in favor of the young Japanese.


Masashi Oiso 1, Eugene Harvey 0


Between games, Eugene took out [Roar of Jukai](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Roar+of+Jukai) and [Stampeding Serow](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stampeding+Serow), and brought in [Mending Hands](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mending+Hands) and [Rending Vines](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rending+Vines). Oiso made no changes, confident in his maindeck.

### Game 2


Eugene had a turn-one [O-Naginata](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=O-Naginata), a very powerful card in a green deck, then followed it with [Petalmane Baku](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Petalmane+Baku) and [Humble Budoka](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Humble+Budoka). Oiso developed with [Akki Avalanchers](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Akki+Avalanchers) and [Brutal Deceiver](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brutal+Deceiver). The Budoka and the Deceiver traded and [Briarknit Kami](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Briarknit+Kami) found its way from Eugene's hand to the table.


Oiso, who had hardcast [Mistblade Shinobi](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mistblade+Shinobi) the turn before, commanded it to pick up a [Shuriken](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shuriken) and murder the [Petalmane Baku](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Petalmane+Baku), keeping Eugene off of his white mana (he had five forests). He then snuck in a [Ninja of the Deep Hours](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ninja+of+the+Deep+Hours) off of his Avalanchers and then set back Eugene with [Kiri-Onna](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kiri-Onna). When he took down [Briarknit Kami](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Briarknit+Kami) with a flurry of [Shuriken](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shuriken) from his two ninjas, Eugene had had more than enough and gave up. His white-green deck was hard pressed to deal with this kind of onslaught.


**Final Score**  
**Masashi Oiso 2, Eugene Harvey 0**
