Welcome to Commander Week! This week we're going to be talking about the Commander format as opposed to the ***Magic: The Gathering** Commander* product that was just released last week. (I [talked about it](/magic/magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/mm/146) two weeks ago.) I'm going to run you through the major rules for deck construction and game play adding in many comments about what I, from a designer's perspective, see as the strengths and weaknesses of the format. (Note there are a lot more strengths than weaknesses, which is why this format is so popular right now.)

Before I begin I want to make several things very clear:

1. Everything I'm in saying today is my opinion. I am not speaking for Wizards of the Coast or anyone other than myself.
2. My perspective today is from the vantage point of a designer. I am focusing on what aspects make the format fun and accessible.
3. I have never played the Commander format (outside of a tiny amount of playtesting for ***Magic: The Gathering** Commander*). I have watched numerous games being played, so I have a general sense of how the format plays, but I am far from an expert. Note that I'm not going to talk about how it plays, but rather about Commander as a format from a theoretical standpoint.
4. I am not personally a big fan of multiplayer play (probably the biggest reason behind #3), but part of my job is to understand what players unlike myself want so that I can help deliver it.

All the official rules (which can be found [here](http://mtgcommander.net/rules.php)) are bolded in blue, while my comments are in black.

**Deck Construction**

I'm going to start with comments before I even get to the first rule, the reason being that I think one of the most important parts of this format has already been covered with just a single word. While every Constructed format has deckbuilding, the only real restriction for most formats is the cards allowed in it.
