Midweek Magic: A New Take on FNM at Home on MTG Arena
=====================================================

We first launched FNM at Home in March of 2020 because players around the world weren't able to keep in touch with their local game store in the usual ways. We wanted to keep the Friday Night Magic fun alive, even when we couldn't engage in "The Gathering." Thankfully, in-store play is available again in many locations, with more and more stores again offering in-person FNM.


With this in mind, we want FNM to go back to being a unique in-store experience, but we also want to continue the fun of MTG Arena's FNM at Home event.


So, we have updated our FNM at Home event to take place Tuesdays and Wednesdays, lengthening it slightly so it's easier to play in, and renamed it Midweek *Magic*(announced in the [July 2021 State of the Game article](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/magic-digital/mtg-arena-state-game-adventures-forgotten-realms-2021-07-02)). It keeps the same structure, with no entry and two ICRs (individual card rewards) as rewards, and you will still be able to contact your favorite local game store for a code, either online or (where safe) in person. But now, you'll be able to play in these fun *MTG Arena* events, and you're free to spend FNM with your friends at your local game store.


Local Game Store Reward Codes
=============================


You can contact your favorite local game store for a Midweek *Magic* code, either online or (where safe) in person, that can be redeemed for extra in-game rewards. You'll be able to redeem up to one code every week, and each code redemption will reward you two in-game cosmetic items.

**How to Get a Reward Code from Your Store**
--------------------------------------------


Some stores have robust online communities, and others may be forming them for the first time. If you're already part of such a community, great! Check with them and get connected.


If you aren't part of a local game store's online community, or if they don't have one set up, there are a couple ways you can get connected. One is to simply reach out to your store and ask. Another is to head to [locator.wizards.com](https://locator.wizards.com/) to find your local game store's website. Many of them have set up online communities through [Discord](https://discordapp.com/), [WhatsApp](https://www.whatsapp.com/), and [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/), so you may have to join or download one of those applications.


Here's how it works:


1. Play in the event (win or lose as much as you want)
2. Take a screenshot of your event page
3. Go to [locator.wizards.com](https://locator.wizards.com/) to find your local game store's website
4. Join their social media channel
5. Share your screenshot with a nice message on their channel
6. Your store will message you a code\* through that social media channel

*\*Note: While supplies last. Not all stores are participating. Limit one code per account. Sharing a screenshot with your local game store does not guarantee you will receive a code.*
