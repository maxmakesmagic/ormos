With the next few weeks of Grand Prix and coverage nearly locked, it's time to look toward two other exciting sets of events. One comprises the store-based Regional Pro Tour Qualifiers, where players will be competing for invitations to [Pro Tour *Amonkhet*](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/premierplay/protour/ptakh). The other involves a very sweet digital festival and a special something for *Magic* players who either plan to attend or may want to go.


RPTQs for Pro Tour *Amonkhet*
=============================


Regional Pro Tour Qualifiers (RPTQs) for Pro Tour *Amonkhet* begin this weekend, giving players from all over the world who earned their entrance through the last round of Preliminary Pro Tour Qualifiers a chance at making their way to *Magic*'s big stage!


RPTQs take place in sixteen cities all around the world this weekend, and another sixteen take place next weekend. The format for this round of RPTQs is Standard. For the exact locations and dates, please refer to the [RPTQs for Pro Tour *Amonkhet* information page](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/instoreplay/rptqakh).


All players who participate in a Regional Pro Tour Qualifier this round will receive an event-exclusive promo card featuring [Emrakul, the Aeons Torn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Emrakul%2C+the+Aeons+Torn) in alternate art as well as a deck box.

The Top 4 players from each in-person RPTQ will receive invitations and airfare to compete in Pro Tour *Amonkhet*, hosted in Nashville, Tennessee, May 12–14.


In addition to these, there will be two RPTQs hosted on *Magic Online*, with the first taking place March 4 and the other taking place March 11. For specific information on these RPTQs, including the number of invitations up for grabs and additional prizing details, please visit the information page link above.


Not qualified for this round, but interested in getting in on the action for Pro Tour *Hour of Devastation* later this year? Preliminary Pro Tour Qualifiers are going on *now* at game stores worldwide, so [check here](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/instoreplay/pptqhou) for more information and check with your local store to see if one is coming up near you!


Top decklists from this round of RPTQS will be posted on March 9, in two weeks.


*Magic* at Dreamhack
====================


Fan of e-sports? Like playing *Magic*? How about ***both***?


Then you should check out Dreamhack's events in the United States this year because Cascade Games and Dreamhack have teamed up to bring you *Magic* at what has become one of the coolest showcases of all things e-sports and video games in recent years.


Starting with Dreamhack Austin April 28–30, attendees can participate in *Magic* events all weekend, featuring a robust side event schedule and a prize wall where you can redeem your tickets for some sweet swag. Of course, if you're looking for a little more, I have good news for you.


On Friday and Saturday, scheduled events will help you on your path to the grand finals on Sunday. Any player who scores four wins in a single scheduled event automatically gains entry into Sunday's grand finals, where players will participate in a 64-person Draft event that features a $10,000 prize pool.


Participating in these events earns players points on a leaderboard, and after Friday and Saturday have concluded, any remaining seats in the 64-person Draft event on Sunday will be awarded to the top players on the leaderboard.
