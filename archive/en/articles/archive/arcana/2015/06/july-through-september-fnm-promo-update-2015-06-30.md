After two months of Modern staples as Friday Night *Magic* promos, September returns us to the world of Standard with a new promo from *Dragons of Tarkir*. First, let's start with those two major Modern months.


**July**


Participate in an FNM in July, and you might just walk away with one of the best removal spells ever printed. Path to Exile is a near-universal staple in Modern, and July will grant you an opportunity to stand out further from the pack with this new version—now featuring art from Raf Sarmento.

**August**


Do you see? Do you see? Your vision of the future will be 20/20 come August, when [Serum Visions](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Serum+Visions)—with art by Dan Scott—comes to an FNM near you.

**September**


The trip back to Standard will be softened with this sturdy Bird Monk, [Orator of Ojutai](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Orator+of+Ojutai)—the Dragoniest [Wall of Omens](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wall+of+Omens) ever. You'll be able to get your copy come September, whether you choose to employ Dragons or some other inferior creatures to do so.
