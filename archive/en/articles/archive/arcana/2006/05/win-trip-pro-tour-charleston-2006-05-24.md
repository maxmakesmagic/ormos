Today's Magic Arcana is proud to introduce Jake Theis with a special announcement.


Â 



### Here Comes Charleston!


![Jake Theis](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/mtgcom/arcana1000/1013_jaketheis.jpg)*Jake Theis, your new best buddy*We (the sneaky marketing types behind the Magic Brand) have hatched a plan. We are going to show an exclusive *Coldsnap* preview card during the Pro Tour-Charleston coverage sometime during the event, which is June 16-18. During the coverage, you will get a first glimpse of the icy goodness known as *Coldsnap*.


Why would anyone want to miss out on such a preview? Well, what if you're not at your computer because you won a trip to Charleston instead!


Beginning right damn now, we are going to start an absolutely free sweepstakes to send you and a buddy to Pro Tour-Charleston. You will receive free roundtrip airfare, free hotel accommodations, a behind-the-scenes look at the Pro Tour, entrance into the swanky, exclusive Pro Player Lounge, free admission to a dozen side events, and a $50 gift bag from our Retail Pro Shop. Not bad for entering in your name and clicking a mouse, huh?


We sent young aspiring Pro Player Tyler Jones off to a Pro Tour [earlier this year](/en/articles/archive/pt-honolulu-giveaway-winner-2006-02-27), and listen to his rave review, "The sweepstakes was even more gracious than needed! At the end of the weekend we hadn't used even close to the allotted 12 free side-events."


Don't wait to enter, because this contest ends next Thursday. Do to the compressed timeframe of this sweepstakes, entrance is open only to U.S. and Canadian citizens over 18 years of age. [Read the official rules here](/en/articles/archive/sweepstakes-official-rules-2006-05-24).


If you win, my comrade, co-conspirator, and fellow assistant brand manager, Andy Smith, will even kick in two free Charleston Chews. You can hassle him for your candy, too, because he will be hanging out at the Pro Tour all weekend long.


Good luck!



The Pro Tour Charleston contest is now closed.
