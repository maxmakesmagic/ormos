*Magic Online* Pro Tour Qualifiers consist of a set of Preliminaries that grant invitations to the PTQ Finals. Winners of PTQ Finals receive invitations to the associated Pro Tour as well as the associated Pro Tour Challenge.


There are two formats for PTQ events: Limited and Standard. Limited Preliminaries lead to Limited Finals, while Standard Preliminaries lead to Standard Finals.


*Magic Online* hosts sixteen Pro Tour Qualifier Finals, one following each set of Preliminaries. Players may participate in as many PTQ Preliminaries as they like, but can only earn a single invitation to the PTQ Finals. Participation in *Magic Online* PTQ Preliminaries and Finals is open only to players who have not been invited to the associated Pro Tour.


Invitations won via *Magic Online* PTQ Preliminaries qualify you for a single associated PTQ Final held later in the week. Invitations to PTQ Finals will not be transferred.


It's almost a new yearâ€”make a resolution to get on the Pro Tour!
