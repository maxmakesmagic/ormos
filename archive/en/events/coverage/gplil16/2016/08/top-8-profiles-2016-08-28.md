**Age:** 24


**Occupation:** Student


**Hometown:** Leiden, Netherlands


**Previous Magic accomplishments:**


One Grand Prix Top 8 (Antwerp), one Pro Tour Top 8 (Dragons of Tarkir), permanent WMCQ winner, Gold level.


**What deck did you play and why?**


[Death's Shadow](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Death%27s+Shadow) Zoo. It's the deck I know best and it's good against all non-Jund decks with few exceptions.


**What changes would you make to your deck and why?**


Add one extra [Faith's Shield](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Faith%27s+Shield), it's very good. I would also like to cut [Steppe Lynx](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Steppe+Lynx) since it's pretty bad but there's no attractive alternative.


**What's the most important card in your deck?**


[Death's Shadow](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Death%27s+Shadow). No contest.

**Previous Magic accomplishments:**


Nothing.


**What deck did you play and why?**


Red-Green [Through the Breach](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Through+the+Breach). The deck is well positioned in the metagame. It reminds me a lot of the time I was playing [Summer Bloom](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Summer+Bloom), it's just a bit slower.


**What changes would you make to your deck and why?**


Nothing, it's awesome!


**What's the most important card in your deck?**


[Primeval Titan](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Primeval+Titan). And my aubergine ahah!

Add two more [Eldrazi Skyspawner](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eldrazi+Skyspawner)s. Beat turn-two [Blood Moon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Moon) twice with it, and it's good in the mirror.
