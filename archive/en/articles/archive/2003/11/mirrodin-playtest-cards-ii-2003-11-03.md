You've seen the common [Replica cycle](http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=magic/cardlist/mirrodin&tablefilter=replica) in *Mirrodin*; you've read Randy's [discussion](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/daily/rb91) over their colored activations; you've seen them [in action](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=sideboard/gpkc03/finals) at the top tables of *Mirrodin* limited tournaments. But each one of these useful artifact creatures went through major or minor tweaking during design and development. Take a look at these playtest versions of this cycle - we think you'll be pleased with the agressive ways they turned out. (Click each playtest card to see the finished *Mirrodin* version.)
