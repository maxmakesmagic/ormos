More Guilds, More Gold.
-----------------------


The *Gatecrash* set is the second in the *Return to Ravnica* block, the long-awaited return to the city-plane of Ravnica and its ten ancient two-color guilds. Five of those guilds were featured in the *Return to Ravnica* set. *Gatecrash* brings the remaining five guilds to the forefront—Orzhov, Dimir, Gruul, Boros, and Simic. Though the guilds rule Ravnica, they aren’t the only ones who walk its streets. The guildless of Ravnica come from all walks of life—soldiers and street urchins, peddlers and Planeswalkers— all with only one thing in common: they want nothing to do with the guilds.


Play Even Sooner!
-----------------


**Magic Online** Prerelease events begin on February 8, at 10:00 AM, and will run through the weekend. As soon as the Prereleases end Monday morning at 10:00 AM, *Gatecrash* will be available in the **Magic Online** Store. *Gatecrash* Release Event queues (Sealed Deck and Draft) will begin at the same time the set goes on sale so players won't have to wait before jumping into a draft!


Choose your Guild!
------------------


Ten guilds, each aligned with two of the five colors of magic, are vying for control of the vast city-world of Ravnica. This conflict carries over from *Return to Ravnica* to the Prerelease of *Gatecrash*. When you head to [your friendly local game store for the *Gatecrash* Prerelease](http://www.wizards.com/magic/tcg/events.aspx?x=mtgcom/events/prerelease-facts), you will declare your allegiance and get a corresponding Guild Prerelease Pack that includes five *Gatecrash* boosters, a guild-specific booster pack, and your Prerelease promo card (along with some other goodies).


The **Magic Online** experience is very similar. You'll purchase the Guild Mark for your favorite guild from the **Magic Online** Store for $5.00 USD, and then use that Guild Mark plus 20 Event Tickets to enter the *Gatecrash* Prerelease Sealed Deck Queue. Your Guild Mark will determine which guild booster pack and Prerelease card you get and, just like paper, you will be able to use your Prerelease card in your deck! You can check out the Guild Marks and Prerelease promo cards below. To learn more about the guilds, visit [GuildsofRavnica.com](/en/node/640376).

Play with the Pros
------------------


While you draft *Gatecrash*, don't miss your chance to also [watch live coverage](http://www.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Events.aspx?x=mtgevent/webcast/home) of Pro Tour *Gatecrash* in Montreal. Like a deck the pros are playing? Use the deck export feature to import your favorite [Standard list](/en/articles/archive/2009-06-29) right into **Magic Online** as soon as it is available.

Although players may have multiple accounts qualified for the *Gatecrash* Release Events Championship, players are not permitted to have more than one of their accounts entered in any single event at one time. Players are not permitted to have any accounts entered in events played by other players for any reason. If a player is discovered to have more than one account playing in any end-of-season championship or championship event before, during, or after the event, Wizards may take action against that player's account(s), up to and including disqualification with no refund of product and/or event tickets, suspension of the offending account(s), and/or termination of the offending account(s).


Using an account other than your own, allowing any other player to use your account, selling your account, and other similar actions are all violations of the [Magic Online User Agreement](http://www.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/%20http:/wizards.custhelp.com/cgi-bin/wizards.cfg/php/enduser/std_adp.php?p_faqid=1358). If you play in **Magic Online** events, win, and expect to get your prize, be very, very sure you are playing on your own account. We do not recognize excuses, such as "I and a friend jointly own the account," "It's my brother's account but he gave it to me," or similar. The only exception is an adult may authorize a single dependent child age 13-18 to play on an account that the adult has established.


It will be the player's responsibility to make sure that he or she has been properly entered into this event and is able to join it PRIOR to the start of the Championship. If a player is qualified and is unable to join the Championship, he or she will need to contact customer service for assistance.


**For all *Gatecrash* Release Events, Wizards of the Coast may modify, suspend, and/or cancel an event, substitute prizes, or change the costs and/or schedule for an event without notice, at its sole discretion.**
