Hello and welcome to another edition of Building on a Budget. [Last week](/en/articles/archive/building-budget/love-me-tender-2009-05-06)'s deck was very well received. I'm always excited to see what my readers have to say, and I'm starting to feel like I have a better understanding of what you guys are looking for. 

This week I'd like to look at one of my favorite cards from the new set.

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/boab/boab38_glorySplash.jpg)  
[Glory of Warfare](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glory+of+Warfare) was initially previewed at Top8magic.com, Brian David-Marshall's web site. Brian is a good friend of mine and he called me the day of the preview. 

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/boab/boab38_phoneCall.jpg)"Hey, Jacob, did you see the card we previewed today?"

"Yeah, it looks like a pretty nice one."

"I especially like how it has the potential to make 'bad' cards competitive. Think about how good it is with Goats."

"Goats?"

"Yeah, Jake. Think about it. [Springjack Shepherd](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Springjack+Shepherd) and [Springjack Pasture](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Springjack+Pasture)." 

"Wow, I really like that."

Since that conversation I've had a lot of time to think about killing people with goats. There isn't really anything better when you think about it.

Question: What is better?




1. Ice Cream
2. Killing people with Goats.

Answer: B. Killing people with Goats.

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/boab/boab38_goatSplash.jpg)  
Yes, killing an opponent with Goats seems to have edged out ice cream on my list of "best" things. I've decided that a Goat deck is an absolute must given our circumstances. 

I'll start by explaining each of the card choices. 

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/boab/boab38_theCardsHeader.jpg)  
**[Glory of Warfare](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glory+of+Warfare):** Making Goats into dangerous monsters is very important. It's also nice to completely blank our opponent's [Infest](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Infest) and [Pyroclasm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyroclasm).

**[Springjack Shepherd](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Springjack+Shepherd):** Goats aren't the most intelligent creatures. If we just let our Goats waltz around without direction there's little chance they will have any idea who they should be attacking or blocking. In an effort to keep our Goats well disciplined I've decided to run a full four copies of the Shepherd. 

**[Cloudgoat Ranger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloudgoat+Ranger):** Okay, let's think about this. She's a giant. Se rides a flying goat. She has a bunch of Kithkin that help her get into the air. She fits our theme and she's just a downright awesome card.

**[Hearthfire Hobgoblin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hearthfire+Hobgoblin):** Goblins love Goats. It's a little awkward, but they just can't get enough. (Of the Goats.) We all know about the Goat obsession. Ever since Wizards printed [Goatnapper](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goatnapper) in *Lorwyn* we've been plunged into the world of Goat / Goblin romance. 

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/boab/boab38_theCardsCross1.jpg)  
**[Knight of Meadowgrain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Knight+of+Meadowgrain):** Goats get lost. It's obnoxious, but it's something we've come to live with. [Knight of Meadowgrain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Knight+of+Meadowgrain) will bring the Goats back home for us. 

**[Burrenton Forge-Tender](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Burrenton+Forge-Tender):** There's nothing Goats hate more than a well-timed [Volcanic Fallout](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Volcanic+Fallout). [Burrenton Forge-Tender](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Burrenton+Forge-Tender) protects our Goats from red mass removalâ€”extremely important in today's Standard. 

**[Kitchen Finks](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kitchen+Finks):** Those pesky Finks are always getting into my kitchen. The thing is; I've already accepted a favor from these guys. Read the flavor text and you'll understand what I'm talking about here.

**[Sigiled Paladin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sigiled+Paladin):** [Sigiled Paladin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sigiled+Paladin) is an incredible two-drop. I'm quite surprised it hasn't seen more play since its Standard legality began. I ran a full four copies of this fine Knight in my Standard deck at [Worlds](/en/articles/archive/event-coverage/japanese-coverage-2008-magic-world-championships-2008-12-11). I really think this card has what it takes to make the cut. It makes attacking with [Hearthfire Hobgoblin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hearthfire+Hobgoblin) a lot more impressive when it's attacking into a crowded board while we hide behind our Goat tokens.

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/boab/boab38_theCardsCross2.jpg)  
**[Furystoke Giant](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Furystoke+Giant):** I found a way to make our Goats very angry. You don't want to see what Goats do when they get angry. 

**[Rise of the Hobgoblins](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rise+of+the+Hobgoblins):** I've already talked about the way Goblins always stare at my Goats. Green-White Tokens seems to be one of the best and certainly the most played archetype. Rise gives us a lot of game against this type of deck, and the first strike it grants is extremely relevant. Goats with first strike are exceptionally good pets. 

**[Springjack Pasture](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Springjack+Pasture):** Our deck is very good at not running out of gas. [Springjack Pasture](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Springjack+Pasture) is another way to ensure that we're pumping out Goats every turn. 

**[Ancient Amphitheater](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ancient+Amphitheater):** [Furystoke Giant](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Furystoke+Giant) and [Cloudgoat Ranger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloudgoat+Ranger) are Giants, so there's a somewhat reasonable chance we can play our Amphitheater untapped. This is a definite four-of in a deck like this.

Once we play around with the numbers, our Goat deck looks like this:

The sideboard is pretty straightforward. The [Goatnapper](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goatnapper)s are on theme and they have great synergy with our [Springjack Pasture](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Springjack+Pasture). We can steal [Chameleon Colossus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chameleon+Colossus), attack with it, and then sacrifice it for some mana and life. Seems like a lot of fun to me. 

I took my goats into the casual room to play a few matches.

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/boab/boab38_jundHack.jpg)I lose the roll and keep [Ancient Amphitheater](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ancient+Amphitheater), [Plains](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plains), [Mountain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mountain), [Burrenton Forge-Tender](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Burrenton+Forge-Tender), [Knight of Meadowgrain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Knight+of+Meadowgrain), [Hearthfire Hobgoblin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hearthfire+Hobgoblin), and [Springjack Shepherd](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Springjack+Shepherd) on the draw. My opponent plays a [Tattermunge Maniac](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tattermunge+Maniac) and passes. I draw [Furystoke Giant](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Furystoke+Giant), play my [Burrenton Forge-Tender](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Burrenton+Forge-Tender), and pass the turn. My opponent plays a [Jund Hackblade](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jund+Hackblade) and attacks with both of his creatures. I block the [Tattermunge Maniac](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tattermunge+Maniac) and take 3. I draw another [Ancient Amphitheater](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ancient+Amphitheater), play my [Knight of Meadowgrain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Knight+of+Meadowgrain) and pass the turn back to my opponent. My opponent plays a [Boggart Ram-Gang](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Boggart+Ram-Gang) and passes the turn back. I draw a [Springjack Pasture](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Springjack+Pasture), play my [Hearthfire Hobgoblin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hearthfire+Hobgoblin), and pass the turn back to my opponent. My opponent plays another Ram-Gang and attacks with both of his 3/3 wither goblins. I block one with my [Burrenton Forge-Tender](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Burrenton+Forge-Tender) and take 3. I untap and draw another [Springjack Shepherd](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Springjack+Shepherd). I play the first Shepherd and put seven Goats into play, attack with my [Knight of Meadowgrain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Knight+of+Meadowgrain) and [Hearthfire Hobgoblin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hearthfire+Hobgoblin), and pass the turn back to my opponent. My opponent attacks me with his team, I block one creature with my Forge-Tender and go to 10; in his second main he casts [Volcanic Fallout](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Volcanic+Fallout), I sacrifice my Forge-Tender to prevent the damage. On my turn I play [Furystoke Giant](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Furystoke+Giant), and my Goats shoot my opponent to death.

My opponent struggles to find a profitable block. He fiddles around with his blocks for a few minutes and says, "I'm way too far behind, gg."

In review, I really enjoyed the Goat deck. I think [Glory of Warfare](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glory+of+Warfare) is a strong card that deserves more than a glance. If you're into silly theme decks that can actually win some matches then this deck is probably for you. 

Happy brewing!
