That was one heck of a Pro Tour, wasn't it? Out of the over 450 players that came to Honolulu, Hawaii, to take their best shot on *Magic*'s big stage, Shota Yasooka ultimately came out on top to win the title, the trophy, and the $50,000 first-place prize.


Pro Tour *Kaladesh* showcased a Standard Constructed format that is unlike anything we've seen in recent years, with the full spectrum of speedy aggro, inventive combo, and intricate control in full force. And to think that was just the first huge look at Standard. We'll have an opportunity to see where the format goes from here this weekend at [Grand Prix Kuala Lumpur](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/premierplay/grandprix/fact-sheet-gpkl16) and [Providence](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/premierplay/grandprix/fact-sheet-gppro16), and many others will have their chance to explore this format following the Pro Tour at a Game Day [near them](http://locator.wizards.com/).


But first...


Enter the Battlefield: The Series
=================================


Nathan Holt and Shawn Kornhauser's latest project made its debut at Pro Tour *Kaladesh* last weekend. Following their feature-length documentary, which you can find on Netflix, YouTube, Google Play, and Amazon Video, *Enter the Battlefield* has become a documentary series that will explore even more of high-level *Magic*'s personalities.


The series kicked off with *Enter the Battlefield: Roanoke*, a two-part series looking into the lives of 2016 World Champion Brian Braun-Duin along with Brad Nelson and the crew that plays, tests, and works around *Magic* in Roanoke, Virginia.


You can watch Part 1 and Part 2 below.
