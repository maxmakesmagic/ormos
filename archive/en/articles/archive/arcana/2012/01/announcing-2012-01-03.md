Standard rotates once each year, with the release of the October large set. ***Magic** 2013* will enter Standard on its release without knocking anything out, then ***Magic** 2012* and *Scars of Mirrodin* block will leave Standard with the release of "Hook." The Standard format between ***Magic** 2013* and "Hook" will consist of *Scars of Mirrodin* block, *Innistrad* block, ***Magic** 2012*, and ***Magic** 2013*. After the release of "Hook," it will consist of *Innistrad* Block, ***Magic** 2013*, and "Hook."
