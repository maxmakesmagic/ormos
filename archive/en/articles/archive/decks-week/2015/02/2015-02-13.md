Last weekend highlighted the Modern format as players gathered in Washington, DC, to compete in Pro Tour *Fate Reforged*. The Top 8 featured a list of serious heavy-hitters on [the Top 25](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/top-25/2015-02-12), but it was ultimately Spain's Antonio Del Moral León who took home the trophy, earning Spain its first Pro Tour victory in *Magic* history.



With the event now behind us, there are plenty of decklists to reflect on. In fact, we've got more than 100 Modern decks for you to browse through, including a few unique options in the "Going Rogue" article that may be the springboard into the next big thing. And, of course, if you'd like to take a look at all the coverage from Pro Tour *Fate Reforged*, [head over here and start reading](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/ptfrf).



Meanwhile, the Pro Tour Qualifier (PTQ) season for Pro Tour *Dragons of Tarkir* is nearing its conclusion. If you want to join us in Brussels, Belgium, April 10–12, don't miss out on one of the remaining PTQs left to compete in. [Find one to play in today](http://magic.wizards.com/en/protour/qualifierlist)!
