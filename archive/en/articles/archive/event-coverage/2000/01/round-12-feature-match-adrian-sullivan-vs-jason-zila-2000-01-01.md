This match paired two players who weekends have been very good. They both were sitting at 8-3 with aspirations of making Top 8. Jason's tiebreakers were terrible and was most likely in the role of spoiler as opposed to making top 8. Jason has had great success in the past and has had a comeback of sorts with a second place finishing at the New York Masters. Adrian has a reputation for playing decks that are out of the ordinary such as when he finished 9th in PT NY 99 playing mono red in a Tinker and Fluctuator field.


The game was delayed as a deck check occurred, and that was followed by an Adrian mulligan. Zila played Llanowar Elf, Kavu Titan, Kavu Titan and a Rishadan Port for the first 3 turns. Adrian was only able to play lands and did not even cast any manipulation spells. Turn 5 a Thornscape Battlemage with kicker entered played and Adrian was unable to counter it. Adrian cast a Magpie, watched Zila tap his creatures and started shuffling for game 2.


Sullivan 0 - Zila 1


The second game started off rather uneventful for Adrian and a Kavu Titan hit play for Zila again. Zila went for a Thornscape Battlemage without kicker and it was countered. The next turn somehow a Blastoderm resolved and the Titan just kept coming. Adrian tried to slow down the beats by casting a Magpie, but it just ran face first into an Urza's Rage. Adrian Washed Out the board and Zila busted out two Titans and a bird.


Adrian busted out a Magpie but a Ghitu Fire took down the defenses once again and the Grizzly Bears just kept coming over. Adrian washed out one more time, but the Titans were relentless and just kept coming. A Magpie came down for a moment but it's life was Terminated shortly as was Adrian's.


Sullivan 0 - Zila 2


Adrian's deck was rather good for the match up but the Glacial Walls decide they were too afraid of the Ogres and bears to come out and play. The games were over very quickly mainly cause of Adrian's poor draws.
