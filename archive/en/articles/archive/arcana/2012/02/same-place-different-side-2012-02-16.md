When *Innistrad* introduced double-faced cards to **Magic**, we did [an arcana](/en/articles/archive/two-sides-2011-09-21) that showed how some of the cards showed exactly the same location on each side. *Dark Ascension* doesn't have as many precse images like that, but it does have [Huntmaster of the Fells](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Huntmaster+of+the+Fells), who moonlights (ha!) as a [Ravager](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ravager).

Another example is [Mondronen Shaman](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mondronen+Shaman) and [Tovolar's Magehunter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tovolar%27s+Magehunter). When these pieces of art were [shown in a previous arcana](/en/articles/archive/alternate-launch-party-art-2012-02-02), they were separated and you weren't looking at the background. This time, watch the church in the background. It's a whole new experience!

On [Soul Seizer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soul+Seizer) and [Ghastly Haunting](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ghastly+Haunting), Lucas Graciano uses a changed version of the same location. The candles have been extinguished and the frame is slightly tilted to heighten the feeling of an unsettling scene.
