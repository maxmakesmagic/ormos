 Working in R&D since '95, Mark became Magic head designer in '03. His hobbies: spending time with family, writing about Magic in all mediums, and creating short bios. 







We're coming into the final stretch (it turns out a non-creature artifact has a lot fewer decisions than a creature) of “You Make the Card #2”. And we finally have a name. No more [Gazarsgo's Plow]. The second card created by the people is going to be called… Crucible of Worlds.


![Crucible of Worlds](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/mtgcom/articles/ymtc2_crucible_noflava.jpg)Here's how the voting came out:

| Harvest Clock | 953 | 11.07% |
| **TOTAL** | **8610** | **100.00%** |

Now it's time for one final piece - flavor text. We've templated the rules text and we know we have enough space for three lines of flavor text. This will allow all of you burgeoning writers out there a little more space than [Forgotten Ancient](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forgotten+Ancient) allowed. Be aware that the maximum length of three lines is 120 characters (and once again, that counts everything - letters, punctuation, even spaces). For more flavor text tips, check out Rei Nakazawa's “[Adding a Little Flavor](/en/articles/archive/tales-beyond-veil-2005-06-13)” article.


As with other creative elements, we have to limit each person to a single submission. Note that any flavor text that is over 120 characters will not be considered. Deadline for submissions will be Friday, October 10th.


Ron Spencer is working on the final art. We'll have one more step to select the flavor text and then Crucible of Worlds will be complete.


Good luck with your writing. We'll see you in a couple weeks.
