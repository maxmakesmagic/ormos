An epic battle among the Xu family, both players with identical surnames (and incidentally good friends) have sat down at the Featured Match area. Both players are at a 6-2 record and another win here would give the victor ample breathing space for the Constructed portion.


Xu Liang made the Top 8 of China Nationals last year and was looking to repeat the feat again. Xu Bin was no slouch either, being an ex-Nationals Top 8 player himself. In addition, he is currently the second highest rated player in China (at a whooping 2029 total rating) and it was common consensus that Xu Bin could possibly be the most adept and proficient CawBlade player in China, already a little achievement on its own. A huge crowd gathered to watch this match between two Titans of the Chinese Magic community.


### Game 1


Xu Liang busted out of the gates with [Origin Spellbomb](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Origin+Spellbomb), [Leonin Skyhunter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leonin+Skyhunter), [Wall of Tanglecord](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wall+of%C2%A0Tanglecord) and [Ghalma's Warden](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ghalma%27s+Warden) while Xu Bin could only manage [Blinding Souleater](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blinding+Souleater) and pass with five lands in play.


Xu Liang added [Lumengrid Gargoyle](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lumengrid+Gargoyle) and attacked with his team and Xu Bin got the annoying Myr off his back with [Instill Infection](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Instill+Infection) and then used [Divine Offering](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Divine+Offering) to gun down the 4/4 flier.


Xu Liang simply replaced it with [Wing Splicer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wing+Splicer) but his opponent was quick to kill the Splicer with [Virulent Wound](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Virulent+Wound) and blink the token into oblivion with [Glimmerpoint Stag](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glimmerpoint+Stag). After which, he stuck [Lashwrithe](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lashwrithe) onto his [Vault Skirge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vault+Skirge), creating a 5/5 lifelinking monstrosity which took the game within the next few turns.

### Game 2


In view of the terrifying [Lashwrithe](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lashwrithe), Xu Liang added a red splash to his deck to support [Shatter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shatter) and [Victorious Destruction](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Victorious+Destruction) and elected to play first. First cycling [Origin Spellbomb](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Origin+Spellbomb) then adding [Wall of Tanglecord](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wall+of+Tanglecord), Xu Liang could only watch as his opponent build a board of [Shrine of Limitless Power](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shrine+of+Limitless+Power), [Skinwing](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skinwing) and [Lashwrithe](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lashwrithe).


Xu Bin wasted no time in paying four life to turn the Germ token into a 5/5 flier (and growing) and on his next turn wiped Xu Liang's hand of four cards away. Now playing from only the top of his deck, Xu Liang struggled to find a solution to [Lashwrithe](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lashwrithe). However, it was not to be and the eventual 9/9 [Skinwing](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skinwing) ended the game faster than the speed of light.
