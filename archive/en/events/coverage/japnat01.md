![National Championships Logo](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/nationals_sm.jpg)![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/JPNAT01/351F.jpg)As the over-used saying goes, "There can be only one." At the end of 12 rounds of competition plus Top 8 playoffs, one player from among 151 has been crowned with one of the most prestigious titles a **Magic** player can earn: National Champion. Going undefeated in Saturday's draft and 4-2 in Sunday's Standard portion, Goro Matsuo has been crowned 2001 Japan National Champion. He will lead the Japanese National Team, consisting of Finalist Min-Su Kim and Masahiko Morita, at the Team Event at Worlds in Toronto this year, and takes home $10,000 in prizes.
