The dust has settled from Day 1, and 20 teams have emerged from the original 191 to claim their spots in Day 2. 


At the top of the heap stands the only undefeated trio: **Your Move Games**. A combination of two of the most successful Pro Tour teams, the original **YMG** (Darwin Kastle, Rob Dougherty) and **Illuminati** (Alex Shvartsman), they made it through two deckbuilds and eight swiss rounds to emerge with a perfect record. Following hot on their heels are Steve Wolfman's **Aquamoebas Anonymous,** and **Zabutan Nemonauts**, who Mike Turian hopes will bring him to a second GP victory in a row.


Emerging through Pikula sightings and other blasts from the past was Jon Finkel, who slipped into Day 2 on the team **Re-Elect Gore**. He and teammates Eric Froelich and Brian Kibler finished Day 1 with a 7-1 record, and look to make a run for the top 4 tomorrow. Brother teams had decent success, as well: Steve and Dan OMS brought their team **Word of Mouth** into the top 20, and Gabe and Terry Tsang managed to hit 17th in **Truly Lazy Men**. And rounding out the top 20, squeaking in with a 6-2 record, was the team of Krempels, Fabiano and Sonne, **D.G in D.C.**



Despite a grueling first day the DCI judges are ready for another full day of tournament action with the top teams in D.C. Join them tomorrow to see who conquers the Battle in the Capitol in the showdown of the top 20!
