**This promotion ended on December 15, 2011.**

Looking for the alternate-art Liliana Vess or alternate-art Garruk Wildspeaker? We're sorry, but the original promotion has ended. See the terms and conditions for the PlayStation速 3 [here](/en/articles/archive/duels-planeswalkers-ps3-official-terms-2010-11-01), for the XBox [here](/en/articles/archive/duels-planeswalkers-xbox-official-terms-2011-06-07), and for Steam [here](/en/articles/archive/duels-planeswalkers-steam-official-terms-2011-06-07).

However, there will be a new opportunity to get a foil **Magic: The Gathering** card! **Duels of the Planeswalkers** 2012 will be available on June 15\*. And with it, a new crop of promo cards!

If you purchase [**Duels of the Planeswalkers** 2012](/en/articles/archive/duels-planeswalkers-2012-2011-03-10) when it comes out this summer (and we're hoping you do!), if eligible, you'll get an in-game code for a voucher you can redeem at your local participating game store for a physical promo card. There are three different cards, depending on which platform you're using. \*

\* Release date may vary by platform and region. Cards are available while supplies last. Void where prohibited. See the [official terms](/en/articles/archive/duels-planeswalkers-official-terms-2008-12-16).
