Last April 1st, I let you all in on the news that *Unhinged*  was coming out. Many players bemoaned the fact that the set’s release was so far away. Well, that day is over. Maybe “over” is a bit strong. That day is close to being over. A week from this Friday (November 19, 2004 for those that like numbers) *Unhinged* will finally be released. 


The good news is that we’re finally close enough to the release that **magicthegathering.com** can start talking about it. And not just super-oblique hints - actual information (okay, and some more teasing too). For example, we are previewing a card every day from now until the set’s release (well, except Sunday). And today in [my column](/en/articles/archive/making-magic/un-starts-now-2004-11-08) I even outline the basics of what the set will contain. 


But probably the coolest thing is the return of the **[Orb of Insight](javascript:makeWinXY('/magic/orbofinsight_unhinged_4809.asp',%20450,%20640))**. For those that have never had the pleasure of experiencing the Orb, here’s how it works. You tell the Orb a word (or number) and it tells you how many times that word shows up in *Unhinged* (with the one exception of the flavor text - we don’t want to mislead you on what some cards might do). The Orb covers card titles, mana cost (using letters for mana cost; counterspell would be UU, for example), card types, rules text, reminder text, artist credits and power/toughness.


With infinite monkeys and infinite time, the Orb would tell you the entire *Unhinged* set (well, except the flavor text and this is one set that you wouldn’t want to miss the flavor text). We like to think of the Orb as a little game for the readers to see how much all of you can figure out about the set. Just remember that *Unhinged* is no ordinary set. (Check out my [preview card](/en/articles/archive/making-magic/un-starts-now-2004-11-08) today if you don’t believe me.) 


Anyway, we have lots of fun things planned for you during the next two weeks. And then the real fun begins when *Unhinged* finally comes out. And then there’s even more fun the next day (Saturday, November 20, 2004) when *Unhinged* has release tournaments around the globe (more info on this as the preview weeks continue).


So have fun before you have fun.


 Enjoy,


 Mark Rosewater
