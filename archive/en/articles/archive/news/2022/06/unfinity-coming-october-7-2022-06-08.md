Step right up! Step right up to the most unbelievable space carnival in the *un-*iverse! October 7 is the new April 1, our updated release planned for *Unfinity* at a [local game store near you](https://locator.wizards.com/). So, Mark (Rosewater) your calendar for October 7 when the fourth *Un-* set finally gets its day in the sun.


And because it's been a minute since we showed you what *Unfinity* has in store, you may want to revisit [the sneak peek we shared all the way back in November](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/making-magic/unfinity-and-beyond-2021-11-29).
