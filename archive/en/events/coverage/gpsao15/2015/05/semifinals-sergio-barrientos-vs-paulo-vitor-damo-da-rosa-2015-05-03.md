After winning a close game in the Quarterfinals, Sergio Barrientos finds himself playing against Paulo Vitor Damo da Rosa in the Semifinals. Hot on his heels from a finish at Grand Prix Krakow, Damo da Rosa showed no sign of slowing down with his trusty Esper Dragons deck. Both players wished each other good luck and began shuffling up.

**Game One**



Damo da Rosa had missed his fourth land drop, only to face an “end of turn” Boon Satyr. He dissolved [Surrak, the Hunt Caller](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Surrak%2C+the+Hunt+Caller) and countered [Whisperwood Elemental](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Whisperwood+Elemental) with Silumgar's Scorn.


The clock was ticking away and Damo da Rosa had already taken three hits from Boon Satyr. Despite that, Damo da Rosa had all the answers he needed. Killing a second copy of [Whisperwood Elemental](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Whisperwood+Elemental) with Hero's Downfall, he stabilized next turn with a timely Crux of Fate.

*Sergio Barrientos tries to get to the finish line, but falls short.*



When Barrientos presented Dragonlord Atarka, Damo da Rosa evicted it with [Foul-Tongue Invocation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Foul-Tongue+Invocation) and dropped [Silumgar, the Drifting Death](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Silumgar%2C+the+Drifting+Death) onto the board. Using Ashiok, [Nightmare](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nightmare) Weaver to put [Whisperwood Elemental](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Whisperwood+Elemental) into play, Damo da Rosa sealed the game (while holding Dissolve) before Barrientos could topdeck anything disastrous.



**Sergio Barrientos 0 - Paulo Vitor Damo da Rosa 1**



**Game Two**


Damo da Rosa was forced to mulligan to five this game, keeping a hand with five lands. Aside from the pair of Scrylands, Damo da Rosa was playing from the top of his deck.



Barrientos was able to capitalize on the clumsy hand with Boon Satyr, but he wasn't in good shape either. [Thoughtseize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtseize) revealed that he had a bunch of five mana cards in his hand, so Damo da Rosa wasted no time killing Elvish Mystic.





Damo da Rosa eventually tapped out for Dragonlord Ojutai, taking one final hit from Boon Satyr. He was down to 2 life and had to tread carefully. Regardless, he found [Ultimate Price](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ultimate+Price) for the [Boon Satyr](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Boon+Satyr) and with Barrientos unable to cast anything from his hand, [Dragonlord Ojutai](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragonlord+Ojutai) swooped in to claim yet another victim.



**Sergio Barrientos 0 - Paulo Vitor Damo da Rosa 2**
