Commander Laws for Public Gatherings
====================================



 Posted in [Serious Fun](/en/articles/columns/serious-fun-archive)

Let's start with the obvious. It's Azorius Week, an ode to joy for pontification, bureaucracy, declarations, and [*Robert's Rules of Order*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert%27s_Rules_of_Order). The lawmakers of *Ravnica* have an agenda: making all of Ravnica as discrete and orderly as an agenda. 

I'm sure they're all members of *Ravnica*'s Tautology Club, too.

While I am a fanatic of the Boros Legion, the guild I enjoy next is Azorius. As a mathematician, I can confirm that there's beauty in rules, interlacing and determining deep structures and functions that helpfully drive our entire modern world.

While we didn't have an official Tautology Club at my college, I was part of a study group that had settled on that as our nickname.

 What I want to share today is something with less levity and more importance. In honor of the Azorius, I'm hitting a topic I've been asked to discuss for some time: the Commander experience at events like a Grand Prix. If it's a public place where **Magic** is happening, the odds of finding Commander are pretty good. 

 Doing your part to ensure that Commander action is awesome for *everyone* takes five rules. 

Rule 1: Follow the Banned List and Other Commander Rules
