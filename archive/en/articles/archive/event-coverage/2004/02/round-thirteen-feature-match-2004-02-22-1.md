Raphael played an [Auriok Glaivemaster](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Auriok+Glaivemaster) and [Vulshok Gauntlets](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vulshok+Gauntlets), while Raul used a [Skullclamp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skullclamp) on his [Gold Myr](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gold+Myr) and [Nim Replica](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nim+Replica) to draw cards. Raul cast [Cobalt Golem](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cobalt+Golem), and Raphael's response was a [Titanium Golem](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Titanium+Golem) and a Rustpore Ram on the [Skullclamp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skullclamp).

The Spanish equiped his golem with a [Specter's Shroud](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Specter%27s+Shroud) and flew over Raphael's army. Next turn an [Essence Drain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Essence+Drain) took care of the [Cobalt Golem](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cobalt+Golem) and an attack put Raul at eleven life.

Another [Cobalt Golem](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cobalt+Golem) came along and brought with him a [Goblin Dirigible](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Dirigible). Raphael played another Vulshok Gantlets and started attacking with some of his creatures and moved the gauntlets around his creatures, forcing Raul to sacrifice some of his creatures. When Raphael added an [Whispersilk Cloak](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Whispersilk+Cloak) to his array of equipment not even Raul's [Betrayal of Flesh](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Betrayal+of+Flesh) could keep him from losing the game.

### Game 2

Raul's explosive start of two [Vedalken Engineer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vedalken+Engineer)s, [Spire Golem](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spire+Golem), [Cobalt Golem](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cobalt+Golem) and [Nim Devourer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nim+Devourer) had to deal with a Leonin Den Guard equiped with [Vulshok Gauntlets](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vulshok+Gauntlets).

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gpmad04/r14fm1_2.jpg)They started a race for damage, with Raphael using an [Essence Drain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Essence+Drain) on the [Cobalt Golem](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cobalt+Golem), an [Echoing Decay](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Echoing+Decay) on the Nim and Raul casting a [Betrayal of Flesh](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Betrayal+of+Flesh) with entwine on the guard, bringing the Nim back to life.

Raphael played a [Leonin Skyhunter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leonin+Skyhunter) and then a Luminous angel and there was nothing Raul could do.
