I hope you were able to attend a *Kaladesh* Prerelease last weekend, because this set is a blast to play. *Magic*'s brand new expansion hits stores on Friday, and I'm sure many of you are looking forward to the drafting and brewing that will follow!


As *Kaladesh* releases, I'm turning my attention to the fourth quarter of 2016. We've confirmed coverage teams for the rest of the year and wanted to provide you with a comprehensive list of what to expect for October, November, and December.


But first...


Additional GP and PT Swag (including GP and PT t-shirts)
========================================================


There were a couple of Grand Prix–specific items that did not make it into last week's article that I'd like to highlight. This will also include December 2016's Grand Prix playmats.


First up is not a playmat, but rather this awesome t-shirt.

The Grand Prix t-shirt that you'll find at GP prize walls features some very, very sweet Chandra artwork. The back of the shirt will display all Grand Prix that are part of the current GP season where you can get this shirt, in keeping with an artwork and general shirt style that pays tribute to band tour shirts. Rock on!


In addition to that, here are December's Grand Prix playmats, starting off with Denver and Madrid, featuring the art from Ghirapur Orrery.

And finally, Grand Prix Milwaukee will feature a playmat with artwork from Skyship Stalker.

These playmats are available for players who participate in the main event of that weekend (while supplies last). For more info on how to get a playmat at a Grand Prix you're going to, visit the organizer's website for more information.


The Grand Prix isn't the only event with some cool swag, though. [Pro Tour *Kaladesh*](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/premierplay/protour/ptkld) in Honolulu, Hawaii, will offer some additional opportunities to pick up a few items that made their debut in the merch booth at PAX West, along with a few event-exclusives.


First up is the Torch of Defiance t-shirt, along with a messenger bag. Both feature badass custom Chandra artwork and some fantastic work from our team.

The very Kaladeshian Planeswalker logo will also be at the Pro Tour.

Along with this cool water bottle featuring, well, who else but Chandra.

And finally, this event-exclusive playmat will only be available at Pro Tour *Kaladesh*. If you're qualified and going, get it quickly, because these always tend to disappear quickly into the weekend!

The merch booth will also have the usual items, such as mana t-shirts, notebooks, hats, and a new Pro Tour shirt for the 2016-17 season. Remember that the Pro Tour is open to the public (though there aren't any side events), so if you're a local or a competitor or just traveling with friends to enjoy the Hawaiian Islands, stop by to pick up some awesome and hard-to-get stuff!


Confirmed Coverage Line-ups
===========================


Last week, I had hinted at the rest of Q4's coverage teams being locked down. I'm happy to say that the rest of this year's teams have been organized, and today I'll bring you the list of who's covering where through the end of the 2016.

New Leaderboard Layout
======================


Meanwhile, we have made a long desired and overdue change to how we have tracked Player of the Year and many other races in the premier play season. What was once the Player of the Year page has transformed into the [Premier Play Leaderboard](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/top-players/statistics/2016-17-leaderboard), a comprehensive, in-depth look at:


* The Pro Point leaders of the 2016–17 premier play season
* The nationality and geo regions of all players on the leaderboard
* Detailed statistics on players on the leaderboard including the number of Pro Tour and Grand Prix Top 8s that player has gotten, along with the most match points earned in one of those respective events
* The number of Grand Prix Pro Point finishes that count toward a player's Pro Points in the 2016–17 season, with regard to the cap of the six best Grand Prix finishes

The goals of this new leaderboard are:


* To provide a look at all potential prospective World Championship and World *Magic* Cup seats in one sortable sheet that also addresses potential tiebreaker scenarios
* To help educate a player on where they stand in those respective races without needing to do their own work to check

The 2016–17 Premier Play Leaderboard will typically be updated on Tuesdays following a Grand Prix, Pro Tour, World Championship, or World *Magic* Cup event. If you regularly participate in these events and want to know how you're stacking up against the world's competitors, against your country's competitors for a World *Magic* Cup slot, and more, I strongly advise bookmarking that page. It will be the definitive source that we use to track Pro Tour Players Club levels and seats at invitation-only events.
