We have good news for PC users: [*Duels of the Planeswalkers*](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=magic/digital/duelsoftheplaneswalkers.aspx) is now available for PC Users via Steam! All you have to do to play *Duels of the Planeswalkers* on your PC is to go to [Steam](http://www.steampowered.com/) and set up an account. 


Not enough of an enticement? Well, what if we were to throw in a foil promo card?

Yes, that's a foil [Nissa Revane](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nissa+Revane). And you want one.


Here's how to get one. If you are eligible to receive the promo card (see [Terms & Conditions](/en/articles/archive/duels-planeswalkers-official-terms-2008-12-16)) then select **View Games Library** off of the **Games** tab on your Steam window, right click on Magic: The Gathering – Duels of the Planeswalkers and click on **Register your game** to register. Grab yours now before they are gone! (while supplies last – restrictions apply)


Duels of the Planeswalkers players will enjoy the benefits of the Steamworks's features included in all PC versions, such as auto-updating, Steam Achievements, Leaderboards, downloadable content, ability to access from any computer, multiplayer matchmaking and more. More information is available in the [official press release](http://archive.wizards.com/company/press.aspx?x=wz/press/44)
