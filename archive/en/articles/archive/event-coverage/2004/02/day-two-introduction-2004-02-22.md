Almost all of the 128 players who secured a slot today managed to crawl their way back to the gaming floor despite finishing yesterday's last round in the wee hours of the morning. 

Most of the big names are still around today, even if they're a bit lower on the tables than they're accustomed to. Those that survived yesterdays slaughter are rewarded with what's bound to be another grueling day of drafting, deckbuilding, and fierce competition as the biggest Grand Prix in history battles it out for the cash and the Pro Tour invites. 

With so many unknown players will the old pros be able to claim victory or will it be a young upstart who starts his pro career with a win here today? 

We'll bring you the answers to these questions and all the action from the tournament floor as it happens, so keep your browser here for the most up-to-the-minute updates from Madrid.
