 Brian David-Marshall is a New York–based game designer who has been involved with Magic since 1994, when he started organizing tournaments and ran a Manhattan game store. Since then, he has been a judge, a player, and one of the longest-tenured columnists on DailyMTG.com, as he enters his second decade writing for the site. He is also the Pro Tour Historian and one of the commentators for the Pro Tour. 





Kenny Öberg shows off his innovative Birthing Pod deck in *Scars of Mirrodin*  Block Constructed. A combination of a [Grand Architect](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grand+Architect) deck and a [Birthing Pod](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Birthing+Pod+)  deck, it's capable of explosive starts.
