Special Alchemy Events
======================


**Premier Draft New Capenna Alchemy: June 2–6**


Here's an opportunity to get Alchemy cards through drafting! In this special event, players draft three packs of *Streets of New Capenna*, but one common card in each pack is replaced with a card from *Alchemy: New Capenna*. This card can be any rarity, so some packs will have multiple rares!


Each Draft pack contains one card from *Alchemy: New Capenna*.


* 55% of packs contain an uncommon card.
* 38.57% of packs contain a rare card.
* 6.43% of packs contain a mythic rare card.
* Each rare appears twice as often as each mythic rare.

Premier Draft New Capenna Alchemy has the same entry and payouts as the familiar Premier Draft events and awards *Alchemy: New Capenna* packs. The usual Premier Draft New Capenna event will remain available throughout the weekend as well.


*Alchemy: New Capenna* packs will also now be awarded by Alchemy events, traditional Alchemy events, and the upcoming Alchemy Metagame Challenge for those who want to stick to Constructed play.


**Into the Future: June 2–4**


Try out the latest additions to *MTG Arena*! Into the Future is happening this week, June 2–4, with preconstructed decks that spotlight new cards and their capabilities. This event has no entry fee, awards *Alchemy: New Capenna* packs, and earns you 1,000 Mastery XP for participating!
