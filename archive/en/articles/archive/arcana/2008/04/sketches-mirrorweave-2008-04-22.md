One of the cards in *Shadowmoor* takes one creature and makes all other creatures copies of it. And as the art for [Mirrorweave](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mirrorweave) shows, that can have some odd consequences in their everyday lives.

### 1. Art Description

Here's what Jim Pavelec was given to work with:


> 
> Location: Kithkin walled town  
>  Action: Show a kithkin town square with many kithkin going about their business -- walking, selling goods, doing chores, standing guard, etc. There's a catch, though: All the kithkin are exactly the same. It's like a town populated entirely of clones of one kithkin.   
>  Focus: The identical kithkin everywhere.  
>  Mood: Creepy, surreal, like a waking dream
> 
> 
> 

### 2. Sketches

Jim's first sketch shows the aftermath of a [Mirrorweave](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mirrorweave), with one bearded kithkin populating an entire town:

![Mirrorweave Initial Sketch](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/mtgcom/arcana1000/1574_sketcha.jpg)That's certainly a lot of that one guy. But at this point, it could just be some kithkin that all happen to have beards and similar cloaks. So Jim pushed it a bit:

![Mirrorweave Second Sketch](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/mtgcom/arcana1000/1574_sketchb.jpg)Aha! Now there's a kithkin with a stroller. Not to indulge in stereotypes, but it seems like there's a pretty good chance that that's a *mother* with a beard. And although we can't see into the stroller, there's a pretty good chance that the tiny arm is attached to a baby kithkin . . . with a beard.

### 3. Final Art

The final version adds some shadows and ominous coloring, as well as making it clear that the kithkin with a stroller is wearing a dress (underneath the cloak that everyone else is also wearing). And the baby is still there and probably still bearded.

Here is the card as you can see it in booster packs.
