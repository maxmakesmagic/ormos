In a desiccated post-apocalyptic world, representing "islands" can be a challenge. We've seen how vegetation is almost nil on contemporary Dominaria-today we take a look at how many bodies of water have seeped away as well.


Check out these concept illustrations from the *Time Spiral* style guide.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/mtgcom/arcana/1288_si1.jpg)*Illustration by Jeremy Jarvis*These islands are the result of the devastated land coughing up enormous volcanic eruptions. When the magma cooled, they formed tunnels of igneous rock. Then the gases from those eruptions corrupted the clouds, creating storms of acid rain that fell around them, in turn creating sickly pools. These are the islands of *Time Spiral* Block.

Check out the background of cards like [Aeon Chronicler](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aeon+Chronicler), [Veiling Oddity](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Veiling+Oddity), [Clockspinning](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Clockspinning), [Errant Ephemeron](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Errant+Ephemeron), [Tolarian Sentinel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tolarian+Sentinel), or of course the basic [Island](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island) cards from *Time Spiral*.
