In the *[Champions of Kamigawa](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/displayexpansion.asp?set=chk&page=1)* storyline, the Kami War has already devastated the plains surrounding Eiganjo Castle. Attacks by the kami have turned the fields surrounding the castle into a battered, pockmarked plain -- not unlike the surface of the moon -- called the Araba.


Here's a great look at the blasted Araba in Greg Staples' art of one of the basic Plains from *Champions of Kamigawa*:
