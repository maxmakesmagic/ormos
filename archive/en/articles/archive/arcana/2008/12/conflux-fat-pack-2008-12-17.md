Yesterday, we showed off the [*Conflux* booster packs](/en/articles/archive/conflux-booster-packs-2008-12-16). Remember? It was just yesterday. Ah, good times. Anyway, we were wondering if maybe you were looking for a Pack that was a bit more ... *Fat*.

Say hello to the *Conflux* Fat Pack! It's a handsome package, to be sure. Check out that handsome mural (PS: That dragon is Nicol Bolas, who is a planeswalker). But what wonders are within?

* Eight (yes, *eight!*) boosters,
* One card box,
* The *Conflux* Player's Guide, which contains play tips, story background, and a complete visual spoiler of every card in the set,
* A learn-to-play insert,
* A sample chapter from *Agents of Artifice*,
* A pack of 40 basic land,
* And a *Conflux* Spindown Life Counter!

A fella could have a pretty good weekend in Vegas with all that stuff!
