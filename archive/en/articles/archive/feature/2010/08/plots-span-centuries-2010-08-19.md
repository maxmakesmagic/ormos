Yyou know all about *Archenemy*, right? After all, you have [Gatherer](http://gatherer.wizards.com) available. And you can see [all 45 schemes](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?action=advanced&set=+%5B%22Archenemy%22%5D&type=+%5BScheme%5D&special=true&output=spoiler&method=visual) at any time!


Well, there are a few more schemes. Promotional schemes, if you will. And we're going to show one of them to you right ... *now*.


### Plots That Span Centuries


This was given out at *Archenemy* Release Events, which were held over the weekend of June 18-20, 2010.
