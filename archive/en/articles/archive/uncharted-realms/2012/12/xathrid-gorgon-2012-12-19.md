*Hey, it's Jenna. Here's one of my favorite columns. It's also my last for a while. I've been tasked with some other writing projects (exciting!) that you'll hear more about soon. Beginning next year, the awesome Mr. [Adam Lee](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/magazine/archive.aspx?author=Adam%20Lee) will be holding the reins. I've sincerely enjoyed writing these stories and populating the streets of* Ravnica *with the likes of [Ruzi, Kuma](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/magazine/article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/ur/216), [Javy](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/magazine/article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/ur/211), and [Mr. Taz](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/magazine/article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/ur/204). You've been a wonderful audience, and I thank you for how much you crave the stories of the Multiverse.*
