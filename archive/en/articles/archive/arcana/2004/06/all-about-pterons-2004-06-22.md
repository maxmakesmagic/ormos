On the plane of Mirrodin, a pteron is a pterodactyl-like flying creature that soars the skies above the Razor Fields. You've probably heard their name on the card [Pteron Ghost](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pteron+Ghost), but there are better illustrations of (living) pterons on other cards. 

That's because leonin skyhunters use pterons as mounts. Any cat creature with flying in *Mirrodin* block is depicted on a pteron mount. Check out [Skyhunter Cub](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skyhunter+Cub), [Skyhunter Patrol](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skyhunter+Patrol), [Leonin Skyhunter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leonin+Skyhunter), [Skyhunter Prowler](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skyhunter+Prowler) and [Skyhunter Skirmisher](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skyhunter+Skirmisher).

![Skyhunter Prowler](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Skyhunter+Prowler)There's at least one more place that a pteron is depicted in *Mirrodin* block art. Check out what's being fried in the art of *Fifth Dawn's* 
[Magma Jet](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Magma+Jet). Tastes like chicken?
