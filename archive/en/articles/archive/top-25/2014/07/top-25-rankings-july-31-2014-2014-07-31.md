It's time for the big one here at the *Magic* Top 25 Pro Rankings. All the Grand Prix from this mammoth season of Pro *Magic* are over. No more broken Sealed decks, no more Top 8s with no byes, no more 6–0 Day Two runs to sneak into a Top 8 that starts ten minutes after Round 15. Everything done and dusted—except for one everything-on-the-line epic in Portland this weekend, as [Pro Tour *Magic 2015*](/content/fact-sheet-pro-tour-magic-2015) rounds out the season in spectacular fashion.



At the top of the rankings, it could barely be tighter, with a miniscule 0.15% separating No. 1 Reid Duke from No. 2 Jérémy Dezani. These two seem certain to be locked in battle for the [Player of the Year race](http://magic.wizards.com/en/protour/standings/poy201314), having built up such a lead over the likes of Stanislav Cifka (No. 3), Josh Utter-Leyton (No. 4), and Owen Turtenwald (No. 5), that only a combination of stellar finish and staggering meltdown can combine to steal the title away from one of the big two.



As we we get ready to embark on the next season of Pro *Magic* immediately following the conclusion of Pro Tour *Magic 2015*, this Top 25 is likely to see many changes as a result of the tumultuous events in Portland. As it stands on the eve of battle, sixteen North Americans, five Europeans, and four from the Asia-Pacific region have combined to represent all that is good about the pinnacle of our global game. While the Canadian Jacob Wilson made a move last weekend from No. 19 up to No. 15, the majority of the players in our Top 25 were already turning their attention to Portland and the big finish.



So who will emerge as the No. 1 once the final card is turned sideways on Sunday at Pro Tour *Magic 2015*? Join us next week, when we take our final look of the season at the *Magic* Top 25 Pro Rankings.
