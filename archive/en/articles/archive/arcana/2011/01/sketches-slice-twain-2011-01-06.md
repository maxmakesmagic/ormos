Welcome back to once again to Sketches! Today, we're going to look at the effect color has when it's applied to a black-and-white sketch. Here's a spoiler: it makes things look neat!

### Artist Portfolio

Artist [Efrem Palacios](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?action=advanced&artist=+%5B%22Efrem%20Palacios%22%5D) is new to **Magic: The Gathering** art. His first card was [Garruk's Companion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Garruk%27s+Companion) in ***Magic** 2011*, and he's got five more cards in *Scars of Mirrodin*.

### Art Description

The first step of the creation of a card's art is its art description. The art description tells the artist what the card will do, what its flavor is, and what the mood of the illustration should be. Here were the instructions Efrem was given for [Slice in Twain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Slice+in+Twain):


> 
> Color: Green spell
> 
> 
> Action: We see a Golem that's just been cleanly sliced through by a glowing elvish sword. The sword is wielded by a "steelbane," an elvish warrior who hunts down artifact creatures. 
> 
> 
> Focus: the fact that the golem is destroyed in one blow
> 
> 
> Mood: Prowess with a blade combined with a shaman's magic
> 
> 
> 

### Sketch

Armed with that art description, Efrem submitted a sketch to **Magic**'s creative team.

### Final Art

The creative team liked the action in the piece, and sketch was approved. When the color came in, the final version really popped.
