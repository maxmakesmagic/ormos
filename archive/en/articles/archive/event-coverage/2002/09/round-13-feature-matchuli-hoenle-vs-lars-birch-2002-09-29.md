![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gpham02/898.jpg)Both Uli Hoenle and Lars Birch have competed on the Pro Tour although not to great success yet. German Hoenle scraped into day two by the slightest of margins. He finished 65th only for someone to drop out. Birch from Denmark also had tough start. He had one bye and after round three was 1-1-1.

Hoenle is playing blue-black [Upheaval](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Upheaval) while Birch is running a Wake deck.

As expected the build up was fairly slow. Birch Speculated three [Deep Analysis](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deep+Analysis) into the Graveyard while Hoenle gained 3 cards off [Standstill](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Standstill). The first shots fired were when Birch wished for a [Ray of Revelation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ray+of+Revelation) to take out [Compulsion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Compulsion).

Birch then went for three successive [Mirari's Wake](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mirari%27s+Wake). The first two were [Syncopate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Syncopate)d and the third stopped by [Circular Logic](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Circular+Logic). Then Hoenle pulled off a savage trick when he wished for Plagiarise, cast it in Birch’s draw step to steal his card and then sacrificed Coliseum so that Birch had to discard three while he got the cards. Probe – OBC style!

Hoenle’s first Tog vanished to [Syncopate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Syncopate) but a second stayed on the table. The card advantage wars continued as Hoenle drew 4 off [Skeletal Scrying](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skeletal+Scrying). Then he cast [Standstill](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Standstill) to make it even sillier. Birch wished in response for a [Moment's Peace](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Moment%27s+Peace) but he didn’t have enough mana to cast it and the Tog went Lethal.

Hoenle 1-0 Birch

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gpham02/899.jpg)Game 2 saw another steady build up. Hoenle dropped an early [Standstill](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Standstill) but Birch didn’t feel the need to crack it as he used two [Krosan Verge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Krosan+Verge)s to ramp up his mana and then dropped a [Nantuko Monastery](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nantuko+Monastery). In his end step Birch started to hold back cards to discard to head towards threshold to get the monastery online.

Seeing this Hoenle had to break his own [Standstill](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Standstill). He went for [Mirari](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mirari), which Birch [Syncopate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Syncopate)d. There was short [Syncopate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Syncopate) war over a [Cunning Wish](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cunning+Wish) from Hoenle. Hoenle won and fetched a [Skeletal Scrying](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skeletal+Scrying) from the board. This tapped him out and allowed Birch to drop a [Mirari's Wake](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mirari%27s+Wake) and have access to a ridiculous amount of mana. A second followed and then [Mirari](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mirari) itself. With [Compulsion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Compulsion) on the table Birch was in a very strong position and kept knocking chunks out of Hoenle’s life total with the Monastery.

Hoenle went for a Tog but when Birch burst it in response to his subsequent [Standstill](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Standstill) the German conceded.

Birch - “Having uncounterable beatsticks is a good thing.”

Hoenle 1-1 Birch

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gpham02/900.jpg)Birch attempted turn two [Compulsion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Compulsion) only for Hoenle to [Syncopate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Syncopate) it. This time [Standstill](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Standstill) was much better for Hoenle as he got a Tog on the table. Birch broke it immediately to successfully resolve another [Compulsion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Compulsion). 

Then the game descended into a massive stall as Hoenle got a Tog and then [Standstill](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Standstill) on the table but couldn’t attack as Birch would hit him back for more with a [Nantuko Monastery](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nantuko+Monastery). Birch was happy to sit back and cycle cards off his [Compulsion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Compulsion). Hoenle ended up discarding Infiltrator, Infiltrator and a second Tog to his own Tog to reamin below seven cards. Eventually the [Standstill](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Standstill) was broken and the tog returned to Hoenle’s hand.

The game went into extra turns and Hoenle prevented the one attack he needed to by [Aether Burst](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aether+Burst)ing the Monastery, but Birch had two [Envelop](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Envelop)s to stop his [Upheaval](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Upheaval) resolving and the game ended in stalemate.

Uli Hoenle and Lars Birch drew 1-1
