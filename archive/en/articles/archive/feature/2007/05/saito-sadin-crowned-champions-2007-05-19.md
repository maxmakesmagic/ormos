Top **Magic** players around the world flocked to Strasbourg, France, and Columbus, Ohio, to take part in a huge Grand Prix weekend. More than 2,000 players shuffled up in the major events, but only two could be crowned champion. Dive in to complete coverage from Brian David-Marshall, Hanno Terbuyken, Richard Hagon, Ben Coleman, and Craig Jones.
