**New Feature: Deck Filtering in Limited**


Have you ever been building deck in your Kaladesh Sealed Deck league and wondered how many cards you’ve added do your deck that care about energy? To figure it out, you’d either need to know all the cards intimately, or you’d have to return card to your pool and search for "energy" in the filters.


After the December 7 update, however, you can set filters for your card pool and then apply those filters to your deck. This lets you display subsets of cards in your deck without having to return them to the card pool so you can get a better understanding of your deck composition. To use this new feature, just click the "Apply Filters" check box in the deck’s information bar and any filters or search terms you’ve applied to your card pool will also apply to your deck.
