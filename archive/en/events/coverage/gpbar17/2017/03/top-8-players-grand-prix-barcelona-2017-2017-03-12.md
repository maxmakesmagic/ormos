### Iñigo Vallejo Pascual



![](https://media.wizards.com/2017/events/gpbar17/t8_vallejo.jpg)



**Age:** 24




**Occupation:** Personal trainer




**Hometown:** Bilbao, Spain




**Previous *Magic* accomplishments:**



Grand Prix Sevilla Top 32, two WMCQ Top 8s, two RPTQ Top 16s.



**What deck did you play this weekend, and why did you choose it?**



I played Four-Color Saheeli because I didn't have enough time to test, and between the two tier-one decks of the format, it was the one which better fit my play style.



**What was the best card in your main deck, and why?**



[Skysovereign, Consul Flagship](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skysovereign%2C+Consul+Flagship). It stole so many games along the way, especially versus Mardu decks.



**What was the best card out of your sideboard, and why?**



Probably the same one, because I split the copies between main deck and sideboard, and it really shone when needed.

**Age:** 23




**Occupation:** IT recruiter




**Hometown:** Bexhill, England




**Previous *Magic* accomplishments:**



None?



**What deck did you play this weekend, and why did you choose it?**



Mardu Ballista. Best deck. Relatively straightforward lines of play.



**What was the best card in your main deck, and why?**



[Gideon, Ally of Zendikar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gideon%2C+Ally+of+Zendikar) because it is difficult to interact with and wins the game on its own.



**What was the best card out of your sideboard, and why?**



[Archangel Avacyn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Archangel+Avacyn) 3 and 4 because it excels in the mirror.

**Age:** 27




**Occupation:** Software quality engineer




**Hometown:** Warsaw, Poland




**Previous *Magic* accomplishments:**



PPTQ win and a few impressive runs at local FNMs.



**What deck did you play this weekend, and why did you choose it?**



Mardu Ballista. I knew basically nothing about Standard, so I picked the first netdeck list and hoped for the best.



**What was the best card in your main deck, and why?**



[Aethersphere Harvester](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aethersphere+Harvester), a monster in the mirror, excellent at pressuring planeswalkers, and very cool artwork.



**What was the best card out of your sideboard, and why?**



[Painful Truths](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Painful+Truths). It's great at grinding out games after sideboarding and not that painful with [Aethersphere Harvester](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aethersphere+Harvester) lifegain.

Some PTQ Top 8, Top 32 at Grand Prix Valencia 2013, some Grand Prix Top 64s.

Four-Color Saheeli. Because my friend Soh Weng Heng told me it's the best deck four weeks ago.



**What was the best card in your main deck, and why?**



[Felidar Guardian](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Felidar+Guardian). Because it generates so much value with all the cards in the deck.



**What was the best card out of your sideboard, and why?**



[Walking Ballista](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Walking+Ballista), because it's very good against Mardu Vehicles.

**What deck did you play this weekend, and why did you choose it?**



Four-Color Saheeli. I'm not really an aggro guy and it's the only other viable deck.



**What was the best card in your main deck, and why?**



[Oath of Nissa](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oath+of+Nissa). It does everything.



**What was the best card out of your sideboard, and why?**



[Skysovereign, Consul Flagship](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skysovereign%2C+Consul+Flagship). People aren't prepared for it, so they just lose to it.

[Gideon, Ally of Zendikar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gideon%2C+Ally+of+Zendikar). Because he wins the game all by himself.



**What was the best card out of your sideboard, and why?**



[Archangel Avacyn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Archangel+Avacyn). People forgot how busted Avacyn really is.

[Gideon, Ally of Zendikar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gideon%2C+Ally+of+Zendikar)! It's the best card of the deck, and I'm sure it will get banned.

[Fumigate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fumigate), because so many opponents were surprised when I played it.
