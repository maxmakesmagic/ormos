**Ivan Floch:** I like it a lot. It makes matches less random and more skill intensive. So it's a good change. Even though the games sometimes go a little bit longer because of it.

**Fabrizio Anteri:** I'm really excited. It allows for more play and is an extra advantage for good players. There will be better mulligan decisions and better players will win more games that they otherwise would have lost.

**Thoralf Severin:** It's the best thing that's ever happened. For limited it's amazing because it makes games so much better. I'm not as sure for Standard where it might favor certain decks. But overall it's a great change.

**Andrea Mengucci:** I love it for limited. And for constructed it depends on the format I think. Like we saw at the Pro Tour Mono Red and Blue-Red Thopters did very well. Probably they were helped a little by the scry. I don't mind those decks winning, but it's something that helps certain decks more than others.

**Michael Bonde:** I think it benefits some decks a little more than others, but I haven't tested it that much. But I think it's good to remove some of the high variance in *Magic* by using this mulligan rule.
