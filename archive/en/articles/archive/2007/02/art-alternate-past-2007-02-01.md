P*lanar Chaos* features timeshifted cards that resemble older cards, but twisted into a new color. The art of these cards often references the original in some way, or other past cards to flavor.


Check out the art of two graveyard-manipulation spells—one a spell from *Ice Age*, the other timeshifted in *Planar Chaos*.

Similarly, these two durable rare flyers share an intentionally similar composition:

It’s not just the art of *Planar Chaos*’s timeshifted cards that look back in time for inspiration. Note how Jim Nelson’s [Ana Battlemage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ana+Battlemage) has the same kind of barklike skin covering as Matt Cavotta’s [Anavolver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Anavolver).

And Jim Nelson looked at an older piece for [Muck Drubb](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Muck+Drubb), too—this time not for a direct mechanical link at all, but rather a similar composition and mood. Can you see the resemblance to a creature from **Magic**’s past?
