Day 2 Coverage



Eduardo “Walaoumpa” Sajgalik is the winner of Grand Prix Warsaw 2018! It took him a long way and a long day to get there, but in the end he stood triumphant with his Golgari deck in the finals against Julien Berteaux and his beloved Boros.


Both Eduardo Sajgalik and Julien Berteaux had been seen at the feature match area and the top of the standings for most of the tournament, so it was no surprise to see them both make it to the finals. It looked like Sajgalik might have trouble with the fast Boros deck, but in the end he got there with “creatures and removal, nothing special”, using his own words.


Also joining them in the Top 8 were Ukrainian Iurii Babych, Belgian Pascal Vieren, Estonian Hannes Kerem, the two Germans Johann Wallner and Christian Seibold along with blast from the past - Julien Nuijten. All of them outlasting the record field of 1,836 players to make it to the Top 8 in Poland's largest Magic Tournament ever.


After a long weekend of Magic, what else is there to do but look forward to the next one. Until then - congratulations to Eduardo Sajgalik - champion of Grand Prix Warsaw 2018!
