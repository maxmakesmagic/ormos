 Brian David-Marshall is a New York–based game designer who has been involved with Magic since 1994, when he started organizing tournaments and ran a Manhattan game store. Since then, he has been a judge, a player, and one of the longest-tenured columnists on DailyMTG.com, as he enters his second decade writing for the site. He is also the Pro Tour Historian and one of the commentators for the Pro Tour. 






Team Limited events always make for a party of a weekend. There are tons of fun, but something is slightly different from normal Grand Prix, especially on Friday. There are no byes handed out for Team Sealed Grand Prix which means there are no Grand Prix Trials to play in on Friday before the event. However, that does not mean there is nothing to do.


Friday was the kickoff for the Infinite Challenge, which allows players to buy a single entry into as many Constructed (and a handful of Limited) events throughout the weekend. Along with my cameraman David T. Wright, I went out on the floor Friday to talk to the winners of some of these challenges and find out what cards were their MVPs.


Players included Infinite Challengers, competitors in the main event looking for some Friday action, and one player who came in just to play some Vintage. For some older students of the game, the name Sean O’Brien may sound familiar. He was featured in one of the very first strategic looks at the game when “The O’Brien School” was included in the original Schools of Magic by Rob Hahn.

Thanks to Sean and all the players who took the time to talk to us:


Edward Cullen — Legacy with Burn


Vanessa Sudendorf — Modern with Scapeshift


Loren Eakins — Standard with Mardu Dragons


Sean O'Brien — Vintage with Shops


Luke Riewestahl — Modern with Infect


Dan Ward, Ammi Ribar, & Edward Nguyen — Team Sealed


And remember, even if you are not playing in the main event, there is always something to do when the Grand Prix comes to your part of the world!
