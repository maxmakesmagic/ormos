Looking for your next adventure? You'll find the backstory on *Dungeons & Dragons:* *Adventures in the Forgotten Realms* (AFR) products in this article.


Set Boosters
============


![AFR Set Booster display](https://media.wizards.com/2021/images/daily/en_827sdhwyDs.png)


Set Boosters are an exciting way to add to your collection. You're much more likely to open multiple rares in Set Boosters than in Draft Boosters. Set Boosters always contain a Booster Fun card, a traditional foil card, and an art card. The commons and uncommons in Set Boosters tell little stories, and there's always the chance of opening a card from *The List*.


*Adventures in the Forgotten Realms* Set Boosters contain:


* At least 1 rare or mythic rare card (approximately 27% of Set Boosters contain 2 rares or mythic rares, 3% contain 3, and it's even possible to open 4 though that's less than 1% of the time.)
* 1 Traditional foil card of any rarity
* 1 Rulebook, module, or borderless common or uncommon—check out the [Collecting *Adventures in the Forgotten Realms* article](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/feature/collecting-adventures-forgotten-realms-2021-06-29) for details!
* 1 Art card or foil-stamped art card
* 7–10 Commons and uncommons (at most 7 may be uncommon)
* 1 Basic land or foil basic land
* 1 Ad/token/dungeon card or 1 card from *The List*

Set Boosters are available individually and in displays of 30 packs. If you purchase a display, you may be eligible for this special foil Buy-a-Box promo—ask your local store!

Vorpal Sword is available in Set, Draft, and Collector Boosters, but this art by Alessandra Pisano is exclusive to this promo.


Draft Boosters
==============


![AFR Draft Booster display](https://media.wizards.com/2021/images/daily/en_jwu376dsdh.png)


Draft Boosters are perfect if you're looking for the classic Draft or Sealed experience. You can open all the same *Adventures in the Forgotten Realms* cards in Draft Boosters that you can in Set Boosters—including the same Booster Fun cards—but these packs are optimized for Draft. They contain:


* 1 Rare or mythic rare card
* 3 Uncommon cards
* 10 Common cards (In 33% of *Adventures in the Forgotten Realms* packs, a traditional foil of any rarity replaces a common)
* 1 Basic land
* 1 Ad/token/dungeon card

You can purchase Draft Boosters individually and in displays of 36 packs. Just like Set Boosters, your display purchase may be eligible for the Vorpal Sword Buy-a-Box promo—just ask your store!


Collector Boosters
==================


![AFR Collector Booster display](https://media.wizards.com/2021/images/daily/en_238sdsyweh.png)


Collector Boosters are an incredible way to collect the hottest cards in *Adventures in the Forgotten Realms.* You'll find five rares or mythic rares, tons of Booster Fun variants, foils, and special extended-art versions of cards in every pack.


*Adventures in the Forgotten Realms* Collector Boosters contain:

You can purchase Collector Boosters individually or in displays of twelve boosters. As with Set and Draft Boosters, buying a display may make you eligible for the Buy-a-Box promo—ask your local store!


Prerelease Pack
===============


![AFR Prerelease Pack](https://media.wizards.com/2021/images/daily/en_msjWydhsje.png)


The *Adventures in the Forgotten Realms* Prerelease is your first opportunity to play with *Adventures in the Forgotten Realms* cards with your own hands. At each Prerelease, you'll get a Prerelease Pack and build a deck from the cards inside! You'll find the following in each *Adventures in the Forgotten Realms* Prerelease Pack:


* 6 *Adventures in the Forgotten Realms* Draft Boosters
* 1 Traditional foil rare or mythic rare from *Adventures in the Forgotten Realms* with a foil year stamp
* 3 Traditional foil dungeon cards—one of each dungeon
* 1 d20 with the *Adventures in the Forgotten Realms* expansion symbol imprint for all your dice-rolling needs
* 1 Reusable deck box with divider

Commander Decks
===============


You can form a full adventuring party with the Commander decks in *Adventures in the Forgotten Realms*. Each deck comes ready to play in the Commander format. All four of these decks contain seventeen new cards each plus the new foil-etched display commander card—not legal for tournaments printed on thicker card stock—that debuted in the *Strixhaven: School of Mages* Commander decks. In each deck, you'll find:


* 100 Cards, including 2 foil legendary creature cards
* 1 Foil-etched display commander
* 10 Double-sided tokens
* 1 Life wheel
* 1 Deck box

Theme Boosters
==============


![Theme Booster graphic](https://media.wizards.com/2021/images/daily/en_Uwen37sfhh.png)


Theme Boosters are the perfect way to find new cards for a deck you've already built. You can get a Theme Booster full of cards of the color of your choice, or a special Theme Booster packed with cards perfect for venturing into the dungeon—a great way to kickstart your next *Adventures in the Forgotten Realms* deck. Each Theme Booster contains 1–2 rares and/or mythic rares and 33–34 commons and uncommons.


Bundle
======


![AFR Bundle](https://media.wizards.com/2021/images/daily/en_weyDw38dsn.png)


Bundles are ideal if you want some exciting bonuses to go with your booster packs. Each *Adventures in the Forgotten Realms* Bundle contains oversized cards for all three *Adventures in the Forgotten Realms* dungeons. In each Bundle, you'll find:


* 10 Draft Boosters
* 3 Oversized dungeon cards
* 20 Traditional foil basic lands
* 20 Non-foil basic lands
* 1 Promotional alternate-art card exclusive to the Bundle
* 1 Exclusive oversized d20
* 1 Card storage box

Bundles are also great gifts for the *Magic* players in your life. In August, the *Adventures in the Forgotten Realms* Gift Bundle will release. It contains everything you can find in the standard Bundle, plus an *Adventures in the Forgotten Realms* Collector Booster! The Gift Bundle also contains a different oversized d20 than the standard Bundle—the dice are the same size, but different colors.
