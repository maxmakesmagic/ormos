 A longtime member of the Pro Tour and Grand Prix coverage staff, Nate Price now works making beautiful words for all of you lovely people as the community manager for organized play. When not covering events, he lords over the @MagicProTour Twitter account, ruling with an iron fist. 





For the eight players fortunate enough to have been selected to represent the Community at this year's Community Cup, the day started off at a low point: the Seattle Underground! While it appeared that this early-morning tour was simply a ploy by Mike Robles to keep the Community Team nice and tired for the first day of play, it actually brought them closer together and paved the way for an exceptional first day of play here at the 2012 Community Cup.


The first event of the weekend was Cube Draft, and the Community Cup participants were the first to get a crack at the *Magic Online* Cube updated with *Return to Ravnica*! The first round gave a good idea of what we were in store for as Billy Moreno lost a tight Feature Match against Conley Woods on the last possible second after the absolute perfect draw in the final game. His stolen [Arbor Elf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arbor+Elf) proved a bit too unwieldy as he timed out while attempting to pay for a Pact of Negation on the turn he would have been attacking for lethal damage. The entire room erupted in cheers and jeers, causing employees as much as three floors above us to wonder what had happened! At the end of the round, the score stood tied.


The Wizards of the Coast Team felt that they had the superior lineup in place for the opening round, looking to use their stable of experienced Cube drafters and ex-professional players to take a massive early lead that they could simply protect through the rest of the event, but that wasn't to be. The second round provided just as much gut-wrenching suspense, as Moreno once again found himself in a match revolving around the clock, this time coming out ahead. Still, at the end of the round, things remained tied.


Things only shifted during the final round. After commanding 3-0 performances from Shay Hall on the home team and the Community's Jon Loucks, the Wizards of the Coast team narrowly edged out the Community five matches to three, taking a slight 63-55 lead at the end of the day. While they certainly held a lead, this clearly wasn't the massive lead that the Wizards team hoped they would hold as Day One ended. Day Two is up next, with Unified RGDR Constructed providing a wonderful exhibition of deckbuilding skill as former Community member and Conley Woods "protégé" Gavin Verhey takes the reins for the Wizards team and squares off in a deckbuilding competition against Woods. Following that, it's time for the Multiball round, complete with special rules, scoring modifiers, and what is sure to be a whole lot of points changing hands!


A lot is at stake on Day Two, from deckbuilding crowns to Multiball multipliers. Can Wizards hold on to or extend its lead, or will the Community Team overcome the gap to take the lead going into the final day of play? These questions and more will be answered as coverage continues here at the 2012 Community Cup!
