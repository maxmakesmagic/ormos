The Daily *Magic* Update is a roundup of everything *Magic* you should know on September 7, 2017. Today's Update is brought to you by streams, previews, and two weeks away from the Daily *Magic* Update. Nicholas J. Wolfram (I have no idea if his middle name starts with a J, but I imagine it does. James? Jonathan? Jimothy?) will take over Update duties during that time. 


What to Watch Today
===================

> World Premiere of Magic The Gathering Arena on 9/7 at 1pm PT! [@jfwong](https://twitter.com/jfwong) [@Amaz](https://twitter.com/Amaz) & [@GabySpartz](https://twitter.com/GabySpartz) will join for the reveal.<https://t.co/5pmWcjXqhP> [pic.twitter.com/5bykJQ0AJM](https://t.co/5bykJQ0AJM)

> 
>  — Twitch (@Twitch) [September 6, 2017](https://twitter.com/Twitch/status/905506019245207558)

Today, the mystery is solved. See what all the fuss is about at 1 p.m. PT/4 p.m. ET/8 p.m. UTC on [twitch.tv/magic](https://www.twitch.tv/magic), and, just because we like you, get a whole slew of *Ixalan* preview cards. That's right—a slew.


Today's Previews
================


1. <https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2FMagicTheGathering.apac%2Fposts%2F1477923655609824%3A0&width=500>

So the plan is to draw all of the cards (like), cast creatures with high toughness (like), and then sacrifice those creatures for fun and profit (like)? Count me in. I think it's only drawback is that it doesn't synergize well with [Cloudblazer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloudblazer).

World, meet Vona, Butcher of Magan. Vona, Butcher of Magan, meet the world. He's, um, not the nicest Vampire. See how with [a translation you can find here](https://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/6ynrfn/big_magic_spoiler_legendary_wb_mythic_vampire/).


1. What's to Come

Today's going to be heavy on the *Magic: The Gathering Arena* previews, so look for most of today's new cards there!


After Those, Read, Watch, or Listen to These
============================================


1. [The Top 10 Cards to Revisit in *Ixalan* Standard](https://www.channelfireball.com/articles/the-top-10-cards-to-revisit-in-ixalan-standard/) | ChannelFireball | Mike Sigrist

[Cloudblazer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloudblazer) did not make the list, but only because everyone already knows it's awesome. Probably.


1. [Breaking! 6 new players join the Hareruya Pros!](http://www.hareruyamtg.com/article/en/category/detail/176) | Hareruya EN

Half of the DEX Army has defected! Six players who played on one of the two DEX teams last season have formed a new team under the banner of Hareruya Latin, including some of the biggest names from South America.

Under duress, I will admit that I love some reprints. I'll opt in every time. May lightning strike me down, but a strong reprint will give me both a shot of nostalgia and optimism for the future.


1. [A First Look at *Ixalan*](http://magic.tcgplayer.com/db/article.asp?ID=14154&writer=Brian+Braun-Duin&articledate=9-7-2017) | TCGplayer | Brian Braun-Duin

While it's not *the* first look at *Ixalan*, it is certainly "a" first look, so I'll grant BBD that. He's interested in some pretty big effects, and some effects even bigger than that.


1. [Evaluating *Ixalan*'s Oddball Rares](http://www.starcitygames.com/article/35780_Evaluating-Ixalans-Oddball-Rares.html) | StarCityGames.com | Ryan Saxe

*Ixalan*'s got some weird ones, not gonna lie. Weirdly great. Saxe takes a swing at cutting some of those oddballs down to size.

There's going to be a lot of this today and tomorrow as people start arriving for HASCON. Any information you miss if you can't make it, we'll share on the website and social media. Experiences, on the other hand—that we can't help you with.


Deck of the Day
===============


1. [Four-Color Treasure for the New *Ixalan* Standard](https://www.channelfireball.com/articles/4-color-treasure-for-the-new-ixalan-standard/) | ChannelFireball | Frank Karsten

Leave it to Frank Karsten to create something that makes you multiply. The key to the deck is [Skyship Plunderer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skyship+Plunderer), which is, yes, a Pirate. It also just so happens to work really well with Jace, Cunning Castaway, which in turn works pretty well with [Anointed Procession](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Anointed+Procession). Here's the key interaction, straight from Frank:


*The idea is as follows. You start on turn two with [Skyship Plunderer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skyship+Plunderer). Then, on turn three, you cast Jace, use his +1 ability, attack with [Skyship Plunderer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skyship+Plunderer), loot, and use the trigger to bring Jace up to 5 loyalty. (Meanwhile, your Temur Energy opponent hasn't affected the board yet because they kept [Aether Hub](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aether+Hub), [Botanical Sanctum](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Botanical+Sanctum), Mountain, [Attune with Aether](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Attune+with+Aether), [Whirler Virtuoso](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Whirler+Virtuoso), [Bristling Hydra](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bristling+Hydra), and [Glorybringer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glorybringer) on the draw.)*


*On turn four, you cast [Anointed Procession](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Anointed+Procession), and this is where the fun begins. You immediately ultimate Jace, giving you four copies of the no-longer-legendary planeswalker. You activate each copy's -2 ability, which again produces double the tokens, yielding a grand total of 16 power on turn four. Oh, and you still have four planeswalkers lying around in case that somehow isn't enough to win the game.*


The rest of the deck is filled with all kinds of synergy helped out by Treasure tokens and Treasure Map. It's the first fully unique deck I've seen on the internets using *Ixalan*, so definitely check it out to get your brewer's brain going.
