### Daniel Gardner (Bant) vs. Luis Scott-Vargas (Naya)


Luis Scott-Vargas had already locked up a spot in the Top 8, but now he was playing for Pro Tour history: to dethrone Ryan Fuller’s 14-0 as the longest undefeated streak at a Pro Tour. Standing in his way was Daniel Gardner, who at 11-2 just needed a win for to nearly lock up a berth of his own. The match-up was Gardner’s Bant against Scott-Vargas’s Boss Naya.


**Game 1**


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/ptsd10/r14_scott-vargas.jpg)*With the Top 8 locked up, Luis Scott-Vargas is playing for Pro Tour history.*Gardner led out with [Noble Hierarch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Noble+Hierarch) but Scott-Vargas had [Arid Mesa](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arid+Mesa) and [Lightning Bolt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt) waiting in hand. Gardner untapped and played a replacement, adding a [Stirring Wildwood](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stirring+Wildwood). Scott-Vargas played his own Wildwood and passed the turn.


With the Hierarch’s help, Gardner made an [Emeria Angel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Emeria+Angel). Scott-Vargas had to content himself with a [Knight of the Reliquary](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Knight+of+the+Reliquary). It didn’t last long. Gardner had [Lotus Cobra](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lotus+Cobra) and [Misty Rainforest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Misty+Rainforest) to bust out [Jace, the Mind Sculptor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace%2C+the+Mind+Sculptor). He bounced the Knight and hit for 4.


Scott-Vargas came back with [Bloodbraid Elf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodbraid+Elf) but only scored a [Noble Hierarch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Noble+Hierarch). The Emerian air force came over, and after checking Scott-Vargas’s top card with Jace, Gardner cast a [Baneslayer Angel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Baneslayer+Angel). Scott-Vargas confirmed that Gardner hadn’t left him a [Path to Exile](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Path+to+Exile) and conceded.

Scott-Vargas: “I think this is the second time I’ve been down a game all tournament.”


Gardner: “Really?”


Scott-Vargas: “I mean, when you’re running good, you’re running good.”

**Game 2**


Scott-Vargas mulliganed his opening seven and the crowd murmured to itself. They were standing three-deep, and most of them were rooting for a 16-0 performance.


He kept his six and led with [Misty Rainforest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Misty+Rainforest), and after a [Seaside Citadel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seaside+Citadel) from Gardner, cashed it in for a regular [Forest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest). [Arid Mesa](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arid+Mesa) got him a [Plains](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plains), which got him [Stoneforge Mystic](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stoneforge+Mystic), in turn getting him [Basilisk Collar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Basilisk+Collar). Gardner played a second Citadel and a [Noble Hierarch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Noble+Hierarch), but Scott-Vargas had the second half of the combo in-hand. Down came the [Cunning Sparkmage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cunning+Sparkmage), sending the Hierarch to the graveyard.


Gardner untapped and fetched an [Island](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island) with [Borderland Ranger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Borderland+Ranger). Scott-Vargas outdid him with [Knight of the Reliquary](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Knight+of+the+Reliquary) and [Raging Ravine](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Raging+Ravine). Gardner had [Path to Exile](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Path+to+Exile), getting rid of the [Knight of the Reliquary](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Knight+of+the+Reliquary) before it could come online, and a [Kor Firewalker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kor+Firewalker) to stand up against the Sparkmage.


Now Scott-Vargas was ready to bring down the Collar. He attached it to his Sparkmage and cast [Knight of the Reliquary](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Knight+of+the+Reliquary). Gardner’s face made it clear he still didn’t have removal. He made an [Emeria Angel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Emeria+Angel) just to get the token, as the Mage shot the Angel out of the sky.


Scott-Vargas was content to sit on his weapons. He swung in with [Raging Ravine](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Raging+Ravine) to get a counter on it and gave it back to Gardner. Gardner made another Firewalker and hit for one with his token, losing his Ranger to the deadly Sparkmage. Scott-Vargas dug out [Stirring Wildwood](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stirring+Wildwood) with his Knight, then untapped and played Baneslayer. Gardner took one hit, drew, and started shuffling for the deciding game.

**Game 3**


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/events/ptsd10/r14_gardner.jpg)*Daniel Gardner, on the other hand, is ‘just’ playing for a PT Top 8.*Gardner was fast off the blocks. He started with an unanswered Hierarch into a [Knight of the Reliquary](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Knight+of+the+Reliquary). Scott-Vargas’s [Terramorphic Expanse](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Terramorphic+Expanse) fetched him a [Forest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest), then he cast [Plains](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plains) for [Path to Exile](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Path+to+Exile) on the Knight. Gardner replaced it with [Master of the Wild Hunt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Master+of+the+Wild+Hunt), alongside a [Celestial Colonnade](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Celestial+Colonnade).


Scott-Vargas got his third land with [Arid Mesa](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arid+Mesa) and played a 4/4 [Knight of the Reliquary](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Knight+of+the+Reliquary). Gardner got a Wolf from his [Master of the Wild Hunt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Master+of+the+Wild+Hunt), made a second Hierarch and attacked for 2 with his first one. He played [Kor Firewalker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kor+Firewalker) and passed the turn. Scott-Vargas tried a [Bloodbraid Elf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodbraid+Elf), but it cascaded into a lowly Hierarch, dispatched immediately by the Master.


Gardner tightened his vice with [Jace, the Mind Sculptor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace%2C+the+Mind+Sculptor) and checked Scott-Vargas’s top card. He left it where it was, but Scott-Vargas just dug out a [Terramorphic Expanse](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Terramorphic+Expanse) for a [Forest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forest) with his [Knight of the Reliquary](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Knight+of+the+Reliquary). He untapped and played a second Knight, now quite large.


Gardner used the [Master of the Wild Hunt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Master+of+the+Wild+Hunt) on the [Bloodbraid Elf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodbraid+Elf), trading a Wolf, then untapped and targeted himself with Jace’s scry ability. He activated his [Celestial Colonnade](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Celestial+Colonnade) and swung in, but Scott-Vargas’s [Knight of the Reliquary](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Knight+of+the+Reliquary) searched up [Tectonic Edge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tectonic+Edge) to destroy it.


His next draw was [Basilisk Collar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Basilisk+Collar). A Wolf took the hit from the huge Knight. Gardner grew his Jace and made a grab for the slipping momentum with a [Vapor Snare](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vapor+Snare) on the equipped Knight, but the other simply tutored for [Sejiri Steppe](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sejiri+Steppe) and stopped it. Now Scott-Vargas was swinging with both giants and his life total was getting out of hand. A [Bloodbraid Elf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodbraid+Elf) gave him a [Cunning Sparkmage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cunning+Sparkmage) who took out a Hierarch before the Master killed him.


Gardner untapped, bumped Jace up to 11 loyalty, and played a second [Kor Firewalker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kor+Firewalker), the last card in his hand. Scott Vargas shut down the Wolf factory with a [Lightning Bolt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt), enabling a second [Cunning Sparkmage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cunning+Sparkmage) from his hand to pick up the [Basilisk Collar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Basilisk+Collar).


Gardner drew, then Brainstormed with Jace’s help. He kept a [Knight of the Reliquary](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Knight+of+the+Reliquary) and a [Borderland Ranger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Borderland+Ranger), fetching an island. Scott-Vargas shot down the Knight, untapped, and drew his card.


Ben Stark, from the crowd: “What a master.”


Scott-Vargas moved the Collar back to one of his Knights and attacked, bringing his life total to a comfortable 70 and costing Gardner two more blockers. Then he showed what he had drawn: [Oblivion Ring](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Oblivion+Ring) for Jace. The crowd showed its appreciation.
