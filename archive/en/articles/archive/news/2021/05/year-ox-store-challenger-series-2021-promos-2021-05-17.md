For players across Asia-Pacific, the Year of the Ox began with an in-store play and purchase promotion for WPN stores: promotional versions of [Sethron, Hurloon General](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sethron%2C+Hurloon+General) and a Minotaur token. If you haven't seen it yet, here's what that looked like:

[We shared additional rewards for in-store play coming in 2021](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/news/welcome-summer-legend-2021-05-06), and Asia-Pacific leads the way with the Store Challenger Series. Players in the Asia-Pacific region can battle in events exclusively at their local WPN store to earn promotional cards thematic for the Year of the Ox.


Given the variety of formats and dates reaching all the way through the lunar year, players in Asia-Pacific should check with their local WPN stores for scheduled dates and times to participate in the Store Challenger Series for these cards.


**Note**: In accordance with the Korean government's COVID-19 social distancing restriction guidelines, Korea is excluded from the first Store Challenger Series promotion and will resume when the ban on gatherings of five or more people is lifted.
