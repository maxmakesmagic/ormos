Sometimes, artists include references to their previous work in their art. For [Mass Polymorph](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mass+Polymorph), Christopher Moeller outdid himself. This is what would happen if you were playing an all-Moeller deck and cast [Mass Polymorph](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mass+Polymorph) with nine creatures out.Mouse over the art to see what's going on. And if you ever pull this off in real life, we're pretty sure you'll be showered with gold coins and get to advance directly to the bonus level.
