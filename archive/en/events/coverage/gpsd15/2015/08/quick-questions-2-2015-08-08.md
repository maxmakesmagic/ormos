**Which card from *Magic Origins* has had the biggest impact on Standard so far?**



New sets have a tendency to shake formats up. While Modern and Legacy are notoriously difficult to shift, each new set that enters Standard causes a seismic shift to occur.

With the Pro Tour behind them, this is what some of the game’s greats considered he biggest hit for Standard in *Magic Origins*.

**Luis Scott-Vargas:** “[Abbot of Keral Keep](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Abbot+of+Keral+Keep). It’s such a good card, and exactly what monored wants to do. It takes what red always did and pushes it into Tier 1.”

**Paul Cheon:** [Hangarback Walker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hangarback+Walker). [Hangarback Walker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hangarback+Walker); [Nissa, Vastwood Seer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nissa%2C+Vastwood+Seer); and [Languish](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Languish) are important, and [Exquisite Firecraft](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Exquisite+Firecraft) gives you an answer to so many things in red. But in testing [for the Pro Tour] [Hangarback Walker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hangarback+Walker) was just so important. It was a card on our radar that we tried in so many things: A control deck, a graveyard deck. It was just good.

**Jacob Wilson:** [Hangarback Walker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hangarback+Walker). I’m sad to say it since I don’t really like it. It made the artifact deck playable. I think people will play it in just about every deck, like Abzan, Green-White. It’s really good in any sort of creature mirror and in control.

*Paul Rietzl, Hall of Fame member and the No. 8-ranked entering the weekend, was famous for playing aggressive decks. His answer suited.*


**Paul Rietzl:** [Abbot of Keral Keep](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Abbot+of+Keral+Keep): No doubt. I think it’s the best card and had the biggest impact. It’s really good on every single turn. Red usually doesn’t get cards like that. It gets cards that are good in specific situations or only early or late in the game. Abbot is a card you want every single turn.”

*Matt Sperling, jumping to No. 20-ranked with his Pro Tour Top 8 the weekend before, had a different answer from other players.*


**Matt Sperling:** “I think [Languish](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Languish) changed the decks you see and the decks you don’t. Before *Magic Origins* came out, [Dragonlord Ojutai](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragonlord+Ojutai) was everywhere. [Thunderbreak Regent](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thunderbreak+Regent) was popular. Even though only a couple deck are playing copies of [Languish](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Languish), it’s the boogeyman that changes what everyone else is playing.”
