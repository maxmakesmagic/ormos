### Answering the Modern Format


The Modern card pool is huge and the amount of viable decks is staggering. How does one approach such a brand new, completely open, diverse format, and how does one answer the various pillars of the format? If you're interested in learning about playtesting approaches for this Pro Tour and a detailed overview of powerful and surprising *answers* to the top decks seen here in Philadelphia, then read on!


By now, the three pillars of the Modern format are well-known. First, we have the twelvepost deck packing the fastest mana engine available. Second, we have aggro decks in Zoo and Affinity. Third, we have the combo decks which come in various forms: [Splinter Twin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Splinter+Twin), Pyromancer decks, Infect combo, and many others. Just a few weeks ago, however, this fact was unknown and a fair amount of playtesting was needed to figure out the format. The question was how to do this playtesting methodologically. My own approach, in a group consisting of both Dutch and Belgian players, consisted of the following steps:




| **Step 1:** | Identify the strongest, most obvious aggro deck in the format. This easily turned out to be Zoo. |
| **Step 2:** | Find one or more decks that actually beat Zoo. The most obvious Zoo-slaying deck in the format turned out to be twelvepost in our testing, and this conclusion was confirmed by the early **Magic Online** results. |
| **Step 3:** | Find a deck that beats both Zoo and twelvepost. |

I tried to answer Step 3 with a combo deck as did fellow Hall of Famer Olivier Ruel who described pretty much the same playtest process and logic in coming to his own deck choice. We both wanted to play a proactive deck with broken synergies. As the Pro Tour was the debut of the Modern format we didn't want to be control players dealing with threats. In such an uncertain metagame, it's too easy to arrive at the tournament with the wrong answers.


Now the format is a bit more defined. Dedicated metagamers and deckbuilders may already be wondering how they might beat twelvepost, aggro, and combo. To crack this question, I have sifted through many decklists to see which answer cards players have brought to Philadelphia.


Are you interested in sideboard cards? Or looking for inspiration for a control deck with the perfect tools to answer the format? Let's see what options are available!


### Beating Twelvepost


The most obvious way to attack twelvepost is to destroy their [Cloudpost](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloudpost)s. Indeed, twelvepost mirror matches are often decided by a flurry of [Reap and Sow](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reap+and+Sow), [Plow Under](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plow+Under), and [Beast Within](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Beast+Within). Blue decks have access to [Spreading Seas](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spreading+Seas) and [Annex](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Annex), while [Living End](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Living+End) decks rely on [Fulminator Mage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fulminator+Mage). Zoo decks have access to [Molten Rain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Molten+Rain), and they can also use [Knight of the Reliquary](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Knight+of+the+Reliquary) to fetch [Ghost Quarter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ghost+Quarter) and [Tectonic Edge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tectonic+Edge).


But destroying a single [Cloudpost](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloudpost) often doesn't do the job, especially considering that [Primeval Titan](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Primeval+Titan) can just search for more. [Blood Moon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood+Moon) and [Magus of the Moon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Magus+of+the+Moon) provide heavier ammo; they completely deny the mana bonus of [Cloudpost](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloudpost). [Sowing Salt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sowing+Salt) is another nice answer that takes out all [Cloudpost](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloudpost)s for the remainder of the game. Still not good enough? Boom/Bust and [Thoughts of Ruin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughts+of+Ruin) will completely set a twelvepost player back to zero lands. Finally, [Hokori, Dust Drinker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hokori%2C+Dust+Drinker) has been showing up in decks with [Birthing Pod](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Birthing+Pod) and [Chord of Calling](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chord+of+Calling).

A different yet popular route to beat [Cloudpost](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloudpost) is to steal their [Emrakul, the Aeons Torn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Emrakul%252C%2Bthe%2BAeons%2BTorn) with [Bribery](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bribery).


Another way to go about answering twelvepost is answering their [Primeval Titan](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Primeval+Titan). You could just counter or kill it with cards like [Flashfreeze](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flashfreeze) or [Bant Charm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bant+Charm) but more elegant solutions are [Aven Mindcensor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aven+Mindcensor) and [Shadow of Doubt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shadow+of+Doubt), often effectively countering [Green Sun's Zenith](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Green+Sun%27s+Zenith) and/or substantially weakening [Primeval Titan](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Primeval+Titan)'s triggers.

### Beating Zoo


Zoo is a deck that has been around for years, and the two main ways to beat it are still the same as years ago: get rid of their creatures and gain life!


For answering creatures there is a plethora of options and the best ones are the cheapest ones. [Deathmark](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deathmark) in particular is very cost-effective removal. You could also try to take out multiple [Wild Nacatl](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Nacatl)s at the same time with [Firespout](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Firespout), [Engineered Explosives](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Engineered+Explosives), or [Ratchet Bomb](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ratchet+Bomb). Finally, [Threads of Disloyalty](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Threads+of+Disloyalty) remains an excellent way to deal with opposing [Tarmogoyf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf)s.


As for gaining life, [Kitchen Finks](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kitchen+Finks), [Obstinate Baloth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Obstinate+Baloth), and [Timely Reinforcements](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Timely+Reinforcements) are all splendid.


### Beating Affinity


It will not come as a surprise that a deck built around artifacts is weak against cards that destroy artifacts. There's a lot of one-shot artifact destruction available but the spells that have the most impact on the game are [Shattering Spree](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shattering+Spree), [Hurkyl's Recall](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hurkyl%27s+Recall), [Ancient Grudge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ancient+Grudge), and [Creeping Corrosion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Creeping+Corrosion), all of which have seen play here in Philadelphia. Of course, cards like [Qasali Pridemage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Qasali+Pridemage), [Nature's Claim](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nature%27s+Claim), [Annul](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Annul), and [Bant Charm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bant+Charm) are also perfectly acceptable, although they won't win the game on their own.


Apart from one-shot artifact destruction, there are also various permanent annoyances available. [Kataki, War's Wage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kataki%2C+War%27s+Wage) is an old favorite but [Grim Lavamancer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grim+Lavamancer) can also cause nightmares for Affinity players, picking off their creatures one-by-one.

I spotted Night of Souls' [Betrayal](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Betrayal) in the sideboard of several decks. Although its main use may lie in beating combo decks, the enchantment might be surprisingly good against the Affinity menace. [Inkmoth Nexus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inkmoth+Nexus) and [Blinkmoth Nexus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blinkmoth+Nexus)? Useless. [Memnite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Memnite) and [Vault Skirge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vault+Skirge)? Dead. Play an [Arcbound Ravager](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arcbound+Ravager)? [Sorry](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sorry), it hits the graveyard before you have the chance to grow it.



![Night of Souls' Betrayal](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Night+of+Souls%27+Betrayal)

### Beating Combo Decks


Cards like [Thoughtseize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtseize), [Meddling Mage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Meddling+Mage), [Cranial Extraction](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cranial+Extraction), [Vendilion Clique](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vendilion+Clique), and [Spell Pierce](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spell+Pierce) are all fine general purpose tools in the fight against combo decks in general. I also want to feature some interesting, more specific cards against the most popular combo decks in the format.


### Beating [Splinter Twin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Splinter+Twin)


So, your opponent aims to play [Deceiver Exarch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deceiver+Exarch) on turn 3 and [Splinter Twin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Splinter+Twin) on turn 4. How do you deal with that?


The first things that may come to mind are the zero-mana or one-mana instant answers: [Nature's Claim](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nature%27s+Claim), [Annul](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Annul), [Dismember](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dismember), [Snapback](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snapback), and [Path to Exile](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Path+to+Exile). The problem with this line of attack is [Dispel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dispel). Your opponent just has to wait a little longer until he or she can cast [Splinter Twin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Splinter+Twin) with [Dispel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dispel) mana up, and then beat your disruption.




|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| 
Snapback
 | 
Dispel
 |

To get around [Dispel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dispel) you have uncounterable instant answers: [Combust](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Combust) and [Sudden Death](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sudden+Death). Though perfectly acceptable, these cards require a lot of mana and it's quite a drag to continually keep three or four mana up in anticipation of a possible combo finish, even more so because [Deceiver Exarch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deceiver+Exarch) can tap your lands.


The next step is to go for permanents, thereby sidestepping [Dispel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dispel) (preferably permanents that don't require you to keep up a lot of mana). [Gaddock Teeg](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gaddock+Teeg), [Spellskite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spellskite), and [Seal of Primordium](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seal+of+Primordium) are perfect for this, and [Qasali Pridemage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Qasali+Pridemage) will also work well. Still, there is a problem: although these cards all work well against [Splinter Twin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Splinter+Twin) they don't provide an answer for [Kiki-Jiki, Mirror Breaker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kiki-Jiki%2C+Mirror+Breaker).



![Kiki-Jiki, Mirror Breaker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Kiki-Jiki%2C+Mirror+Breaker)

Many [Splinter Twin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Splinter+Twin) lists have been playing several copies of the red legend for consistency purposes which means that clogging the board with [Seal of Primordium](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seal+of+Primordium)s may leave you without an answer when your opponent plays Kiki-Jiki instead. Permanent answers to [Splinter Twin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Splinter+Twin)*and* Kiki-Jiki include [Torpor Orb](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Torpor+Orb), [Damping Matrix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Damping+Matrix), Night of Souls' [Betrayal](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Betrayal), [Burning-Tree Shaman](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Burning-Tree+Shaman), and [Linvala, Keeper of Silence](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Linvala%2C+Keeper+of+Silence). The fact that the latter two are creatures is relevant for [Chord of Calling](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chord+of+Calling) and [Birthing Pod](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Birthing+Pod).


Interestingly, once the metagame switches to [Torpor Orb](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Torpor+Orb)s, the [Splinter Twin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Splinter+Twin) players will cut their [Dispel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dispel)s for [Echoing Truth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Echoing+Truth) and the same answer-for-your-answer cycle may start all over again.


But the most exciting and surprising answer to [Deceiver Exarch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deceiver+Exarch) that I've seen is...[Arena](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arena). No, not [Phyrexian Arena](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phyrexian+Arena) – the actual land. [Knight of the Reliquary](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Knight+of+the+Reliquary) will typically be a 4/4 or bigger once it has searched for [Arena](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arena), after which it will bravely shout "[Deceiver Exarch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deceiver+Exarch)? Let's fight!"



![Arena](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Arena)

**Beating Pyromancer Decks**


I want to lump both [Pyromancer Ascension](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyromancer+Ascension) and [Pyromancer's Swath](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyromancer%27s+Swath) combo decks in this category. There's a lot of overlap between the [Pyromancer Ascension](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Pyromancer%2BAscension) and [Pyromancer's Swath](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Pyromancer%2527s%2BSwath) strategies: both aim to play [Ponder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ponder), [Rite of Flame](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rite+of+Flame), [Manamorphose](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Manamorphose), etc. to ramp up to a big turn and usually finish off with [Grapeshot](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grapeshot).


The first line of attack against these decks is to ensure that not too many spells are played in a single turn. For that purpose, many sideboards here in Philadelphia have been filled with [Ethersworn Canonist](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ethersworn+Canonist), [Rule of Law](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rule+of+Law), [Trinisphere](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Trinisphere), [Thorn of Amethyst](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thorn+of+Amethyst), and [Lodestone Golem](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lodestone+Golem).

Alternatively, you could also simply counter some rituals ([Flashfreeze](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flashfreeze), [Bant Charm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bant+Charm), and [Chalice of the Void](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chalice+of+the+Void) come to mind).


Another avenue is to directly try to shut down their [Grapeshot](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grapeshot)s. [Leyline of Sanctity](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leyline+of+Sanctity) is probably the best one, and I have witnessed an actual turn-zero kill at the Pro Tour. The [Grapeshot](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grapeshot) player didn't board in an answer to enchantments and simply packed it up and moved to the next game after his opponent resolved the card prior to the first turn. But other options to stop [Grapeshot](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grapeshot) are also available. [Trickbind](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Trickbind) can stifle [Grapeshot](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grapeshot)'s storm trigger while [Silence](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Silence) in response to [Pyromancer's Swath](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyromancer%27s+Swath) can also work well. The award for the answer with the best surprise effect goes to [Mindbreak Trap](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mindbreak+Trap).




|  |  |

You could also answer the namesake enchantments directly. Think [Annul](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Annul), [Nature's Claim](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nature%27s+Claim), [Qasali Pridemage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Qasali+Pridemage), and [Seal of Primordium](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seal+of+Primordium). [Engineered Explosives](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Engineered+Explosives) or [Ratchet Bomb](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ratchet+Bomb) may also work – they're a bit slow, but usually in time to shoot down [Pyromancer Ascension](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyromancer+Ascension).


### Beating Infect Combo


[Blazing Shoal](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blazing+Shoal) turning [Inkmoth Nexus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inkmoth+Nexus) into a 10+ power infect creature is a powerful yet vulnerable combination. There are two main ways to beat it: kill their infect creature or stop their [Blazing Shoal](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blazing+Shoal).




|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| 
Inkmoth Nexus
 | 
Blazing Shoal

First, let's try to kill their infect creatures. [Dismember](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dismember) and [Path to Exile](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Path+to+Exile) are first-rate creature removal, and even [Lightning Bolt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt) and [Punishing Fire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Punishing+Fire) will suffice against the fragile infectors. [Snapback](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snapback) doesn't actually destroy the creature, but it's usually just as good as a removal spell when played in response to a [Blazing Shoal](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blazing+Shoal). Opponents, however, will be ready to reply to these creature removal spells with [Pact of Negation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pact+of+Negation).


To get around [Pact of Negation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pact+of+Negation), one may consider [Grim Lavamancer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grim+Lavamancer) or [Arena](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arena). [Knight of the Reliquary](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Knight+of+the+Reliquary) in particular is rejoicing at the opportunity to fight a puny 1/1 infect creature. Unfortunately, these creatures are too easily answered by [Slaughter Pact](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Slaughter+Pact) – a card often included by the [Blazing Shoal](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blazing+Shoal) decks.


How about [Seal of Fire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seal+of+Fire) and [Ghost Quarter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ghost+Quarter), then? These should work very well as neither Pact can stop them. However, some Infect combo decks are running [Spellskite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spellskite) to protect their creatures, so [Seal of Fire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seal+of+Fire) won't always work.


So is there some way to answer their combo that they can't stop? Surely there is! Remember **Time Spiral**'s split second mechanic? [Wipe Away](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wipe+Away) and [Sudden Death](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sudden+Death) will come to the rescue. In fact, I saw several decklists where [Echoing Truth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Echoing+Truth) was crossed out and replaced by [Wipe Away](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wipe+Away)...perhaps a last minute change with the Infect decks in mind?

If you think you will have enough time to hit four mana, Night of Souls' [Betrayal](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Betrayal) will be the perfect answer. Once it's on the battlefield you'll never be harassed by [Inkmoth Nexus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Inkmoth+Nexus).


Finally, if you aim to stop [Blazing Shoal](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blazing+Shoal) then [Spellskite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spellskite), [Dispel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dispel), [Gaddock Teeg](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gaddock+Teeg), and [Flashfreeze](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flashfreeze) are all excellent candidates.

### Conclusion


There are answers aplenty to the top Modern decks. The question is: which one do you want to play in your sideboards? The key is to look for overlap: you want cards that are good against multiple archetypes. As a perfect example of a deck with "overlap" answers you can look at Brian Kibler's CounterCat deck sporting such cards as [Flashfreeze](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flashfreeze), [Bant Charm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bant+Charm), and [Qasali Pridemage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Qasali+Pridemage).


I am sure that there is also some "answer to the format" deck out there. For the brewers among you, let me suggest a black-blue shell with all the maindeckable overlapping answer cards. [Shadow of Doubt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shadow+of+Doubt) is an excellent, underplayed, maindeckable answer to twelvepost's [Green Sun's Zenith](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Green+Sun%27s+Zenith) that can also [Stifle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stifle) fetch-lands against other decks. In addition, such a black-blue "answer" deck may have [Snapback](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snapback), Night of Souls' [Betrayal](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Betrayal), and [Spellskite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spellskite) against the [Splinter Twin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Splinter+Twin) and Infect combo decks – all cards that are quite solid against Zoo and Affinity as well. [Engineered Explosives](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Engineered+Explosives) is good against Zoo and Pyromancer decks. And in the sideboard we get stuff like [Annul](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Annul) and [Flashfreeze](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flashfreeze). To win the game with such a deck, possibly some [Cloudpost](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cloudpost)s and [Emrakul, the Aeons Torn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Emrakul%252C%2Bthe%2BAeons%2BTorn)s might work.


The format remains a deckbuilder's paradise, and it contains all the answers to pretty much every deck you might want to beat.
