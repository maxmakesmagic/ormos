Since this is a ***Magic** 2010* Preview week, we wanted in on the fun here in Arcana. Unfortunately, we don't have a preview card, so we had lean on the "**Magic** 2010" side.


So! Did you know that the numeral "**20**" appears on precisely **10** cards in **Magic**? Betcha didn't! Now ... can you name them?


Before you start, be warned that we're talking only about the numeral "20". If it's spelled out as "twenty," it doesn't count.


The rest of this Arcana will be a list of the cards in question, followed, of course, by Core Set Survivor. Click here to see the categories of "20" cards.

**Core Set Survivor!**There are exactly sixteen cards that have been in every core set from *Alpha* to *Tenth Edition*. When ***Magic** 2010* comes out, only *eight* cards will have been in every core set. Over the weeks before the ***Magic** 2010* prerelease, we'll be counting them down in this special Arcana sub-feature, giving you an "IN" or "OUT" on one card a day. Step forward, [Grizzly Bears](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grizzly+Bears).
