I won with a Duel Decks! I did it! [You might remember](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/magazine/article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/feature/237b) *Duel Decks: Sorin vs. Tibalt*, where I fumbled horribly and struggled to eke out a win, only to fail repeatedly. Well, with this new Duel Decks, I went 3–1 against R&D's Kelly Digges. Kelly is an R&D editor, ex-DailyMTG.com editor, and designer behind this latest Duel Decks. And I crushed him 3–1 in our games!
