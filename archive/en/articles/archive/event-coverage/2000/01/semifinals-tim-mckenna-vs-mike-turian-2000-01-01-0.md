This is the fourth time these two have played each other in this tournament. Their record thus far is 1-1-1. They have played once before this weekend in GP:Kansas City where McKenna decked Turian with a Sligh deck. 


### Game 1


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/GPMON01/632.jpg)Turian won the die roll eight to six and chose to play. McKenna plays a turn two [Mad Dog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mad+Dog) and after he attacks with it on turn three he plays a [Barbarian Lunatic](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Barbarian+Lunatic). Turian plays a Hall and it's Flamebursted as McKenna attacks for four more damage. McKenna plays a [Twigwalker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Twigwalker) as Turian has nothing without a second green land. Turian finally drew [Nantuko Mentor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nantuko+Mentor) and played it. McKenna played [Elephant Ambush](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elephant+Ambush) and Turian just scooped. Maher then said "Mike you are a good man for conceding and not bluffing". 


McKenna 1-0


### Game 2


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/GPMON01/633.jpg)McKenna plays a turn two [Mad Dog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mad+Dog) again this game and Turian doesn't block it with his turn three [Leaf Dancer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leaf+Dancer). The [Mad Dog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mad+Dog) then runs into an elephant. McKenna summons a [Metamorphic Wurm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Metamorphic+Wurm) and is done. Turian [Reckless Charge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reckless+Charge)d the [Leaf Dancer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leaf+Dancer) and sent with the token and dancer. McKenna blocked and traded his Wurm for a [Muscle Burst](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Muscle+Burst). On Turian's next attack McKenna makes his own elephant token and they trade. McKenna has the only creature on the board in the form of [Werebear](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Werebear), but Turian's hand is [Kamahl, Pit Fighter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kamahl%2C+Pit+Fighter) and [Shower of Coals](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shower+of+Coals). You can go to Game 3 now but if you like you can continue reading this game. Turian eventually Showered the bear and a squirrel token and played a [Wild Mongrel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Mongrel). McKenna played a [Twigwalker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Twigwalker) and is done. Turian draws [Savage Firecat](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Savage+Firecat) to go with the other broken rare in his hand and sends the turn over to McKenna. Turian then discarded Kamahl to the mongrel and McKenna just scooped. 


Tied 1-1


"I watched you discard [Ember Beast](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ember+Beast) and was like wow your hand must be good, that guy would be an all-star on my side. Then I saw you discard Kamahl and I knew your hand was very good" 


### Game 3


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/GPMON01/634.jpg)No [Mad Dog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mad+Dog) on turn two for McKenna but Turian has the turn two [Werebear](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Werebear) and turn three [Wild Mongrel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Mongrel). McKenna played a [Zoologist](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Zoologist) and Turian played a turn four Elephant. Turian attacked and said "Its scary to attack into the [Zoologist](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Zoologist)" which hit an [Elephant Ambush](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elephant+Ambush) and McKenna took some damage. Turian then played a [Savage Firecat](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Savage+Firecat). The game was over at this point and McKenna cast a [Chatter of the Squirrel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chatter+of+the+Squirrel)s. "Oh at least he saves some pride there" I pointed out. McKenna then just scooped his cards up.
