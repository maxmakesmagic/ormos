*You are the archenemy, and your goal is simple: the utter decimation of your fellow Planeswalkers. A force of unbridled malevolence, your power is so immense that their only hope is to join forces in a desperate attempt to defeat you.*


An Archenemy game follows a “one vs. many” format. In this exciting new multiplayer variant, an oversized deck packed with brutal scheme cards allows one player to assume the role of the *archenemy*, a merciless paragon of power bent on total domination.


The other players in the game must unite to defeat the archenemy and save the day—if they can.
