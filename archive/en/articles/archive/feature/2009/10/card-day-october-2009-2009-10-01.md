![All Hallow's Eve](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=All+Hallow%27s+Eve)**[All Hallow's Eve](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=All+Hallow%27s+Eve)** – *Legends* rare. [All Hallow's Eve](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=All+Hallow%27s+Eve) was originally printed as a sorcery, errata-ed to an enchantment, and then turned back into a sorcery that used the technology from the suspend mechanic. However, instead of suspend's time counters, [All Hallow's Eve](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=All+Hallow%27s+Eve) goes for flavor with scream counters.
 ![Incremental Growth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Incremental+Growth)**[Incremental Growth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Incremental+Growth)** – *Lorwyn* uncommon. [Incremental Growth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Incremental+Growth) is part of a loose ongoing series of "cone" cards, which includes [Incremental Blight](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Incremental+Blight) and, of course, [Cone of Flame](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cone+of+Flame).
 ![Dragon Mask](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Dragon+Mask)**[Dragon Mask](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragon+Mask)** – *Visions* uncommon. The art for [Dragon Mask](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragon+Mask) was originally intended for [Crimson Hellkite](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crimson+Hellkite), but it just wasn't dynamic enough. So the *Mirage* team created the idea of a mask that *looks* like a dragon so the art would have a home.
 ![Haunting Echoes](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Haunting+Echoes)**[Haunting Echoes](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Haunting+Echoes)** – *Odyssey* rare. In *Odyssey* playtesting, there was a time when [haunting Echoes](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=haunting+Echoes) didn't contain the words "other than basic lands". Playtesting with the same set's [Traumatize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Traumatize) soon fixed that.
 ![Headless Horseman](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Headless+Horseman)**[Headless Horseman](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Headless+Horseman)** – *Legends* common. Here's something cool: everyone that posts their **Magic Online** account name in the "[Halloween Tricks for Treats](http://community.wizards.com/magiconline/go/thread/view/76117/20569561/Halloween_Tricks_for_Treats)" thread (NOT the blog comments section) by 2 pm PDT/2100 UTC on October 28th will be awarded one [Headless Horseman](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Headless+Horseman) promo card. This *Legends* card has not been released on **Magic Online**, so here is your first chance to collect him! 
 ![Torch Slinger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Torch+Slinger)**[Torch Slinger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Torch+Slinger)** – *Zendikar* common. By an interesting "coincidence", the two mana that it costs to kick [Torch Slinger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Torch+Slinger) and deal 2 damage to a creature is very similar to the two mana it would cost to play and equip an actual [Blazing Torch](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blazing+Torch).
 ![Umara Raptor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Umara+Raptor)**[Umara Raptor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Umara+Raptor)** – *Zendikar* common. One of the challenges Mark Rosewater set for competitors in the Pro Tour–Austin edition of "Question Mark" was to list a *Zendikar* card beginning with each letter of the alphabet (except for X and Y, which don't have any). One of the trickier letters was U, which has only [Unstable Footing](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Unstable+Footing) and [Umara Raptor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Umara+Raptor).
 ![Punishing Fire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Punishing+Fire)**[Punishing Fire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Punishing+Fire)** – *Zendikar* uncommon. [Punishing Fire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Punishing+Fire) can return to hand whenever an opponent gains life for any reason. Looking for a way to abuse that? Consider *forcing* the life gain, via cards like [Grove of the Burnwillows](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grove+of+the+Burnwillows) or [Invigorate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Invigorate)!
 ![Sphinx of Jwar Isle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Sphinx+of+Jwar+Isle)**[Sphinx of Jwar Isle](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sphinx+of+Jwar+Isle)** – *Zendikar* rare. On the Pro Tour, [Sphinx of Jwar Isle](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sphinx+of+Jwar+Isle) is popular because it has shroud, protecting it from [Terminate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Terminate) and [Maelstrom Pulse](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Maelstrom+Pulse). But it's popular on the coverage team for three little words:At. Any. Time. If you had one, you could be looking at the top card of your library *right now*. 
 ![Vampire Hexmage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Vampire+Hexmage)**[Vampire Hexmage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vampire+Hexmage)** – *Zendikar* uncommon. As we learned [over the weekend](/en/events/coverage/kibler-completes-comeback-austin-victory), [Vampire Hexmage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vampire+Hexmage) combos well with [Dark Depths](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dark+Depths). But think outside the box! It also works with [Phyrexian Etchings](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phyrexian+Etchings) and [Aboroth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aboroth), and it's an absolutely brutal card against [B-I-N-G-O](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=B-I-N-G-O)!
 ![Exhaustion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Exhaustion)**[Exhaustion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Exhaustion)** – *Ninth Edition* uncommon. [Exhaustion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Exhaustion) is what happens when you're already tired. If someone isn't quite tired enough, you can always cast [Sleep](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sleep) to push them over the edge.
 ![Sengir Bats](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Sengir+Bats)**[Sengir Bats](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sengir+Bats)** – *Homelands* common. The [Sengir Bats](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sengir+Bats) aren't just "bats that happen to live on the grounds of [Castle Sengir](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Castle+Sengir). They're actually all under the direct control of [Baron Sengir](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Baron+Sengir) himself, who can see through their eyes!
 ![Chromatic Star](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Chromatic+Star)**[Chromatic Star](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chromatic+Star)** – *Tenth Edition* uncommon. [Chromatic Star](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chromatic+Star) is almost identical to [Chromatic Sphere](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chromatic+Sphere), except that it got a wording change to fix an obscure hiccup caused by the timing of the card draw on the sphere.
 ![Steamcore Weird](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Steamcore+Weird)**[Steamcore Weird](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Steamcore+Weird)** – *Guidpact* common. There are only [three Weirds](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?action=advanced&subtype=+%5BWeird%5D) in **Magic**, and they're all in *Guildpact*. But if they were more common, they wouldn't be all that weird, would they?
 ![Musician](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Musician)**[Musician](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Musician)** – *Ice Age* rare. Even after [Musician](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Musician) leaves play, the costs associated with the music counters have to be paid. Based on [Obsidian Fireheart](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Obsidian+Fireheart), we can assume that if [Musician](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Musician) were printed today, it would say "The music continues to play".
 ![Geyser Glider](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Geyser+Glider)**[Geyser Glider](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Geyser+Glider)** – *Zendikar* uncommon. The terrain of *Zendikar* is constantly undergoing upheavals and changes. The [Geyser Glider](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Geyser+Glider) has adapted to that environment, so when an unexpected lava geyser shoots it into the air, it casually spreads its wings and uses the height to improve its hunting area.
 ![Grazing Gladehart](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Grazing+Gladehart)**[Grazing Gladehart](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grazing+Gladehart)** – *Zendikar* common. [Grazing Gladehart](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grazing+Gladehart) is not spelled Glade**heart**. It's "hart", as in the name for a male deer. It's a deer, grazing in a glade. See?
 ![Ob Nixilis, the Fallen](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Ob+Nixilis%2C+the+Fallen)**[Ob Nixilis, the Fallen](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ob+Nixilis%2C+the+Fallen)** – *Zendikar* mythic rare. Ever wonder what Ob Nixilis was before he became The Fallen? The flavor text gives a hint, mentioning that he's lost his spark. Was Ob Nixilis once a planeswalker?
 ![Shoal Serpent](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Shoal+Serpent)**[Shoal Serpent](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shoal+Serpent)** – *Zendikar* common. The [Shoal Serpent](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shoal+Serpent)'s head looks a little odd, doesn't it? That's because at the moment we see it in the art, it's upside down! The eyes are onthe bottom, and the tongue is on the top!
 ![Eternity Vessel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Eternity+Vessel)**[Eternity Vessel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eternity+Vessel)** – *Zendikar* mythic rare. Here's a "great" combo: First, cast [Eternity Vessel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eternity+Vessel) when you're at a reasonable amount of life, like 15 or so. Then slam [Lich](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lich) on the table. Now every time you play a land, you'll draw however many cards your life was at! At fifteen cards per land, winning is left as an exercise for the student.
 ![Sea Gate Loremaster](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Sea+Gate+Loremaster)**[Sea Gate Loremaster](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sea+Gate+Loremaster)** – *Zendikar* rare. The Lighthouse at Sea Gate is the center of learning for explorers in Zendikar, and it sits in Tazeem, the homeland of the merfolk. The loremaster knows things that even the library does not contain.
 ![Guul Draz Vampire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Guul+Draz+Vampire)**[Guul Draz Vampire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Guul+Draz+Vampire)** – *Zendikar* common. In Guul Draz, vampires aren't the monsters; they're the citizens. The vampire homeland is a humid region of teeming lagoons and tangled, fetid swamps, but that isn't always enough to deter daring treasure-seekers from the dangerous land.
