Both of these players lost an entire day flying to this country, and they obviously don't want to see their weekend end after only four measly rounds. Of course, facing a fellow teammate on the National Team just makes it that much worse, which is why U.S. Nationals winner Paul Cheon and runner-up Ben Lundquist groaned when they saw the Round 4 pairings. Nothing could be done, obviously. They simply shrugged and faced that fact that one of their Pro Tours would be over in less than sixty minutes.


### Game 1


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/ptkob06/Round4_Cheon.jpg)*Wait'll you see thisâ€¦*Cheon opened the game with a [Thallid Shell-Dweller](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thallid+Shell-Dweller), while Lundquist cast the saucy Urborg Syphon Mage, only to see it die immediately to a kicked [Thornscape Battlemage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thornscape+Battlemage). Lundquist answered right back with [Coal Stoker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Coal+Stoker) and [Orcish Cannonade](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Orcish+Cannonade). Removal continued to fly from each side of the board as both players struggled to keep a creature in play. 


[Coal Stoker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Coal+Stoker), [Magus of the Mirror](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Magus+of+the+Mirror), and [Clockwork Hydra](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Clockwork+Hydra) all fell outside of battle, while the life totals hardly moved. Finally, Lundquist managed to make a Stoker stick on the board for a couple of turns and started taking 3-point bites of Cheon's life. [Sedge Sliver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sedge+Sliver) added to Lundquist's beatdown, and Cheon packed it up, too burdened by the flood of land to make a further game of it.

### Game 2


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/ptkob06/Round4_Lundquist.jpg)*Lundquist brings it to the red zone.*The early turns of Game 2 were quiet ones, with Cheon suspending a [Durkwood Baloth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Durkwood+Baloth) while Lundquist cast a [Foriysian Totem](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Foriysian+Totem) and then followed with [Eron the Relentless](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eron+the+Relentless). Eron bashed for a turn before the mortars started whacking creatures faster than snitches in a season of The Sopranos, with [Orcish Cannonade](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Orcish+Cannonade) taking down the Legendary Human Rogue. 


Lundquist played his removal trump with [Sedge Sliver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sedge+Sliver), adding [Fire Whip](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fire+Whip) to it, but Cheon trumped right back with [Lightning Axe](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Axe) and [Strangling Soot](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Strangling+Soot) to get past Lundquist's regeneration mana.


This time it was Cheon's turn to attack with a hasty Eron, but obviously he died a turn later, this time to Lundquist's [Strangling Soot](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Strangling+Soot), before Ben cast [Basalt Gargoyle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Basalt+Gargoyle), which stuck around even past its echo payment. 


Meanwhile, Cheon was getting some traction behind [Clockwork Hydra](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Clockwork+Hydra), making the life totals 6 to 8 in his favor, but [Tendrils of Corruption](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tendrils+of+Corruption) killed a post-combat Jorael, Empress of Beasts to put Lundquist ahead again. This allowed Lundquist to beat for the win two turns later, eliminating Cheon from Day 2 contention. Looking at Lundquist's deck, he has a very real chance of running the table and getting the 3-0 necessary to keep on drafting.
