[The Day 1 metagame breakdown at Pro Tour *Kaladesh*](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/ptkld/day-1-standard-metagame-breakdown-2016-10-14) revealed a field led by [Aetherworks Marvel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aetherworks+Marvel) decks and a wide selection of aggressive strategies. After eight rounds of play, the field cut from 466 to 293 players.

The real story here is the lack of representative change across decks. The difference (change) in the percent of the field for archetypes from Day 1 to Day 2 is, overall, small. No one deck was a runaway success, and while [Aetherworks Marvel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aetherworks+Marvel) was clearly among the favored choices for collaborating players, it doesn't appear to have overwhelmed everything else.


If anything, being aggressive was still the best plan…by a sliver of overall percentage.


The two Day 1 undefeated players, seventh-ranked Shota Yasooka and Eric Froehlich, each made their mark with different decks. Froehlich's Black-Green Delirium was the second most popular archetype on Day 1, holding its spot for Day 2. It played between aggro and midrange, which gave it play against fast and slow decks alike.


The real talk of the tournament so far is what Yasooka went undefeated with: Grixis Control. With Vehicles playing a key part of the known decks leading up, the decision to play control at the Pro Tour wasn't one most players made. As one of the least represented overall archetypes, the tuning and toolset Yasooka brought spoke to his preparation. Packed with removal and countermagic, leading up to [Thing in the Ice](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thing+in+the+Ice) and [Torrential Gearhulk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Torrential+Gearhulk), Yasooka's calm dispatched aggressive opponents as easily as [Aetherworks Marvel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aetherworks+Marvel) combo decks.


With the field relatively stable for Day 2, there's little reason to believe either Yasooka or Froehlich would slow down their pace, or that [Aetherworks Marvel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aetherworks+Marvel) won't find it's way into the Top 8.
