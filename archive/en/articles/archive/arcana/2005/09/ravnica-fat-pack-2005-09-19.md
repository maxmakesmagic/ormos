Remember how cool the [9th Edition Fat Pack](/en/node/608941) looked?

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/mtgcom/arcana300/RavFatPack8675309.jpg)

Here's what you get for your $29.99 MSRP: 

* Two card boxes (standing on end in the back; the two creatures you can see clearly in the picture are Savra, Queen of the Golgari and Razia, Boros Archangel)
* The *Ravnica* Player's Guide, with images of every card in the set and background information on the set available nowhere else
* One of the new [Pro Player Cards](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/events/playercards)
* Six color dividers to keep your cards separated in the card boxes
* A special *Ravnica* life counter
* A 40-card [*Ravnica* basic land](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/feature/284) pack
* Six *Ravnica* boosters
At this point, you're wondering what else you get. Isn't this basically the same stuff that came with the *Ninth Edition* Fat Pack, except for the Pro Player card? Well, how about this:

* The *Ravnica* novel by Cory J. Herndon

Yes, those of you who were worried that the Fat Packs wouldn't contain the novel can rest easy. The Fat Pack has everything you need to jump start your *Ravnica* experience (or, if you've already jump started your *Ravnica* experience, it's just got a lot of cool stuff you want to own).
