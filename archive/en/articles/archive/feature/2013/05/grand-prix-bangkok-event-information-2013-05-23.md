Bangkok is also one of the world's top tourist destination cities with its multi-faceted sights, attractions, and city life appealing to diverse groups of tourists. **Magic: The Gathering** Grand Prix finally returns to Bangkok after a four-year hiatus. 


 Grand Prix Bangkok is open to the public and all players are invited to participate. With the completion of the *Return to Ravnica* block, what better way to celebrate one of **Magic**'s most exciting and colorful blocks than with a Sealed Deck of the entire block! In addition, the side event schedule will be jam-packed with exhilarating events with multiple formats. With Planeswalker Points multipliers of 8x for the main event and 3x for all side events, there is no better way to chalk up those Planeswalker Points! A Sleep-In Special will be available (for a fee) allowing players with byes to have more snooze time on Saturday. Local and international card dealers will be on hand, whether you are looking for that elusive card for your Commander deck or looking to offload your cards. 


 Register for the main event and receive a Grand Prix Bangkok exclusive [Savageborn Hydra](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Savageborn+Hydra) playmat by Raymond Swanland (while supplies last). What's more, Raymond Swanland will be in attendance as the guest artist for signatures and sketches on cards, prints and even the exclusive playmat! 


Come on down to Grand Prix Bangkok for an amazing and unforgettable weekend! 


  

 *The **Magic: The Gathering**  Grand Prix tournament series is a great reason to get out into the **Magic** tournament community, catch up with old friends, meet some new ones, and play some great **Magic**. Grand Prix tournaments are world-wide open events that allow all **Magic**  players to participate and experience the thrill of a large-scale competition. In addition to cash prizes, a high Planeswalker Points multiplier, and exclusive foil promo cards for participants, Grand Prix feature a host of other activities, including side events and artist signings (prizes subject to change).

**Tournament Structure** 


* Modified Swiss-style (50-minute rounds).

* The Top 8 players will be seated randomly at the draft table immediately prior to drafting. The Top 8 bracket will be determined using this random seating.
* Where necessary, the standings after the Swiss rounds will still be used to determine final order in the standings.
* For the first game of each match in the Top 8, the player that finished higher in the Swiss rounds chooses either to play first or to play second. For subsequent games in each Top 8 match, the usual Play/Draw rule applies (loser of the previous game decides whether to play first in the next game).
