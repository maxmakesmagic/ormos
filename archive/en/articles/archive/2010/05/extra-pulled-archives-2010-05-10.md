 Working in R&D since '95, Mark became Magic head designer in '03. His hobbies: spending time with family, writing about Magic in all mediums, and creating short bios. 






*Before there was Daily MTG, before there was **magicthegathering.com**, in the Time Before Time ... there was* The Duelist*, a monthly magazine that brought the latest **Magic** news, puzzles, previews, event coverage, and even card text to the masses.*


*In addition to all that "important" stuff, there were various articles and regular features showing off the lighter side of **Magic**. One enduring feature was Extra Pulled, featuring "rejected" **Magic** cards allegedly pulled from sets in development. Mark Rosewater—then* Duelist *editor, now the site's longest-running columnist—brought these humorous not-actually-cards to readers in a continuing series.*


*As one would expect, some of the jokes are anachronistic; we no longer scoff at the idea of a [Treefolk lord](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treefolk+lord), and the "Dojo Effect"—using deck lists from web sites like The **Magic** Dojo rather than a home-brewed list—hasn't been controversial for about a decade. But the spirit of fun and good-natured self-ribbing still rings true twelve years later.*


*Enjoy!*
