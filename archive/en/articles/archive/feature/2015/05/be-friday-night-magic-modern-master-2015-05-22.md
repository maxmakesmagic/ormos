DRAFT LIKE A MASTER
===================


*Modern Masters 2015 Edition* is more than a set filled with the all-starts of the Modern *Magic* era. It's also one epic drafting experience.


To participate, you'll need three *Modern Masters 2015 Edition* booster packs, some friends, and a few hours set aside for some fun. This set contains ten distinct archetypes built around the ten two-color combinations, and each archetype has its own distinctive play style as well as a representation of some of *Magic*'s most memorable Draft archetypes from the sets these cards come from.


Experience *Modern Masters* like it was intended to be experienced. Grab some packs, some friends, and get drafting!
