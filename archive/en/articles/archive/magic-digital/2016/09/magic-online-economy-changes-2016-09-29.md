Magic Online Economy Changes

Hi everyone!


I hope folks are enjoying Leagues, especially the new Draft Leagues. From our data, it certainly seems you are! We are always looking for ways to make *Magic Online* more accessible and convenient for you all, so in that vein, I wanted to stop by to announce some other big, exciting new changes coming to *Magic Online* next month.


Starting with the release of *Kaladesh,* we are reducing entry fees/requirements for the most current Draft and Sealed Deck events. This change applies to *Kaladesh* forward only, older sets and events are unchanged. This change should make *Magic Online* events more accessible and help emphasize *Magic Online*'s biggest benefit: playing *Magic* on your schedule.


As you might expect, this means changes to events, both in entry options as well as prize structures, and it also includes changes to redemption. Lee is going to talk about the details of the event and prize structure changes [in his article](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/magic-digital/magic-online-kaladesh-event-changes-2016-09-29)—all of which will be starting with *Kaladesh* Prereleases!


Speaking of *Kaladesh* Prereleases, we will be starting those a little earlier than normal—on Wednesday, October 5, immediately following the scheduled downtime. This is a trial change for *Kaladesh*, but if it is successful it is definitely something we'll consider for future releases. Note that we will be changing the *Legacy Cube* to end with the downtime on October 5 to accommodate this change, but again, make sure to check out [Lee's article](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/magic-digital/magic-online-kaladesh-event-changes-2016-09-29) for details on event changes.


Redemption Changes
==================


Starting with *Kaladesh* and for sets going forward, redemption for a given set will only be available until the first redemption set for the next block is available.


Looking at *Kaladesh*, this means that redemptions will start 30 days after the set is available for sale in the *Magic Online* store as normal. The same will happen for the *Aether Revolt* release. When *Amonkhet* redemption begins, *Kaladesh* and *Aether Revolt* redemption will end.

As I said above, this change only applies to *Kaladesh* forward. Earlier sets will continue to have the originally announced guarantee and cutoff dates for redemption. Full redemption information can be found on the [Redemption Policy page](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/magic-online-general-resources/magic-online-redemption-policies-2014-02-04).


Additionally, *Magic Online* versions of the *Kaladesh* *Inventions* and cards available only in the *Kaladesh* Planeswalker Decks are not required to redeem sets of *Kaladesh*, nor will those cards be included in any redeemed *Kaladesh* sets.


A New World
===========


We are excited about these changes to *Magic Online* and our hope is that they allow more *Magic* players to take part online. Between these changes and the new bright and exciting world of *Kaladesh*, it feels like a good time to be a *Magic Online* player!


Many of the changes in *Magic Online* in the past couple years have been a direct result of player feedback and behavior. If you have any feedback on these changes or other issues related to *Magic Online* events, please do not hesitate to reach out to [@MagicOnline](http://www.twitter.com/MagicOnline) or [@mtg\_lee](http://www.twitter.com/mtg_lee) on Twitter, or email [magiconlinefeedback@wizards.com](mailto:magiconlinefeedback@wizards.com). For general *Magic Online* feedback, I can be found on Twitter [@mtgworth](http://www.twitter.com/mtgworth). We read and appreciate all the ideas, excitement, passion, and feedback our players send us...truly!


Thanks for helping us make our game and community great.

Executive Producer, *Magic Online*
