Many older cards, like [Phyrexian Furnace](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phyrexian+Furnace), [Ashen Ghoul](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ashen+Ghoul), and [Phyrexian Grimoire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phyrexian+Grimoire) all revolved around a player's graveyard being in a specific order. But the rules for graveyard order have proven to be too tricky to keep making cards that require technically perfect play. Questions like, "Does the [Wrath of God](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wrath+of+God) go to the graveyard first, or all the dead creatures?" and "In which order do cards discarded to [Hymn to Tourach](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hymn+to+Tourach) go to the graveyard?" were impacting play a little too much.

[Volrath's Shapeshifter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Volrath%27s+Shapeshifter) from *Stronghold* was the last card printed that referred to the graveyard being in a specific order.
