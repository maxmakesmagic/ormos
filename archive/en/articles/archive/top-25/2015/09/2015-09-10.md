It's an off week for the players in the *Magic* Top 25 Pro Rankings. With the World Championship now in our rearview mirror, it's time for *Magic Origins* to have another dose of the Grand Prix spotlight before *Battle for Zendikar* takes on the mantle of a new Limited environment next month. Madrid in Spain plays host to *Origins* Limited this weekend, so we may see the likes of No. 9 Ondřej Stráský, No. 14 Joel Larsson, and No. 19 Antonio Del Moral León in action. Del Moral León will be on his home turf, and while it's notable that there are very few European players inside the Top 25 right now, Spain is certainly one country that is on a discernible upswing. Increasingly, we are seeing Spaniards at the top tables, and the void left by Joel Calafell is now starting to be filled by a group of players who regularly attend European Grand Prix and succeed when they do.


Elsewhere, Oklahoma City is the center of North American attention, as we swing into action in the Modern format. With the first six in the standings—Eric Froehlich, Seth Manfield, Mike Sigrist, Paul Rietzl, Sam Black, and Owen Turtenwald—all hailing from America, plus seven more in the Top 25, we can expect a star-studded event. There's also every chance that we will have a new World No. 1 by this time next week. Since Eric Froehlich had more points last season than new World Champion Seth Manfield (meaning his total decays faster as the 2015–16 season progresses), Froehlich will need to outperform Manfield in Oklahoma City if he is to retain the No. 1 spot. Even a no-show from both would likely see Manfield emerge from the weekend as the new No. 1.


However, we won't know for sure until the cards are played in earnest, so if you want to keep up to date with all the action, join us again next week here at the home of the *Magic* Top 25 Pro Rankings.
