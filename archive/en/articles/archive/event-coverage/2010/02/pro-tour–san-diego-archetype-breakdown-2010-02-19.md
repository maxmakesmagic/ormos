There were two questions on everyone's mind as the **Magic** world prepared for Pro Tour–San Diego: what would the impact of *Worldwake* be on Standard, and what was the Allies deck the Japanese were rumored to be brewing? We've patiently toiled through all the data from 413 contestants this weekend to bring you the cold hard numbers.


The Allies deck, it turned out, was either a ruse or a mis-classification. At Grand Prix–Oakland, a number of card dealers mentioned that numerous Japanese players had been scooping up various Ally cards from both *Worldwake* and *Zendikar*. That led to rampant speculation that players from the country, famous both for wacky decks and top Pro Tour talent, had come up with a strategy no one else was even talking about. Either the Japanese have pulled off the greatest ruse in Pro Tour history or they abandoned the idea altogether, because no Ally decks sat down to battle in San Diego.


What did sit down were over a hundred Jund players, making it the most popular deck in the field. Players varied over whether they wanted to use [Vampire Nighthawk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vampire+Nighthawk), [Putrid Leech](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Putrid+Leech), [Explore](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Explore), [Rampant Growth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rampant+Growth), and a host of other cards. We broke down the archetype into the subcategories of Leech and No Leech, which you can view below.


Second up was a bit of a surprise: White Weenie. The archetype isn't exactly a mainstay of Pro Tour competitors, who are occasionally guilty of considering "attacking" beneath them. Pro Tour–San Diego turns that conventional wisdom on its ear, as 41 players came to battle with the white creatures. Whether they also relied on [Stoneforge Mystic](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stoneforge+Mystic), tokens, or color splashes was a different matter altogether.


In third was Vampires, and there were two distinct builds: traditional Vampires didn't look far removed from the decks we've seen in the past few months since *Zendikar*'s release. The new versions have added *Worldwake* rare [Kalastria Highborn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kalastria+Highborn) as a means of getting extra edge out of interactions with [Bloodghast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodghast) and as protection against board-sweeper effects like [Day of Judgment](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Day+of+Judgment).


Bant and All-American Control rounded out the top five. Further down the list we found a host of smaller archetypes that were of particular interest for their roguey-ness. Numerous players are trying to abuse [Howling Mine](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Howling+Mine) and [Open the Vaults](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Open+the+Vaults), either in [Time Sieve](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Time+Sieve), Turbo [Fog](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fog), or [Open the Vaults](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Open+the+Vaults) decks. Generally the plan is to abuse drawing extra cards with a big turn or series of back-to-back [Time Warp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Time+Warp) / [Time Sieve](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Time+Sieve) turns that results in a decked or otherwise dead opponent.


Also seeing some play are [Valakut, the Molten Pinnacle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Valakut%2C+the+Molten+Pinnacle) combo decks that use green mana fetch to put a lethal amount of [Mountain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mountain)s onto the battlefield all at once. [Summoning Trap](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Summoning+Trap) made an appearance as players accelerated into the instant with things like [Rampant Growth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rampant+Growth) and [Trace of Abundance](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Trace+of+Abundance) to plop fatties like [Iona, Shield of Emeria](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Iona%2C+Shield+of+Emeria) into the path of their hapless opponents. Eldrazi Green is still proving to be a strong contender, and there were even a few copies of [Runeflare Trap](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Runeflare+Trap) decks as well as Unearth lists. Those decks try to abuse cycling with unearth and [Crypt of Agadeem](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crypt+of+Agadeem) to generate huge amounts of mana and overwhelm the opponent all in one turn.


For those interested, in addition to the main archetype breakdown above, here are a listing of sub-archetypes for Pro Tour–San Diego as well.
