======================

When a new set is released into Standard, it usually takes some amount of time for players to figure out how to incorporate it into their decks. When there is a large tournament on release weekend, such as the [StarCityGames Open in Baltimore](http://www.starcitygames.com/events/190714_baltimore.html) this past weekend, players have a tough decision to make. Do they stick with what is tried and true and something they know how to play well? Do they brave trying out a new deck, hoping that the value in catching opponents off guard might outweigh the unfamiliarity with the deck?



![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Sunblade Elf)

Andrew Boswell decided to take a middle road with his green-white deck en route to a 2nd-place finish at the Open. While keeping the core of his aggressive green-white deck intact, Andrew added a few *Magic 2015* cards to his deck in order to throw his opponents off without compromising his ability to play the deck. This deck begins with cheap creatures, such as [Experiment One](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Experiment+One), [Soldier of the Pantheon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soldier+of+the+Pantheon), and [Voice of Resurgence](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Voice+of+Resurgence). *Magic 2015*'s [Sunblade Elf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sunblade+Elf) is another 2-power creature for one mana that helps the deck generate aggressive starts, but [Sunblade Elf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sunblade+Elf) has a late-game ability to boost all of your creatures.



Speaking of boosting all of your creatures, the sideboard features [Ajani Steadfast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ajani+Steadfast) to provide a potentially repeatable way to make all of your creatures bigger. [Ajani Steadfast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ajani+Steadfast) also shines in racing situations, as the combination of vigilance and lifelink can swing a race in your favor. Ajani is particularly powerful with large creatures, such as [Loxodon Smiter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Loxodon+Smiter) and [Advent of the Wurm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Advent+of+the+Wurm) tokens.
