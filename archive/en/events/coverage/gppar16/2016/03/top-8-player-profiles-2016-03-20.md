### Paolo Magnani


**Age:** 27


**Occupation:** Bomberteam pro


**Hometown:** Rome, Italy


**Previous Magic accomplishments:**


I sometimes beat my buddy Marco Cammilluzzi.


**What deck did you play and why?**


Mardu Green. Marco shipped me his list and it kind of reminded me of Modern Jund.


**What changes would you make to your deck and why?**


Probably put some [Cranial Extraction](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cranial+Extraction) effect into the sideboard.


**What's the most important card in your deck?**


[Siege Rhino](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Siege+Rhino).

### Giuseppe Reale


**Age:** 31


**Occupation:** Cammilluzzi's best friend


**Hometown:** Rome, Italy


**Previous Magic accomplishments:**


Back to back Top 8s. Here and at Grand Prix Bologna.


**What deck did you play and why?**


Four-Color Rally. It's the best one.


**What changes would you make to your deck and why?**


Ask Owen Turtenwald.


**What's the most important card in your deck?**


[Reflector Mage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reflector+Mage).

### Ryoichi Tamada


**Age:** 31


**Occupation:** Shop owner


**Hometown:** Osaka, Japan


**Previous Magic accomplishments:**


One Pro Tour Top 8, two Grand Prix Top 8s.


**What deck did you play and why?**


Bant Company. [Collected Company](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Collected+Company) and [Reflector Mage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Reflector+Mage) are very nice. But Four-Color Rally is weak against [Dispel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dispel) and [Hallowed Moonlight](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hallowed+Moonlight).


**What changes would you make to your deck and why?**


None.


**What's the most important card in your deck?**


[Wingmate Roc](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wingmate+Roc).

### Martin Jůza


**Age:** 28


**Occupation:** Professional tourist


**Hometown:** Plzen, Czech Republich


**Previous Magic accomplishments:**


Some Top 8s here and there.


**What deck did you play and why?**


Abzan, because this is the last Standard Grand Prix where [Siege Rhino](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Siege+Rhino) is legal. Also, because it's great.


**What changes would you make to your deck and why?**


I'd replace one [Arashin Cleric](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arashin+Cleric) in the sideboard with [Kalitas, Traitor of Ghet](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kalitas%2C+Traitor+of+Ghet). I just forgot to do that before the tournament.


**What's the most important card in your deck?**


[Siege Rhino](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Siege+Rhino), duh.

**Occupation:**


**Hometown:** Prague, Czech Republic


**Previous Magic accomplishments:**


Pro Tour Top 16, Grand Prix Top 8, gold-level pro.


**What deck did you play and why?**


Grixis. I never considered not playing [Jace, Vryn's Prodigy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace%2C+Vryn%27s+Prodigy) and [Dig Through Time](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dig+Through+Time) as long as they are legal, and Grixis seemed like the best shell for them.


**What changes would you make to your deck and why?**


The deck is the best.


**What's the most important card in your deck?**


[Dig Through Time](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dig+Through+Time).

Dark Jeskai. Plays all close games, every one is a sweat, never know if you will win or lose.


**What changes would you make to your deck and why?**


Take the [Arashin Cleric](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arashin+Cleric)s out of the sideboard. No one played Atarka Red.


**What's the most important card in your deck?**


[Jace, Vryn's Prodigy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace%2C+Vryn%27s+Prodigy). Best card in Standard.

Take out [Dragonlord's Prerogative](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragonlord%27s+Prerogative), put in [Painful Truths](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Painful+Truths).
