'Would you like to play *Friday Night Magic*?' isn't a question I usually have too much trouble answering. 'Yes', obviously. Yesterday, however, there was a problem. Or closer to 249 problems. The format, you see, was M12 draft, and much to my surprise the 63 Japanese players in the 64 player field at Japanese *Friday Night Magic* here in Japan had opted for Japanese M12 boosters, featuring Japanese on all the Japanese cards.


I don't speak Japanese. I don't read Japanese.


As I believe I may have said earlier, 249 problems.


Still, surely it couldn't be that bad, could it? With an hour to go before decision time, I took my handy M12 Player's Guide, and started working out just how much I didn't know about the set that was only released yesterday. Here's the edited version, with all the swearing taken out:


First, 20 basic lands, know what those do. 229. Next, 119 cards I remember from 15 years of playing *Magic*. 110. Well, I managed to play a midnight pre-release draft last weekend, so I can eliminate the cards I played with and against there. That takes me to 90. That's still a lot of cards I don't know. So, let's eliminate all the Mythic Rares. If someone plays one against me, I'll just have to ask. And if I open one and don't know what it does, I'll take it anyway. I can always look it up after the draft! Now I can get rid of all the cards that are vanilla monsters, things like [Armored Warhorse](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Armored+Warhorse). Then there are the cards I can guess at, because in the middle of all the Japanese text you get the +1 +1 bit on cards like [Benalish Veteran](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Benalish+Veteran).


Hey, this is easy! Anyone can play with a set they don't know in a language they can't read!


By the time I sat down to begin this strangest of exams I hadn't prepared for, I felt like I had a reasonable chance of knowing what at least most of the cards in my deck would do. I worked on the basis that if a card was costing a lot less than it 'should', then I was probably going to find a nasty surprise waiting for me when I finished the draft. You know the sort of thing:


2GG  



In the event, things went (mostly) ok. I opened a five cost white flyer ([Peregrine Griffin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Peregrine+Griffin)), found that blue was clearly open (with double [Belltower Sphinx](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Belltower+Sphinx)), and opened the [Garruk, Primal Hunter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Garruk%2C+Primal+Hunter) in the last pack, taking it anyway. I only got really stumped by this guy:

Right then. A 1/2 for two mana, with a tap ability that has to be sufficiently good to demand paying mana as well. Trouble is, because it's blue, that ability could be utterly pointless. I took it, and subsequently discovered it was [Merfolk Mesmerist](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Merfolk+Mesmerist). Now, since I had double [Belltower Sphinx](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Belltower+Sphinx), and had also picked up a couple of random late-pick [Jace's Erasure](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace%27s+Erasure)s, there were possibilities. In the end, though, I came to the conclusion I was probably not going to need them. Here's what I ended up playing:


1 [2&2 for U that runs away when it's targeted](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=380219)  

1 [White tapper dude](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=228122)  

1 [2&1 white guy for 1L with a 1L ability](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=220264)  

1 [1&1 flyer that gets +3+3 when something or other happens](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=220282)  

1 [Aether Adept](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aether+Adept)  

2 [3&1s for 2U that almost certainly fly, looks like they fly, can only block flyers?](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=220153)  

1 [Assault Griffin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Assault+Griffin)  

2 [Belltower Sphinx](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Belltower+Sphinx)  

1 [2&4 flying first strike in white](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=238327)  

3 [Elixir of Immortality](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elixir+of+Immortality)  

1 [Ice Cage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ice+Cage)  

2 [Frog instant thingy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=389730)  

1 [Mighty Leap](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mighty+Leap)  

2 [Cancel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cancel)  

2 [Divination](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Divination)  

1 [Mind Control](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mind+Control)  

11 [Island](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island)s  

6 [Plains](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plains)


Yes, that's three copies of [Elixir of Immortality](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elixir+of+Immortality). I won my first two rounds easily, never dropping into single figures before taking control with an endless supply of life gain, card draw, and countermagic, not to mention high-toughness flyers. I was worried about a potential black-red aggro deck, and did indeed meet that in the final, getting battered in game one, despite using [Ice Cage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ice+Cage) on his turn one [Goblin Fireslinger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Fireslinger). It turns out that [Goblin War Paint](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+War+Paint) is quite an effective answer to [Ice Cage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ice+Cage)...


Still, all's well that ends well, and the Elixirs did their thing in games two and three. *Friday Night Magic* victory was mine!
