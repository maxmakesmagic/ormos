DAY 3 COVERAGE



Overcoming all odds, and emphasized in the pivotal final game of the 2014 World *Magic* Cup, a series of timely draws assured Team Denmark's victorious and epic victory over Team Greece.


After both Denmark and Greece emerged triumphant over a multitude of juggernaut and newcomer countries all weekend, the two unexpected underdogs found themselves battling to make *Magic* history in the final match. It all came down to the final game between Simon Nielsen and Panagiotis Savvidis in a battle to see whose Whip or Erebos deck would push their team to victory. After Savvidis battled back after a stall on mana, and leaning on the power of Ashiok, Nightmare Weaver, it appeared Denmark was done. However, a series of draws from Denmark's Abzan Whip deck featuring Siege Rhino, Duneblast, and Wingmate Roc closed the door on Greece, and ensured Denmark's win.


For Team Denmark, history has been made. Congratulations to the 2014 World *Magic* Cup champions!

Here are the Top 5 Cards of the 2014 World Magic Cup.




5. Butcher of the Horde

With teams coming in from all over the world, variety in a format like Team Unified Standard seems like the norm rather than the exception. But across all players in all nations, the m...

It was the all-underdog finals that nobody could have predicted. Two of Magic's under-represented countries shocked the world, and now stood on the cusp of greatness.

Stories like England's don't come around often at major events. Given the way tournament structure typically works, players who hope to Top 8 a tournament must do well throughout the entire weekend. Starting 0-2 can be a death knell to a competitor's hopes of playing...

It was a tale of three games, three matches, three players, a tale of luck and fortune, a tale of skill and guile. It was a tale full of drama and suspense.

[by Adam Styborski](/en/events/coverage/2014WMC/quarterfinals-greece-vs-south-korea-2014-12-07)

Titles are a powerful incentive for players, but those competing in the World Magic Cup Top 8 were often driven by much more.

For the team from Greece, it had been a hard-fought battle to make it to Top 8. Without top seeding in the pool rounds, the Hellenic team ne...

Brazil may have had the advantage in team strength thanks to Edel and Saporito, but England had already bested them in Standard. Now they would play to advance to Top 4.

It wasn't quite winner take all, but clinching a World Magic Cup Top 8 was a key piece of what every team this weekend wanted. Making the Top 8 of the World Magic Cup earned players a few benefits, such as invitations and airfare to the next Pro Tour (in this case, P...

Unified Standard presents teams with a unique challenge: build three decks out of one play-set of Standard. Finding the best mix of strategies that don't overlap is no small feat. This year, the conventional wisdom has it that your decks are heavily influenced by two...

One thing the World Magic Cup does like no other event in Magic is bring people together.
