![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/ptyok03/a372.jpg)Kastle- "For Houston we thought [Tinker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tinker) was going to be one of the two big decks, and that's the main reason I played this deck (The Rock). This should be like a bye."

### Game 1

Kibler double mulliganed to start; this was the third game in a row that Kastle's opponent started with five cards. Kastle played [Cabal Therapy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cabal+Therapy) naming [Grim Monolith](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grim+Monolith). Kibler had it, along with [Upheaval](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Upheaval), [Thran Dynamo](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thran+Dynamo) and [Tangle Wire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tangle+Wire). A second Therapy took out [Thran Dynamo](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thran+Dynamo), and Kibler was stuck with [Rishadan Port](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rishadan+Port) and [City of Traitors](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=City+of+Traitors) as his only lands. Kastle cast [Vampiric Tutor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vampiric+Tutor) (likely getting a forest), and summoned [Llanowar Elves](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Llanowar+Elves).

[Tangle Wire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tangle+Wire) tied up Kastle's resources for a few turns, and he played a second Elves. One was sacrificed and [Cabal Therapy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cabal+Therapy) was flashed back to take [Upheaval](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Upheaval), leaving [Urza's Blueprints](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Urza%27s+Blueprints), [Thran Dynamo](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thran+Dynamo), [Mishra's Helix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mishra%27s+Helix) and [Masticore](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Masticore) in Kibler's hand. The other was flashed back, and got rid of the [Masticore](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Masticore). [Haunting Echoes](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Haunting+Echoes) followed, taking all the [Upheaval](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Upheaval)s, [Masticore](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Masticore)s, Dynamos and Monoliths out of Kibler's deck. On the following turn Kastle played [Birds of Paradise](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Birds+of+Paradise) and [Yavimaya Elder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Yavimaya+Elder), leaving him with no cards in hand.

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/ptyok03/a371.jpg)Kibler got himself back in the game, using [Thran Dynamo](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thran+Dynamo) and [Voltaic Key](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Voltaic+Key) to get out [Urza's Blueprints](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Urza%27s+Blueprints). Kibler drew two cards by untapping the Blueprints with [Voltaic Key](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Voltaic+Key). This would have been really bad for Kastle if it continued, but he used [Vampiric Tutor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vampiric+Tutor) to get [Pernicious Deed](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pernicious+Deed) and clear the table. Kibler came right back with [Phyrexian Processor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phyrexian+Processor), setting it to eight. Kastle player another Deed, and [Duress](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress) on the following turn, seeing [Stroke of Genius](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stroke+of+Genius), [Phyrexian Colossus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phyrexian+Colossus), [Tangle Wire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tangle+Wire), [Mishra's Helix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mishra%27s+Helix) and [Tangle Wire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tangle+Wire)- Kibler lost the Stroke. Kastle used the Deed, destroying a Key and the Processor along with the token. [Ravenous Baloth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ravenous+Baloth) followed, while Kibler had [Metalworker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Metalworker), which died right away to [Diabolic Edict](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Diabolic+Edict). [Tinker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tinker) turned [Tangle Wire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tangle+Wire) into [Crumbling Sanctuary](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crumbling+Sanctuary), giving Kibler a little more breathing room since he was at two life and staring down a Baloth.

[Cabal Therapy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cabal+Therapy) stripped [Phyrexian Colossus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phyrexian+Colossus) from Kibler's hand, as the Baloth took four cards off the top of Kibler's library. Eventually, Kibler conceded.

Kibler- 0 Kastle- 1

### Game 2

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/ptyok03/a370.jpg)Kibler mulliganed his opening hand. [Duress](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress) took away Processor and revealed [Masticore](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Masticore), [Stroke of Genius](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stroke+of+Genius), [Tangle Wire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tangle+Wire) and [Metalworker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Metalworker). Kibler's only land was the [City of Traitors](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=City+of+Traitors) he had in play. The [Metalworker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Metalworker) came out, and [Rishadan Port](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rishadan+Port) buried the City. [Cabal Therapy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cabal+Therapy) took care of [Masticore](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Masticore), and a second got [Tangle Wire](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tangle+Wire). Without many options left, [Metalworker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Metalworker) attacked for one and the Port was activated on upkeep. Kastle played [Treetop Village](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treetop+Village), while Kibler got a second Port. [Diabolic Edict](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Diabolic+Edict) killed [Metalworker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Metalworker), and was followed by [Llanowar Elves](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Llanowar+Elves).

Kibler played [Ancient Tomb](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ancient+Tomb), and Kastle had [Pernicious Deed](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pernicious+Deed). Stroke on end step gave Kibler two cards, and he used both Ports on Kastle's upkeep. [Duress](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress) took [Voltaic Key](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Voltaic+Key), leaving Kibler with only [Ancient Tomb](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ancient+Tomb) in hand. [Yavimaya Elder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Yavimaya+Elder) gave Kastle a little more to work with, as he had Kibler at a loss for resources but not much pressure on the board to take full advantage (although he did have Deed as an insurance policy). After a few turns, [Voltaic Key](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Voltaic+Key) was [Tinker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tinker)ed into [Masticore](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Masticore), which could shoot down Kastle's two creatures and survive Deed. Regardless, Kastle had Edict to handle it and won the match.

**Final Result:** Kibler- 0 Kastle- 2
