A fixture on the Pro Tour for the last eight years, Raphaël is uniquely positioned to answer your questions about the life of a professional **Magic** player, give a historical perspective on the game and high-level tournament scene, share stories about travelling the world, and talk about the role **Magic** plays in his life.

Seventh on the lifetime Pro Points list, Raphaël began his Pro Tour career back at Pro Tour-Paris in 1997. He became a regular on the tour starting at the 1998 World Championships. Since then he hasn't missed a Pro Tour, an astounding streak of 49 consecutive events. He was recently honored as a member of the [**Magic** Pro Tour Hall of Fame](/en/node/574031)'s 2006 class and was inducted at the 2006 World Championships in Paris.

Answers will be posted every Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday. 

**March 31, 2007****Q**: Bonjour. Congratulations on your recent GP wins. While checking the coverage of [Grand Prix–Kyoto](/en/events/coverage/amateur-wins-kyoto), I saw that two of the undefeated decks were Project-X decks. Although you did not earn much success at Worlds 2006, I believe you piloted a very innovative and creative deck. How do you feel when the decks you created in Constructed are used by others to win big events? Similarly, how does it feel that a deck you piloted but did not design (Project-X, for example) becomes a top deck?  
 - Rex Lim   



**A:** Salut Rex, 


I've had quite a lot of success in Constructed lately, mostly thanks to decks I didn't design. Project X in the Standard portion of Worlds, TePS in Extended, and later Domain Zoo in both Dallas and Singapore all had important impacts on their respective metagames. 


I got a fair amount of credit for piloting the decks successfully. Of course, I would have liked to come up with the ideas of the decks I played myself, but it's just out of my limited deckbuilding range. The deck designers usually don't get enough credit for their work, and unless you read the right reports, you surely don't know that Project X was created by Vincent Lemoine and Geoffrey Siron in Belgium before Worlds. 


It's one of the goals of every player to have his name associated to a deck. I both feel glad and proud that my name is associated to some of the top decks and grateful to the ones who worked on them beforehand. Choosing the right deck to play is part of the game. Having it in the top tier of a given format is almost as rewarding as doing well with it.

  
**March 29, 2007****Q**: Now that you are talking about Pro Points, there are fewer Grand Prix this season (only 13 announced). How does it affect to the POY race and the pros?   
 -Christian   



**A:** Hello Christian, 


As I mentioned in my March 20 answer, the Player of the Year race and the levels will be a lot more influenced by the GPs as each stop gives away more Pro Points. 


Last year, Shouta Yasooka won the race thanks to his good finishes in all four Pro Tours of the season: 34th in Honolulu, 19th in Prague, first in Charleston and 33rd in Kobe, and his five Top 8s in Grand Prix. With the system used today, Shouta would have finished the 2006 season with at least five more points – a PT top 64, or half a pro level. 


The fact that the GPs are more important now is undeniable, regarding the race and the Pro Club levels. However, 13 have been announced, four have been played already, but more are to come (Wizards just hasn't announced them to the public yet as details are being finalized).


The more Grand Prix stops in the season, the more difficult it is for those who hate to travel to win Player of the Year.


  
**March 27, 2007****Q**: Yo :) I was just wondering, in a Standard Constructed tournament such as Grand Prix–Kyoto, I noticed some people playing a Battle of Wits deck with 240-plus cards in it ([Kazuya Mitamura finished Day One at 8-0-1](/en/articles/archive/event-coverage/day-2-blog-archive-2007-03-18)). I was just wondering how do they shuffle, and how do they place their deck in the designated deck area, etc?   
 -Brendan   



**A:** Yo Brendan,


I played a Battle of Wits deck once at Worlds in 2005 and I can share my experience here: 


- One enjoyable thing is that you always play a different game. You have so many different cards that it's fun to see a new card in your hand.

- For the same reason, your opponent never knows what to expect.

- It can surprisingly do very well – 8-0-1 in Kyoto is quite impressive. The fact that you're running so many cards doesn't affect so much the strength of your "control deck." The redundancy of the cards makes it – almost – as stable as any 60-card deck.

However:   


- 50-minute rounds make the shuffling an issue. During pre-game shuffling and after sideboard, you need another pair of hands to help you. You can either call a judge, or ask your opponent. For some reasons, the latter will pay a particular attention to shuffling your deck ... well, maybe because unconsciously he suspects you to take advantage of the size of your deck to ... you know, cheat.

- Unless you buy really slippery sleeves, you shouldn't have problems placing your deck in a corner of the table.

- You may need a plastic bag to carry your deck around between rounds.

- You may also want to shuffle your deck between rounds as well, to save some time later on.

- You must have a predefined sideboard plan. Going through your whole deck after Game 1 might take more than three minutes if you don't know already what to take out.

And of course, the biggest problem is that you need a lot of cards. If you're like me and you don't own the cards you need to build decks, you should pass on this one!

**March 24, 2007****Q**: I was recently at a PTQ where I went 5-2 and got ninth place. :( What do you do as a player to overcome the agony of finishing one spot out of a Top 8 or 16?  
 - Thanks, Ro   



**A:** Hi Ro, 


First of all, to ease your pain, I wanted to let you know that in most French PTQs, some 5-1-1s don't even make the cut. But I know, it usually doesn't help to know that there's always less fortunate than yourself. 


Anyways, a lot has been written about your case:


- No stone cannot be polished without friction, no man cannot perfect his experiment without test. *Confucius*

- Better a patient man than a warrior, a man who controls his temper than one who takes a city. *The Bible, Proverbs 14:29*

- Anger leads to hate. Hate leads to suffering. *Master Yoda, The Phantom Menace.*

What it means basically is that it's too bad for you, but there's no need in being angry or agonising. You don't have to throw chairs around or punch a wall. You'll make it soon enough.


- Learn and move on. *Raphaël, ATP, March 24, 2007.*

  
**March 22, 2007****Q**: How much is a Pro Point really worth in terms of dollars, assuming you're going to be at least Level 4 or so. Obviously it depends on a lot of things, but when you pros think of justifying the cost to attend an event, what kind of approximate expected value do you give 1 Pro Point?  
 -Doron Blake  



**A:** Hi again Doron,


The answer to your question depends on many different factors:


- The Pro level you want to reach

- The Pro level you currently have

First of all, how much are the different levels worth:


**Level 3: 20 points**  
 $500 per Pro Tour (4 Pro Tours a year + Worlds)   
 = 5\*500   
 = $2,500


**Level 4: 30 points**  
 $1,000 per PT  
 1 trip per season (estimated at $700)  
 = (5\*1,000)+700  
 = $5,700


**Level 5: 40 points**  
 $1,500 per PT  
 $250 per GP (expected to attend 12 GPs)  
 All the trips to PTs  
 = (1,500\*5)+(12\*250)+(5\*700)  
 = $14,000


**Level 6: 50 points**  
 $2,000 per PT  
 $500 per GP (expected to attend 12 GPs)  
 All the trips to PTs  
 All the hotel on PT locations (estimated at $200)  
 = (2,000\*5)+(12\*500)+(5\*700)+(5\*200)  
 = $20,500


The simplest way to calculate how much a Pro Point is worth would be to divide each bonus you get when you level up by how many points you need. For example, up to Level 3, each Pro Point would be worth:  
 $2,500/20  
 = $125


You also have to keep in mind that the first nine points (or first 19 up to Level 3) of each step are worth nothing if you don't get the 10th one (or 20th).


From there, you have to calculate differently and not consider point individually, but as a part of a set of 10. For example, to level up from Level 4 to 5, 10 points are worth $8,300. 


When hunting for Pro Points, you will have to calculate how much you have to spend in plane tickets and hotel rooms to capture the 10 points. Thanks to stats you have about yourself, you can know how many points on average you make at each GP stop and see how many you have to play in order to make the 10 points. If the total expenses are superior to the expected value of the level you want to reach, then you may decide not to go. 


To sum it up, the Pro Point raises in value at the end of a season, when players have set their objectives and want to get the 10th point that would allow them to level up. As for an example, when I was fighting for Level 5 last season, I considered every point being worth between $800 and $900.


  
**March 20, 2007****Q**: Have you or any of the other dedicated pros you know tried to get Wizards to make the Grand Prix circuit a little more user-friendly in terms of travelling? Looking at the schedule, there are five GPs within a month and they're absolutely all over the place. It seems like Wizards might achieve better turnout from you guys if it went something like Kyoto-Singapore-Amsterdam-Massachusetts-Dallas, rather than Dallas-Singapore-Amsterdam-Mass-Kyoto...  
 - Doron Blake   



**A:** Hello Doron,


GPs are a lot more important now than what they used to be. One Pro Point for a top 64, three for a top 16 – same as a PT top 200 – and even more for a Top 8, they are mandatory stops if you want to achieve a good season or reach a high level in the Pro Players Club. So basically, Pro players are bound to travel – a lot – to capture PT Points.


Wizards is often trying to make pro players' lives easier and better. The Pro Players Club they set up was a good start. The Pro Lounge sure makes the PTs cozier. But there's a lot more things that could be improved.


Wizards of the Coast has offices around the world, and each region's office is in charge of the local Grand Prix. When you factor in all that goes into putting on an event (booking the site, coordinating schedules, having it not conflict with other major events like PTs or Prereleases, etc.), the offices on each continent can't perfectly coordinate when the GPs happen. That's why the GPs were so close to each other and that some of them take place at the same time (Grand Prix-Strasbourg and Grand Prix-Columbus, for example). The fact that they were all over the place, and not really easily reachable, was out of anybody's control. It was announced, unofficially, that they would work more carefully on the GP schedule next season.


I threw the idea some time ago, to create some kind of official "syndicate" of players, to talk about issues like these. For legal reasons, it's impossible to make such thing. We'll probably manage at some point to set up meetings between the Wizards' staff and us, pro players, to share our ideas and wishes (it already happens unofficially at major events, where we give feedback). I don't know how much influence we can have on organized play, but it could be a good way to improve it. 


  
**March 17, 2007****Q**: What's it like playing an opponent who doesn't speak your language, and how do you effectively communicate with them?  
 - Greg Schwartz   



**A:** Hi Greg,


Magic is now spread worldwide and it's common to see players who don't speak the same language playing against each other, at any level of competition. The tournament rules ask players to make an effort to make sure their opponents know what's going on. 


Even when players don't have a language in common, **Magic** has an international vocabulary that doesn't require them to speak that much. "Play," "draw," "attack," "block," "stack," and "go" are words known by everyone ... and it's mostly all the words you will need to know to have a normal game going. 


To avoid problems, you will have to be extra careful when you're playing under these circumstances. Even without words, you can manage to make yourself understood clearly by your opponent by using signs, for example. In the worst case, you can ask a judge who can translate. 


Misunderstandings due to the language barrier can lead to strange situations where your opponent takes advantage of the fact that he "didn't understand what was going on" and gets himself a "take back" for a mistake he just made. That's something you can avoid by being super clear.


  
**March 15, 2007****Q**: Do the best Limited Pros have an encyclopaedic knowledge of cards in any given set?

 - James S., Glasgow   



**A:** Hi James,


When the format is new, pros learn all the common tricks as fast as possible. They are the ones that will see the most plays and that you'll have to play around the most. When you play around a trick your opponent may hold, you have to take in consideration a couple of factors:


1. How will the trick he may have affect the game if you run into it  
 2. What are the chances of him having it 


Most of the common tricks will have a limited impact on the game. They're often spot pump or removal spells that usually don't provide card advantage naturally (as in: "destroy two creatures"). As they are commons, they are likely to be in your opponent's deck and with some experience, you will be able to play around them all.


It's a different story for rare tricks. Not everyone has the time to practice enough to know them all and what to expect when your opponent has access to any kind of mana. In general, before making a play, you will have to ask yourself "What can my opponent do now?" Try to gather all the information you have to figure it out. The mana open on your opponent's side, the cards you may have passed in the draft, the way he has been playing so far. Most rare tricks are devastating when you find the right window to play them. I'm thinking about "[Word of Seizing](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Word+of+Seizing)" or "[Draining Whelk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Draining+Whelk)" type of game-changing plays. Both can be played around and I know that when I see my opponent passing the turn with cards in hand and ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20160830042801im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/colorless4.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161115194122im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/blue.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161115194122im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/blue.gif) open, I'm thinking about [Draining Whelk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Draining+Whelk). 


After you played a large number of games in a given format and if you've paid enough attention, you'll end up playing around all kind of tricks, common or rare. Sometimes it won't matter as you can't simply play around everything, but having a perfect knowledge of all cards will definitely save you some games. The knowledge isn't that much encyclopaedic, but more relative to the cards' power levels.


  
**March 13, 2007** Hello everyone!


I'm not answering to any one question in particular today. However, you may find the answer to one of yours in what follows.


First of all, I'd like to thank you all for your messages following my recent successes at Grand Prix. I'll sure make a good use of your support in the next events. To be honest, I don't really know what happened! The deck was great (still a good choice if you still have PTQs to play), my companions as friendly as they could be. 


For everything related to what kind of illicit substances I may have taken or if I can sign autographs on very specific parts of the body, just come to me at the next events I'll attend – Grand Prix-Massachusetts, Pro Tour-Yokohama or Grand Prix-Stockholm – and I'll make sure to answer your question/request!


For everyone sending me rule questions: I unfortunately don't answer them. To find answers to your rules problems, the easiest way is to log on Efnet on IRC, join #mtgjudge, and ask your question there. Judges from around the world are logged on 24/7 and will be able to help you faster and better than I would ever do. 


 I hope you're still enjoying reading this column (unless you never did), and don't hesitate to give your feedback!


  
**March 10, 2007****Q**: My mom says **Magic** is a waste of my time. She doesn't understand how important it is to me. What can I do to convince her that biochemistry is for nerds and being a professional **Magic** player can be my career!!!  
 -Thaddius Milkerton  



**A:** Hello Thaddius,


I always thought that **Magic** was for nerds in people’s minds! I’m sorry to say that, but I’m afraid your mom is right. As I repeated many times in here, you don’t become a pro player just by wanting to become one. 


**Magic** should not become more than a hobby or a way to express one’s competitive spirit. And **Magic** as a hobby is a fine thing. It allows you to focus on a specific mental activity and take a break from whatever is going on in your life. But even if you love **Magic** more than anyone else in the world, it’s still not likely that you can make a living at it. I heard school was a pretty good way to get a job in the long run. 


Unless you manage to qualify to the Pro Tour and make a few thousand dollars on your first tries, don’t drop out of school or make **Magic** your number one priority. In the case you actually do make a few thousand dollars on your first tries, you will still have to think about it. 


Oh and by the way, isn’t biochemistry the subject all the girls flock to? 


  
**March 8, 2007****Q**: I was recently at a PTQ where I went 4-1. With one round left I played, lost, went 4-2 overall and came in ninth. After looking at the standings I felt like if I had drawn with my opponent we both would have made Top 8. Could you explain how this works and how newer players can tell if they should draw their last match to make the Top 8? Thanks,  
 -Kruger   



**A:** Hi Kruger,


Before playing your last round, you usually have a few minutes to figure what you need to make Top 8. 


In a six-round Swiss round tournament, it’s simple math. The undefeated players will be in whether they play or draw. When you are 4-1 and wondering if you can draw, you have to check how many players can reach 13 points or more. To make sure you’re in with a draw, you have to make sure no more than eight players can reach 13 points. Check the standings and the pairings. Keep also in mind that you’re not supposed to wait for other matches to finish to decide to draw. 


When there are more than eight players who can reach 13 points, you will have to rely on your tie-breakers. If your loss came early in the tournament, like round 1 or 2, you will probably have bad tie-breakers and be in a position you could draw yourself out of the Top 8. If you picked up your loss later, you’re likely to make it with a draw. Just compare your tie-breakers with the other potential Top 8ers. Tie-breakers depend on the percentage of wins your opponents have. 


In the case you have a doubt, it’s always better to play. You’ll feel better if you lose and don’t make Top 8 than if you draw and still not make it. 


  
**March 6, 2007****Q**: My friends keep telling me bad **Magic** stories. I don't care or don't have the attention span to listen. What should I do?  
 -Charlie B.  



**A:** Hi Charlie,


It's amazing how **Magic** players expect sympathy from others. Don't take it the wrong way! I tell my fair share of bad beat stories and happy endings, and even if people don't seem to care, I tell them until the end. 


The point is to find the right listener. You're obviously not one of them. My advice would be to tell your friends clearly that you don't care and that unless something spectacular happened in their games, you are not interested. Introduce them to people that genuinely care about some poor guy's misery. This way your friends will be happy to have an audience and you will be spared of uninteresting tales. 


  
**March 3, 2007****Q**: How do you recover from an early loss in a tournament or a game-losing mistake?  
 -Ervin T.  



**A:** Hello Ervin,


Every player makes mistakes, even the seasoned pros. It's just how you realize it, learn from it and put it behind you so you can avoid repeating them. 


Losing in the first round of a tournament might be discouraging, but you have to tell yourself that you're not out yet. If you manage to win, let's say, the next two rounds, just imagine you could have lost two of them with different pairings. You need to find whatever gets you in the right mentality to focus on your games rather than on your past errors. The time to think about mistakes is after the tournament, whatever it may have cost. 


I personally try to think positive; whatever I did is done. Next match. 


  
**March 1, 2007****Q**: I was in Dallas this past weekend and witnessed you [win the Grand Prix](/en/events/coverage/hall-famer-lone-star-dallas). How did it feel?  
 -Shane Remelt  



**A:** Hello Shane,


Nine years... it has been nine years since I last won a premier event. I started to think that I was too rusty to actually ever win again. But I finally did it! It's no Pro Tour, but it doesn't matter. Sure I probably play worse than nine years ago (nothing could stop me back then), some of my matches this weekend proved that there is still room for improvement, but I managed to focus enough in the Top 8 not to throw it away. 


I can't lie, it's a great satisfaction. It's also funny to think that the newest generation of **Magic** players weren't even born when I won GP-Lyon in '98!


For the ones interested in the deck I played, it was Olivier who tested and improved the deck, and made the mana base reliable. So, big thanks to him! The list has been updated on the site (it was missing two Flooded Strands) and now has 60 cards.
