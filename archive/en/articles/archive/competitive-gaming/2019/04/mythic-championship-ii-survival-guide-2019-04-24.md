Co-Streaming
============


During last month's Mythic invitational, streamers were able to co-stream the official feed on their own Twitch channels. This was a great success, so we want to again open that option up for this weekend’s Mythic Championship II in London. The intent behind this open policy is to encourage more regionalized viewing options and give creators the ability to convey information to their community in their unique voice.


Following Twitch's [Content Sharing Guidelines](https://help.twitch.tv/s/article/twitch-content-sharing-guidelines?language=en_US), you can co-stream the from [twitch.tv/magic](https://www.twitch.tv/magic) using OBS or XSplit. This allows anyone on Twitch to be able to cover the event in their voice and with their community. As a reminder, co-streamed content is not endorsed by Wizards and we expect anyone who participates in co-streaming to follow Wizards' [Fan Content Policy](https://company.wizards.com/fancontentpolicy).


While we hope twitch.tv/magic is your go-to place to tune in to the Mythic Championship, more viewing options on Twitch is always better.
