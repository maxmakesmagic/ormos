**June 18 Update**: Hi all. The excitement around Grand Prix Las Vegas has inspired the **Magic Online** team to create a *Modern Masters* sealed Swiss Phantom queue. The full details about this new queue are updated below. Here is a recap.

The *Modern Masters* sealed Swiss Phantom queues follow the following structure:

***Modern Masters* Phantom Sealed Queues**
  
**Location:** Release Queues room.   
**Entry Option(s):** 8 Event Tickets OR 2 Event Tickets and 10 Cube Tickets.   
**Product: Magic Online** will provide 6 *Modern Masters* booster packs for Sealed. Cards that players draft and play with in a Phantom event are NOT added to those players' collections. 

The *Modern Masters* sealed Swiss Phantom queue will begin following the downtime on Wednesday, June 19, and will last until the beginning of the scheduled downtime on Wednesday, July 10. 

Let us know what you think about this new event offering on the forums or Twitter (#MTGO). You can get me at @ckiritz, Worth at @mtgworth, and Mike Turian at @mturian.

Thanks,

Chris

**June 6 Update:** Hi **Magic Online** players. We've decided to update our *Modern Masters* release plan. I have updated the details below, but here's a summary: 

* The *Modern Masters* draft queues will have their entry reduced from 30 Event Tickets or 9 Event Tickets plus product to 25 Event Tickets or 4 Event Tickets and product. The 64-player Premier drafts will remain unchanged.
* The Phantom *Modern Masters* draft queues will have their start date changed from June 21 to June 14 to match the start of all the other *Modern Masters* events.

We made these changes for several reasons, but our primary goal was to ensure players who wanted to draft *Modern Masters* had the chance to do so. We felt that the three main draft versions–Premier, Phantom, and regular–let players choose the style of event that fits them best. 

Premier drafts let players experience top-8 style events and prove they are the best against a larger field. Phantom drafts are available for players who just want to experience *Modern Masters* drafting in its purest form. And for players looking for a way to build up their collection of Modern cards, we have regular draft queues. 

As always, we take your feedback seriously so feel free to hop on the forums or Twitter to let us know what you think of the changes. You can get me at @ckiritz, Worth at @mtgworth, and the newest **Magic Online** team member, Mike Turian, at @mturian. 

Have fun drafting,  
 Chris

### They're not old, they're Modern.

*Modern Masters*, which contains 229 reprint cards drawn from *Eighth Edition* through *Alara Reborn*, gives players a chance to collect some of **Magic**'s strongest cards.
