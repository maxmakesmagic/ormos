Oliver Polak-Rottmann won the previous European Grand Prix in Europe with Mono-Blue Devotion. Since then, [Nightveil Specter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nightveil+Specter) and [Tidebinder Mage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tidebinder+Mage) had rotated out of Standard, and he switched to Sidisi-Whip. He ran the deck, which is based around [Sidisi, Brood Tyrant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sidisi%2C+Brood+Tyrant) and [Whip of Erebos](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Whip+of+Erebos), at Pro Tour *Khans of Tarkir* and is piloting it today as well.


Jan van der Vegt, a popular streamer who made the Top 8 of Grand Prix Gothenburg, is on a spicy brew: UW Heroic. "It looks like an aggro deck, but it's more of a combo deck," he said to me before the match. "It's a 3-card combo: a heroic creature, a way to pump it, and a protection spell."


Let's see how their decks match up!


Game 1
======


Polak-Rottmann started off the game by filling up both his graveyard and his board with Sylvan Wayfinder and [Sidisi, Brood Tyrant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sidisi%2C+Brood+Tyrant). Meanwhile, van der Vegt wasn't doing much, passing on turns one and two without playing a single creature.

A peek at his hand revealed what was up: He had a bunch of pump spells and a [Gods Willing](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gods+Willing), but only one creature in hand. Unwilling to lose his only threat to a one-mana [Murderous Cut](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Murderous+Cut), Van der Vegt decided to wait until turn three before playing his [Battlewise Hoplite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Battlewise+Hoplite). This way, he had [Gods Willing](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gods+Willing) mana up to protect it.



However, Polak-Rottmann didn't challenge the heroic creature with a removal spell and was content to see it grow larger and larger. A [Defiant Strike](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Defiant+Strike), [Ordeal of Thassa](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ordeal+of+Thassa), and [Aqueous Form](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aqueous+Form) later, Van der Vegt was attacking with a 6-power unblockable creature.


Van der Vegt still had [Gods Willing](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gods+Willing) to answer a removal spell, but Polak-Rottmann had something much better: [Whip of Erebos](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Whip+of+Erebos). The lifegain ability provided him with over 10 life a turn, and suddenly it was nearly impossible for van der Vegt to win the damage race. No matter how big he made his Hoplite, Polak-Rottmann was gaining just as much life. A couple attacks with Sidisi and her zombies later, van der Vegt was down to 0 while Polak-Rottmann was sitting comfortably at 30 life.


"The Whip is so good against me," Van der Vegt said while reaching for his sideboard.


Game 2
======


Van der Vegt came out of the gates quickly with [Favored Hoplite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Favored+Hoplite) and [Ordeal of Thassa](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ordeal+of+Thassa), and he was able to protect it as well. Thanks to [Stubborn Denial](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stubborn+Denial) and [Gods Willing](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gods+Willing) to say no to [Sultai Charm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sultai+Charm) and Hero's Downfall, Van der Vegt made sure his threat stuck around, and started attacking for a bunch. When he had [Aqueous Form](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aqueous+Form) to make sure that blocking was not an option either, Van der Vegt quickly took the second game.

Game 3
======



Van der Vegt started with [Favored Hoplite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Favored+Hoplite) on turn one, [Defiant Strike](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Defiant+Strike) on turn two, and [Ordeal of Thassa](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ordeal+of+Thassa) on turn three. When Polak-Rottmann played [Murderous Cut](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Murderous+Cut), van der Vegt had [Gods Willing](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gods+Willing) in response. So on turn three, van der Vegt was attacking with a 5-power creature and drawing two cards for his troubles. Not bad.


Polak-Rottmann killed it off with Hero's Downfall when he had the chance, and then cast [Whip of Erebos](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Whip+of+Erebos). His board was empty, but not for long: He returned [Sidisi, Brood Tyrant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sidisi%2C+Brood+Tyrant) (put there with [Satyr Wayfinder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Satyr+Wayfinder) earlier) from the graveyard and got immediately two 2/2 Zombies: one when Sidisi entered the battlefield and one when Sidisi attacked. In the process, he put a new Sidisi in his graveyard, ensuring that he could keep on going.

But would it be fast enough? Van der Vegt had rebuilt with [Hero of Iroas](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hero+of+Iroas) and was relentlessly targeting it with a flurry of pump spells. The game turned into a close damage race, but van der Vegt was able to grow his creature faster than Polak-Rottmann could produce tokens. With a [Feat of Resistance](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Feat+of+Resistance) to seal the deal, the heroic creature took it down.



Jan van der Vegt moves to 5-1 and has a good shot at making Day 2, while Polak-Rotmann will have to win all the remaining matches of the day to make it.
