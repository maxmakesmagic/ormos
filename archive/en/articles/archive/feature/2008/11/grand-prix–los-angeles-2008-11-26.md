**Things to See/Do**  
 LA. Los Angeles. The City of Angels. This fabled metropolis famous for its celluloid history is part reality, part dream. It's also sprawling. Four thousand square miles of Los Angeles County is divided into five distinct regions: Downtown, Hollywood, The Valley, Westside, and the Beaches. This geographical diversity also extends to LA's wide-ranging ethnic mix--the richest in the country. Visitors to the city are met by a cultural mélange that's reflected in the city's art, entertainment, architecture, dining, and music. Tourist hot spots are many: Universal Studios, Warner Brothers, Twentieth Century Fox, Rodeo Drive, Melrose Avenue, Dodger Stadium, The Getty Center, Chinatown, and Disneyland® Resort. LA offers more museums than any other American city (over 300). Along with professional basketball and baseball franchises and an abundance of outdoor opportunities at several national and state parks, this is one place where the dream lives on.
