An FAQ is a collection of clarifications and rulings involving the cards in a new **Magic: The Gathering** set. It's intended to make playing with these new cards more fun by clearing up the common misconceptions and confusion inevitably caused by new mechanics and interactions. As future sets are released, updates to the **Magic** rules may cause some of this information to become outdated. If you can't find the answer you're looking for here, please contact us at [www.wizards.com/customerservice](http://www.wizards.com/customerservice).


This FAQ has two sections, each of which serves a different purpose.


The first section ("General Notes") explains the new mechanics and concepts in the set.


The second section ("Card-Specific Notes") contains answers to the most important, most common, and most confusing questions players might ask about cards in the set. Items in the "Card-Specific Notes" section include full card text for your reference. Not all cards in the set are listed.


### GENERAL NOTES


**The War**


The outcome of the conflict between the Phyrexians and Mirrans was unknown for a time, and two possible conclusions to the *Scars of Mirrodin* block were presented: *New Phyrexia* and *Mirrodin Pure*. The Phyrexians won the war. *New Phyrexia* is set 3 of 3 in the *Scars of Mirrodin* block; the *Mirrodin Pure* set does not exist.


Despite the Phyrexian victory, some pockets of Mirran survivors can be found. Like cards in the first two sets in this block, each card in the *New Phyrexia* set (other than basic lands and planeswalkers) has an identifying insignia in its text box that shows what faction it belongs to. (The Mirran insignia looks like a segmented ring. The Phyrexian insignia looks like a circle with a slash through it.) Faction insignias have no effect on game play.


**Release Information**


The *New Phyrexia* set contains 175 cards (60 common, 60 uncommon, 35 rare, 10 mythic rare, and 10 basic land).


Prerelease events: May 7-8, 2011  

Launch Parties: May 13-15, 2011


The *New Phyrexia* set becomes legal for sanctioned Constructed play on its official release date: Friday, May 13, 2011.


At that time, the following card sets will be permitted in the Standard format: *Zendikar*, *Worldwake*, *Rise of the Eldrazi*, ***Magic** 2011*, *Scars of Mirrodin*, *Mirrodin Besieged*, and *New Phyrexia*.


Go to [www.wizards.com/locator](/en/articles/archive/magic-gathering-retail-locator-2002-10-08) to find an event or store near you.


Go to [www.wizards.com/MagicFormats](http://www.wizards.com/MagicFormats) for a complete list of formats and permitted card sets.


### New Mechanic: [Phyrexian Mana Symbols](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?text=+%5B%22can%20be%20paid%20with%22%5D+%5B%22or%202%20life%22%5D&set=%5B%22New%20Phyrexia%22%5D)


Under Phyrexian rule, the very nature of magic is changing. In some cases, blood works just as well as mana. Phyrexian mana allows players to cast spells and activate abilities with fewer mana and to ignore colored mana requirements.




|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| [Thundering Tanadon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thundering+Tanadon)4(G/P)(G/P)
 Artifact Creature—Beast
 5/4
 ((/P) can be paid with either  or 2 life.)
 Trample | 
Thundering Tanadon
 |

Visually, each Phyrexian mana symbol looks like the Phyrexian insignia (a circle with a slash through it) on one of five colored backgrounds, each corresponding to one of the five colors of mana. Each Phyrexian mana symbol represents a cost that can be paid in two ways: by spending one mana of the color that matches the colored background or by paying 2 life. For example, (![](https://web.archive.org/web/20220123123600im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/green.gif)/P) can be paid with either ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20220123123600im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/green.gif) or 2 life. It's a green mana symbol.


* Phyrexian mana symbols appear only in costs, such as the mana cost in the upper right corner of a card or the cost to activate an activated ability.
* A card with Phyrexian mana symbols in its mana cost is each color that appears in that mana cost, regardless of how that cost may have been paid. For example, the [Thundering Tanadon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thundering+Tanadon) above is green, even if a player spent ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227130159im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/red.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227130159im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/red.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227130159im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/red.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227130159im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/red.gif) and paid 4 life to cast it.
* To calculate the converted mana cost of a card with Phyrexian mana symbols in its cost, count each Phyrexian mana symbol as 1.
* As you cast a spell or activate an activated ability with one or more Phyrexian mana symbols in its cost, you choose how to pay for each Phyrexian mana symbol at the same time you would choose modes or choose a value for X.
* If you're at 1 life or less, you can't pay 2 life.
* Phyrexian mana is not a new color. Players can't add Phyrexian mana to their mana pools.

### Cycle: [Chancellors](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?action=advanced&set=%5B%22New%20Phyrexia%22%5D&name=+%5Bchancellor%5D)


The Chancellors are powerful members of the Phyrexian leadership. Each allows you to impact the game before it even begins.




|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| [Chancellor of the Dross](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chancellor+of+the+Dross)
 Creature—Vampire
 6/6
 You may reveal this card from your opening hand. If you do, at the beginning of the first upkeep, each opponent loses 3 life, then you gain life equal to the life lost this way. | 
Chancellor of the Dross
 |

* Your "opening hand" is the hand of cards you decide to start the game with after taking any mulligans.
* After all players have decided not to take any more mulligans, if the starting player has any Chancellors or other cards that allow actions to be taken with them from a player's opening hand (such as [Leyline of the Void](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leyline+of+the+Void)), that player may take the actions of any of those cards. The starting player repeats this, taking all actions he or she wishes to, one at a time. Then each other player in turn order may do the same.
* After each player has exercised his or her option to take actions from his or her opening hand, the first turn of the game begins.
* Any Chancellor revealed this way remains revealed until the first turn of the game begins.
* Once a Chancellor has been revealed this way, the same physical card can't be revealed again for additional effect.

### Cycle: [Splicers](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?action=advanced&set=%5B%22New%20Phyrexia%22%5D&name=+%5Bsplicer%5D)


Creatures in the *New Phyrexia* set with "Splicer" in their names produce Golem tokens when they enter the battlefield and provide a bonus to each Golem you control.




|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| [Sensor Splicer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sensor+Splicer)
 Creature—Artificer
 1/1
 When Sensor Splicer enters the battlefield, put a 3/3 colorless Golem artifact creature token onto the battlefield.
 Golem creatures you control have vigilance. | 
Sensor Splicer
 |

* The bonus provided by each Splicer applies to all Golem creatures you control, not just the tokens put onto the battlefield with its triggered ability.

### Cycle: [Exarchs](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?action=advanced&set=%5B%22New%20Phyrexia%22%5D&name=+%5Bexarch%5D)


Creatures in the *New Phyrexia* set with "Exarch" in their names have modal abilities that give you a choice of two effects when they enter the battlefield.




|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| [Tormentor Exarch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tormentor+Exarch)
 Creature—Cleric
 2/2
 When Tormentor Exarch enters the battlefield, choose one—Target creature gets +2/+0 until end of turn; or target creature gets -0/-2 until end of turn. | 
Tormentor Exarch
 |

* You choose which mode you're using when the ability goes on the stack. Once this choice is made, the mode can't be changed.
* You can't choose a mode that requires a target unless you are able to choose a legal target.
* While the ability is on the stack, treat it as if the mode you didn't choose doesn't exist. You don't select targets for that mode.

### Theme: [Phyrexian "Blood Tax" Cards](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?action=advanced&set=%5B%22New%20Phyrexia%22%5D&text=+%5B%22loses%201%20life%22%5D)


A number of spells have an additional effect that causes a player to lose 1 life.




|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| [Glissa's Scorn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glissa%27s+Scorn)
 Instant
 Destroy target artifact. Its controller loses 1 life. | 
Glissa's Scorn
 |

* If the spell requires a target, as Glissa's Scorn does, and that target is illegal when the spell tries to resolve, the spell will be countered and none of its effects will happen. No one will lose 1 life.
* You must be able to choose a legal target in order to cast the spell. You can't simply cast it without a legal target to have a player lose 1 life.

### Returning Ability Word: [Imprint](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?action=advanced&set=%5B%22New%20Phyrexia%22%5D&text=+%5Bimprint%5D)


The ability word "imprint" had appeared exclusively on Mirran artifact cards in this block. In this set, however, it appears only on three Phyrexian-aligned cards, and none of those cards are artifacts. Otherwise, cards with imprint work the same way as in the rest of the block. They still have one ability that exiles a card and another that refers to the exiled card in some way.




|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| [Invader Parasite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Invader+Parasite)
 Creature—Insect
 3/2
 Imprint—When Invader Parasite enters the battlefield, exile target land.
 Whenever a land with the same name as the exiled card enters the battlefield under an opponent's control, Invader Parasite deals 2 damage to that player. | 
Invader Parasite
 |

### Returning *Scars of Mirrodin* and *Mirrodin Besieged* Mechanics


Many abilities and mechanics featured in the *Scars of Mirrodin* and *Mirrodin Besieged* sets return in the *New Phyrexia* set. For more information about infect, -1/-1 counters, poison counters, imprint, metalcraft, and proliferate, see the *Scars of Mirrodin* FAQ. For more information about living weapon, see the *Mirrodin Besieged* FAQ. These are located at [www.wizards.com/Magic/TCG/Resources.aspx?x=magic/rules/faqs](http://www.wizards.com/Magic/TCG/Resources.aspx?x=magic/rules/faqs).


### Rules Change: Poison Counters in Two-Headed Giant Games


The rules for how poison counters are handled in the Two-Headed Giant multiplayer variant changed on April 1, 2011. The official rules are now as follows:



> 
> 810.8d If a team has fifteen or more poison counters, that team loses the game. (This is a state-based action. See rule 704.)
> 
> 
> 810.10. Effects that cause players to get poison counters happen to each player individually. The poison counters are shared by the team.
> 
> 
> 810.10a If an effect needs to know how many poison counters an individual player has, that effect uses the number of poison counters that player's team has.
> 
> 
> 810.10b If an effect says that a player loses poison counters, that player's team loses that many poison counters.
> 
> 
> 810.10c A player is "poisoned" if his or her team has one or more poison counters.
> 
> 
> 


In addition, the following rule was added to clarify that you choose teams and not individual players when you proliferate:



> 
> 701.23c To proliferate in a Two-Headed Giant game means to choose any number of permanents and/or teams that have a counter, then give each exactly one additional counter of a kind that permanent or team already has. See rule 810, "Two-Headed Giant Variant."
> 
> 
> 


* When you proliferate, you may give one poison counter to a team that already has one.

 Sorcery
 Until end of turn, creatures you control gain "Whenever this creature deals damage to an opponent, you may return target creature that player controls to its owner's hand." | 
Arm with AEther
 |

* Only creatures you control on the battlefield when Arm with Æther resolves gain the ability. Creatures you gain control of later in the turn won't be affected.
* The affected creatures keep the ability even if another player gains control of them that turn. If such a creature deals damage to you, the ability will trigger, targeting a creature you control.
* The granted ability triggers on all damage dealt by the creature to one of your opponents, not just combat damage.
* In a multiplayer game, if an affected creature deals damage to two of your opponents simultaneously, the ability will trigger twice.

| --- | --- |
| [Beast Within](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Beast+Within)
 Instant
 Destroy target permanent. Its controller puts a 3/3 green Beast creature token onto the battlefield. | 
Beast Within
 |

* If the permanent is an illegal target when Beast Within tries to resolve, the spell will be countered and none of its effects will happen. The permanent's controller won't get a Beast token.
* If the permanent is still a legal target but is not destroyed (perhaps because it regenerated or is indestructible), its controller still gets the Beast token.



|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| [Birthing Pod](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Birthing+Pod)(/P)
 Artifact
 ((/P) can be paid with either  or 2 life.)(/P), , Sacrifice a creature: Search your library for a creature card with converted mana cost equal to 1 plus the sacrificed creature's converted mana cost, put that card onto the battlefield, then shuffle your library. Activate this ability only any time you could cast a sorcery. | 
Birthing Pod
 |

* A creature's converted mana cost is determined solely by the mana symbols printed in its upper right corner (unless that creature is copying something else; see below). If its mana cost includes ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20160829100442im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/x.gif), X is considered to be 0. If it has no mana symbols in its upper right corner (because it's an animated land, for example), its converted mana cost is 0. Ignore any alternative costs or additional costs (such as kicker) paid when the creature was cast.
* A token has a converted mana cost of 0, unless it is copying something else.
* If a creature is copying something else, its converted mana cost is the converted mana cost of whatever it's copying.



|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| [Blind Zealot](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blind+Zealot)
 Creature—Human Cleric

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| [Bludgeon Brawl](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bludgeon+Brawl)
 Enchantment
 Each noncreature, non-Equipment artifact is an Equipment with equip  and "Equipped creature gets +X/+0," where X is that artifact's converted mana cost. | 
Bludgeon Brawl
 |

* The affected artifacts retain their other types and abilities.
* An Equipment that's also a creature can't be equipped to anything.
* If an artifact affected by Bludgeon Brawl later becomes a creature, Bludgeon Brawl's effect no longer applies to it. That artifact will stop being an Equipment and become unattached from any creature it was attached to; it will remain on the battlefield. The same thing happens if Bludgeon Brawl leaves the battlefield.
* While Bludgeon Brawl is on the battlefield, an Aura enchantment that somehow becomes an artifact in addition to its other types will also become an Equipment. Any of its abilities that refer to either "enchanted creature" or "equipped creature" refer to the creature it's currently attached to. It can be attached to other creatures using its equip ability. If you try to attach the Aura Equipment to a creature it can't legally be attached to, it remains where it is. If the creature it's attached to becomes an illegal permanent for it to enchant, the Aura Equipment will be put into its owner's graveyard as a state-based action.



|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| [Caged Sun](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Caged+Sun)
 Artifact

 Whenever a land's ability adds one or more mana of the chosen color to your mana pool, add one additional mana of that color to your mana pool. | 
Caged Sun

 Artifact Creature—Wall

* In a multiplayer game, if you reveal Chancellor of the Annex from your opening hand, it will trigger each time an opponent casts his or her first spell of the game.

Chancellor of the Spires

* If you reveal more than one Chancellor of the Spires from your opening hand, each opponent will put the top seven cards of his or her library into his or her graveyard that many times (for a total of fourteen, twenty-one, or twenty-eight cards).
* The instant or sorcery card you target with the enters-the-battlefield triggered ability is cast as part of the resolution of that ability. Timing restrictions based on the card's type are ignored. Other restrictions, such as "Cast [this card] only during combat," are not.
* If you are unable to cast the card, perhaps because there are no legal targets available, the card remains in its owner's graveyard.
* You may pay additional costs, such as kicker costs, of the instant or sorcery card.
* If the card has any mandatory additional costs, as [Artillerize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Artillerize) does, you must pay them in order to cast the spell.
* See also "[Cycle: Chancellors](#chancellors)" in the General Notes section above.

* The state-based action that removes matching +1/+1 and -1/-1 counters won't check until after you proliferate and Grim Affliction finishes resolving. It's possible to remove up to two +1/+1 counters from the creature by choosing to put a second -1/-1 counter on the creature when proliferating.

 Each opponent's maximum hand size is reduced by seven. | 
Jin-Gitaxias, Core Augur
 |

* Jin-Gitaxias doesn't affect the maximum hand size of its controller.
* If a player has more cards in his or her hand than his or her maximum hand size during the cleanup step (after the end step) of that player's turn, that player discards until he or she has that many cards. A player's maximum hand size isn't checked at any time other than his or her own cleanup step.
* Unless another spell or ability is affecting your opponent's maximum hand size, Jin-Gitaxias's ability will result in your opponent having a maximum hand size of zero. He or she will discard each card from his or her hand during the cleanup step at the end of his or her turn.

| [Karn Liberated](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Karn+Liberated)
 Planeswalker—Karn
 6
 [+4]: Target player exiles a card from his or her hand.
 [-3]: Exile target permanent.
 [-14]: Restart the game, leaving in exile all non-Aura permanent cards exiled with Karn Liberated. Then put those cards onto the battlefield under your control. | 
Karn Liberated
 |

* Karn's first and third abilities are linked. Similarly, Karn's second and third abilities are linked. Only cards exiled by either of Karn's first two abilities will remain in exile when the game restarts.
* A game that restarts immediately ends. The players in that game then immediately begin a new game. No player wins, loses, or draws the original game as a result of Karn's ability.
* In a multiplayer games (a game that started with three or more players in it), any player that left the game before it was restarted with Karn's ability won't be involved in the new game.
* The player who controlled the ability that restarted the game is the starting player in the new game. The new game starts like a game normally does:


	+ Each player shuffles his or her deck (except the cards left in exile by Karn's ability).
	+ Each player's life total becomes 20 (or the starting life total for whatever format you're playing).
	+ Players draw a hand of seven cards. Players may take mulligans.
	+ Players may take actions based on cards in their opening hands, such as Chancellors and Leylines.
* After the pre-game procedure is complete, but before the new game's first turn, Karn's ability finishes resolving and the cards left in exile are put onto the battlefield. If this causes any triggered abilities to trigger, those abilities are put onto the stack at the beginning of the first upkeep step.
* Creatures put onto the battlefield due to Karn's ability will have been under their controller's control continuously since the beginning of the first turn. They can attack and their activated abilities with ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20170424152623im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/tap.gif) in the cost can be activated.
* Any permanents put onto the battlefield with Karn's ability that entered the battlefield tapped will untap during their controller's first untap step.
* No actions taken in the game that was restarted apply to the new game. For example, if you were dealt damage by Stigma Lasher in the original game, the effect that states you can't gain life doesn't carry over to the new game.
* Players won't have any poison counters or emblems they had in the original game.
* In a Commander game, players put their commanders into the command zone before shuffling their deck.
* The number of times a player has cast his or her commander from the command zone resets to zero. Also, the amount of combat damage dealt to players by each commander is reset to 0.
* If a player's commander was exiled with Karn at the game restarted, that commander won't be put into the command zone at the beginning of the game. It will be put onto the battlefield when Karn's ability finishes resolving.
* In a multiplayer game using the limited range of influence option, all players are affected and will restart the game, not just those within the range of influence of the ability's controller.

Leeching Bite

| [Melira, Sylvok Outcast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Melira%2C+Sylvok+Outcast)
 Legendary Creature—Human Scout
 2/2
 You can't get poison counters.
 Creatures you control can't have -1/-1 counters placed on them.
 Creatures your opponents control lose infect. | 
Melira, Sylvok Outcast
 |

* Melira doesn't remove any poison counters you already have or any -1/-1 counters already on creatures you control.
* Damage dealt to planeswalkers you control causes loyalty counters to be removed from them, regardless of whether Melira is on the battlefield.
* If a creature with infect enters the battlefield under an opponent's control after Melira enters the battlefield, that creature loses infect.
* It's possible for a creature an opponent controls to gain infect after Melira enters the battlefield. For example, your opponent could cast [Glistening Oil](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glistening+Oil) on a creature, and then Melira's ability and [Glistening Oil](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glistening+Oil)'s ability would be applied in timestamp order, with the most recent effect winning. The damage dealt to you by such a creature won't result in you losing life (because the creature has infect) or in you getting poison counters (because Melira stops them). Similarly, damage dealt to a creature you control by such a creature won't result in damage being marked on the creature or in -1/-1 counters. However, abilities that check whether damage was dealt (such as lifelink or [Whispering Specter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Whispering+Specter)'s triggered ability) will still see that damage.

* Each Phyrexian mana symbol in a spell's mana cost contributes 1 to that spell's converted mana cost. For example, Mental Misstep's converted mana cost is 1, regardless of how its cost was paid.

* Myr Superion can be cast only with mana produced by the abilities of one or more creatures on the battlefield (such as [Alloy Myr](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Alloy+Myr) or [Priest of Urabrask](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Priest+of+Urabrask) in this set).
* Mana produced by abilities of creature cards not on the battlefield, such as [Chancellor of the Tangle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chancellor+of+the+Tangle) or [Elvish Spirit Guide](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elvish+Spirit+Guide), can't be used to cast Myr Superion.

 Artifact
 ((/P) can be paid with either  or 2 life.)
 Creatures can't attack you or a planeswalker you control unless their controller pays (/P) for each of those creatures. | 
Norn's Annex
 |

* The controller of each creature attacking you or a planeswalker you control pays either ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227125855im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/white.gif) or 2 life as attackers are being declared.
* If a player attacks with more than one creature, that player chooses how to pay each cost individually. For example, if you attack with two creatures, you may pay ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227125855im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/white.gif) for one cost and 2 life for the other.
* Multiple Norn's Annexes controlled by the same player will each impose a cost to attack. Players choose how they pay each cost individually. For example, if a creature you control is attacking a player who controls two Norn's Annexes, you may pay ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227125855im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/white.gif) for one cost and 2 life for the other.
* If you control Norn's Annex, your opponents can choose not to attack with a creature with an ability that says it must attack.
* In a Two-Headed Giant game, if one player controls Norn's Annex, creatures can't attack that player's team or a planeswalker that player controls unless their controller pays (![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227125855im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/white.gif)/P) for each of those creatures he or she controls.

| [Omen Machine](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Omen+Machine)
 Artifact
 Players can't draw cards.
 At the beginning of each player's draw step, that player exiles the top card of his or her library. If it's a land card, the player puts it onto the battlefield. Otherwise, the player casts it without paying its mana cost if able. | 
Omen Machine
 |

* Putting the land onto the battlefield or casting the card is not optional.
* If the player is unable to put the land onto the battlefield (this is rare) or cast the spell (perhaps because there are no legal targets available) as the triggered ability of Omen Machine resolves, the card simply remains in exile.

 Phyrexian Ingester gets +X/+Y, where X is the exiled creature card's power and Y is its toughness. | 
Phyrexian Ingester

* If the exiled card has a characteristic-defining ability that defines its power and/or toughness (as [Slag Fiend](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Slag+Fiend) does), that ability will apply.
* If the card in exile isn't a creature card (perhaps because it was a land that was only temporarily a creature while on the battlefield), Phyrexian Ingester doesn't get a bonus.

 You may have Phyrexian Metamorph enter the battlefield as a copy of any artifact or creature on the battlefield, except it's an artifact in addition to its other types. | 
Phyrexian Metamorph
 |

* Except for also being an artifact, Phyrexian Metamorph copies exactly what was printed on the original permanent and nothing more (unless that creature is itself copying something or is a token; see below). It doesn't copy whether that permanent is tapped or untapped, whether it has any counters on it or Auras attached to it, or any noncopy effects that have changed its power, toughness, types, color, and so on.
* If Phyrexian Metamorph copies a noncreature artifact, it is no longer a creature.
* If the chosen permanent has ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20160829100442im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/x.gif) in its mana cost (such as [Protean Hydra](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Protean+Hydra)), X is considered to be zero.
* If the chosen creature is copying something else (for example, if the chosen creature is a [Clone](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Clone)), then your Phyrexian Metamorph enters the battlefield as whatever the chosen creature copied, except it's also an artifact.
* If the chosen permanent is a token, Phyrexian Metamorph copies the original characteristics of that token as stated by the effect that put the token onto the battlefield, except it's also an artifact. Phyrexian Metamorph is not a token.
* Any enters-the-battlefield abilities of the copied permanent will trigger when Phyrexian Metamorph enters the battlefield. Any "as [this] enters the battlefield" or "[this] enters the battlefield with" abilities of the chosen permanent will also work.
* If Phyrexian Metamorph somehow enters the battlefield at the same time as another permanent (due to [Mass Polymorph](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mass+Polymorph) or [Liliana Vess](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Liliana+Vess)'s third ability, for example), Phyrexian Metamorph can't become a copy of that permanent. You may only choose a permanent that's already on the battlefield.
* You can choose not to copy anything. In that case, Phyrexian Metamorph simply enters the battlefield as a 0/0 artifact creature and is put into its owner's graveyard as a state-based action (unless something else is raising its toughness).

 |

* Phyrexian Unlife won't affect damage that reduces your life total from a positive number to 0 or less. For example, if you're at 3 life and are dealt 5 damage, you'll end up at -2 life. The next time you're dealt damage, it will be dealt as though its source had infect.
* If you're at 0 or less life and Phyrexian Unlife leaves the battlefield, you'll lose the game (unless some other effect is keeping you from losing).
* If you're at 0 or less life, you can't pay any amount of life except 0.
* You can still lose the game for other reasons, including having ten or more poison counters or drawing a card from a library with no cards in it.

 Whenever an opponent shuffles his or her library, you may look at the top two cards of that library. You may exile one of those cards. Then put the rest on top of that library in any order. | 
Psychic Surgery
 |

* You look at the top two cards of that library as the triggered ability resolves. That happens after your opponent is done shuffling.
* If your opponent's library has one card in it and he or she is instructed to shuffle that library, Psychic Surgery will trigger. You may' exile the one card in that library.
* In most cases, [Green Sun's Zenith](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Green+Sun%27s+Zenith) instructs you to shuffle your library twice. Although shuffling that library only once is an acceptable shortcut, Psychic Surgery's ability will still trigger twice.

| [Soul Conduit](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soul+Conduit)
 Artifact, : Two target players exchange life totals. | 
Soul Conduit
 |

* If one of the targeted players is an illegal target when the activated ability tries to resolve, the exchange won't happen. Neither player's life total will change.
* When the life totals are exchanged, each player gains or loses the amount of life necessary to equal the other player's previous life total. For example, if Player A has 5 life and Player B has 3 life before the exchange, Player A will lose 2 life and Player B will gain 2 life. Replacement effects may modify these gains and losses, and triggered abilities may trigger on them.
* If a player can't gain life, that player can't exchange life totals with a player with a higher life total. If a player can't lose life, that player can't exchange life totals with a player with a lower life total. In either of these cases, neither player's life total will change.
* In a Two-Headed Giant game, each player is considered to have the same life total as his or her team. If the two targeted players are on different teams, the teams will end up exchanging life totals. If the two targeted players are teammates, nothing will happen.

Spellskite
 |

* You can activate Spellskite's ability even if Spellskite wouldn't be a legal target for the spell or ability. However, the target of that spell or ability will remain unchanged.
* If changing one target of a spell or ability to Spellskite would make other targets of that spell or ability illegal, the targets remain unchanged.
* If the spell or ability has multiple instances of the word "target," you choose which target you're changing to Spellskite when Spellskite's ability resolves.
* By activating Spellskite's ability multiple times, you can change each target of a spell or ability with multiple instances of the word "target" to Spellskite, one at a time.
* The target of the spell or ability won't change unless Spellskite fulfills all the targeting criteria, even if multiple instances of the word "target" are used. For example, you can't change both targets of [Arc Trail](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arc+Trail) to Spellskite.
* If a spell or ability has multiple targets but doesn't use the word "target" multiple times, such as [Fulgent Distraction](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fulgent+Distraction), you can only successfully change one of the targets to Spellskite.
* If a spell or ability has a variable number of targets, you can't change the number of targets.

| [Torpor Orb](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Torpor+Orb)
 Artifact
 Creatures entering the battlefield don't cause abilities to trigger. | 
Torpor Orb
 |

* Torpor Orb stops a creature's own enters-the-battlefield triggered abilities as well as other triggered abilities that would trigger when a creature enters the battlefield.
* The trigger event doesn't have to specify "creatures" entering the battlefield. For example, [Amulet of Vigor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Amulet+of+Vigor) says "Whenever a permanent enters the battlefield tapped and under your control, untap it." If a creature enters the battlefield tapped and under your control, [Amulet of Vigor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Amulet+of+Vigor) would not trigger. If a land (that isn't also a creature) enters the battlefield tapped and under your control, [Amulet of Vigor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Amulet+of+Vigor) would trigger.
* Abilities that create replacement effects, such as a permanent entering the battlefield tapped or with counters on it, are unaffected.
* Abilities that apply "as [this creature] enters the battlefield," such as choosing a creature to copy with [Clone](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Clone), are unaffected.
* Look at the permanent as it exists on the battlefield, taking into account continuous effects, to determine whether any triggered abilities will trigger. For example, if you control [March of the Machines](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=March+of+the+Machines), which says, in part, "Each noncreature artifact is an artifact creature," Torpor Orb will be a creature when it enters the battlefield and will not cause triggered abilities to trigger.
* Similarly, if Torpor Orb and a creature enter the battlefield at the same time, that creature entering the battlefield won't cause triggered abilities to trigger.

Unwinding Clock

* Those artifacts untap at the same time as the active player's permanents. You have no choice about what untaps and can't choose to not untap an artifact you control.
* Some effects, such as the one generated by [Rust Tick](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rust+Tick)'s ability, state that an artifact doesn't untap during its controller's untap step. These effects won't apply and stop the artifact from untapping during another player's untap step.
* Even if you control more than one Unwinding Clock, you'll only untap your artifacts once during each other player's untap step.

| [Xenograft](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Xenograft)
 Enchantment
 As Xenograft enters the battlefield, choose a creature type.
 Each creature you control is the chosen type in addition to its other types. | 
Xenograft
 |

* The choice of creature type is made as Xenograft enters the battlefield. Players can't respond after this choice is made but before Xenograft is on the battlefield and its effect starts applying.
* You must choose an existing **Magic** creature type.
* Creature cards not on the battlefield and creature spells are not affected.
* Replacement effects that modify creatures of a certain type as they enter the battlefield will apply (or not apply) before you apply Xenograft's effect. For example, if Warrior is the chosen creature type and you control [Bramblewood Paragon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bramblewood+Paragon), a [Runeclaw Bear](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Runeclaw+Bear) would not enter the battlefield with an additional +1/+1 counter.
