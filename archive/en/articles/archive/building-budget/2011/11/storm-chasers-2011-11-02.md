Jacob Van Lunen began playing Magic in 1995. He has participated in organized play at every level of competition and was a member of the winning team at Pro Tour San Diego in 2007, thanks to an innovative draft strategy. As a writer, Van Lunen has had more than three hundred Magic strategy pieces published 






Welcome to Modern Week here on **MagicTheGathering.com**! [Modern](http://www.wizards.com/Magic/TCG/Resources.aspx?x=judge/resources/sfrmodern) is a Constructed format wherein all core sets from *Eighth Edition* forward and all blocks from *Mirrodin* (the original *Mirrodin*) forward are legal. [Pro Tour Philadelphia](/en/events/coverage/estratti-starts-modern-revolution-philly) offered us our first glimpse of the new Modern format. The Pro Tour was dominated by blisteringly fast combo decks that intended to win on the second, third, or fourth turns of the game. The combo-centric nature of the format was quickly remedied by [a big set of bannings](http://www.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/feature/161a).

Wizards wants to make Modern less of a combo-oriented format. This allows creature-based strategies to race combo decks and supports a more play-friendly environment.

I'm a Johnny/Spike, though. I want to dome my opponent for huge amounts of damage on the third turn. It's gotten pretty difficult to do so with the new set of bannings. Today, I'm going to offer up another round of Pyromancer strategies. This time, we'll be arming ourselves with an often overlooked enchantment from *Future Sight*, [Pyromancer's Swath](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyromancer%27s+Swath).

Just for reference, here's an updated list of all the banned cards in the Modern format.

Today, we're going to try to build a Swathstorm deck. Swathstorm is an archetype that came about with the original printing of [Pyromancer's Swath](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyromancer%27s+Swath). The deck intends to cast a lot of spells on a single turn, cast [Pyromancer's Swath](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyromancer%27s+Swath), and then follow it up with a [Grapeshot](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grapeshot) with enough storm to finish off the opponent.



|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Pyromancer's Swath | Grapeshot |

The deck is normally going to go off on the fourth turn, but it's often able to finish the game as early as the third turn. Modern players have very painful mana bases, especially in the earlier turns of the game. Cracking a [*Zendikar* fetch land](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scalding+Tarn) and grabbing [a *Ravnica* dual land](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Breeding+Pool) untapped is 3 damage worth of fixing. These small amounts of damage may not seem like a huge deal, but it becomes significantly easier to storm for the win each time your opponent's life total reaches a lower denomination of 3.



|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Sleight of Hand | Serum Visions |

Not having access to [Ponder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ponder) or [Preordain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Preordain) gives us a pretty big hurdle to jump, but cards like [Sleight of Hand](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sleight+of+Hand), [Gitaxian Probe](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gitaxian+Probe), and [Serum Visions](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Serum+Visions) will help pick up the slack. We want to dig through our library and sculpt our hand to perfection.



|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Gitaxian Probe | Manamorphose |

[Manamorphose](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Manamorphose) is perfect for this type of strategy. It helps fix our mana when we're going off and it generates storm in the interim. There are many games where you might be forced to attempt your combo without all the necessary pieces in hand. Cards like [Manamorphose](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Manamorphose) and the other cantrips will greatly increase our chances of "getting there" on a key turn.

![Peer Through Depths](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Peer+Through+Depths)  
[Peer Through Depths](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Peer+Through+Depths) is perfect here. It's exactly the type of card manipulation we're looking for. It can be used to find necessary rituals, storm builders, [Grapeshot](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grapeshot)s, or, post sideboarding, [Empty the Warrens](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Empty+the+Warrens).

[Sleight of Hand](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sleight+of+Hand) and [Serum Visions](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Serum+Visions) are lackluster replacements for [Ponder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ponder) and [Preordain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Preordain). Still, these cards do a lot of work setting up our hands for the big turn.

[Gitaxian Probe](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gitaxian+Probe) is similar to [Manamorphose](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Manamorphose) in many ways. It essentially draws you a card for free, generating storm and digging us deeper through our library. [Gitaxian Probe](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gitaxian+Probe) is especially good because it helps us decide whether or not it's safe to go for our big turn. I like to lead with [Gitaxian Probe](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gitaxian+Probe) when able on my key turn. A free look at my opponent's hand will give me all the information I need to decide whether or not it's safe to go off.

![Remand](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Remand)  
[Remand](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Remand) is often enough of a speed bump for your opponent that you're able to make it to your key turn and combo them out. [Remand](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Remand) gains a lot of additional value when you consider its ability to return a [Grapeshot](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grapeshot) to your hand with the storm trigger on the stack. Sometimes you'll fire off a [Grapeshot](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grapeshot) with five storm copies and have an opponent at 13. In that situation, you can cast [Remand](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Remand) targeting your [Grapeshot](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grapeshot), the storm trigger will still resolve and you'll be able to fire off that same [Grapeshot](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grapeshot) with seven copies for exact damage.

![Magma Jet](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Magma+Jet)  
[Magma Jet](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Magma+Jet) is a solid removal spell that gives us outs to problematic cards like [Ethersworn Canonist](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ethersworn+Canonist). [Magma Jet](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Magma+Jet) also puts our opponent to 18 from 20. This makes a huge difference when we have a [Pyromancer's Swath](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyromancer%27s+Swath). The difference between six spells (including the [Grapeshot](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grapeshot)) and seven spells is pretty huge. [Magma Jet](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Magma+Jet) also cracks people down to 15 from 17 (the actual starting life total in most Modern decks thanks to fetch lands and *Ravnica* duals). [Lightning Bolt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt) may be better in this slot, but I'm wary of missing out on card manipulation when we've just lost [Ponder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ponder) and [Preordain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Preordain).

| Pyretic Ritual | Seething Song |

[Pyretic Ritual](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyretic+Ritual), [Desperate Ritual](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Desperate+Ritual), and [Seething Song](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seething+Song) are the fuel for our fire. On our key turn, we're going to produce a lot of mana with these "ritual" effects. These spells generate the mana necessary to combo off and generate enough storm to create a nice buffer for the [Grapeshot](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grapeshot) / [Pyromancer's Swath](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyromancer%27s+Swath) combo.

The deck, excluding lands, should be very easy to acquire. [Pyromancer's Swath](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyromancer%27s+Swath) is the only rare in the deck, and it's not hard to get. The lands may be a bit harder to track down, but they're necessary to the deck's ability to function. I'd include another [Steam Vents](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Steam+Vents) and at least one more [Island](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island)-based fetch land if I had no budget requirement here. The mana base I used here shouldn't be too prohibitive even for the most frugal deck builders.

Quick Aside: This deck's immunity to [Gaddock Teeg](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gaddock+Teeg) is quite deadly against a lot of opponents. Players will probably realize that we're a storm combo deck when we have red and blue mana available and we're casting [Serum Visions](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Serum+Visions), [Peer Through Depths](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Peer+Through+Depths), and [Sleight of Hand](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sleight+of+Hand). Most combo decks have a lot of trouble dealing with [Gaddock Teeg](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gaddock+Teeg), and an opponent will probably go out of the way to find the legendary Kithkin.

![Gaddock Teeg](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Gaddock+Teeg)

I played a few matches with the deck on **Magic Online** to see how it fared against players' latest Modern creations.

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/boab/boab167_match1header.jpg)  
![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/boab/boab167_noble.jpg)I lost the roll and kept [Shivan Reef](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shivan+Reef), [Serum Visions](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Serum+Visions), [Peer Through Depths](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Peer+Through+Depths), [Pyretic Ritual](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyretic+Ritual), [Seething Song](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seething+Song), [Pyromancer's Swath](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyromancer%27s+Swath), and [Manamorphose](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Manamorphose). My opponent cracked a fetch land, grabbed an [Overgrown Tomb](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Overgrown+Tomb) untapped, cast a [Noble Hierarch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Noble+Hierarch), and passed the turn at 17 life. I drew a [Breeding Pool](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Breeding+Pool), played it untapped, cast [Serum Visions](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Serum+Visions), drew a [Pyretic Ritual](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyretic+Ritual), and used scry to leave a [Grapeshot](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grapeshot) on the top of my library. My opponent cast a [Dark Confidant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dark+Confidant), played [Misty Rainforest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Misty+Rainforest), and passed the turn.

I drew the [Grapeshot](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grapeshot) and had to think about the correct play. If I attempted to combo that turn, then I risked losing to a [Spell Snare](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spell+Snare). However, my opponent's deck was surely filled with cards like [Thoughtseize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtseize) and [Snapcaster Mage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snapcaster+Mage), and I didn't want to leave an opportunity to rip my hand apart. I decided that I should go for it. I played [Shivan Reef](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shivan+Reef) and cast [Pyretic Ritual](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyretic+Ritual), then [Seething Song](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seething+Song), then another [Pyretic Ritual](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyretic+Ritual), I used [Manamorphose](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Manamorphose) to create two blue mana and drew a [Sleight of Hand](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sleight+of+Hand), I cast [Sleight of Hand](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sleight+of+Hand), and drew into a [Remand](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Remand). I used three of the five mana left in my pool to cast [Pyromancer's Swath](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyromancer%27s+Swath), and used the last remaining mana to [Grapeshot](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grapeshot) my opponent with six storm copies. That's 21 damage on turn two. Yep, the deck is good.

**Sideboarding:** -1 [Remand](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Remand), +2 [Magma Jet](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Magma+Jet), -4 [Pyromancer's Swath](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyromancer%27s+Swath), -4 [Grapeshot](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grapeshot), +3 [Goblin Bushwhacker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Bushwhacker), +4 [Empty the Warrens](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Empty+the+Warrens)

Green decks are sure to have enchantment removal like [Krosan Grip](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Krosan+Grip) after sideboarding. Taking out [Pyromancer's Swath](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyromancer%27s+Swath) and [Grapeshot](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grapeshot) for [Empty the Warrens](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Empty+the+Warrens) and [Goblin Bushwhacker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Bushwhacker) ensures that our opponent will have some dead cards in post-sideboard games.

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/boab/boab167_dark.jpg)I kept [Mountain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mountain), [Steam Vents](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Steam+Vents), 2 [Manamorphose](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Manamorphose), [Empty the Warrens](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Empty+the+Warrens), [Seething Song](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seething+Song), and [Gitaxian Probe](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gitaxian+Probe). My opponent played a fetch land and cracked it for a basic [Swamp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swamp). [Thoughtseize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtseize) targeted me, and my [Empty the Warrens](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Empty+the+Warrens) hit the bin. I drew a [Goblin Bushwhacker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Bushwhacker), played my [Steam Vents](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Steam+Vents) tapped, and passed the turn. My opponent played a [Breeding Pool](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Breeding+Pool) untapped and cast [Dark Confidant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dark+Confidant). I drew a [Magma Jet](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Magma+Jet) and cast it targeting the [Dark Confidant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dark+Confidant), putting two lands on the bottom of my library. My opponent cast another [Dark Confidant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dark+Confidant) and passed the turn.

I drew a [Peer Through Depths](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Peer+Through+Depths), and figured I'd be hit with at least one more form of disruption the next turn. My chances of getting to six mana and finding an [Empty the Warrens](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Empty+the+Warrens) was extremely low here, so I decided to pass the turn again. My opponent revealed a [Krosan Grip](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Krosan+Grip) off of [Dark Confidant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dark+Confidant), played a [Misty Rainforest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Misty+Rainforest), attacked for 2, and passed the turn. I cast [Peer Through Depths](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Peer+Through+Depths) during the end step and put a [Seething Song](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seething+Song) in my hand. After the [Peer Through Depths](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Peer+Through+Depths) resolved, my opponent cast a [Vendilion Clique](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vendilion+Clique) and put my [Goblin Bushwhacker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Bushwhacker) on the bottom of my library. I drew another [Goblin Bushwhacker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Bushwhacker).

I drew a [Pyretic Ritual](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyretic+Ritual) and decided that I needed to go for my combo. I cast [Pyretic Ritual](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyretic+Ritual), then [Seething Song](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seething+Song), then [Manamorphose](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Manamorphose) to make ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161115194122im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/blue.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227130159im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/red.gif). I drew into [Sleight of Hand](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sleight+of+Hand), cast it, and found an [Empty the Warrens](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Empty+the+Warrens). Another [Manamorphose](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Manamorphose) made more red mana, and a [Gitaxian Probe](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gitaxian+Probe) revealed a hand with a [Snapcaster Mage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Snapcaster+Mage), two [Krosan Grip](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Krosan+Grip)s, and lands. Another [Seething Song](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seething+Song) put me back to six mana. I cast [Empty the Warrens](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Empty+the+Warrens) and made sixteen Goblins, then cast [Goblin Bushwhacker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Bushwhacker) and attacked for 34 damage.

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/boab/boab167_match2header.jpg)  
![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/boab/boab167_guide.jpg)I won the roll and kept [Island](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island), [Scalding Tarn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scalding+Tarn), [Halimar Depths](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Halimar+Depths), [Pyretic Ritual](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyretic+Ritual), [Seething Song](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seething+Song), [Desperate Ritual](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Desperate+Ritual), and [Sleight of Hand](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sleight+of+Hand). I played my [Halimar Depths](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Halimar+Depths) and left a [Grapeshot](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grapeshot) on top of two lands. My opponent cast a [Goblin Guide](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Guide) and attacked. I revealed a [Grapeshot](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grapeshot), so my opponent knew it was vital to kill me as fast as possible. I drew the [Grapeshot](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grapeshot), played [Scalding Tarn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scalding+Tarn), sacrificed it for a basic [Mountain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mountain) to shuffle away the lackluster top of my library, and cast [Sleight of Hand](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sleight+of+Hand), finding another [Grapeshot](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grapeshot).

My opponent attacked for another 2; I revealed a [Steam Vents](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Steam+Vents), which went to my hand. After that my opponent cast [Figure of Destiny](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Figure+of+Destiny), made it a 2/2, and passed the turn. I drew a [Serum Visions](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Serum+Visions) and cast it, drew a [Manamorphose](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Manamorphose), and used scry to leave a third [Grapeshot](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grapeshot) on top of my library. After some quick math I realized that my opponent was dead. I played my land, cast [Desperate Ritual](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Desperate+Ritual), then [Seething Song](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seething+Song), then [Pyretic Ritual](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyretic+Ritual), then [Manamorphose](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Manamorphose), making more red mana. I drew the third [Grapeshot](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grapeshot) off of [Manamorphose](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Manamorphose) and cast three [Grapeshot](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grapeshot)s targeting my opponent—the first for 6, the second for 7, and the third for 8.

**Sideboarding:** -2 [Remand](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Remand), +2 [Magma Jet](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Magma+Jet)

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/boab/gametwo.jpg)  
![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/boab/boab167_strom.jpg)I mulliganed and kept [Island](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island), [Shivan Reef](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shivan+Reef), 2 [Seething Song](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seething+Song), [Grapeshot](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grapeshot), [Serum Visions](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Serum+Visions). My opponent led things off with a [Stromkirk Noble](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stromkirk+Noble), a card I was surprised to see in Modern. I drew a [Shivan Reef](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shivan+Reef), played my [Island](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island), cast [Serum Visions](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Serum+Visions), drew [Serum Visions](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Serum+Visions), and scryed a [Magma Jet](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Magma+Jet) to the top of my deck. My opponent attacked for 1 and cast [Keldon Marauders](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Keldon+Marauders). On my turn, I drew [Magma Jet](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Magma+Jet), cast it targeting the [Stromkirk Noble](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stromkirk+Noble), and left a [Manamorphose](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Manamorphose) on the top of my library. My opponent cast a [Boggart Ram-Gang](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Boggart+Ram-Gang) and attacked me for 6.

I drew the [Manamorphose](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Manamorphose) and figured I had a decent shot of finding the [Pyromancer's Swath](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyromancer%27s+Swath). I cast [Seething Song](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seething+Song), then [Seething Song](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seething+Song), then [Manamorphose](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Manamorphose) for two blue mana. I drew [Sleight of Hand](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sleight+of+Hand), I cast [Serum Visions](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Serum+Visions), drew a [Pyretic Ritual](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyretic+Ritual), and put two cards on the bottom of my library. I cast [Sleight of Hand](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sleight+of+Hand), found the [Pyromancer's Swath](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyromancer%27s+Swath), and cast [Pyretic Ritual](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyretic+Ritual), then [Pyromancer's Swath](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyromancer%27s+Swath), then [Grapeshot](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grapeshot).

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/boab/2_0Footer.jpg)  
My draws went pretty well here, but the deck is pretty consistent and turn two to four wins are the norm. Once the Modern Pro Tour Qualifier season rolls around a lot of players may have decks that are well equipped to fight [Grapeshot](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grapeshot)s with cards like [Leyline of Sanctity](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leyline+of+Sanctity) in their sideboards.

In short, I feel like the deck is probably the premier combo deck of the format even without the [Ponder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ponder)s or [Preordain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Preordain)s. The bannings made combo less consistent and probably made the format more player-friendly. Combo certainly isn't dead, and I'm interested to see where this deck could go. Perhaps [Past in Flames](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Past+in+Flames) could find a home here?

Shoot me an email or hit the forums with any questions or comments on the deck.

Happy brewing!
