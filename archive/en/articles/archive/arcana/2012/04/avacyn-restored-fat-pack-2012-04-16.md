That's the *Avacyn Restored* Fat Pack, which will be available in stores on May 4, the same day *Avacyn Restored* goes on sale. The MSRP is $39.99, and here's what's in it:

* A sleeve that unfolds to reveal an *Avacyn Restored* mural
* A card box with art from Avacyn, Angel of Hope

* A learn-to-play insert
* An exclusive *Avacyn Restored* Spindown Life Counter

Having trouble imagining how all that could be enclosed in one box? Good news! You don't *have* to imagine it, because we're showing it to you right now!
