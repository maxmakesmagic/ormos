*What's your favorite fatty, and why?*


![Kenneth Nagle](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/mtgcom/authorpics/authorpic_kennethnagle.jpg)**Kenneth Nagle:** My favorite fatty is Mossbridge Troll. During *Shadowmoor* design, we wanted mechanically linked rare creatures to show what iconics were hiding away as [Mosswort Bridge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mosswort+Bridge), [Windbrisk Heights](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Windbrisk+Heights), [and friends](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?text=+%5Bhideaway%5D) in *Lorwyn*.


We had a few designs:





* [Mossbridge Troll](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mossbridge+Troll) costs 5 less if you control any number of creatures with combined power 10 or more.
* When [Mossbridge Troll](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mossbridge+Troll) enters the battlefield, [bonus]. If it was hidden away by a card named [Mosswort Bridge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mosswort+Bridge) [insane bonus].

But in the end, we went with a somewhat loose cycle with the goal that "you should play the creature and the hideaway card in the same deck." We gave each creature a conditional ability similar to its hideaway land. I might have designed all five of these at a working lunch; they are definitely my kind of card designs.


Mossbridge Troll sports the biggest size bonus in the game. Since [every Troll in **Magic**](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?type=+%5Btroll%5D%7C%7Csubtype=+%5Btroll%5D) regenerates (or persists), we cut trample and added super-regeneration.


Why cut trample?
