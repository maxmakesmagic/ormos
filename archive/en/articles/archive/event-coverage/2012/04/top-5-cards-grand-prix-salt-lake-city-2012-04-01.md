Humans had fallen off the radar in the past few weeks. No one expected it to have such a big impact this weekend. Bryan Olvera managed to Top 8 the event with the forgotten archetype. [Honor of the Pure](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Honor+of+the+Pure) was also added to [Delver of Secrets](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Delver%2Bof%2BSecrets) by Josh Utter-Leyton in an effort to go "over the top" of other versions of the deck.

### 2) [Gideon Jura](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gideon+Jura)


[Gideon Jura](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gideon+Jura) is one of the most powerful spells in standard, but there aren't many decks that want to play with this Planeswalker. This weekend, Andrew Cuneo showed up with a traditional Blue/White control deck that looked like it was delivered in a DeLorean, fresh from 1998. The deck served Cuneo well and took him very deep in the competition. 




![Runechanterâ€™s Pike](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Runechanter%E2%80%99s+Pike)
### 3) [Runechanter’s Pike](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Runechanter%E2%80%99s+Pike)


[Runechanter's Pike](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Runechanter%27s+Pike) has overtaken [Sword of War and Peace](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sword+of+War+and+Peace) as the equipment of choice for [Delver of Secrets](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Delver%2Bof%2BSecrets) players. The latest versions of [Delver of Secrets](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Delver%2Bof%2BSecrets) play over twenty instants and sorceries and even include Thoughtscour over [Gitaxian Probe](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gitaxian+Probe) to take full advantage of the rare equipment. 




![Huntmaster of the Fells](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Huntmaster+of+the+Fells)
### 4) [Huntmaster of the Fells](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Huntmaster+of+the+Fells)


[Huntmaster of the Fells](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Huntmaster+of+the+Fells) had a great showing this weekend. [Kessig Wolf Run](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Kessig%2BWolf%2BRun) Ramp decks saw a revival and RG aggro decks were battling at the top tables throughout the event. The new Naya-Pod decks, popularized by Brian Kibler, took full advantage of [Huntmaster of the Fells](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Huntmaster+of+the+Fells). [Birthing Pod](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Birthing+Pod) gives players something to do without casting a spell, making it easy to flip Huntmaster into [Ravager of the Fells](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ravager+of+the+Fells). [Birthing Pod](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Birthing+Pod) also lets players trade their [Huntmaster of the Fells](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Huntmaster+of+the+Fells) in for [Acidic Slime](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Acidic+Slime), leaving behind a 2/2 wolf and some lifegain. 




![Delver of Secrets](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Delver+of+Secrets)
### 5) [Delver of Secrets](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Delver+of+Secrets)


[Delver of Secrets](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Delver%2Bof%2BSecrets) decks continued to dominate in Salt Lake City. Both decks in the finals included four copies of the *Innistrad* common. A turn one [Delver of Secrets](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Delver+of+Secrets) that quickly flips into [Insectile Aberration](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Insectile+Aberration) provides an exceptionally fast clock that can be defended with [Mana Leak](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak), [Vapor Snag](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vapor+Snag), and other cheap disruptive spells.
