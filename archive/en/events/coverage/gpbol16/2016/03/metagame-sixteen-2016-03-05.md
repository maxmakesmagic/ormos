With over 2,000 players in the room, there's no chance we could tell you about the whole of the Day 1 metagame. Something we can tell you about, however, is the deck choices of a select group of 16 players with two or three byes that we chose to shine a spotlight on:


* (12) Fabrizio Anteri
* Lukas Blohon
* Marcio Carvalho
* Marco Cammilluzzi
* Pierre Dagen
* Robin Dolar
* (20) Martin Dang
* Patrick Dickmann
* Immanuel Gerschenson
* Martin Jůza
* Magnus Lantto
* (17) Joel Larsson
* Raphaël Lévy
* Andrea Mengucci
* (8) Martin Müller
* Oliver Polak-Rottmann

Here's the archetype breakdown of what this group of Hall of Famers, Gold or Platinum pros, Modern Pro Tour Top 8 collectors, and World Magic Cup winners are playing:




| Deck | # |
| U/W Eldrazi | 6 |
| Abzan Company | 4 |
| R/G Eldrazi | 2 |
| Living End | 1 |
| Bant Company | 1 |
| Bogles | 1 |
| Infect | 1 |

So if the choices of these 16 veterans are any indication, there are two best decks: White-Blue Eldrazi and Abzan Company. But one is still on top. As Raphaël Lévy told me: "When the best deck plays [Rest in Peace](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rest+in+Peace) in the sideboard, and the second-best deck relies on creatures like [Kitchen Finks](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kitchen+Finks) and [Eternal Witness](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eternal+Witness), you need a very good reason to not play the best deck."


But beyond the Eldrazi decks and Abzan Company, there are plenty of interesting one-of choices as well. Players are standing up to the Eldrazi villain by playing sweepers like [Living End](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Living+End), by copying them with [Phantasmal Image](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phantasmal+Image), by making even more gigantic creatures with [Daybreak Coronet](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Daybreak+Coronet), or by pushing little infectors through with [Distortion Strike](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Distortion+Strike). The hopes of beating Eldrazi are still alive.


Tune in later this weekend, when we have more detailed overviews for you!
