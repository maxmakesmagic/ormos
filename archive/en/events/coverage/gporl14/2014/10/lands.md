 It's Sunday morning, and time to start diving into the new *Khans of Tarkir* draft format. There can be few better places to start than with Matt Costa. Already with an outstanding career resume that includes five Grand Prix Top 8s, a title at Grand Prix Baltimore 2012, and a Pro Tour Top 8 at the last Pro Tour held in Honolulu (*Dark Ascension* 2012), Costa is held in such high regard by his peers that he found himself as a regular on the stellar Pantheon playtest team of Pros.
