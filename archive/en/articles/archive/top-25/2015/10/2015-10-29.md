Welcome to another busy week at the home of the *Magic* Top 25 Pro Rankings. With Grand Prix in both Beijing and Quebec City this past weekend, and with a triple-header (Lyon, Indianapolis, and Porto Alegre) just a few days away, there's plenty going on in our Top 25. So let's take a look.


The first seven in the table remain unchanged, and that's mostly due to no activity this past week, with several top US players not making the trip to Canada for GP Quebec City. Mike Sigrist took the plunge but couldn't advance to Day Two, while Paulo Vitor Damo da Rosa—who last week went all the way from No. 18 up to No. 5—had another solid weekend, just missing out on the Top 8 in Canada. He stays put at No. 5, but is now much closer to Eric Froehlich ahead of him.


Someone who *did* make the Top 8 in Quebec was Reid Duke. He may only have risen one spot in the rankings as a result (to No. 18), but he's now firmly in a glut of players within a couple of points of each other. His next gain is likely to be substantial. On home soil, Alexander Hayne finished in tenth place, and that was enough to send him back into the Top 10 at No. 8. Two-time World Champion Shahar Shenhar also featured in the Top 16 of Quebec City, and he's up two this week at No. 14.


Seth Manfield and Steve Rubin both had Top 32 finishes, which puts Manfield fractions away from Owen Turtenwald in the battle for world No. 1 and sees Rubin up three places to No. 12. Joel Larsson, staying in North America after the Pro Tour, couldn't make the most of his extended stay, and he falls two to No. 23.


Meanwhile, GP Beijing demonstrated yet again that Team Limited is a format where the cream really does rise to the top. Yuuya Watanabe was our biggest climber in the charts this week, up six to No. 11 on the back of his team's second-place finish in Beijing. As for the new Pro Tour champion, Kazuyuki Takimura of Japan, there was more good news, as his team finished fourth. That takes him to No. 20 in the rankings. This leaves fellow countryman Kentaro Yamamoto on the trapdoor as we head into our three GPs around the world this coming weekend, featuring Modern (Porto Alegre), Standard (Indianapolis), and *Battle for Zendikar* Limited (Lyon). For all the news from those three GPs, join us again right here next week.
