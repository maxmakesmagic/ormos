David Grant is one of the stronger British players, having represented the national team back in 2002. ### Game 1


Jorstedt won the die roll and elected to go first. The game was interrupted with a mulligan from Jorstedt, but he was happy with his six cards and the game got underway. Both players had a reasonably slow start with the first play not coming until Jorstedt played a [Vulshok Battlegear](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vulshok+Battlegear) on turn 3. Grant's Vedalkan Engineer turned up a turn late. It accelerated him out a [Razor Golem](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Razor+Golem), but by this time the Englishman was facing down a Battlegear equipped [Auriok Steelshaper](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Auriok+Steelshaper). A Tel-Jihad Outrider cropped up to dissuade any counter attacking.


Grant took to the skies with a [Hoverguard Observer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hoverguard+Observer) but the next attack from Jorstedt saw the Outrider trampling right over Grant's Engineer with a [Predator's Strike](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Predator%27s+Strike). Grant was down to 5.


Down but not out though. He attacked back for 6 and when Jorstedt tried to attack for the coup de grace Grant was waiting with a [Blinding Beam](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blinding+Beam). This gave Grant two turns.


It was all he needed. He attacked back for another 6 before summoning a [Skyhunter Patrol](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skyhunter+Patrol). Jorstedt drew another card and then conceded in the face of a lethal attack on the next turn. He hadn't managed a single spell after Grant caught him with the Beam.


**Grant 1 - 0 Jorstedt**


### Game 2


Grant mulliganed this game and again there wasn't much action until Jorstedt's Battlegear on turn 3. Grant followed with a [Neurok Spy](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Neurok+Spy) and then watched as Jorstedt imprinted Tel-Jihad Outriders on a [Soul Foundry](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soul+Foundry).


Grant had to move quickly before he was swamped. He cast a Slith Acscendant, which looked perfect for the situation. Another flier followed in the form of [Skyhunter Patrol](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skyhunter+Patrol). Maybe Grant could race through the skies.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gpbir04/qf2_2.jpg)Jorstedt built up his army, he attacked with an Outrider token and then cast [Pulse of the Tangle](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pulse+of+the+Tangle) twice. Grant cut down his forces with an [Irradiate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Irradiate) and attacked back with his unblockable monsters.


Jorstedt came in for nine damage on the next turn. With an [Echoing Courage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Echoing+Courage) and [Predator's Strike](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Predator%27s+Strike) in hand he could a whopping 16 damage. Unfortunately Grant was at 17 life and was able to attack over the top for lethal damage the next turn.


**David Grant beats Mattias Jorstedt 2-0**
