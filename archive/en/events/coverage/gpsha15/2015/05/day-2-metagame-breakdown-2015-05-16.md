* The presence of Atarka was also felt in Day 2. 10 players chose to defeat their opponents with the help of little red men and [Atarka's Command](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Atarka%27s+Command), 9 others chose to summon [Dragonlord Atarka](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dragonlord+Atarka) from their Green-based Devotion decks instead.
