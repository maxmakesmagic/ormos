*What card from the [**Magic** 2012 Card Image Gallery](http://www.wizards.com/magic/tcg/article.aspx?x=mtg/tcg/magic2012/cig) are you most hoping to open at the Prerelease, and why?*

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/mtgcom/authorpics/authorpic_zachill.jpg)**Zac Hill:** Chandra, the Firebrand! Not only is she powerful, awesome, and one of the only cards that can singlehandedly control a board, but you can play her in almost every deck! 

There are so many cards inside the set that combo with her second ability—everything from [Divination](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Divination) to [Doom Blade](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Doom+Blade) to the mighty Sorin's Bite. Yet she's subtle enough that a lot of the stuff you can do with her is fun. She doesn't singlehandedly end the game like a [Fireball](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fireball) or an [Overrun](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Overrun), and to me that's a lot more interesting. Plus, I mean, it's never bad to open a planeswalker!
