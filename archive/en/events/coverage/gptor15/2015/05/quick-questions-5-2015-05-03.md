**What is the most surprising card that has been played against you this weekend?**



With Standard a wide-open playing field and Grand Prix boasting such high attendance numbers, you’re going to come up against a few oddballs. I talked to some of Day 2’s best and asked which cards raised their eyebrows.

**Paul Rietzl, Hall of Famer** – Maindeck [Encase in Ice](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Encase+in+Ice). I had to call a judge, but it was legit. It was good, too, locked down a 13/13 [Warden of the First Tree](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Warden+of+the+First+Tree).

**Dan Fournier, Team Canada 2015** – [Archetype of Courage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Archetype+of+Courage). I had to take it with [Thoughtseize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtseize) or I would’ve lost on the spot.
