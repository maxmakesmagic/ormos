![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/ptven03/a952.jpg)Away from the gaming table, Canadian pro Jeff Cunningham is the nice young man every mother hopes her daughter will end up with. Polite, but not to a fault, soft-spoken, clean-cut, in short, Cunningham is the perfect gentleman. That is, until he sits down at the table. Then his gentle charms and nonthreatening good looks give way to a champion's focus. When the game is on, he's all business. Mike Turian puts on a similar Jekyll and Hyde act, going from giggly Pillsbury Dough-Boy to well-oiled victory machine as soon as he starts to resolve a mulligan. Cunningham seemed more intense than ever thanks to a haircut you could set your watch to. After a quick dance involving Turian winning the die roll then choosing to orient the play mat rather than choose play or draw, the match was a go.

"You know, you don't have to wear the badge." – Mike Turian

### Game 1

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/ptven03/a951.jpg)Cunningham's hopes for a good matchup were dashed when Turian showed a plains on his first turn. Suddenly his turn-one Sledder was staring down [Astral Slide](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Astral+Slide). He kept gamely at it, swinging for damage and adding [Sparksmith](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sparksmith) and [Goblin Burrows](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Burrows) to the mix while Turian dug with [Renewed Faith](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Renewed+Faith) and then dropped [Astral Slide](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Astral+Slide). Cunningham brought out the Goon, but Turian's second Slide with one mana open predicted bad times.

Sure enough, Turian cycled [Akroma's Blessing](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Akroma%27s+Blessing) to minimize the pain. Next turn he had [Starstorm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Starstorm) and a cycler. Still, Cunningham wasn't out of it. Running out of gas, Turian was forced to drop an unprotected [Jareth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jareth), gambling that Cunningham didn't have maindeck [Threaten](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Threaten)s. He did, but not in hand. He swung with Goon and Piledriver, punching through seven damage thanks to two Burrows, leaving Turian at five. However, Turian had another [Renewed Faith](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Renewed+Faith), and then dropped the Angel, removing all doubt.

Turian 1 – Cunningham 0

### Game 2

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/ptven03/a953.jpg)Cunningham's start for the second game was far from spectacular. He had a pair of [Goblin Piledriver](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Piledriver)s with no one-drop support. Turian dropped [Lightning Rift](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Rift) and gave Cunningham his fourth turn with three mana open.

Then he dropped the bomb: [Gempalm Incinerator](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gempalm+Incinerator). Both Cunningham's incoming creatures were marked for death. Cunningham [Shock](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shock)ed the one targeted by the Rift, saving the other. A cycled [Akroma's Vengeance](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Akroma%27s+Vengeance) took out the other Piledriver. Cunningham rebuilt with a wave of goblins, but they were swept aside by [Starstorm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Starstorm). Then Turian showed his Angel, comfortably eating seven from a [Blistering Firecat](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blistering+Firecat). Cunningham scooped up his cards, showing only lands in hand.

**Final Result:** Mike Turian defeats Jeff Cunningham 2-0
