New Faces, New Direction for Live Coverage

After starting his career covering college football and basketball for ESPN.com, Greg Collins found a way to merge his love of sports and games into one job. He's been in charge of Magic event coverage since 2004. 






*Oath of the Gatewatch* is almost upon us, which means we're about to kick off our live video coverage schedule for 2016. Following up on our [announcement about video coverage](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/news/magic-tournament-video-coverage-2016-2015-12-08) from December, here's a deeper look at what we have to offer for the first three months of the year.


The weekend of January 30–31 puts the new set on display for Sealed Deck and Booster Draft play from Grand Prix in [Nagoya](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/premierplay/grandprix/fact-sheet-gpnag16), [Mexico City](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/premierplay/grandprix/fact-sheet-gpmex16), and [Vancouver](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/premierplay/grandprix/fact-sheet-gpvan16). [Pro Tour *Oath of the Gatewatch*](http://magic.wizards.com/en/protour/ogw) follows a week after that, and then [Grand Prix Houston](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/premierplay/grandprix/fact-sheet-gphou16) and the triple weekend of [Grand Prix Melbourne](http://magic.wizards.com/en/premierplay/grandprix/fact-sheet-gpmel16), [Bologna](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/premierplay/grandprix/fact-sheet-gpbol16), and [Detroit](http://magic.wizards.com/en/premierplay/grandprix/fact-sheet-gpdet16) wrap up our first series of live video coverage this year.


I'm excited to announce several new faces joining the coverage team across those events. Vancouver features the coverage-writing debut of Melissa DeTora, and Houston will feature not one but two debuts: Gaby Spartz on the video commentary team and Meghan Wolff on the writing team. These new additions join a host of returning commentators and writers who have become the backbone of *Magic*'s live event coverage.


The other big change is we are moving to 1080p resolution for our six flagship events—the four Pro Tours, the World Championship, and the World *Magic* Cup. This allows us to bring our biggest events to you in even more detail, ideal for viewing on flat-screen TVs. Time to schedule that Pro Tour viewing party!


Our new-look Grand Prix video coverage debuts from Vancouver, which will serve as a base of operations to bring you info from all three GP locations that weekend. The video teams will be adding two roles in 2016: a lead producer and a features host. This will better define each person's role on the commentary team, and the overall broadcast will be more organized.


Here are the rosters for the first cycle of weekends with video coverage:


Grand Prix Vancouver/Mexico City/Nagoya
=======================================


  
**Match Commentators**: Marshall Sutcliffe and Randy Buehler


**Producer/Commentator**: Rich Hagon


**Features Host**: Brian David-Marshall


**Writers**: Marc Calderaro and Melissa DeTora (Vancouver), Corbin Hosler (Mexico City), Chapman Sim (Nagoya)


Video coverage begins Saturday, January 30, at 5 p.m. ET.


The bulk of that weekend's team will then regroup in Atlanta for the Pro Tour February 5–7, building on the storylines that emerge from the Grand Prix.


Pro Tour *Oath of the Gatewatch*
================================


![](https://media.wizards.com/2016/images/daily/NEWS20160114_PTOGW.png)


**Match Commentators**: Marshall Sutcliffe, Randy Buehler, Ian Duke, Tim Willoughby (with possible Sunday cameo by Luis Scott-Vargas)


**News Desk Anchors**: Rich Hagon and Brian David-Marshall


**Feature Match Floor Reporters**: Rashad Miller and Tim Willoughby


**Feature Match Spotters**: Neil Rigby and Maria Bartholdi


**Writers/Editors**: Blake Rasmussen, Mike Rosenberg, Marc Calderaro, Corbin Hosler, and Jacob van Lunen


**Social Media**: Trick Jarrett and Nate Price


Video coverage begins Friday, February 5, at 9 a.m. ET.


Along with everything you've come to expect from Pro Tour coverage, we'll be extending our view to outside the tournament hall by embedding BDM and a camera crew with a major team at their testing house before the Pro Tour. He'll spend a day on the inside to bring you a unique look at the dynamics of a testing team. Those video features will run throughout the Pro Tour live stream. What team, you ask? You'll have to watch the stream to find out.


The story of *Oath of the Gatewatch* and *Magic*'s top professional players continues at Grand Prix Houston February 27–28. Standard's the name of the game that weekend as we delve into the new set's impact.


Grand Prix Houston
==================


**Match Commentators**: Marshall Sutcliffe, Luis Scott-Vargas, and Gaby Spartz


**Producer**: Rich Hagon


**Features Host**: Brian David-Marshall


**Writers**: Marc Calderaro and Meghan Wolff


Video coverage begins Saturday, February 27, at 2 p.m. ET.


That commentary team of Marshall, Luis, Gaby, and Brian returns the next week in Detroit for a follow-up look at Modern. With Grand Prix also in Melbourne and Bologna, the coverage team will delve into how the metagame established at the Pro Tour has developed across three regions, putting what we've learned about the new set into focus from across the very top of the *Magic* tournament scene.


Grand Prix Detroit/Melbourne/Bologna
====================================


**Commentators**: Marshall Sutcliffe, Luis Scott-Vargas, and Gaby Spartz


**Producer**: Rich Hagon


**Features Host**: Brian David-Marshall

So stay tuned to [twitch.tv/magic](http://www.twitch.tv/magic) and follow each event on DailyMTG for the next two months, and by the time the calendar turns to March you'll be an expert on all things *Oath of the Gatewatch*. From Modern to Standard, Sealed Deck to Booster Draft, the Wizards coverage team has you covered.
