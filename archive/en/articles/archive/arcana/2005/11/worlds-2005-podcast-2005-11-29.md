| **WHAT IS PODCASTING?**
Podcasting is delivering audio content on demand so that it can be listened to at the user's convenience. The main benefit of podcasting is that listeners can sync content to their media player and take it with them to listen whenever they want to. Because podcasts are typically saved in MP3 format, they can also be listened to on nearly any computer. |

This month's studio podcast kicks off with the extremely tight race for Player of the Year between France's Olivier Ruel and Japan's Kenji Tsumura, which will be decided at Worlds. In addition, Randy and Hall of Famer Alan Comer discuss the [Magic Pro Tour Hall of Fame](/en/node/574031) and Alan's return to competitive Magic. Finally, Randy announces the [complete 2006 Pro Tour schedule](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=dci/announce/dci20051129a). (If you're scared of technology, you can check out Brian David-Marshall's preview of Worlds [here](/en/articles/archive/event-coverage/2005-magic-world-championships-preview-2005-11-23).)

Then for the rest of the week, Randy will be delivering new updates every few hours from the floor of Worlds. Listen in as he interviews players, follows the Player of the Year race, updates the National Team competition and much more.

In addition to Randy's regular event coverage, we will bring you monthly podcast updates on the latest news from the world of **Magic**.
