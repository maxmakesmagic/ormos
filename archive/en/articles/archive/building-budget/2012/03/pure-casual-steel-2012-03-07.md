Hello and welcome to Fate Week here on **DailyMTG.com**. I've wanted to write about [Puresteel Paladin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Puresteel+Paladin) for some time, but the card has always been in high demand. [Puresteel Paladin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Puresteel+Paladin) strategies have fallen out of favor since the release of *Dark Ascension* and the card has become significantly easier to acquire through trading.

Traditionally, Puresteel decks have been white-blue, playing blue for cards like [Trinket Mage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Trinket+Mage), [Invisible Stalker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Invisible+Stalker), and [Ponder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ponder). Today, I'd like to experiment with a white-black version of the deck.

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/boab/boab185_pure.jpg)[Puresteel Paladin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Puresteel+Paladin) | Art by [Jason Chan](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&artist=+%5B%22Jason+Chan%22%5D)

[Puresteel Paladin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Puresteel+Paladin) is a powerful tempo and card-advantage engine. It's a 2/2 for two mana that turns a huge percentage of the deck into cantrips (cards that draw you a card). Also, once you have three or more artifacts on the battlefield, you'll be able to equip everything for no mana.

In the past, [Puresteel Paladin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Puresteel+Paladin) decks have had trouble staying powerful enough in the games where they don't draw their namesake. However, *Innistrad* brought [Mentor of the Meek](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mentor+of+the+Meek) into the picture and gave the deck a new angle in which it can churn out huge amounts of card advantage.

| Puresteel Paladin | Mentor of the Meek |

If you've been playing for a while, you'll surely remember how good cards like [Bitterblossom](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bitterblossom) and [Spectral Procession](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spectral+Procession) were with Equipment. I expected [Lingering Souls](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lingering+Souls) to be just as good, if not better. With a healthy dose of Equipment, each Spirit will require a removal spell from your opponent. In the past, board-sweeping effects would alleviate the situation and allow a control player to move on. [Lingering Souls](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lingering+Souls) requires opponents to have two board-sweeping effects if they intend to control the game. [Lingering Souls](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lingering+Souls) also has incredible synergy with [Mentor of the Meek](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mentor+of+the+Meek). You'll be able to draw two cards with each casting of [Lingering Souls](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lingering+Souls) if you have the mana available and a [Mentor of the Meek](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mentor+of+the+Meek) on the battlefield. Also, [Lingering Souls](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lingering+Souls) is one of the most powerful cards in recent sets all by itself, so that's certainly a plus.

![Lingering Souls](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Lingering+Souls)  
[Flayer Husk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flayer+Husk) is an efficiently costed Equipment that comes with a body. We're playing [Flayer Husk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flayer+Husk) because of its strength with [Puresteel Paladin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Puresteel+Paladin) and [Mentor of the Meek](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mentor+of+the+Meek), but the card works surprisingly well with all cogs of the deck.



|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Flayer Husk | Mortarpod |

[Mortarpod](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mortarpod) is an obvious inclusion. Many decks that don't even have access to [Lingering Souls](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lingering+Souls) or [Puresteel Paladin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Puresteel+Paladin) are including [Mortarpod](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mortarpod) these days as an effective answer to [Delver of Secrets](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Delver+of+Secrets) and many other popular threats of the format. Once you have metalcraft, [Puresteel Paladin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Puresteel+Paladin) lets you effectively [Fireball](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fireball) your opponent for the number of creatures you have on the battlefield. This makes your clock deceptively fast in racing situations.

[Sword of Vengeance](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sword+of+Vengeance) might not be [Sword of Feast and Famine](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sword+of+Feast+and+Famine) or [Sword of War and Peace](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sword+of+War+and+Peace), but it gets the job done. I needed a big Equipment so I wasn't just durdling about with [Flayer Husk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flayer+Husk)s and [Mortarpod](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mortarpod)s when I didn't have an engine online. [Sword of Vengeance](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sword+of+Vengeance) fits the bill. If you're lucky enough to own a [Sword of Feast and Famine](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sword+of+Feast+and+Famine) or [Sword of War and Peace](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sword+of+War+and+Peace) instead, then you should make the swap. If I were building the deck without budget restrictions, it would likely include three copies of [Sword of War and Peace](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sword+of+War+and+Peace) and two of [Sword of Feast and Famine](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sword+of+Feast+and+Famine) instead of the four [Sword of Vengeance](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sword+of+Vengeance) and one [Flayer Husk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flayer+Husk). Currently, this is a casual deck and is not Standard legal. If you acquire the other Swords you can make this deck Standard ready!



|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Sword of Vengeance | Tragic Slip |

[Tragic Slip](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tragic+Slip) is an extremely efficient removal spell. [Mortarpod](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mortarpod) and [Flayer Husk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flayer+Husk) make it very easy to turn on morbid. Additionally, you have a lot of creatures that win the game all by themselves if left hanging around. Your opponents will be forced to use removal spells aggressively to turn on the morbid for your [Tragic Slip](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tragic+Slip).

I wanted six spot-removal spells, so in addition to the two copies of [Tragic Slip](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tragic+Slip) I rounded out the deck with two each of [Dismember](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dismember) and [Go for the Throat](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Go+for+the+Throat). To be honest, I'm not sure which card is better. [Go for the Throat](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Go+for+the+Throat) is better against Titan decks, but playing four copies makes us incredibly weak against [Tempered Steel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tempered+Steel) strategies. I feel the two/two split is perfect.



|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Dismember | Go for the Throat |

[Swiftfoot Boots](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swiftfoot+Boots) will help protect our engines.

[Faith's Shield](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Faith%27s+Shield) is an efficiently costed way to protect one of our permanents from whatever the opponent might throw at it. [Faith's Shield](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Faith%27s+Shield) has fateful hour, we can often engineer our life total with [Dismember](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dismember) and use [Faith's Shield](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Faith%27s+Shield) to effectively [Fog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fog) our opponent and swing back for lethal or we can make our team extremely difficult to block and get in the final swing.

![Faith's Shield](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Faith%27s+Shield)  
I like playing a single copy of [Nihil Spellbomb](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nihil+Spellbomb) in any Standard deck with twelve or more black sources of mana. I find the activated ability is almost always at least a little bit relevant and the ability to cantrip and get closer to more [Puresteel Paladin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Puresteel+Paladin)s is definitely worth the slot.

My favorite card in the deck is [Bloodline Keeper](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodline+Keeper). Think about all the interactions this card has here. [Bloodline Keeper](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodline+Keeper) is a one-sided [Howling Mine](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Howling+Mine) if you have a [Mentor of the Meek](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mentor+of+the+Meek) in play. [Bloodline Keeper](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodline+Keeper) can attack for 5 and make a token on the turn it comes into play with a [Sword of Vengeance](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sword+of+Vengeance) equipped to it. [Bloodline Keeper](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodline+Keeper) with [Swiftfoot Boots](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swiftfoot+Boots) is an outright game-win against a lot of the decks in the format. I didn't even mention how strong the card is entirely on its own. There will be many games where a [Bloodline Keeper](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodline+Keeper) is able to take down your opponent without any help at all.

Here's the final decklist. Remember, this is a casual deck and is not legal in Standard tournaments. If you like the deck and want to play it in a Standard tournament, all you need to do is find a solid replacement for [Sword of Vengeance](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sword+of+Vengeance):

I played a few matches with the deck against the Standard decks people were playing at my local shop.

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/boab/boab185_match1Header.jpg)  
![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/boab/boab185_gravecrawler.jpg)I won the roll and kept [Plains](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plains), [Isolated Chapel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Isolated+Chapel), [Isolated Chapel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Isolated+Chapel), [Evolving Wilds](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Evolving+Wilds), [Puresteel Paladin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Puresteel+Paladin), [Mortarpod](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mortarpod), and [Lingering Souls](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lingering+Souls). I played my [Evolving Wilds](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Evolving+Wilds). My opponent cast a [Diregraf Ghoul](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Diregraf+Ghoul) and I cracked my [Evolving Wilds](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Evolving+Wilds) to grab a [Plains](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plains). I drew [Bloodline Keeper](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodline+Keeper), played [Isolated Chapel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Isolated+Chapel), and cast [Puresteel Paladin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Puresteel+Paladin). My opponent attacked for 2 and cast [Gravecrawler](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gravecrawler). I drew [Flayer Husk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flayer+Husk), cast [Mortarpod](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mortarpod), drew [Tragic Slip](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tragic+Slip), cast [Flayer Husk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flayer+Husk), drew [Sword of Vengeance](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sword+of+Vengeance), and attacked for 2. My opponent attacked with both creatures (I took 4), then cast [Geralf's Messenger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Geralf%27s+Messenger) and dropped me to 12. I drew a [Faith's Shield](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Faith%27s+Shield), played my land, cast [Sword of Vengeance](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sword+of+Vengeance), equipped it to [Puresteel Paladin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Puresteel+Paladin), attacked for 4, and passed the turn with an [Isolated Chapel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Isolated+Chapel) open. 

My opponent played a [Diregraf Captain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Diregraf+Captain) and attacked with everything. I used my [Mortarpod](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mortarpod) on the [Gravecrawler](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gravecrawler), cast [Tragic Slip](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tragic+Slip) on the [Diregraf Captain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Diregraf+Captain), blocked the [Diregraf Ghoul](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Diregraf+Ghoul) with [Puresteel Paladin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Puresteel+Paladin), and chump-blocked the [Geralf's Messenger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Geralf%27s+Messenger) with my [Flayer Husk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flayer+Husk) germ. I drew a [Swamp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swamp), played it, cast [Bloodline Keeper](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodline+Keeper), equipped all my Equipment to [Bloodline Keeper](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodline+Keeper), attacked for 8, and passed the turn with [Isolated Chapel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Isolated+Chapel) open. My opponent aimed a [Go for the Throat](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Go+for+the+Throat) at [Bloodline Keeper](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodline+Keeper), but I had [Faith's Shield](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Faith%27s+Shield) at the ready. My opponent then brought back [Gravecrawler](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gravecrawler) and I made a Vampire on the endstep. I drew another [Sword of Vengeance](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sword+of+Vengeance) and attacked for lethal damage in the air.

It's generally fine to sideboard out the [Faith's Shield](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Faith%27s+Shield), especially when your opponent sees it in Game 1. Players might play around it even when it isn't in your deck anymore.

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/boab/boab185_mess.jpg)I kept [Plains](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plains), [Isolated Chapel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Isolated+Chapel), [Go for the Throat](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Go+for+the+Throat), [Tragic Slip](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tragic+Slip), [Nihil Spellbomb](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nihil+Spellbomb), [Lingering Souls](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lingering+Souls), and [Lingering Souls](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lingering+Souls). My opponent played a land. I drew a [Swamp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swamp), played my [Plains](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plains), and cast [Nihil Spellbomb](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nihil+Spellbomb). My opponent played a second land and cast [Distress](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Distress), making me discard [Go for the Throat](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Go+for+the+Throat). I drew [Bloodline Keeper](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodline+Keeper) and played [Isolated Chapel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Isolated+Chapel). My opponent cast [Geralf's Messenger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Geralf%27s+Messenger), putting me at 18. I drew a [Plains](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plains), played it, and cast [Lingering Souls](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lingering+Souls). My opponent attacked me for 3 and cast another [Geralf's Messenger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Geralf%27s+Messenger) to put me at 13. I drew a [Swamp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swamp), played my land, and hard cast another [Lingering Souls](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lingering+Souls). My opponent attacked with both [Geralf's Messenger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Geralf%27s+Messenger)s and I double-blocked both. With both undying triggers on the stack I sacrificed my [Nihil Spellbomb](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nihil+Spellbomb) and removed them from the game, then paid a black mana and drew a [Mentor of the Meek](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mentor+of+the+Meek). My opponent cast a [Diregraf Ghoul](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Diregraf+Ghoul). I drew a [Flayer Husk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flayer+Husk), played my land, cast [Mentor of the Meek](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mentor+of+the+Meek) and [Flayer Husk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flayer+Husk), then paid one and drew a [Plains](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plains). My opponent cast a [Diregraf Captain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Diregraf+Captain) and attacked with [Diregraf Ghoul](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Diregraf+Ghoul), which I chump-blocked with the [Flayer Husk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flayer+Husk). 

Then I drew a [Puresteel Paladin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Puresteel+Paladin), used the flashback on [Lingering Souls](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lingering+Souls) and drew [Sword of Vengeance](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sword+of+Vengeance) and [Swiftfoot Boots](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swiftfoot+Boots) with [Mentor of the Meek](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mentor+of+the+Meek), and played another land. My opponent attacked with [Diregraf Ghoul](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Diregraf+Ghoul) and I double blocked with my [Lingering Souls](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lingering+Souls) tokens, putting two damage on the 3/3 Ghoul. My opponent had a [Tragic Slip](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tragic+Slip) for my [Mentor of the Meek](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mentor+of+the+Meek), but I had a [Tragic Slip](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tragic+Slip) and that was enough to get rid of the [Diregraf Ghoul](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Diregraf+Ghoul) as well. I drew a [Plains](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plains), played my seventh land, cast [Swiftfoot Boots](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swiftfoot+Boots), cast [Bloodline Keeper](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodline+Keeper), equipped [Bloodline Keeper](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodline+Keeper) with the boots, and passed the turn. My opponent conceded.

[Bloodline Keeper](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodline+Keeper) is pretty good.

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/boab/boab185_grave.jpg)I won the roll, sent back a hand with one land, and kept [Plains](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plains), [Plains](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plains), [Swamp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swamp), [Puresteel Paladin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Puresteel+Paladin), [Sword of Vengeance](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sword+of+Vengeance), and [Lingering Souls](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lingering+Souls). I played a [Plains](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plains). My opponent played a [Swamp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swamp). I drew [Mentor of the Meek](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mentor+of+the+Meek), played another [Plains](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plains), and cast [Puresteel Paladin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Puresteel+Paladin). My opponent played a second land and cast [Go for the Throat](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Go+for+the+Throat) on [Puresteel Paladin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Puresteel+Paladin). I drew an [Isolated Chapel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Isolated+Chapel) and cast [Mentor of the Meek](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mentor+of+the+Meek). My opponent played a third land and passed. I drew a [Plains](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plains), played it, attacked for 2, cast [Lingering Souls](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lingering+Souls), drew [Go for the Throat](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Go+for+the+Throat) with [Mentor of the Meek](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mentor+of+the+Meek), and passed the turn, but my opponent cast [Forbidden Alchemy](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forbidden+Alchemy) on my endstep. 

My opponent cast [Black Sun's Zenith](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Black+Sun%27s+Zenith) for 2 and wiped my board. I drew [Bloodline Keeper](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodline+Keeper) and cast it. My opponent simply played a fifth land and passed the turn. I drew [Puresteel Paladin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Puresteel+Paladin) and cast both it and [Sword of Vengeance](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sword+of+Vengeance), the latter of which got [Mana Leak](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mana+Leak)ed; my opponent cast [Think Twice](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Think+Twice) on my endstep. My opponent played a sixth land and cast [Grave Titan](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grave+Titan). I made a Vampire on the endstep, then drew a [Flayer Husk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flayer+Husk) on my turn, cast it, drew a [Plains](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plains), cast [Go for the Throat](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Go+for+the+Throat) on my opponent's [Grave Titan](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grave+Titan), and attacked for 5 in the air. My opponent cast [Black Sun's Zenith](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Black+Sun%27s+Zenith) for 4 and wiped both of our boards after attacking. I drew [Sword of Vengeance](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sword+of+Vengeance), cast it, and used the flashback on [Lingering Souls](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lingering+Souls). My opponent cast a main-phase [Forbidden Alchemy](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forbidden+Alchemy) and played a seventh land. I drew an [Isolated Chapel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Isolated+Chapel) and attempted to equip a Spirit, but it got [Tragic Slip](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tragic+Slip)ped; I equipped the Sword and [Flayer Husk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flayer+Husk) to the other token and attacked for 4. My opponent used the flashback on [Think Twice](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Think+Twice), then untapped and cast another [Grave Titan](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grave+Titan) before passing. I drew [Bloodline Keeper](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodline+Keeper), cast it, equipped my Sword, and attacked for 7. My opponent aimed a removal spell at [Bloodline Keeper](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodline+Keeper) and I made a Vampire in response. My opponent attacked for 10 (I took the damage), then packed it up because I had the kill on board.

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/boab/boab185_think.jpg)My opponent went down to five cards and I kept [Plains](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plains), [Isolated Chapel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Isolated+Chapel), [Evolving Wilds](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Evolving+Wilds), [Puresteel Paladin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Puresteel+Paladin), [Flayer Husk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flayer+Husk), [Flayer Husk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flayer+Husk), and [Mortarpod](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mortarpod). My opponent played an [Island](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island) and passed. I played [Evolving Wilds](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Evolving+Wilds) and fetched up a [Plains](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plains). My opponent played another [Island](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Island) and passed the turn. I drew [Gruesome Discovery](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gruesome+Discovery) and cast [Puresteel Paladin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Puresteel+Paladin). My opponent cast [Think Twice](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Think+Twice) on my endstep, then untapped and played a [Swamp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swamp). I drew a [Swamp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Swamp), cast [Flayer Husk](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flayer+Husk), drew a [Plains](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plains), cast [Mortarpod](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mortarpod), drew [Sword of Vengeance](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sword+of+Vengeance), and attacked for 2. My opponent used the flashback on [Think Twice](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Think+Twice), then main-phased another [Think Twice](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Think+Twice), played a land, and cast [Go for the Throat](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Go+for+the+Throat) on my [Puresteel Paladin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Puresteel+Paladin). I drew [Bloodline Keeper](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodline+Keeper), attacked for 1, aimed a Germ at my opponent with [Mortarpod](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mortarpod), and cast [Gruesome Discovery](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gruesome+Discovery) with morbid, leaving my opponent with nothing but land in hand. 

My opponent used the flashback on [Think Twice](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Think+Twice) and passed the turn. I drew [Faith's Shield](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Faith%27s+Shield) and cast [Bloodline Keeper](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodline+Keeper); my opponent aimed a [Go for the Throat](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Go+for+the+Throat) at it, but I had [Faith's Shield](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Faith%27s+Shield) ready. My opponent played a land and passed. I drew another [Bloodline Keeper](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bloodline+Keeper), cast it, made a guy with the first one, then attacked for 1. My opponent just passed back. I made a guy with both Bloodline keepers and flipped them, attacked with the one token I had prior, and passed the turn. My opponent drew and conceded.

The deck works really well. If you're a fan of [Puresteel Paladin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Puresteel+Paladin) then I strongly recommend putting this deck together and trying it out. It's really pretty easy to acquire on **Magic Online** and is a great deck to play in the casual room; [Isolated Chapel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Isolated+Chapel) is the hardest card to pick up, but all the rest are fairly easy. There are a lot of interactions in the deck and it can be very difficult to play. Try a few matches for practice before finding replacements for [Sword of Vengeance](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sword+of+Vengeance) and sleeving it up for a Standard tournament.

As always, hit the forums or shoot me an email with questions, comments, or ideas for future columns.

Happy Brewing!
