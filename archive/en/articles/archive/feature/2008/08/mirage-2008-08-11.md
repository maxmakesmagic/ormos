### Collector's Highlights


The *Mirage* expansion, originally released in 1996, is a limited, 350 all-new, black-bordered card set featuring 110 rares, 110 uncommons, 110 commons and 20 basic lands.




### Game Features


*Mirage* introduced two new abilities to the world of **Magic: the Gathering**: Phasing and Flanking.


* **Phasing --** Now you see it; now you don't! With Phasing, permanents spend only half their time in play, allowing some pretty big discounts on mana cost.
* **Flanking --** Some creatures are just better at attacking than others. And creatures with Flanking are so good, the blockers can go down even before any damage is dealt!

M**irage is back!**


Welcome to Jamuraa, a land steeped in magical traditions that have existed for millennia. The northwest of the huge continent of Jamuraa is occupied by three nations: the militaristic kingdom of the Zhalfirins, the religious state of Femeref, and the trading province of the Suq'Ata empire.

Until now, Phasing, Flanking, and Enchant Worlds have been unknown online. And there have never been any *Mirage* theme decks anywhere! The four decks were created in four different ways: there was an online tournament ([won by Markus Pettersson](/en/articles/archive/whoever-won-mirage-precon-contest-2005-09-29)) for the right to create the first one; then Jay Moldenhauer-Salazar [made one with the help of his readers](/en/articles/archive/building-budget/interlude-my-mirage-precon-part-1-2005-10-03). The third one is currently being created [by the readers of magicthegathering.com](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/authorarchive&author=FrankGilson), and the fourth one will be made by R&D.
