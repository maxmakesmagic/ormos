We're nearly to April, which means it is my duty to inform you, dear Friday Night *Magic* player, what promos we have coming to stores near you in the coming months. We'll start with April and inch our way to June. Deal?


Rhetorical question. We're doing this. Read on.


**April**


April showers bring...eww. Planar flesh peeling? That's nasty. I want one.


If you play in an FNM in April, you could pick up a [Blighted Fen](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blighted+Fen) with art by Jason Felix and the newfangled colorless mana symbol. That's a win for fans of the Eldrazi and of Jason Felix!

**May**


Fun fact: Mark Zug had only ever painted one Goblin before in his illustrious *Magic* career: [Ponyback Brigade](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=386628). For May's FNM promo, however, Zug has put his spin on maybe *the* Goblin—[Goblin Warchief](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Warchief). Truly a terror when it was in Standard, Warchief can now terrorize even more tabletops after May positively rains Zug's new vision of the Warchief on FNMs everywhere.

Looking for something? Well, if that something is a land, [Sylvan Scrying](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sylvan+Scrying) will help you find it—with new art from Christine Choi.
