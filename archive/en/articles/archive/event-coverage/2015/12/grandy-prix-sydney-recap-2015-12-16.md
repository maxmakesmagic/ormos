With play starting at about 10 am Saturday morning, the whole GP ran smoothly without even the slightest hint of a hitch. With the Invitational being played downstairs, players had the chance to go see how the real "professionals" played the game between rounds. With side events running almost nonstop and celebrities such as Worth Wollpert gunslinging there was something for players of all skill levels to do.



On the Wednesday before the GP, a local Magic player named Ben Seck went on a childrens' television show called "Cheese TV," explaining to everyone the basics of the game and where and when the GP was on in case they wanted to learn about the game themselves.



The Grand Prix was won by Gordon Lin, a ratings-flagged player who picked up both the major prize purse and the ratings purse making him the highest paid GP winner in Magic history. He played one of the least common decks in the format, Pandeburst, and defeated Will Copeman, playing his own version of TS, 2-1 in the final. Other players in the top 8, included Royce Chai, Joe Connolly, Anatoli Lightfoot, Chris Allen, Satoshi Nakamura and Kim Brebach.



Day One saw a wide variety of decks being played by an even wider variety of players from all over the southern hemisphere, including Japan, New Zealand and Singapore. The most popular decks were traditional decks in Extended including Oath, Trix and CounterSliver. There was also a wide splashing of Sligh, TS and the rebirth of some WW Jank decks.



Day Two saw the more traditional decks move to the top of the field, with many of the top tables testing their skills in the Trix and CounterSliver mirror matches, pushing themselves to their mental limits for a place in the Top 8.
