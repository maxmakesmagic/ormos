A while back I [promised you](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/stf/93) a glimpse into the world of concept push, where a specially picked team of **Magic** artists are air-lifted in for a couple of weeks to generate sketches and ideas for what a brand new world looks like. The most recent one was for codename: "Shake" (coming out October 2011). It was another look for me into how **Magic** gets made and it was one of the high points of my time here. Lots of excitement and plenty of creative, flavory goodness for me to baste my brain in. Artists come flying in from all over the place, we hole them up in the concept room where they have access to pens, pencils, movies, death rays, robots, and all the things artists need to create crazy-cool art. Then they are taken into the boardroom where they are briefed on the basic vibe of the set and what the creative team's vision is for the world—the creatures and the architecture. Then the artists go to work. Watching all the ideas get visually represented by some of the world's best fantasy paint-slingers is a real treat for me and seeing their efforts translate into the "Shake" world coming to life is über-cool. It's world-building at its best.
