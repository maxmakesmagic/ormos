4 PT Top 8s


13 GP Top 8s


**Who did you prepare with?**


Channelfireball and Face to Face


**What Constructed deck are you playing and why?**


Abzan, no idea. I thought it could get me a good enough record that limited could carry me. It was fairly average.


**What Modern deck, other than the one you’re playing, impressed you the most this weekend?**


Infect, but I thought it was too weak vs. Abzan.


**What decks did you draft? What did you think of each deck?**


3-0 with Abzan. I opened some rares. It worked out.


2-1 with Sultai. No rares, but good for the table.


**What would winning the Pro Tour mean to you?**


They haven’t invented words to express that quite yet.

**What Constructed deck are you playing and why?**


[Splinter Twin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Splinter+Twin). I think it’s the best deck.


**What Modern deck, other than the one you’re playing, impressed you the most this weekend?**


Infect.


**What decks did you draft? What did you think of each deck?**


White-Blue Control and Four-Color Rares deck.

A lot of satisfaction due to the effort.

**What Constructed deck are you playing and why?**


[Splinter Twin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Splinter+Twin). It’s easy to play and probably not too bad.


**What Modern deck, other than the one you’re playing, impressed you the most this weekend?**


Infect.


**What decks did you draft? What did you think of each deck?**


Five-Color Rares: It was great.


Blue-Red: I didn’t think it was very good, but it had some powerful cards.


**What would winning the Pro Tour mean to you?**


Winning an individual Pro Tour has always been the one big accomplishment missing from my resumé. Finally getting that win after so many years would be amazing.

Seth Manfield
=============

**Age:** 24


**Hometown:** Chevy Chase, Maryland


**Limited Record:** 6-0


**Constructed Record:** 6-3-1


**Favorite Clan:**Sultai


**Previous *Magic* accomplishments:**  Winner of Grand Prix Daytona Beach ’07, winner of Grand Prix Kansas City ’13, Winner of Grand Prix Ottawa ‘14


**Who did you prepare with?**


Team TCGPlayer


**What Constructed deck are you playing and why?**


Burn. We were able to tune the list in a way that I was comfortable with, and I wasn’t expecting a ton of lifegain or hate cards.


**What Modern deck, other than the one you’re playing, impressed you the most this weekend?**


The Abzan deck with [Voice of Resurgence](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Voice+of+Resurgence) and [Kitchen Finks](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kitchen+Finks). That is a completely different take on that archetype.


**What decks did you draft? What did you think of each deck?**


Sultai. The deck was very solid with a bunch of card advantage to gain control in the late game.


Blue-Red. It was a very strong deck with a good mana curve and a great mana base.


**What would winning the Pro Tour mean to you?**


I have always dreamed about winning a Pro Tour. The first step is the Top 8. Now I can focus on winning this thing.

**Who did you prepare with?**


Team Face to Face and Team ChannelFireball working together. 20 people.


**What Constructed deck are you playing and why?**


White-Green Aggro. It was well positioned against the metagame. I have faith in Sam Pardee’s decks.


**What Modern deck, other than the one you’re playing, impressed you the most this weekend?**


Burn.


**What decks did you draft? What did you think of each deck?**


Mardu, 2-1. Mardu, 2-1. It’s bad in pack one, so it is often open in packs two and three.


**What would winning the Pro Tour mean to you?**


It would be validating all the effort I have put in.

Lee Shi Tian
============


![](https://media.wizards.com/2015/events/ptfrf/top8_tian.jpg)

**What Constructed deck are you playing and why?**


Burn. Metagame call. I felt sad dropping my Steam Vents, but they just can’t beat Overgrown Tomb.


**What Modern deck, other than the one you’re playing, impressed you the most this weekend?**


Infect. If Kevin Chew had qualified for this Pro Tour, we would have probably had the deck as well.


  



Both Abzan. Draft one was Black-Green based.


Draft two was White-Green based—Fatties + Tricks.


**What would winning the Pro Tour mean to you?**


A dream coming true—which is hard for a Hong Kong-er.

White-Black Tokens.

Jeskai Flyers was decent; had a lot of bounce.

I would get to play more Pro Tours. I love playing against the best in the world.
