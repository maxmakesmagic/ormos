### Simon Nielsen

**Age:** 23


**Occupation:** Former Linguistics student


**Hometown:** Slagelse, Denmark


**Previous *Magic* accomplishments:**


Gold pro by exactsies two years in a row, three Grand Prix Top 8s, Pro Tour Sydney Top 16. Also, didn't sleep at all between Saturday and Sunday.


**What deck did you play this weekend, and why did you choose it?**


Jeskai Gift. I spent the week between GPs in lovely Annecy, France, without Internet. So with no tech to rely on, I just chose what I knew best. Deck is good, just not well positioned.


**What was the best card in your main deck, and why?**


Can I say [God-Pharaoh's Gift](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=God-Pharaoh%27s+Gift) bringing back [Angel of Invention](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Angel+of+Invention)? On turn four. Every game.


**What was the best card out of your sideboard, and why?**


I honestly didn't really use my sideboard. Nine of the cards I never brought in.

**What deck did you play this weekend, and why did you choose it?**


I chose White-Blue Approach because it has a great matchup versus Temur and other energy decks.


**What was the best card in your main deck, and why?**


[Approach of the Second Sun](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Approach+of+the+Second+Sun). Because it makes you win the game second time you cast it.


**What was the best card out of your sideboard, and why?**


The best card in my sideboard is [Regal Caracal](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Regal+Caracal) because it gains a lot of advantage versus aggro decks.

Four Grand Prix Top 8s.


**What deck did you play this weekend, and why did you choose it?**


Blue-Black Control. It is well positioned against decks which aren't mono-red.


**What was the best card in your main deck, and why?**


[The Scarab God](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=The+Scarab+God). It's the main reason to play this deck.

[Kalitas, Traitor of Ghet](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kalitas%2C+Traitor+of+Ghet). It gives you a chance against mono-red.

Red-White Vehicles, because I got some good results with it on *Magic Online* and I think it's well positioned right now.


**What was the best card in your main deck, and why?**


[Aethersphere Harvester](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aethersphere+Harvester), because it's really hard to kill, really good to have, and really easy to crew.


**What was the best card out of your sideboard, and why?**


[Archangel Avacyn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Archangel+Avacyn). Really impactful card in the mirror and against Temur.

**What was the best card out of your sideboard, and why?**


[Gideon, Ally of Zendikar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gideon%2C+Ally+of+Zendikar). Games slow down after sideboarding and Gideon is especially good then.
