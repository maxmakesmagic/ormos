They came, they saw, they conquered! Three national championships from three different continents saw champions crowned this past weekend, and **magicthegathering.com** brought you all the details live! Check out the Top 8 deck lists from Australia, Japan, and Spain to find out what the world's best decided to bring to the table with the release of ***Magic** 2010,* and as an extra bonus take a look at what Singapore mustered for its National Championship too! Of course, we've also got the latest from **Magic Online** and the Pro Tour–Austin Qualifier deck lists for you to peruse as well.


Enjoy!
