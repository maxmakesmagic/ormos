We asked a couple of players what they believe to be the reason for Jeskai's fall from grace—from one of the most succesful decks at the Pro Tour two weeks ago to barely being represented in the Top 16 at Grand Prix Los Angeles last weekend.


Why did Jeskai Crash So Badly at Grand Prix Los Angeles?

***Thoralf Severin:** That's actually a good question. It probably never was as good as the Pro Tour results suggested in the first place. And players are probably much better playing against it now, using their painlands more sparingly for example. Also, [Siege Rhino](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Siege+Rhino) is everywhere.*

***Matej Zatlkaj:** Good question. I think the deck is still strong. It's probably a combination of shifts in the metagame and the fact that so far Jeskai players haven't really adapted the deck very well to the new environment. It's difficult to build right and hard to play correctly too.*

***Oliver Polak-Rottmann:** I believe too many players tried to mix different versions of the deck. Jeskai is a ridiculously complex deck and very easy to misbuild. I have no idea how the deck should be built nowadays.*

***Denniz Rachid:** Jeskai, like Abzan, is a pretty generic deck, but while Abzan employs all sorts of different tools, Jeskai is much easier to answer. Tempo strategies in general are. So basically two decks came out of the Pro Tour, one easy to answer, one very difficult. And that's exactly what has happened.*
