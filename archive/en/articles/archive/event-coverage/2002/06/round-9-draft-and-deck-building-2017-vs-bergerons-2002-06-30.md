For first team rochester draft of day, 2017 (featuring David Rood, Elijah Pollock and Guillaume Daoust in the A, B, C seats respectively) squared off against Bergerons (with Ken Ho, Brian Kibler and Ben Rubin) in a battle to stay in contention for the top four. Brian offered to arm wrestle Elijah for choice of who starts the draft, but Mr. Pollock declined and instead opted to roll a die. His team won the roll, and the draft began with Elijah himself opening the first pack. Both teams followed the standard draft rules of this format: The black deck goes in the "A" seat since *Torment* feeds that seat the most, and the white deck goes in the "C" seat since *Judgment* does the same. 

Here are some of the assorted highlights of the draft:

In the third pack, the Bergerons opened a second [Wild Mongrel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Mongrel), but opted to give it to Ben Rubin instead of Brian Kibler. Afterwards they said that they had hoped to draft a Red/White deck in the seat where Ben sat, but the red cards just weren't coming and there was a glut of good green cards throughout the draft.

In pack four, Ken Ho insisted on taking [Pardic Firecat](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pardic+Firecat) and [Halberdier](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Halberdier) on the wheel, although his teammates wanted him to take a [Last Rites](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Last+Rites) instead. Although the [Last Rites](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Last+Rites) wasn't played, they were obviously concerned with the power of this discard spell (playing both with and against it) compared to the easily killed 3/1 first striker.

2017 's red/black deck seemed to be in trouble right up until the end of the draft, with Ken's deck easily outmatching David's. Fortunately for the 2017's, David was gifted with the absolutely huge [Treacherous Vampire](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treacherous+Vampire) and [Masked Gorgon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Masked+Gorgon) in the last three packs, giving him a total of three huge creatures (including a [Carrion Wurm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Carrion+Wurm) from *Torment*). 

While we're talking multiples, Ben Rubin ended up with three [Shieldmage Advocate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shieldmage+Advocate)s, while Ken had a grand total of twenty-eight mana worth of [Ember Shot](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ember+Shot)s he could cast in his match. When asked 'how many [Ember Shot](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ember+Shot)s are too many?', his team replied that three would be pushing it, and four out of the question. Two was the number, and that was that. "It functions a lot like [Morbid Hunger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Morbid+Hunger). It's one more mana but it draws you a card and can be used as an instant to stop tricks. I've splashed for three before in my draft decks", said Brian Kibler.
