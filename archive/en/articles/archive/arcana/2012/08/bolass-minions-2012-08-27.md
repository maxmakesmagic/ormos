N[Nicol Bolas, Planeswalker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nicol+Bolas%2C+Planeswalker) is, of course, in ***Magic** 2013*.

Alexander Gregory](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&artist=%5B%22D.%20Alexander%20Gregory%22%5D)


But it isn't like Nicol Bolas is a lone dragon, standing without friends in a cold and unfeeling core set. Both an [Augur](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Augur) and a [Disciple](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Disciple) stand by, each showing the horns of Nicol Bolas to show where their loyalties lie.

It can be a little hard to see the horns on [Disciple of Bolas](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Disciple+of+Bolas) at card size, but when the art is blown up, it's on the disciple's torso.


But the horns aren't the only symbol of Nicol Bolas being carried around ***Magic** 2013*. The chest armor worn by [Augur of Bolas](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Augur+of+Bolas) matches the armor on [Nicol Bolas, Planeswalker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nicol+Bolas%2C+Planeswalker). And Nicol Bolas, the Augur, and the Disciple all have a distinctive strip of fabric draped over their shoulders. And that brings us to [Mindclaw Shaman](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mindclaw+Shaman).

Not only does [Mindclaw Shaman](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mindclaw+Shaman) have the fabric and the armor, but even the Viashino's horns reflect Nicol Bolas's distinctive shape!
