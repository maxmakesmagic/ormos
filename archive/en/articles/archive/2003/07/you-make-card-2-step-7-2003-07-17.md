The people have spoken and You Make the Card #2 will feature **Mechanic A**. The card was given a temporary design name by its creator, Ralph Tice. (The complete list of mechanic creators will come in a future article.) Don't worry, you'll all have a chance to give it a real name later in the process.

Here’s how the vote turned out (get a refresher on the wording of each mechanic [here](/en/node/630541)):

| **Total** | 8563 | 100.00% |

While we give the Tomato development team some time to play with Gazarsgo’s Plow, we’re going to move onto the creative side of the card. As with the first You Make the Card, we’re going to start by creating the card concept. For those of you that weren’t involved last time, or simply don’t remember, here’s a little crash course in card concepts:


A card concept basically tells the artist what the card is, giving him or her enough information to create the card art. Now, in the past, these were very specific, especially during the *Weatherlight* Saga, in order to convey key plot points and to keep characters consistent. But in the current era, Creative Text is trying simply to create an interesting mix of creatures that give the environment a unique flavor.


As a quick reminder, here are the do’s and don’ts of card concepting:


### A good concept should:


* Convey just enough information about the creature to get a proper depiction.
* Be free of unnecessary detail that the artist could create on his/her own.
* Give the artist a general idea of how the card’s abilities work. If it’s a direct damage spell, is it fire, lava, or lightning? If it’s a creature that regenerates, how is that generally reflected in its physical form? For example, a red Wizard who taps to deal one damage to a creature or player might have a concept that reads, “a red Wizard who has the ability to spit balls of plasma.” In fact, remember that not all **Magic** artists know the first thing about the game. You’ll need to be clear and avoid jargon.
* Be simple. Generally, we’ve found that the fewer people and things you require with your concept, the better the art is. That’s because, with a creature card, the artist has only one thing to focus on and make impressive: the creature being depicted.
* Be appropriate to the game in general. While you may like really disgusting art, there are others who don’t. Be sure to keep some amount of taste.

### A good concept should *not*:


* Micromanage the artist. That means no camera angles, no specific description that forces the artist into certain corners (the Wizard has red hair, a goatee, a red cloak with purple polka dots, etc. etc.), no description of action or location. In the red Wizard example above, we just say that the wizard *can* spit balls of plasma. We leave the decision of whether or not to depict this up to the artist. Which details are necessary, and which are micromanagement? Use your own best judgment. If it’s not needed to express what the card is and what it does, don’t include it. For example, if you were concepting [Crush of Wurms](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crush+of+Wurms), it’s very important to the concept to have three wurms in the art, because that’s what the card produces. Requesting that they all be eating centaurs, though, is unnecessary detail.
* Violate the “flavor” of the card or the color it’s in. If you’re trying to concept a blue card, you shouldn't have it use fire as a weapon.
* Bend over backwards to work in every aspect of the card’s abilities. If you focus too much on trying to visually depict each aspect of the card, you’re going to come up with an unfocused mess. Decide what the most important things about the card are, and concentrate on those. Let the artist do the rest.
* Be too long. Since the artists may not know the game as well as you do, and since their schedules are usually very full, they don’t have the time or knowledge to go through a complex or detailed concept.

The last point is especially important, because we’re going to limit your card concept to *twenty-five words or less*. I addition, you only get one entry, so make it count! Let your imagination run wild, and good luck!


The deadline is midnight Wednesday, July 30. We will select 5-10 of the best ones and put them to a vote! Remember: one entry per person and no more than 25 words!


Have fun!
