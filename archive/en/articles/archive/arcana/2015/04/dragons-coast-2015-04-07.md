We're serious about our Dragons here at Wizards of the Coast. Super serious. So serious, our office is a bit lousy with them. So, in honor of Dragons Week, I thought I'd give you a small tour of just how dragony we have dragoned our headquarters.



First up is the one everyone already knows: Mitzy, the Lobby Dragon.

Mitzy is well known by now, but did you know Mitzy loves its mother?

We also like to go highbrow with our Dragon imagery, with numerous pieces of Dragon art hanging around the office. Here are two.

Wizards also makes another game you might have heard of: *Dungeons & Dragons*. That means our office gets to show off tons of cool *D&D*-related art pieces put together by some pretty talented folk.

Finally, we've put up a number of really cool murals around the office, some more Dragony than others. Naturally, Nicol Bolas has a spot on one of our murals.

And here you can see [Hellkite Igniter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hellkite+Igniter) on our wall. And just so you can get a sense of how big and beautiful these images are, Community Manager Sean Gibbons for scale!
