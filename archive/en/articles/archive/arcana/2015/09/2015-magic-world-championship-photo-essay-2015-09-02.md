Battle for Zendikar *is looking to be an excellent, excellent expansion. Wil Wheaton approves! The immensely-popular internet celebrity and much-revered TV personality shows off one of the biggest and baddest commons to be ever printed in* Magic*'s 22-year history!*

*Our 24 superstars smile for the camera and get ready for their biggest tournament of the season. They'll pit their wits against each other to earn copious Pro Points, claim the lion's share of the $150,000 prize purse, and to ultimately clinch the prestigious World Champion title!*
