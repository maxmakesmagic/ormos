Welcome to the first week of [Selecting *Ninth Edition*](http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=mtgcom/columnarchive&column=SelectingNinthEdition), where you get to put on your R&D hat and help build **Magic**'s next Core Set. For more information, check out the [Selecting *Ninth Edition* home page](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/selecting9e/home).


To kick off the voting this week, we present two green monsters. Both weighing in at a hefty 5/5 and costed at four, they're bargain fatties any way you cut it. [Emperor Crocodile](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Emperor+Crocodile) is a splashable beatstick for creature-heavy decks. The resume of [Jade Leech](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jade+Leech) includes tournament play in [Fires of Yavimaya](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fires+of+Yavimaya) decks. Which will you choose to put into *Ninth Edition*?
