Go to the *Theros* Prerelease and experience the newest **Magic: The Gathering** set a week before it goes on sale!


The *Theros* Prerelease presents players with a special opportunity to open a Prerelease Pack and begin their journey down the Hero's Path. There are five Prerelease Packs to choose from; each color has a heroic path: White – Honor, Blue – Wisdom, Black – Ambition, Red – Battle, and Green – Might.


The *Theros* Prelease will also be players' first opportunity to earn a Hero Card, which they can use to Face the Hydra at *Theros* Game Day. To learn more about the Hero's Path, go to [MTGHerosPath.com](http://mtgherospath.com/).
