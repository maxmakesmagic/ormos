### Shahar Shenhar


**Age:** 19  
**Hometown:** Jerusalem, Israel / Sacramento, CA, USA  
**Occupation:** Pro *Magic* Player

**Invitation Source**: Top Pro Points, At-Large  
**Lifetime Pro Points**: 112  
**Lifetime Winnings:** $41.650


**Professional Magic Accomplishments**:


* Grand Prix San Diego 2011 champion
* Grand Prix Salt Lake City 2012 champion
* Grand Prix Houston 2013 champion
* 2013 Israel National champion

### National Team Appearances: 0


The youngest player invited to the 2013 *Magic* World Championship, Shahar Shenhar has an incredibly bright future ahead of him if the results of his fairly young career are anything to judge by. Of all of the players invited to the World Championship, Shenhar has the highest career win percentage. He has a trio of Grand Prix wins already in his career, all earned with only five Grand Prix Top 8s. He has one of the highest median finishes of any player in the game, and all of this has happened before his 20th birthday!


Playing competitive *Magic* since the first time he held a card, Shenhar has moved quickly up through the professional ranks. Now traveling full time for *Magic*, it is rare to attend a Grand Prix these days and not see Shenhar in attendance. In fact, he has spent more time traveling for *Magic* than at his home in Israel over the last year.


This diligence has paid off though, as recently as Grand Prix Houston, where Shenhar made it look easy, defeating even the mighty Hall of Famer Shuhei Nakamura on his way to the title. Thanks to his success, Shenhar has fallen in and become good friends with many of the other top pros in the game today. This is a busy weekend for him, as he will be doing his part to represent Israel as the top player in the country in the World *Magic* Cup as well. Still, if Shenhar has proven anything, he can handle the pressure despite his young age.

A self-described "non-competitive player," Ben Stark plays the game of *Magic* for one reason only: he loves it. And does he ever play it well. Long viewed by many of the top players in the world as one of the finest Limited minds to play the game, Stark has shattered that mold to become one of the most respected *players* in the game today.


This south Florida native has been playing the game for an incredibly long time, making his Pro Tour debut over a decade ago. While he has gone through fits and starts over the course of his career, he has really turned it on in recent years, winning a Pro Tour and making the Top 8 of another. Over the full duration of his career, he has earned titles in events of all formats, showcasing his utter grasp on the game, and a skill that goes far beyond a simple mastery of Limited.


Currently a member of incredibly powerful Team Channelfireball, Stark has seen his game continue to rise. An avid user of *Magic Online*, Stark is always on the lookout for an opportunity to draft, be it at an event, at home, or on a plane on the way to a Grand Prix. This constant desire to play—combined with surrounding himself with a number of the greatest players in the game—has paid off immensely, helping Stark to earn his spot here at the World Championship.

**What is your favorite Magic deck?**  
[Psychatog](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psychatog)


**Who is your favorite Magic player to watch?**  

I'm not a big watcher but back when I first started playing in Pro Tours in 1999, it would be Finkel.


**What's your favorite format and why?**  

Booster Draft, All the games are different. I feel like in Constructed, once you have played 10-20 games of a matchup, you have experienced everything you are going to experience in that matchup. In Limited, every game is different.


**What is your favorite draft format?**  
*Champions of Kamigawa*. It's the best set ever by miles.


**On average, how many hours of Magic do you play each week?**  

N/A


**Who taught you how to play Magic?**  

My friend Jared in the sixth grade.


**What was the first Magic deck you built?**  

I used to play a local tournament every Saturday with my RUG deck when I was in 6th grade. I was on a limited budget then so every time I made Top 3 and got store credit, I would buy another dual land for the deck or things like that. It played [Kird Ape](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kird+Ape)s, [Serendib Efreet](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Serendib+Efreet)s, [Lightning Bolt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt)s, and [Giant Growth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Giant+Growth)s.


**At which local game store have you've played the most Magic?**  

For the past few years I've played almost exclusively at Cool Stuff Games in South Florida. Growing up, stores down here usually lasted a few years and then closed, so I went to a lot of different ones.


**What's your biggest edge going into the World Championship?**  

My biggest edge is probably going to be *Magic* 2014 draft, the newest draft format. I'm pretty good at solving new draft formats quickly.


**Who or what is your nemesis?**  

Brian Kibler, who is in this World Championship, and even though he is a friend, I can't say I was rooting for him to make it once I knew I was going to be in it. I've never beaten him and we have played a lot. And we have played more in Limited than Constructed. He just always beats me!


**Where is your favorite place Magic has taken you?**  

Sydney, Australia for Worlds in 2002.


**What does Magic mean to you?**  
*Magic* is a great game. Games expand your mind by teaching how you to analyze things. I don't think I would be half the person I am today if I hadn't started playing *Magic* when I was 11.


**We're going out for food. What do you want to eat?**  

Hate to be cliché, but pizza is probably my favorite food. I like pretty much everything though. I also really like sushi and that's probably more of a "going out for food" answer.


**What do you enjoy doing when you're not playing Magic?**  

I play basketball and watch all the HBO television series. Game of Thrones is the best one but True [Blood](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blood) and Boardwalk Empire are also very good.


**And finally... rock, paper, or scissors?**  

Paper. Scissors is going too deep.

Ladies and gentlemen, your 2013 Player of the Year, Josh Utter-Leyton.


Utter-Leyton's possession of the title wasn't set until late into the closing rounds of Pro Tour *Dragon's Maze*, nervously watching as Tom Martell made his push for Top 8, but falling narrowly short. With the weight of the world off his shoulders, Utter-Leyton began to gush, incredulous that he was the new Player of the Year.


Having described his time in last year's Players Championship as "the greatest tournament experience he's ever had," Utter-Leyton was ecstatic at the opportunity to give a repeat performance. Earning his spot last year by virtue of his position as one of the top ranked players in the world, Utter-Leyton's calling card has been his utter consistency, seemingly never posting a finish outside of the Top 64. A core member of Team ChannelFireball, Utter-Leyton is surrounded by some of the best minds the game has to offer, and admits that it has been a major factor in his improvement as a player.


Another fairly quiet player once in the game, Utter-Leyton can always be located thanks to his signature headphones and cool demeanor. He can go from stoic to effusive in an instant. Despite being relatively taciturn, when Utter-Leyton speaks, people listen. This is why his articles are some of the most well-received of all of those posted on channelfireball.com.


**What is your favorite Magic card?**

**At which local game store have you've played the most Magic?**

**What does Magic mean to you?**  

I love playing games and *Magic* is the best game I have ever played. More than just entertainment, though, *Magic* has entrenched itself as an enormous part of my life. Preparing for, traveling to, and playing in tournaments is how I spend the majority of my time. It's also a huge part of my social life, as almost all of my closest friends I know through *Magic*.
