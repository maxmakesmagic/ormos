Welcome to another edition of [Sketches](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/fullarchive&tablefilter=sketch)! For Elf Week, we're going to take a look at how [Seedcradle Witch](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seedcradle+Witch) came to be.

### 1. Art Description

Here's the original art description:


> 
> **Location:** A field of nettle-wheat near the border of a creepy forest  
> **Action:** Show an elf "nature-priestess" of your design, male or female. He/she is a healer and a master of herbalism, a mage who gets his/her power from nature. Show this figure casting a spell; perhaps leaves made of light swirl around his/her 

### 2. Sketches

Steven Belledin received that art description and gave this to the creative team for their approval:

![Seedcradle Witch sketch](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/mtgcom/arcana1000/1659_sketch.jpg)The sketch looked promising, and Steven was given the go-ahead to proceed.

### 3. Final Art

In the end, Steven took the bottom sketch and filled it out nicely, as you can see.
