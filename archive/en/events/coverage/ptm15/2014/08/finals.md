Winning a Pro Tour means earning a few things: Immediate promotion to Platinum status with the benefit carrying through the next Pro Points season, a $40,000 cash prize, and a chair in that year's ending World Championship.


No big deal, right?



**The Players and Decks**




 Ivan Floch had long been one of the strongest players without a Pro Tour Top 8. Adding the Sunday feather to his cap was a hurdle a long time coming for him. Taking his White-Blue Control deck through the paces meant both playing it efficiently – the deck could take a lot of time to win if you weren't quick enough during timed rounds – and correctly. Floch had deftly handled numerous threats, thanks to a suite of removal, [Quicken](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Quicken)-powered sorcery like [Planar Cleansing](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Planar+Cleansing) and [Supreme Verdict](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Supreme+Verdict), and [Elixir of Immortality](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elixir+of+Immortality) to ensure it all happened as many times as it needed to.




 Jackson Cunningham made it farther than most players dream to in their first Pro Tour. Having secured Silver status in the Pro Players Club just by winning his way into the Finals, the best that Cunningham could do now would be to win, warping to Platinum and a seat at the most prestigious tournament of the year. His White-Green Aggro deck had proven resilient, thanks to [Voice of Resurgence](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Voice+of+Resurgence) and [Ajani, Caller of the Pride](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ajani%2C+Caller+of+the+Pride): Both provided staying power against removal and explosive potential damage, finding wins when opponents otherwise felt safe.




 Both players had put on a show making it to the last match of Pro Tour *Magic 2015*. Many games ended up swinging unexpectedly, and even competitors rooted for each other.




 "I was thinking how I would beat Planeswalker Jund with three [Rakdos's Return](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rakdos%27s+Return)s and suddenly I'm rooting for you," Floch said.






*While Cunningham's first Pro Tour has been a memorable one, Floch came too far to back down in the finals.*
