What deck are you playing and why? What was your MVC (Most Valuable Card)?  

Green-White Tokens, because it is efficient and powerful. My best card was [Hangarback Walker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hangarback+Walker).  
  
**What does making this Top 8 mean to you?**  

It is pretty exciting to be on the Pro Tour for the first time.  
  
**Emrakul, the Promised End—How cool is that thing?!**  

13 out of 13, looks pretty promising.

Bant Humans. Didn't really know what to play and teammate Mark Jacobson gave the team a Bant Humans deck guide, so, thanks Marky Mark!!! <3  
  
**What does making this Top 8 mean to you?**  

Potentially a lot. It gets me closer and closer to Platinum. If I win the tournament, I'll be locked Platinum.  
  
**Emrakul, the Promised End—How cool is that thing?!**  

Deece.

[Green-White Tokens]. This time, [Hangarback Walker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hangarback+Walker)  
  
**What does making this Top 8 mean to you?**  

Feels good to defend the home turf.  
  
**Emrakul, the Promised End—How cool is that thing?!**  

Kinda.

**Previous Magic Accomplishments:**  

Top 8 SCG Invitational, occasional FNM win  
  
**What deck are you playing and why? What was your MVC (Most Valuable Card)?**  

Bant Company. Because Jonathan Hickerson told me it was unfair.  

Hmm … [Collected Company](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Collected+Company).  
  
**What does making this Top 8 mean to you?**  

Means a trip to Hawai'i worth!  

Good to have a chance to redeem my poor Madrid performance.  
  
**Emrakul, the Promised End—How cool is that thing?!**  

Very. He's great and I'll try very hard to cast him. Too hard, probably.

**Occupation:** Dogwalker  
  
**Previous Magic Accomplishments:**  

Once broadcast powerful wizardry on the internet.  
  
**What deck are you playing and why? What was your MVC (Most Valuable Card)?**  

Bant Humans (with [Eldrazi Displacer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eldrazi+Displacer))  

Ben Feingersh told me to put Displacer in my deck and it defeats the entire Green-White deck in a single combat if it lives.  
  
**What does making this Top 8 mean to you?**  

I get to feel unreasonably responsible for my extreme good fortune.  
  
**Emrakul, the Promised End—How cool is that thing?!**  

Seven out of Ten.

**Hometown:** Richmond, Kentucky  
  
**Occupation:** Server/Manager at my Dad's board game cafe.  
  
**Previous Magic Accomplishments:**  

2nd place — TCG 50k  

4th place — TCG 50k  
  
**What deck are you playing and why? What was your MVC (Most Valuable Card)?**  

Green-White Tokens. Because everyone told me to play it if I wanted to win. The [Nissa, Vastwood Seer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nissa%2C+Vastwood+Seer) in the main was amazing. [Archangel Avacyn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Archangel+Avacyn) is just too good to not be the MVC though.  
  
**What does making this Top 8 mean to you?**  

It means the world to me. I have wanted to be on the Pro Tour ever since I started playing at 8 years old.  
  
**Emrakul, the Promised End—How cool is that thing?!**  

He is all right. Will be fun to see if anyone breaks it. But I'm not a fan personally.

**Occupation:** Ski Instructor/Recent College Grad  
  
**Previous Magic Accomplishments:**  

SCG Standard Open Champion, a couple of GP Top 25s.  
  
**What deck are you playing and why? What was your MVC (Most Valuable Card)?**  

Bant Humans – Most Valuable Card was [Archangel Avacyn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Archangel+Avacyn). People think you have [Collected Company](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Collected+Company) or [Ojutai's Command](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ojutai%27s+Command) and they end up not playing around one of the most powerful cards in the format.  
  
**What does making this Top 8 mean to you?**  

I finally get to play on the Pro Tour and test my skills against the best in the world.  
  
**Emrakul, the Promised End—How cool is that thing?!**  

I'm not a big fan of giant Eldrazi, so not very cool.

**What deck are you playing and why? What was your MVC (Most Valuable Card)?**  

Sultai, by Brad Nelson  

I like a bunch of lands in the deck, but I guess [Nissa, Vastwood Seer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nissa%2C+Vastwood+Seer) and [Tireless Tracker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tireless+Tracker).  
  
**What does making this Top 8 mean to you?**  

Well, I never before traveled to the US for Grand Prix. Until Charlotte and Minneapolis to search for points, I made four there, and I decided to go to Pittsburgh to try to reach Gold which I did!  

So … Insanely happy!!! Thx for my girlfriend, family and friends for all the support!  
  
**Emrakul, the Promised End—How cool is that thing?!**  

The art is the nuts!!!  

Very cool regardless of playability. Also love how Liliana clashes against her! [in the *Eldritch Moon* trailer]
