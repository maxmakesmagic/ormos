The *Magic Online* Championship is almost upon us. From Friday, May 15, to Sunday, May 17, a group of the best players on *Magic Online* will come together to compete for a share of more than $100,000 in cash prizes and, ultimately, the prestigious title of *Magic Online* Champion.

Lars Dam
========



### Defending *Magic Online* Champion



**When did you start playing *Magic*?**


Back when *Ice Age* was new.


**What is your favorite format to play and why?**


Limited. It's just more fun than Constructed after the first 30-40 games.


**What hobbies do you have aside from *Magic*?**


I like to play all kind of games.


**How long have you been on *Magic Online*?**


I started playing *Magic Online* the year it came out. I think that is 14 years ago now.


**What is your favorite *Magic* Card and why?**


[Winter Orb](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Winter+Orb) and [Rising Waters](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Rising+Waters). I like breaking the symmetry of those cards. [Imagecrafter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Imagecrafter) and [Tidal Visionary](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tidal+Visionary) in Limited—great tricksy small creatures.


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&multiverseid=159277)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=159277) [![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&multiverseid=21304)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=21304) [![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&multiverseid=39884)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=39884) [![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&multiverseid=22977)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=22977)


**What deck archetype do you HATE to play against?**


Overpowered creature decks like [Tarmogoyf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf) and [Siege Rhino](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Siege+Rhino). Playing against them just doesn’t lead to fun situations.


**What colors do you think best represent you?**


Blue and red.


**What are you doing to prepare for the *Magic Online* Championship?**


Play a bit on *Magic Online* and use the testing from the Pro Tours [*Dragons of Tarkir*](http://magic.wizards.com/en/content/pro-tour-dragons-tarkir-event-information) and [*Fate Reforged*](http://magic.wizards.com/en/content/event-information-pro-tour-fate-reforged) to help me choose for Constructed.


**Who is your favorite *Magic* player to watch?**


At the moment, Trey van Cleave. Overall, probably Noah Sandler.


**If you had a theme song that played every time you entered a room, what would it be?**


"Pokerface," by Lady Gaga.


**What record do you think you’ll have at the end of the event?**


7-7.


**What is one fact about you that might surprise people?**


I hate to gamble.


**What other *Magic* results do you have?**


Ninth place at Worlds 2004 or 2005 (I cant remember which) and 2nd at Danish Nationals the same year. I was the *Magic Online* Champion last year. Also, lifetime 4-0 record against Kai Budde in premier events :)


**How many hours a week do you think you spend on *Magic Online*?**


A lot less than I used to—3-7.


**What would winning the *Magic Online* Championship mean to you?**


It would obviously hard to complain if it happens again, but travelling and testing for every Pro Tour is a time-eating machine. Even so, it would still be pretty awesome to defend the title.

### Qualified Via Season 4 Modern 2014 MOCS Finals



**When did you start playing *Magic*?**


I started playing *Magic* right before *Time Spiral* block was released, with my sister and brother. We used to bash *Ninth Edition* starter decks against one another until I graduated to Friday Night *Magic* for the next five years. You aren’t a true Friday Night *Magic* player until you give someone an [Immortal Coil](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Immortal+Coil) with a [Bazaar Trader](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bazaar+Trader).


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&multiverseid=175125)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=175125) [![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&multiverseid=198364)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=198364)


**What is your favorite format to play and why?**


My favorite format in *Magic* would have to be Legacy. My loyal [Nimble Mongeese](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=29784) have gotten me to two Pro Tours. Plus, how can you say no to cards like [Wasteland](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wasteland), [Brainstorm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brainstorm), and [Force of Will](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Force+of+Will).


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&multiverseid=29784)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=29784) [![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&multiverseid=397531)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=397531) [![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&multiverseid=382224)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=382224) [![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&multiverseid=382943)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=382943)


**What hobbies do you have aside from *Magic*?**


Outside of *Magic* my hobbies include… well, *Magic* is pretty much my only hobby now. I was a Boy Scout in high school and eventually I became and Eagle Scout so I suppose you can count that.


**How long have you been on *Magic Online*?**


I have had a *Magic Online* account for a number of years but didn’t start playing a lot until around 18 months ago in which I ended the year in the top 20 in Constructed Qualifer Points. It would be fair to say that, after I got a taste, I jumped head first into *Magic Online*.


**What is your favorite *Magic* Card and why?**


In the sense of having fun it’s easily [Hidetsugu's Second Rite](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hidetsugu%27s+Second+Rite). You haven’t lived until you have had to make weird attacks or even use [Grove of the Burnwillows](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grove+of+the+Burnwillows) to get someone at exactly 10 life.


In a competitive world it’s [Tarmogoyf](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tarmogoyf) for sure. My refusal to give up the #RUGLyfe led to everything I love about *Magic*.


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&multiverseid=88818)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=88818) [![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&multiverseid=287335)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=287335) [![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&multiverseid=370404)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=370404)


**What deck archetype do you HATE to play against?**


Bogles, Dredge, Affinty, Burn, Tron, and [Show and Tell](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Show+and+Tell) are likely the decks I hate the most. They make me feel like my cards don’t matter and there was nothing I could do to change that. I would rather draw sideboard cards than play well against these decks.


**What colors do you think best represent you?**


Red, blue, green. This question was too easy.


**What are you doing to prepare for the *Magic Online* Championship?**


Play test on *Magic Online*. Only real way to get in the most amount of games on my own schedule.


**Who is your favorite *Magic* player to watch?**


I am fond of my own replays. As for watching other players, I have no true preference.


**If you had a theme song that played every time you entered a room, what would it be?**


"Hey Stephen," by Taylor Swift.


**What record do you think you’ll have at the end of the event?**


Whatever it takes to get to the World Championships.


**What is one fact about you that might surprise people?**


I have played more rounds of Legacy than games of Standard and Limited combined in the past two years.


**What other *Magic* results do you have?**


Top 8 in my first Legacy Grand Prix, missed on tiebreakers in the second, won a Star City Games Open with 4 [Kird Ape](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kird+Ape) in my deck…in 2015.


**How many hours a week do you think you spend on *Magic Online*?**


I don’t have to answer that. Just know it’s enough to win a *Magic Online* Championship Season Finals, plus.


**What would winning the *Magic Online* Championship mean to you?**


Winning would mean a chance to knock Shahar off his throne and get back onto the Pro Tour. I have never played *Magic* for money, but I wouldn’t say no to $25,000.

Timothy Divelbliss
==================



### Qualified Via Season 12 *Vintage Masters* Sealed 2014 MOCS Finals



**When did you start playing *Magic*?**


I started playing around 1997. I remember my first starter as *Fifth Edition* and my first booster as *Weatherlight*.


**What is your favorite format to play and why?**


I like playing Limited formats. I like to draft whatever the current block is on *Magic Online*. I just have more fun playing Limited over Constructed.


**What hobbies do you have aside from *Magic*?**


I am an avid hunter, particularly deer hunting. I play a lot of other games. I also like to go to concerts—I'm a big fan of Say Anything.


**How long have you been on *Magic Online*?**


I've been playing since 1997 when my younger brother showed me the game. I took several long breaks during that time. I came back to the game and starting playing *Magic Online* around three years ago.


**What is your favorite *Magic* Card and why?**


My favorite card is [Jace, the Mind Sculptor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace%2C+the+Mind+Sculptor). It does everything I want it to do and Planeswalkers are awesome.


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&multiverseid=382979)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=382979)


**What deck archetype do you HATE to play against?**


I hate playing against combo decks that pretty much play solitaire, like Eggs and Amulet Bloom for example. I'm glad those types of decks exist—I'd just rather not play against them.


**What colors do you think best represent you?**


A while back I took the clan test on the Planeswalker Points [website](https://www.wizards.com/magic/planeswalkerpoints). It said I was Gruul, and I agree.


**What are you doing to prepare for the *Magic Online* Championship?**


Right now I am just playing a lot of Standard and drafting a lot.


**Who is your favorite *Magic* player to watch?**


I like watching Luis Scott-Vargas a lot. He seems to pull wins out of thin air. He's also pretty funny when he is streaming.


**If you had a theme song that played every time you entered a room, what would it be?**


"On Top of the World," by Imagine Dragons.


**What record do you think you’ll have at the end of the event?**


I'm going to be optimistic and guess x-4 or x-5.


**What is one fact about you that might surprise people?**


I hate coconut.


**What other *Magic* results do you have?**


None really. A good many Pro Tour Qualifer Top 8s. Winning the Last Chance Qualifier was my first time qualifying for the Pro Tour.


**How many hours a week do you think you spend on *Magic Online*?**


Since I got into the *Magic Online* Championship, I've been playing at least 20 hours a week on *Magic Online*.


**What would winning the *Magic Online* Championship mean to you?**


It would be an honor—I would be in very good company. It would also mean my wife will let me take a year off to play *Magic*, and that is something I would really enjoy.

Maxime Martin
=============



### Qualified Via 2014 MOCS Player of the Year Event



**When did you start playing *Magic*?**


Back in 1997, with the release of *Fifth Edition*. I was in high school, and a friend of mine introduced me to *Magic*.


**What is your favorite format to play and why?**


Probably Cube Draft and Cube Sealed, as it allows a lot of creativity while playing with very cool cards.


**What hobbies do you have aside from *Magic*?**


Kickboxing, which I practice competitively between two and four times a week.


**How long have you been on *Magic Online*?**


I created my own *Magic Online* account in 2012.


**What is your favorite *Magic* Card and why?**


[Pit Keeper](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pit+Keeper)! I developed a taste for *Magic*-based puns throughout the years, especially during the *Time Spiral* block. From there it was only a matter of choosing between BradPitKeeper and PrismaticLensArmstrong. Since I’m not a big fan of doping, the choice was obvious :)


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&multiverseid=116396)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=116396)


**What deck archetype do you HATE to play against?**


Blue draw-go control decks in Constructed.


**What colors do you think best represent you?**


Probably green. I’m a big fan of ramping mana and efficiently costed creatures. I enjoyed playing [Pod](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=218006) for the most part of 2014 and, although it stung a little, I think banning it was legit.


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&multiverseid=218006)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=218006)


**What are you doing to prepare for the *Magic Online* Championship?**


Like all online events, my preparation will consist mainly of testing with my teammate from *Magic Online*, GrinderZ Ggb (Jeremy Berthoux), in all the different formats. Since the *Magic Online* Championship is such a big deal for us, we’ve decided to launch our own website and publish articles and videos describing the journey that brought me here today.


**Who is your favorite *Magic* player to watch?**


I like Sam Pardee’s streams. He plays pretty well and uses the *Magic Online* interface swiftly and efficiently, which makes his stream very enjoyable to watch.


**If you had a theme song that played every time you entered a room, what would it be?**


"The Ecstasy of Gold," by Ennio Morricone.


**What record do you think you’ll have at the end of the event?**


The best possible (I hope!).


**What is one fact about you that might surprise people?**


A sideboarded [Feed the Clan](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Feed+the+Clan) won me the *Magic Online* Championship Series Player of the Year Event Finals!


[![](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&multiverseid=386535)](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=386535)


**What other *Magic* results do you have?**


I don’t play that many paper events, but on *Magic Online* I managed to Top 8 four *Magic Online* Championship Series events since January 2014, all in Limited (nothing very impressive yet!).


**How many hours a week do you think you spend on *Magic Online*?**


Way too many in my girlfriend’s mind! Between 20 and 30 hours a week I’d say…


**What would winning the *Magic Online* Championship mean to you?**


It would mean that I’ll play the *Magic* World Championships and next year’s *Magic Online* Championship, which would be totally awesome!

Aleksa Telarov
==============



### Qualified Via Season 11 Standard 2014 MOCS Finals



**When did you start playing *Magic*?**


I started playing when *Guildpact* came out.


**What is your favorite format to play and why?**


Probably Limited, although I like Standard more over time.


I like Limited because I always know every single trick an opponent can have (which I wouldn't say is very widespread among players), therefore, I'm able to play as optimally as I can. But I suck at drafting and my Draft decks are always a train-wreck.


As for Standard, I always loved breaking Standard and mostly trying to not play the best cards/strategy for the current Standard at the time, but rather to think outside the box and try to beat the best cards/deck/combos. That's excluding Faeries, which I played non-stop while they were Standard-legal. Most people who didn't play Faeries will probably hate me forever for admitting that :D


**What hobbies do you have aside from *Magic*?**


I enjoy participating in most sports like, swimming, water polo, football(soccer), table tennis, occasionally basketball and volleyball, throwing flying disk (frisbee), and the one that I enjoy most, a sport mostly known to our region called picigen.


Other then sports, I like travelling, collecting stuff, occasionally playing computer games, and working on my projects and incorporating ideas into them.


**How long have you been on *Magic Online*?**


I've been on *Magic Online* since the end of 2009.


**What is your favorite *Magic* Card and why?**


I don't really get attached to cards that much.


Now, don't get me wrong, I like some cards a LOT, but since I don't have an answer off the top of my head, I don't have a favorite one. My favorite cards are the ones tied to memories—the cards I've received from friends through special occasions, like my birthday, or through a great game of *Magic* against an opponent I've just met. My friends sometimes give me cards because they love me—I usually get them to sign those for me so that a part of me can go back to that moment to reminiscence about the great times we had.


**What deck archetype do you HATE to play against?**


None in particular, but if I had to choose, it would probably be Mono-Red Burn because any player on the planet, regardless of game-play skills, can beat me by throwing cards in my face. There's the everlasting "I need to top-deck a burn spell and I get it every single time!"


Other than that, I dislike when a single card defines a format, so I try to go around it. The latest example of that is Siege Rhino.


**What colors do you think best represent you?**


None. I just play the cards I enjoy and try to make them work.


**What are you doing to prepare for the *Magic Online* Championship?**


I will be testing online and playing paper *Magic*.


**Who is your favorite *Magic* player to watch?**


I immediately like a player when I see them make a great play. Unfortunately I don't have a clear answer for you. Owen Turtenwald, Matt Hoey, and Patrick Dickmann are some names off the top of my head.


**If you had a theme song that played every time you entered a room, what would it be?**


"Bad," by Michael Jackson.


**What record do you think you’ll have at the end of the event?**


Easy win.


**What is one fact about you that might surprise people?**


I'm actually really really good looking.


**What other *Magic* results do you have?**


I made Top 8 in Grand Prix Vienna, lost two win-and-ins in Grand Prix Milan, I've been a National Champion for six years now, won some big tournaments on *Magic Online*, and I've also made it to Day 2 in a bunch of Grand Prix and made Top 64 multiple times.


**How many hours a week do you think you spend on *Magic Online*?**


A lot! Five hours a day, I would say.


**What would winning the *Magic Online* Championship mean to you?**


It be a pretty big deal. Being the best *Magic Online* player for a year seems good to me! Being a Gold pro would help a lot financially since I travel to pretty much every European Grand Prix anyway. Being qualified for every Pro Tour would be a dream come true.
