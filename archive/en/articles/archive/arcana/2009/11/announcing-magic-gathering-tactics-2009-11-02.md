 "By collaborating with Wizards of the Coast, we're able to combine the strengths of both companies to develop an innovative, online, 3D game based on an extremely popular IP," said John Smedley, president, Sony Online Entertainment. "We're going to be taking the *Magic: The Gathering* Multiverse places players have never seen."

"The growing *Magic: The Gathering* community has an insatiable desire for great strategic game experiences.
