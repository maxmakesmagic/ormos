Kazuya "The Chief" Mitamura is your Pro Tour-Honolulu champion! Making his third trip to the Top 8, the Japanese player finally managed to take down the big title. Of course, there are plenty of other decks from the event to check out, including what the best minds in the game came up with when confronted with the challenge of the *Shards of Alara* Block Constructed format. On top of that we continue bringing you Regionals, Pro Tour Qualifier, and **Magic Online** Premier Event Top 8s.

Enjoy!
