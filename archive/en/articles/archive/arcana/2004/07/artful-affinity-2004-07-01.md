[Blinkmoth Infusion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blinkmoth+Infusion) untaps all your artifacts at great expense -- unless you have a ton of them. The affinity for artifacts ability is actually depicted in Alan Pollack's art of [Blinkmoth Infusion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blinkmoth+Infusion), in the form of small artifacts shown on pedestals behind the magical light shining down on the main artifact in the center.

And what is that main artifact in the center? [Gilded Lotus](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gilded+Lotus) -- a very sensible artifact to untap.
