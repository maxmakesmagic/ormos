Live Coverage of 2003 Grand Prix Hiroshima
==========================================












[日本語の取材へ](/en/node/776506)


Amateur Motokiyo Azuma has won Grand Prix – Hiroshima! Playing a forgotten deck, Enchantress, he smashed through a field populated with red beats, green-blue madness and Psychatog. He wasn't a heavy favorite to take the title, though. The Top 8 had too much star power for people to bet on the little guy. In the quarters he dispatched Tsuyoshi "Mr. Rolly" Fujita with incredible speed. In the semifinals he drew Takao Higaki, whose Tinker deck was not up to the task.


That put him head to head with Osamu Fujita, who had just narrowly escaped defeat at the hands of Korea's Jisang Kang and his Aluren deck. Fujita's deck was a red-green hybrid designed for pure speed and an advantage against other red decks. He jokingly called it "Two Deuce" (though it might be hard to resist calling it The Double Deuce), after the utility deck Three Deuce from way back. Though Fujita had all the pros pulling for him to get Grand Prix gold, the matchup against Azuma's Enchantress was nigh impossible. With consummate ease, Azuma eliminated Fujita as he had so many before him. Congratulations to Motokiyo Azuma, Grand Prix – Hiroshima Champion!
