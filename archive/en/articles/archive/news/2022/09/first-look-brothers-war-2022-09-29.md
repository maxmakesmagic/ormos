[*The Brothers' War*](https://magic.wizards.com/en/products/the-brothers-war) is the epic retelling of the most consequential event in the Multiverse. This far-reaching epic event sets in motion nearly all that *Magic* is today, including being the catalyst for unleashing the greatest evil *Magic* has ever known—the Phyrexians.


After the events of *Dominaria United*, our heroes must peer into the past to save their future, and in doing so, they reveal the true story of the clash between the brothers Urza and Mishra. Prepare yourself for an unprecedented clash that decided the fate of all living things—and may do so yet again.

A War Between Brothers
======================


Dominaria's past includes many stories, but the most formative of them is the namesake for the set: the Brothers' War. Before the timelines bled and the Multiverse itself was mended. Before the invasion of Phyrexians—the *first* invasion of Phyrexians—sundered the land. Before the Ice Age that froze the plane. (The end of the Brothers' War *is* what froze the plane.)


The events that led to repeated destruction and challenges for Dominaria began with egos in conflict and the clash of massive machines of war. These titanic weapons are featured on showcase mech basic lands: full-art mech basic lands showcase locations and the mechanical behemoths that battled there.

While there are non-full-art basic lands we'll show off later, these mech basic lands will be found in Draft, Set, and Collector Boosters.


It wouldn't be *The Brothers' War* without the brothers Urza and Mishra. The set features multiple versions of the larger-than-life legends. The pair—heroes of their own stories, and villains to the other—stand on either side of a conflict populated by legends throughout history. And no one looms larger in it than Urza. Literally.

Meld returns to capture the grandiosity that is Urza in his Planeswalker form. (To see what becomes of his brother Mishra, tune in to [twitch.tv/magic](https://www.twitch.tv/magic) on October 4 for our 30th Anniversary Kickoff Stream.)


As with the recent set, we are also releasing *The Brothers' War* Commander decks. These two decks were made with the aesthetic of traveling back in time to the battles during the namesake Brothers' War. Not only are they helmed by new versions of Urza and Mishra (in traditional foil, or with your foil-etched display commander), but *every* Magic *card in the decks features the retro frame treatment*.

Yes, every single card. New cards will be in the retro frame. Reprints will be in the retro frame (many for the first time). Lands will be in the retro frame. All of it—and here's a look at just a few of these.

For fans of the retro frame treatment, this is one Commander release you will not want to miss.


Plus, these versions of Urza and Mishra also get the typical extended-art treatment (using the modern *Magic* frame) in *The Brothers' War* Collector Boosters.

Back in Time
============


Finally, with our heroes traveling back in time, we of course wanted to go with them. To do so, we've created a series of retro artifacts from throughout *Magic*'s history, starting all the way back at *Magic*'s beginning.


![Retro frame Ivory Tower](https://media.wizards.com/2022/bro/en_UxPmjixkxd.png)![Retro frame Jalum Tome](https://media.wizards.com/2022/bro/en_s7XXkpuofo.png)

Retro frame artifact classics feature their own set symbol and can be found in Draft, Set, and Collector Boosters.



![The Brothers' War Retro Frame Artifacts set symbol](https://media.wizards.com/2022/images/daily/OfU9FN4KmoV8.png)Retro Frame Artifacts
Plus, we have one more twist in time: we've added a second, special set of retro frame artifacts with artwork that echoes a schematic one would use to build their own.

These can also generally be found in Draft, Set, and Collector Boosters.


Generally?


Great question; lazy writing device. For the first time in a *Magic* booster product, we're introducing serialized versions of cards that will list how many exist, and which one you have. For example, we're printing 500 of each serialized retro schematic—which feature what we're calling double-rainbow foiling—in *The Brothers' War* Collector Boosters. Each one will be numbered with their number out of 500, and they'll only be available in Collector Boosters! (Non-serialized schematic artwork versions will be available, too.) It's certainly an exciting time to be a collector.



![Wurmcoil Engine schematic artwork](https://media.wizards.com/2022/images/daily/QLVTLOePYv.jpg)Wurmcoil Engine | Art by: [Raymond Swanland](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?action=advanced&output=spoiler&method=visual&artist=+%5B%22Raymond%20Swanland%22%5D)
We'll dive into all the information—from epic machines of war and the battlegrounds we'll tread to the crunchy details for all the incredible cards you'll find—when we kick off our *The Brothers' War* reveals on October 27.


And if you can't wait, rest assured: we have one more *The Brothers' War* reveal up our sleeve to share thanks to our friends over at [Hasbro Pulse Con 2022](https://hasbropulse.com/pages/hasbro-pulse-con-2022). Stay tuned for their reveals so you don't miss it!
