We kick things off this week with the Pro Tour Qualifier season for Pro Tour–Honolulu. The season is mid-swing and things are really starting to heat up. We have the Extended lists from tournaments held in Madison, Columbus, Mobile, Burlington, and Rockville, the latest tech which you can expect weekly on Decks of the Week.

There are, of course, additional Extended lists for your amusement from the world of **Magic Online**, in addition to Standard, *Shards of Alara* Block Constructed, and Classic. Dozens of Top 8s mean you have literally hundreds of lists to peruse to see what the most successful players are playing at the moment. The best part? All those lists will give you a prime feel for what each format looks like prior to the release of *Conflux*! That's right, **Magic**'s newest set hits the prerelease circuit this upcoming weekend, and you can get a chance to see it in action before you can buy it in the stores! To find out more information, visit the [*Conflux* prerelease page](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/tcg/events.aspx?x=mtgcom/events/prerelease-facts). And, while you're there, make sure to check out the [official visual spoiler](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/TCG/Article.aspx?x=mtg/tcg/conflux/spoiler) with tons of cool previews of the as-yet-unseen cards!
