 Both players have unblemished records thus far and intend to keep it that way. Nam Sung-Wook has had the honor of being the first South Korean player to win a Grand Prix, achieving this feat at Melbourne less than a month ago. Running the very same deck that propelled him to victory, Nam is back with Mono Black Devotion, but has tuned his deck to run [Duress](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress) in the maindeck in view of the shifting metagame.




 His opponent, Sun Bo, is no slouch himself. Known as duotianshi203 on **Magic Online**, he was the powerhouse that almost nearly became the MTGO Player of the Year, narrowly losing to eventual winner Shouta Yasooka by a two mere Qualifying Points.



Sun laments that it was a heartbreaking defeat, considering he had been leading the entire season for the first ten months before being overtaken. Regardless, he remains one of the most well-known players in Mainland China and will try to disrupt Nam's attempt at perfection.



**Game One**




 After a trip to Paris, Nam opened with [Duress](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress), nabbing [Syncopate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Syncopate) from Sun's hand. This left Sun with with just a fistful of lands and a lone [Supreme Verdict](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Supreme+Verdict). Thankfully, he had a pair of Scrylands at the ready, which enabled him to smooth out his future draws.




 Not having a third untapped land, Nam activated [Mutavault](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mutavault), and swung for 4 damage, before laying [Temple of Deceit](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Temple+of+Deceit). This prompted Sun to cast [Jace, Architect of Thought](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace%2C+Architect+of+Thought) to slow down the bleeding by shrinking the opposing army.




 Sun decided it was time to draw some cards and flipped over [Elspeth, Sun's Champion](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elspeth%2C+Sun%27s+Champion), [Sphinx's Revelation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sphinx%27s+Revelation) and [Azorius Charm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Azorius+Charm). Nam was clearly very experienced in this matchup, and wasted no time in isolating Elspeth. Sun took the larger pile, with [Sphinx's Revelation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sphinx%27s+Revelation) and [Azorius Charm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Azorius+Charm).




 Regardless, double [Pack Rat](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pack+Rat)s and double [Mutavault](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mutavault) crashed into the red zone. Nam activated a third [Mutavault](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mutavault), turning all the [Pack Rat](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pack+Rat)s into temporary 5/5s, but only for a short moment. Sun blocked the first [Mutavault](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mutavault) with his own, and sent the other onto the top of the library.




[Supreme Verdict](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Supreme+Verdict) cleared the board and it looked like Sun was in firm control having protected his Jace for upwards of five turns. Sun fired off the first [Sphinx's Revelation](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sphinx%27s+Revelation), and then another. Soon [Ã†therling](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=%C3%86therling) reared it's ugly head and even [Underworld Connections](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Underworld+Connections) from Nam could not bother Sun as he proceeded to close the game in three attack steps.






*Sun Bo adeptly survives Nam's [Duress](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress) and [Pack Rat](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pack+Rat)s.*
