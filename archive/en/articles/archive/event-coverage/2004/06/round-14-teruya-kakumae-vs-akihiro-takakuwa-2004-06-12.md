In fact, he will be teaming with Koichiro Maki and Akira Asahara at the next team Pro Tour, which should speak volumes about how well respected his talents are. A win here would guarantee him a spot in the Top 8, while a win will only put Kakumae in contention via tiebreakers. ### Game 1


Kakumae mana burned on his first turn (for [Pulse of the Forge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pulse+of+the+Forge)), and played a Talisman on turn two. Takakuwa's [Ravenous Rats](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ravenous+Rats) caused Kakumae to lose a [Great Furnace](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Great+Furnace), and Kakuwae took more damage from his Talisman. He untapped, activated his [Blinkmoth Nexus](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blinkmoth+Nexus), and attacked for one. Takakuwa swung back with his Rats, and Kakumae burned once more. After another Rats attack, Kakumae cast [Pulse of the Forge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pulse+of+the+Forge) on end step, getting it back. He then took two more burn to go down to nine, while Takakuwa was at fourteen due to painlands. A Rat attack brought Kakume down to seven, and Takakuwa played Siege Gang Commander. The Pulse brought Takakuwa down to nine, and [Pyroclasm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pyroclasm) cleared the board. A Blinkmoth attack put Takakuwa at eight, where a double Pulse shot did the rest.

### Game 2


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/jpnat04/fm20_2.jpg)Takakuwa mulliganed his opening hand. Both players had Talismans, and Kakumae used [Molten Rain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Molten+Rain) to destroy Takakuwa's forest. On the following turn he played [Solemn Simulacrum](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Solemn+Simulacrum), and Takukawa's morph creature (Nantuko Vigilante) was killed by [Electrostatic Bolt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Electrostatic+Bolt). The Simulacrum attacked for two, and Takakuwa played [Ravenous Rats](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ravenous+Rats), then drew cards off it thanks to [Skullclamp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skullclamp). Kakumae surprisingly decided to [Shatter](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shatter) a Talisman instead of [Skullclamp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skullclamp), and Takakuwa played Siege Gang Commander. It blocked the Simulacrum, and after damage went on the stack, Kakumae sacrificed it to [Shrapnel Blast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shrapnel+Blast), bringing Takakuwa down to nine. Takakuwa cycled through his Goblin tokens with [Skullclamp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skullclamp), and played [Ravenous Rats](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ravenous+Rats), causing Kakumae to discard a [Great Furnace](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Great+Furnace). On end step, Kakumae had another [Shrapnel Blast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shrapnel+Blast) to bring Takakuwa down to four, but this left him with no cards in hand. [Pulse of the Forge](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pulse+of+the+Forge) was waiting on top of the library, and when Kakumae cast it, the crowd around the table reacted with a tone that describes "How lucky!" no mater what language you speak.
