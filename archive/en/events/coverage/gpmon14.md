TOP 8 COVERAGE
--------------


Atotal of 1,622 players put Grand Prix Montreal on the record-sized event map for Canada. Like its sister event over the same weekend in Bueno Aires, Montreal pulled in a fantastic number of competitors from the world over. Here, it was all about *Born of the Gods* and the Limited environment its created. 


After a cut down to 170 players, thanks to nine rounds of Sealed deck, it was Gerard Fabiano that drafted his way to victory in the still-frozen north. Duel-wielding Celestial Archons in his final deck, Fabiano used the same plan every pro had brought for the weekend: aggression. The dominance of white-based aggressive decks was hard to miss as Fabiano's finals opponent, Dave Shiels, used a suite of his own fliers and tricks to cut a path through the Top 8. 


Will white continue to reign as the color du jour from *Born of the Gods*? Grand Prix Philadelphia is the next stop for the Limited format, and all eyes will fall on the City of Brotherly Love for the next step of the format's evolution.

DAY 2 COVERAGE
--------------


Draft! 


The call of the judge keeps time for competitors that have returned for Day 1 of Grand Prix Montreal. What started as a Canadian Grand Prix record of 1,622 players has been pared down to just 170. Among them are 7th-ranked Shahar Shenhar, 11th-ranked Alexander Hayne, and multiple Grand Prix Top 8 competitors David Ochoa and Gerard Fabiano - the latter who went undefeated on Day 1 alongside Daniel Fournier, Michael Ando, Philip Dettelis, and Geoff Risi.


What lies in store today? Six rounds of Born of the Gods-Theros-Theros Draft stand between the start of Round 10 and a final draft at Top 8. Tune in for live coverage at twitch.tv/magic starting shortly after 10 AM local time. 


Will you be watching when history is unwrapped?

DAY 1 COVERAGE
--------------


The largest Canadian Grand Prix in history - 1,622 players building and battling Born of the Gods Limited - has reached its halfway mark. 170 players will return tomorrow for more, this time testing their mettle by drafting Born of the Gods - Theros - Theros.


Across the nine rounds of Sealed Deck we saw heroes rise and fall. 2013 Player of the Year, and currently 8th-ranked, Josh Utter-Leyton fell early in the day as teammate David Ochoa rose through the ranks. Former Magic R&D developer and current Pro Tour coverage commentator Zac Hill took a strong run all day starting with Round 1, but multiple Grand Prix Top 8 player Patrick Cox rebooked his flight home before the penultimate round. In the end, five players stood above the rest and remained undefeated going into tomorrow drafts: Gerard Fabiano, Daniel Fournier, Michael Ando, Philip Dettelis, and Geoff Risi. 


A host more players remain right behind them with just one loss each.


With Born of the Gods Sealed Deck firmly behind us our eyes now turn to picks from packs: Six rounds of Booster Draft stand between tomorrow's competitors and the Top 8 they each seek. Join us around 9 AM local time to watch it all unfold live.
