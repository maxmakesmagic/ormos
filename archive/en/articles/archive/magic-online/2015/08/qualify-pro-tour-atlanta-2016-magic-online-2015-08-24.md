How do I qualify for the Pro Tour through *Magic Online*?
=========================================================


With *Magic Online*, you can qualify for the Pro Tour from the comfort of your own home via *Magic Online* Pro Tour Qualifier events!




---

You can find information on face-to-face PTQ events [here](http://magic.wizards.com/en/protour/regionalqualifiers).




---

*Magic Online* Pro Tour Qualifiers consist of a set of Preliminaries that grant invitations to the PTQ Finals. Winners of PTQ Finals receive invitations to the associated Pro Tour as well as the associated Pro Tour Challenge.


*Magic Online* hosts sixteen Pro Tour Qualifier Finals, one following each set of Preliminaries. Players may participate in as many PTQ Preliminaries as they like, but can only earn a single invitation to the PTQ Finals. Participation in *Magic Online* PTQ Preliminaries and Finals is open only to players who have not been invited to the associated Pro Tour.


Invitations won via *Magic Online* PTQ Preliminaries qualify you for a single associated PTQ Final held later in the week. Invitations to PTQ Finals will not be transferred.


As mentioned previously, by placing first in a Pro Tour Qualifier Final, you will win an invitation to the [Pro Tour Challenge](http://magic.wizards.com/en/MTGO/content/magic-online-pro-tour-qualifiers-pro-tour-atlanta-2016#challenge) in addition to your Pro Tour invitation! The *Magic Online* Pro Tour Challenge is an additional tournament held during the Pro Tour especially for *Magic Online* players invited via a Pro Tour Qualifier on *Magic Online* or the *Magic Online* Championship Series. This in-person event is held in the same location as the Pro Tour and pits *Magic Online* Pro Tour invitees against one another in a single, 4-round Swiss event, with $1500 and a ton of *Magic Online* booster packs up for grabs!


Once a player qualifies for the Pro Tour through a *Magic Online* Championship Series Season Final, or a *Magic Online* PTQ, s/he is no longer eligible to participate in either face-to-face or *Magic Online* PTQ Events that lead to the same Pro Tour. Refer to the [*Magic: The Gathering* Premier Event Invitation Policy](http://wpn.wizards.com/en/wpn/document.aspx?x=magic_the_gathering_premier_event_invitation_policy) for more event eligibility requirements and rules.
