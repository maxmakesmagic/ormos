The holidays are awesomely difficult times to buy for the gamers in your life. Whether you're a gamer yourself or just love one (or draw them in Secret Santa), it can be hard to know if Audrey could really use a Bundle Box or if Jack is jonesing for Planeswalker Decks and booster packs.


That's where this guide comes in. Below we've grouped together gift ideas for the type of player you might be shopping for.


*Kaladesh* Holiday Buy-a-Box Promotion
======================================


First, let's talk about the holiday promotion we're running starting November 26. If you [visit a local store](http://locator.wizards.com/) and purchase a booster display box of *Kaladesh* (MSRP: $143.64), you may also receive two bonus packs containing epic cards, while supplies last, so plan to pick this up ASAP.



![Kaladesh Booster Display Box](https://media.wizards.com/2016/images/daily/9hViKXfMHY.png)*Purchase a* Kaladesh *booster display box from a local game store and, for a limited time, you may receive two bonus holiday packs from participating stores, while supplies last. So check with [your local store](http://locator.wizards.com/).*
These boosters will contain:


* A premium card from a currently legal Standard set\*, including *Zendikar Expeditions* and *Kaladesh Inventions*.
* Two non-premium cards that are either rare or a mythic rare from a set currently legal in Standard\* (*Battle for Zendikar* through *Kaladesh)*.

\*Cards from *Oath of the Gatewatch* and double-faced cards not included.


If you're not familiar with what a lot of those words mean, the short version is that these promotional boosters are meant to be special to players of all levels and interests. This is a promotion we've never tried before, and the packs may contain some of our rarest cards!
