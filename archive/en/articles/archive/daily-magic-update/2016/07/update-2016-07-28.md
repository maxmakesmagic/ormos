The Daily *Magic* Update is a roundup of everything *Magic* you should know on July 28, 2016. Today's Update is brought to you by Emrakul. They're all her updates. They always were.


Today's Must
============


1. [*Eldritch Moon* Sealed Is Great](http://www.hipstersofthecoast.com/2016/07/eldritch-moon-sealed-great/) | Hipsters of the Coast | Brendan McNamara

I swear I didn't include this article simply because the headline talks about how great this set is for Sealed. I promise. I included it because it's an early look at the Sealed format—McNamara actually played in two sealed PPTQs, so he has as much experience as anyone—just before we get a weekend full of three Sealed Grand Prix using the latest set. Whether you're playing in a Grand Prix this weekend, just watching, or playing in your own Sealed event, this is a good resource for an early take on *Eldritch Moon* Sealed.


After That, Read, Watch, or Listen to These
===========================================


1. [Are you interested in *Magic: The Gathering*? Find out today! (150k Celebration)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJGcHi6xGvg) | Tolarian Community College | The Professor

Part joke advertisement, part rehashing of some of the channels greatest hits, part celebration for being the first *Magic*-focused YouTube channel to hit 150,000 subscribers. Congratulations to The Professor, and here's to three more years. And then three more years after that. Then—well, then we'll see.

1. [Cosplay: Ms. Chandra Goes to Innistrad](http://www.gatheringmagic.com/mjscott-07282016-cosplay-ms-chandra-goes-to-innistrad/) | MJ Scott | Gathering Magic

Cosplay articles can be rare birds, so I like to highlight them whenever possible. This one features an interview with Liz Montinola-Dimailig, an excellent cosplayer who has taken up the Chandra mantle. Obviously full of cool pictures, as any good cosplay article should be.


1. [*Eldritch Moon* First Impressions](http://lrcast.com/limited-resources-347-eldritch-moon-first-impressions/) | Limited Resources | Marshall Sutcliffe and Luis Scott-Vargas

Marshall and Luis talk first impressions of—wait, Luis? He's back! And he's talking about *Eldritch Moon* with Marshall. Just like old times. Old times being like a month ago.


1. [Eldritch Revolution](http://www.channelfireball.com/articles/eldritch-revolution/) | ChannelFireball | Joel Larsson

This one is less remarkable for its content—though, don't get me wrong, the content is strong and brewing with [Eldritch Evolution](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eldritch+Evolution) in Modern is something Modern players should know—but the most notable feature is that Joel Larsson is now writing for ChannelFireball. Because that website was really lacking in Platinum pros.


1. [Against the Odds: Endless Whispers](http://www.mtggoldfish.com/articles/against-the-odds-endless-whispers) | MTGGoldfish | SaffronOlive

What kind of deck wins all of its Game 1s and none of its Game 2s? As usual, Against the Odds finds a unique way to approach Modern—and a unique way to both win and lose. This time, with [Endless Whispers](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Endless+Whispers) teaming up with [Phage the Untouchable](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phage+the+Untouchable).


1. [Top 10 *Eldritch Moon* Cards for Modern](https://rocketjump.com/listen/top-10-eldritch-moon-cards-modern) | Masters of Modern | Ben Bateman and Alex Kessler

You have to love an on-the-nose title. They say they talk about the Top 10 *Eldritch Moon* cards for Modern, and that's what they do. So click the little link above and listen to it.


Or would you prefer something like "Ben and Alex reveal their 10 most amazing *Eldritch Moon* cards for Modern! You'll never believe what's No. 3!"? Because I can do that.


What People Are Talking About

Just a reminder that these Paliano Posts from Bruce Richard are both awesome and entirely the work of a fan, not at all relating to canon. There [appeared to be some confusion about that](https://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/4uve5f/second_assassination_attempt_at_queen_marchesa/).


That said, the posts are great, and if you're just as excited for *Conspiracy: Take the Crown* to release as Bruce is—well, no one is as excited as he is. But if you're close, there's only about a month left till its release and even less till previews start (they start August 15).


1. The Promised End

Yesterday's *Magic Story,* "[The Promised End](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/magic-story/promised-end-2016-07-27)," has been one of the most talked about stories we've released in a long time. And with good reason. If you haven't read it, the twist is quite satisfying. If you have, there are a number of people and places talking about it online. Here's a small selection.

Decks of the Day
================


1. [The Standard Decks You Haven't Seen](http://magic.tcgplayer.com/db/article.asp?ID=13421&writer=Adam+Yurchick&articledate=7-28-2016) | TCGPlayer | Adam Yurchick

I was looking around, scouring the internet for an interesting, *Eldritch Moon*-inspired deck to feature today, when I came across Adam Yurchick's excellent article that features a ton of decks. So why not just point you in the direction of his efforts?


He has tons of lists. There's a [Deploy the Gatewatch](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deploy+the+Gatewatch) list, Zombies, Vampires, White-Black Madness, Blue-Red Madness, a [Bedlam Reveler](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bedlam+Reveler) deck, Blue-Red Prowess, an Eldrazi-based [Eldritch Evolution](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eldritch+Evolution) deck, and several more. And all of them, Yurchick says, have found some success at tournaments of some kind (though he doesn't say where).


So sit back, click the link above, and enjoy a nearly endless stream of new decks.
