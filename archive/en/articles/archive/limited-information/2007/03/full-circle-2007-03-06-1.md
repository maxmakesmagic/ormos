I was destroyed. Utterly taken apart. The thing about Turian is that he doesn’t lose, and more specifically, never met a fourth turn he didn’t cast a [Lightning Angel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Angel). The two games were extremely quick affairs. In the first I felt good about the early suspend cards alongside [Dreamscape Artist](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dreamscape+Artist) and [Mogg War Marshal](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mogg+War+Marshal), only to see Mike play [Prodigal Pyromancer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Prodigal+Pyromancer) and undo the entire opener. In fact, Mike called [Prodigal Pyromancer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Prodigal+Pyromancer) Planar Chaos’s best common simply because of its ability to nullify entire swaths of an opponent’s deck. It’s not a bad philosophy. [Lightning Angel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Angel) came down early and beat me senseless. That’s one card this deck has a serious problem with. The second game was more of the same, with my Pyromancer getting an [Erratic Mutation](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Erratic+Mutation), and the rest of my team taking burn and [Stingscourger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stingscourger)s before [Lightning Angel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Angel) and [Chronosavant](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chronosavant) dealt the final points. By the end, we both agreed it was a pretty miserable matchup for me. We shook hands and Mike Turian was crowned the winner of the R&D draft.


Final record 2-1


And that looks like the end for me. I’m told I’ll be able to poke my head in once in a while, but for now I’ll be just another guy behind the scenes, trying to make future sets as fun as possible. It’s been a pleasure to write for you guys, and incredibly instructive as well. I have no illusions about having landed my plush new dream job without the experiences I’ve gained working with such a discerning audience. You guys are great. I hope everyone continues to enjoy what they do, be it Magic or anything else. Good luck and as always, thanks for reading.
