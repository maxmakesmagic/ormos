**Things to Do in Toronto, Ontario**
  
 Toronto is the fifth largest city in North America, and one of its most exciting. Our 2 million people in the city itself and the 5.3 million in the total Greater Toronto Area speak more than 100 languages and dialects.


The vitality is everywhere, and offers a warm welcome and excitement, in Little Italy, Little Portugal, India, Thailand, Korea or Russia, in Greektown, in the largest Chinatown in North America, and in pockets of the West Indies everywhere. 


You can taste it in our amazing array of inexpensive restaurants; you can see it in theatre, culture and neighbourhoods; you can feel it in our music, you can experience it in the Waterfront Marathon, at our seven Neighbourhood Entertainment Centres along the route (that you'll pass 15 times!)...and throughout the city during your visit here. 


If this isn't enough, we're only 1.5 hours from legendary Niagara Falls, and 3 hours from world-famous Algonquin Park. 


Here are some of the sites to visit when in Toronto:
