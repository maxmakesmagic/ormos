 Bruce's games invariably involve several friends, crazy plays, and many laughs. Bruce believes that if anyone at your table isn't having fun, then you are doing it wrong. 






 The first game of the night had been going pretty well, then Jesse decided things were getting out of hand, so he used Jaya Ballard's third ability, doing 6 damage to all creatures and players. That effectively reset the board, except for your [Wall of Frost](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wall+of+Frost). Harry played another land and dropped a smaller creature that really didn't affect the board in any way. John followed up on his turn with [Deranged Hermit](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deranged+Hermit) and a flashed back [Chatter of the Squirrel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chatter+of+the+Squirrel). That was going to be annoying, but Jesse is capable of handling several small creatures. 

 On the next round, Jesse played a kicked [Goblin Ruinblaster](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Ruinblaster) and took out one of your [Hallowed Fountain](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hallowed+Fountain)s. John followed up with [Beastmaster Ascension](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Beastmaster+Ascension) and attacked you with four of the Squirrel tokens and Harry with the other two tokens and the [Deranged Hermit](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deranged+Hermit). Your [Wall of Frost](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wall+of+Frost) could block one of the Squirrels but the remaining Squirrels were coming in for a lethal 21 damage! 

 Thankfully, you decided to run [Fated Infatuation](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fated+Infatuation)! You wanted the flexibility that casting it at instant speed would offer. You knew it would allow you to copy one of your creatures on your opponent's end step, essentially giving your token creature haste, to surprise your opponents. Haste creatures are not something people generally expect from blue decks, but [Fated Infatuation](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fated+Infatuation) offers that. That flexibility also let you throw a surprise blocker out, messing up your friend's combat math. You played [Fated Infatuation](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fated+Infatuation), copying the [Wall of Frost](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wall+of+Frost), and blocked one of the Squirrels coming at you. 

 You would have much rather copied your [Diluvian Primordial](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Diluvian+Primordial), but you do what you have to do to stay alive. You take 14 damage (still pretty rough), but the Fates have smiled on you; you live to fight another day!
