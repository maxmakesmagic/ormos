So I might have lied a little bit. I'm sorry. It was all with the best of intention. Preview season is a time for secrets, and I stretched the truth just a little bit in last week's [promo Arcana](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/arcana/khans-tarkir-promos-2014-09-04). You see, there was one promo I left out. But I did so with good intentions. I hope we can still be friends. But I think you'll forgive me once you see what comes inside this, the 2014 Holiday Gift Box.

The box itself can hold more than 2,000 *Magic* cards and is available worldwide in English on November 14, 2014. You do get more than just a beautiful box to store your cards in for the MSRP of $19.99, though! To wit:



* Four *Khans of Tarkir* booster packs
* Beautiful storage box that can hold more than 2,000 *Magic* cards
* Twenty *Khans of Tarkir* basic lands
* Six illustrated plastic dividers
* Sticker sheet for customizing the dividers
* An alternative-art Sultai Charm from the *Khans of Tarkir* set

That's right, every Holiday Gift Box comes with this version of Sultai Charm:
