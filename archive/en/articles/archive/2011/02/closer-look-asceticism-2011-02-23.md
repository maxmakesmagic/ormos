S*cars of Mirrodin*'s [Asceticism](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Asceticism) is a clear call-back to the original *Mirrodin*'s [Troll Ascetic](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Troll+Ascetic), turning all your creatures into regenerating, holy-crap-is-that-better-than-shroud-having monsters (and implying, incidentally, that [Troll Ascetic](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Troll+Ascetic)'s unique properties are due at least as much to being an ascetic as to being a troll). But in addition to being a call-back, [Asceticism](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Asceticism) was also a call-*forward*â€”to *Mirrodin Besieged*.


Who's that lone figure standing among the trees? Let's take a closer look.






Yeah, that guy looks familiar, all right. Definitely some kind of [Troll Ascetic](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Troll+Ascetic). But that could be any old troll hermit, right?


Not so! As the flavor text of [Asceticism](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Asceticism) suggests, there's only one troll left on the plane of Mirrodin: the outcast [Thrun, the Last Troll](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thrun%2C+the+Last+Troll). Check 'em out side by side:
