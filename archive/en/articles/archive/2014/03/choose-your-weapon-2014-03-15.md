 A longtime member of the Pro Tour and Grand Prix coverage staff, Nate Price now works making beautiful words for all of you lovely people as the community manager for organized play. When not covering events, he lords over the @MagicProTour Twitter account, ruling with an iron fist. 






 Proper deck selection is key to success in any Constructed format, yet is consistently one of the hardest tasks in **Magic**. As the variety in a format increases, deck selection somehow manages to get both harder and easier. Obviously, more options leads to more opportunities to make mistakes, hence why too many options can be paralyzing. However, the more viable options there are, the less likelihood that there is an actual "best deck" for a tournament. In situations like this, where there are a number of excellent choices for a tournament, the correct decision is often to go with what you know.



After Round 7, I had a chance to sit down with three of the players we have been watching, each of whom is playing a different deck. First up was the top-rated player in the hosting Argentina, Andres Monsalve.




*Andres Monsalve's choice of Uw Devotion is particularly appropriate to represent Argentina.*
