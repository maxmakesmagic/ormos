Dae-Hoon Won from South Korea and Joseph Sclavezero from Australia shook hands as they began their Top 8 match at GP Manila. This was the first GP Top 8 for both players, but only one would be able to progress onwards.


Game 1
======


Sclauzero was first on the the battlefield with a [Seeker of the Way](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seeker+of+the+Way), but Wan quickly responded with a [Courser of Kruphix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Courser+of+Kruphix). Sclauzero pressed the attack and Wan declined to block, and eventually the Seeker was joined by a [Butcher of the Horde](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Butcher+of+the+Horde). Wan summoned [Sidisi, Brood Tyrant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sidisi%2C+Brood+Tyrant), making a zombie token off a [Soul of Theros](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soul+of+Theros) hitting the graveyard. Sclauzero went into the tank.


"If he drew an untapped land, I wanted to force him to use the [Soul of Theros](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soul+of+Theros) with as few creatures as possible," Sclauzero said after the match, "So I decided to go all in on [Butcher of the Horde](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Butcher+of+the+Horde). I had a [Hordeling Outburst](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hordeling+Outburst) to stabilise with lifegain from the Butchers next turn."

Sclauzero played out a second Butcher, sacrificed the [Seeker of the Way](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seeker+of+the+Way) to grant it haste, and smashed in for ten. Wan drew but didn't find an untapped land. Wan cast [Commune with the Gods](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Commune+with+the+Gods). Unfortunately the Gods found no favour with him, so Wan attacked, then conceded.


Game 2
======


Wan mulled to six on the play, keeping a two land hand with a [Thoughtseize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtseize). He targeted Sclauzero with the discard spell and saw an opposing 2 land hand with [Chained to the Rocks](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chained+to+the+Rocks), [Lightning Strike](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Strike), two [Utter End](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Utter+End), [Hushwing Gryff](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hushwing+Gryff), and [Butcher of the Horde](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Butcher+of+the+Horde). Wan took the [Chained to the Rocks](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chained+to+the+Rocks) and passed the turn.


Sclauzero played a land and passed, while Wan drew into another [Thoughtseize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtseize) and used it immediately. He saw the third land had arrived in hand for Joseph. "Thinking." he said softly. "Ok." replied Joseph. Finally Wan forced Sclauzero to discard the [Butcher of the Horde](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Butcher+of+the+Horde).


The following turn Wan summoned [Anafenza, the Foremost](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Anafenza%2C+the+Foremost), while Sclauzero flashed in the [Hushwing Gryff](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hushwing+Gryff). Sclauzero found his fourth land and Wan sighed, knowing Joseph's hand. [Utter End](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Utter+End) ended Anafenza utterly. Wan cast a [Siege Rhino](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Siege+Rhino), losing the Lighting Helix effect to the the [Hushwing Gryff](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hushwing+Gryff)'s static ability.


Sclauzero kept the pressure on with Hordling Outbursts. Even though the [Hushwing Gryff](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hushwing+Gryff) was destroyed by a [Glare of Heresy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glare+of+Heresy), the Rhino couldn't make headway and was forced to play defence against the 1/1s. Eventually Sclauzero used the Lighting Strike he'd had since the start of the game to finish Wan off, and the two shook hands a final time.

"I'm feeling pretty calm, pretty happy." Sclauzero said afterwards, "The goal was to qualify for the Pro Tour. My friend, Tristan Cook, won a PTQ and I really wanted to go with him."


"Everything about the deck has worked perfectly. I feel like I'm running a hot, playing well, and if I want a card it'll be there for me. I'll probably face Whip decks now. I've beaten two Whip decks so far, and if they mana screw I should be okay. But the goal is to turn their enter-the-battlefield abilities off with [Hushwing Gryff](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hushwing+Gryff), kill their big guys, and get through as much damage as possible, as fast as possible."
