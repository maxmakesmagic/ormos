Making its debut at Pro Tour-London last weekend was **magicthegathering.com's** new [Draft Viewer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/magic/draftools/draftviewer2.asp?draftid=7_10_2005_3_34_53_0), which enables you to replay the entire Top 8 draft from each seat at the table. You can see what cards came to each Pro, and gain insight into why they made the choices that they did.




Much was made of Masashi Oiso's unfocused draft, which left him with a black-green mess splashing red for two [Spiraling Embers](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spiraling+Embers). If you haven't seen it yet, our Sunday webcast featured Oiso's draft, and you can [watch it here](http://webcast.wizards.com/05london/Sunday/london_draft.wmv.zip) (39.9 MB zip). 


Did Oiso have a good chance to jettison his attempt at green and jump into red? [Pick 3 of pack 2](http://gatherer.wizards.com/magic/draftools/draftviewer2.asp?draftid=7_10_2005_3_34_53_0&player=8&pack=2&pick=3) provided a doorway that Oiso chose not to go through. With only [Sosuke, Son of Seshiro](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sosuke%2C+Son+of+Seshiro), [Kami of the Hunt](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kami+of+the+Hunt), and [Wear Away](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wear+Away) making up his green contingent from pack 1, Oiso grabbed [Gnarled Mass](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gnarled+Mass) to bulk up his creature base. Not a bad pick, but in retrospect, the [Cunning Bandit](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cunning+Bandit) could have shifted him into red with a bounty awaiting in pack 3. Because Geoffrey Siron was the only red drafter at the table, this shift wouldn't have affected other players' picks as no one else was hunting for red. 


Here's a sample of the red cards Oiso saw in Pack 3:  
[Pick 2](http://gatherer.wizards.com/magic/draftools/draftviewer2.asp?draftid=7_10_2005_3_34_53_0&player=8&pack=3&pick=2): [Barrel Down Sokenzan](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Barrel+Down+Sokenzan)  
[Pick 3](http://gatherer.wizards.com/magic/draftools/draftviewer2.asp?draftid=7_10_2005_3_34_53_0&player=8&pack=3&pick=3): [Sokenzan Spellblade](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sokenzan+Spellblade)  
[Pick 4](http://gatherer.wizards.com/magic/draftools/draftviewer2.asp?draftid=7_10_2005_3_34_53_0&player=8&pack=3&pick=4): [Spiraling Embers](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spiraling+Embers)  
[Pick 5](http://gatherer.wizards.com/magic/draftools/draftviewer2.asp?draftid=7_10_2005_3_34_53_0&player=8&pack=3&pick=5): [Spiraling Embers](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spiraling+Embers) and [Undying Flames](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Undying+Flames)  
[Pick 6](http://gatherer.wizards.com/magic/draftools/draftviewer2.asp?draftid=7_10_2005_3_34_53_0&player=8&pack=3&pick=6): [Barrel Down Sokenzan](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Barrel+Down+Sokenzan)


Oiso ended up picking and using the two [Spiraling Embers](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spiraling+Embers) for a splash of red (leaving two [First Volley](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=First+Volley) in his sideboard). In reality, here is what he ended up with those picks: [O-Naginata](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=O-Naginata), [Razorjaw Oni](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Razorjaw+Oni), [Briarknit Kami](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Briarknit+Kami), and [Death Denied](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Death+Denied).


And a 15-minute stomping at the hands of Siron in the quarterfinals.


Another interesting way to view the draft is to look at the high picks players didn't put in their decks, and the low picks that made it, to judge the "value" of their picks. Interestingly enough, Siron dominated the Top 8 despite not playing his second pick out of Pack 3, a place you'd expect to find some serious gas for your deck.
