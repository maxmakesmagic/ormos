 Traditionally, when you think of Asian **Magic**, Japan is the first thing that springs to mind. After all, it's the home of some of the best players to ever play the game, including multiple Hall of Famers. It's served as the venue for numerous Grand Prix and Pro Tours and has hosted some of the most memorable moments in **Magic**'s history. What doesn't immediately spring to mind is Singapore. Or Hong Kong. Or South Korea.




 The Asian **Magic** community has historically been sort of isolated from the rest of the **Magic** world. Since the majority of the game's focus was initially centered on North America, it was hard for the early Asian players to learn the game at a high level, to get access to the resources needed to succeed, and to generally raise the level of their game to match the level of play seen by the older players in the Americas and Europe. Over time, the growth of the Japanese **Magic** community spawned some of the fiercest competitors ever seen at the Pro Tour level. Yet the level of competition from the rest of Asia lagged behind.




 Enter **Magic Online**. Possibly the greatest thing to ever happen to Asian Magic, **Magic Online** closed a lot of the distance that existed between the top-level communities in the world and the ones seen in some of the smaller countries of Southeast Asia. You began to see gradual increases in the level of play, more success at the upper levels of the game, and, eventually, champions.




 Still, the game has become so competitive that it can be hard to properly prepare to succeed at the professional level without the support of a strong team. Rituals like traveling to a Pro Tour a week in advance to testing, renting gaming houses for weeks on end, even taking a cruise a la Team Mana [Deprive](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deprive)d have become the norm. In addition to geographically making it easier to prepare for a Pro Tour, one of the biggest impacts teams have is to concentrate top talent in one location, which drives up the individual skill of each player on the team.




 Simply put, the communities of many of the Southeast Asian countries are just smaller than the communities of most of the other regions in the world. Enter Team MTG Mint Card. Originally rising to recognition through the efforts of Chinese Taipei's Tzu-Ching Kuo and Hong Kong's Lee Shi Tian, MTG Mint Card has blossomed into one of the top teams in **Magic**, deserving of recognition alongside the other big boys of the game. The team has gone through a number of roster changes from Pro Tour to Pro Tour. This season, they notably worked with Japanese master Ken Yukuhiro for Pro Tour *Born of the Gods*, eventually putting Lee Shi Tian into the Top 8. Their other notable pickups were two little-known professional players from South Korea: Nam Sung Wook and Jun Young Park.






*Team MTG Mint Card has become the shining force behind Asian **Magic** on the Pro Tour.*
