We've just made one of the biggest announcements in competitive gaming, with a [$10 million prize pool](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/news/next-chapter-magic-esports-2018-12-06) in competitive *Magic* in 2019.


That's right: The 25-year-old card game is now a top competitive esports program. And these five additions gear it up to be a global success.


1. **Combining *MTG Arena* and Tabletop *Magic***

The PC-based digital card game *MTG Arena* will integrate into competitive *Magic* in 2019. There's a $10 million prize pool up for grabs in 2019 across digital and tabletop *Magic*. The new system provides lucrative opportunities for pros, players, sponsors, and esports partners.


1. **The *Magic* Pro League**

The first year of the *Magic* Pro League brings together 32 of *Magic*'s top-ranked players from around the world. This includes player and streamer contracts with a combined worth of $75,000. MPL players will compete in weekly competitive match-ups on *MTG Arena* and Mythic-level tournaments (more on that below).


1. **$1 Million Mythic Invitational**

We're kicking off the *Magic*'s new esports and competitive gaming program with a special $1 million *MTG Arena* Mythic Invitational event at PAX East in Boston on March 28–31. The Invitational showcases players in the new *Magic* Pro League battling against challengers from the *Magic* community. More info on how to snag one of the elusive spots coming in January!


1. **2019 Mythic Championships**

The rest of 2019 features a new series of Mythic Championships: high-drama events with major prize pools for both *MTG Arena* and tabletop. You'll be able to qualify for *MTG Arena* Mythic Championships by playing *MTG Arena* at home. Then test your skills against the stars in the *Magic* Pro League to claim your share of prizes and glory.


1. **Partner Tournament Events**

We have a significant prize pool set aside to partner with independent organizers who want to host *MTG Arena* esports and tabletop competitive gaming events. The tabletop Grand Prix circuit held at MagicFests run by ChannelFireball Events offers a $2.5 million prize pool, along with dozens of events around the world in 2019. We look forward to announcing more partner events, especially esports events featuring *MTG Arena*.
