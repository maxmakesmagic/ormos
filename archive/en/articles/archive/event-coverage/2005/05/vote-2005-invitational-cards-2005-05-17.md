The winner of the **Magic** Invitational gets the rare opportunity to design a **Magic** card complete with his image in the art. In the past, many spectators have picked who to root for based on which card they wanted to see printed.


This year we gave the public a chance to root for their favorite player and still get the card they most desire. Readers voted for an additional card to be printed (although the designer of this card doesn't get his lovely mug in the art), regardless of how its designer fared.


With all that out of the way, we present the voting results:
