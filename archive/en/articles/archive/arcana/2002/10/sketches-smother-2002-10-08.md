This week's "Sketches" looks at the new top-notch black removal spell, [Smother](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Smother) by Carl Critchlow.

### 1. Art Description

These are the instructions given to the artist:

"Location: Aphetto  
 Action: Dwarf Pit-Fighter surrounded by a swarm of gnats. They are suffocating him by flying into his nose, mouth, etc."

It's hard to notice the gnats on the actual card, but they're there. It isn't just a dwarf grasping at the "camera."

### 2. Sketch

This is the preliminary sketch submitted by Carl. Unlike many other artists, Carl actually uses color in his preliminaries, so the art department has a better idea of what the final piece will look like.

### 3. Final Art

Here is a large version of the final piece. The gnats are much more visible at this size.

### 4. Card

Finally, here is the card as it appears in the set.
