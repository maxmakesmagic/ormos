*Magic: The Gathering* is probably the greatest gaming experience I've ever had. Many are first drawn to the intricate artwork of the individually illustrated cards and the element of collectibility.


As the game matured, we eventually fall in love with the excellently-developed products and Organized Play systems that allow us to enjoy at game in so many ways. The possibilities and strategies are limitless.


You can play it alone on *Magic Online*. Many play it with their siblings and neighbors on their kitchen tabletops, or hang out in game stores with their local community.


If you want to go the distance, you have the option of embracing the globetrotting lifestyle to "play the game" while "seeing the world" like many of the Pros and Hall-of-Famers are doing. Personally, I find the squirrels in the game really cute.

I digress. My point is, there are so many reasons to love this game!


However, it's so much more than "just a game".



 It's a **lifestyle** that brings us all together. No matter where we are from, what tongue we talk with, or what our nationality is, we all speak the language that is *Magic*.



Imagine this. You're walking down a street and later bump into this dude on the subway, wearing this inconspicuous (to the general public) T-shirt.

The next moment, you're talking about where you usually play Friday Night *Magic*, what his favorite color is (presumably blue), and who your favorite player is. You become "insta-friends" with this total stranger you've never met in your life and the next moment, you're planning a trip to a Grand Prix together with a bunch of both your friends.



**This weekend, we are expecting this force to unite thousands of *Magic* players all over the world.** In Chiba. In Utrecht. In Las Vegas. And we will be celebrating *Modern Masters 2015* around the clock in an UNPRECEDENTED triple Grand Prix weekend.




*Magic* players will forsake their usual commitments for just one weekend and take the flight across the oceans or make twelve-hour road trips to converge at the biggest tournaments of each continent to play the one game that connects us all.

For example, Ihoue Hiroyuki and Onizuka Ryo are two lifelong friends who've decided to share some quality time together this weekend. Not only did they spend the full day enjoying the wide selection of Public Events yesterday, they are also entered in the Main Event today.


"Winning is not the most important thing for us. What matters most is that we're having fun playing a game that we enjoy."

Apparently, they are not the only ones who feel that way as evidenced by the throng of fans gathered at the Makuhari Messe this weekend. In fact, the event reached its registration capacity of 4000 in under ten hours and the dedicated tournament organizers had to find ways to enroll more people so as to avoid disappointment.



 Of course, this venue also has a place in Magic history and is most fondly remembered by Guillaume Matignon and Ivan Floch. The [2010 World Championships](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/eventcoverage/worlds10/welcome) was also held here five years ago and the individual portion was won by the Frenchman, while the Slovaks took down the team portion.

*There's No Jace Like Guillaume.*



Today, the record-smashing number of players in attendance has made Grand Prix Chiba the largest tournament in the history of Japan and Asia Pacific, a statistic that will go down in the annals of history and etched in our minds for a long, long time to come.


Over 25,000 *Modern Masters 2015* boosters will be opened today in Chiba alone and many many more in a few hours in Utrecht and Las Vegas. As we bring you live coverage 24-hours around the clock, you too can be part of this epic weekend!

*You know you love the smell of crisp booster wrappers in the morning...*




 Even better, immerse yourself in the revelries and perhaps crack some *Modern Masters* boosters of your own! Get a draft going with a group of friends and tune in to the live stream and get involved with our social media.

*"Greetings from Chiba, wherever you are!"*



Remember. No matter where you are, you'll always be part of the Multiverse and we will always be as one.
