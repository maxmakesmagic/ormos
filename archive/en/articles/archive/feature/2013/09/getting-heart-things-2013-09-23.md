*Theros* is here in full force and it's time to take a look at some new decks. It's always interesting to explore in the time before the new season really gets going. The unknown metagame means that anything is possible, especially if you believe in the heart of the Chimera, as this deck does. 


![Spellheart Chimera](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Spellheart+Chimera)
 This list (from [Gerry Thompson's [Premium] article on StarCityGames.com](http://www.starcitygames.com/article/26951_Finally-Some-Semi-Tuned-Theros-Decks.html)) was actually built by [Jacob Van Lunen](http://www.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Archive.aspx?author=Jacob%20Van%20Lunen), although Gerry did tweak it a little. It's a blue-red control deck at its core, with the pretty sweet kill condition of [Spellheart Chimera](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spellheart+Chimera), although the one [Ætherling](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=%C3%86therling) is handy in a pinch. 


[Steam Augury](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Steam+Augury) is what powers both the deck and the Chimera, as it not only refills your hand, it loads your graveyard. JVL's plan to take full advantage of the Augury is to have as many redundant cards as possible, making it difficult for your opponent to leave you with a "bad" pile. The most common case is that you flip over some lands, some counterspells, and maybe a piece of removal, making it easy to end up with two lands and a spell in one pile and two spells in the other. Either pile is pretty sweet, and if you can hit the dream five of four spells and a land, even better. 

 The deck plays a full twelve counterspells, taking full advantage of [Cavern of Souls](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cavern+of+Souls)'s departure from Standard. Unless you are playing against [Mistcutter Hydra](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mistcutter+Hydra) or [Loxodon Smiter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Loxodon+Smiter), [Essence Scatter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Essence+Scatter)*will* do the trick, and the full set of [Dissolve](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dissolve)s plus three [Syncopate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Syncopate)s offers a ton of backup. There's even a singleton [Negate](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Negate) to keep your opponent guessing. 

 The non-counter removal also features a powerful *Theros* card in [Anger of the Gods](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Anger+of+the+Gods). [Voice of Resurgence](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Voice+of+Resurgence) is a huge problem for this deck, and [Anger of the Gods](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Anger+of+the+Gods) is the best answer to it. Gerry suggests trying [Domestication](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Domestication) as well, if Voice makes a resurgence in the new format. [Shock](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shock) gets a little love too, although [Lightning Strike](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Strike) seems like a very valid choice if the format breaks toward 3-toughness creatures. 

 I like the simplicity of the deck, the fact that it uses [Steam Augury](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Steam+Augury) and [Spellheart Chimera](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spellheart+Chimera), and the potential to just counter or burn everything the opponent plays. It's even got [Quicken](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Quicken) as a sweet combo with [Anger of the Gods](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Anger+of+the+Gods), although it's mostly there to power up [Spellheart Chimera](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spellheart+Chimera).
