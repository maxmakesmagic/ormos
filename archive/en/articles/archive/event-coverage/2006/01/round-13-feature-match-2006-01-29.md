Two wins in a row will get any of these two players into the top 8 of this tournament. Petr is one of the six players in a row playing green, Sam was in a much better spot with a solid Dimir deck that is concentrated on milling libraries.


Petr has an average curve in the first game: [Veteran Armorer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Veteran+Armorer), [Civic Wayfinder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Civic+Wayfinder), Fist of Ironwood and Diverbomber Griffin. That is not a great curve for a typical Selesnya deck, as it lack a lot of aggression. After Sam resolves [Drift of Phantasms](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Drift+of+Phantasms), transmuted for and played [Vedalken Entrancer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vedalken+Entrancer) and summoned [Tidewater Minion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tidewater+Minion), Petr never ever got to attack again. Later on, when yet another Entrancer arrived, Sam was milling six cards a turn, and Petr never stood a chance.


Sam 1-0


Game 2 was much more of the same actually, a [Elvish Skysweeper](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elvish+Skysweeper) was killed by [Clinging Darkness](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Clinging+Darkness), [Stinkweed Imp](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stinkweed+Imp) and [Drift of Phantasms](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Drift+of+Phantasms) held [Civic Wayfinder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Civic+Wayfinder) and [Divebomber Griffin](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Divebomber+Griffin) at bay, and [Vedalken Entrancer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vedalken+Entrancer) made sure Sam would never lose. While it is true that Petr drew some more lands than he needed in the second game, I don't think his deck is aggressive anough to stand a chance versus a good Dimir deck.


Sam wins 2-0
