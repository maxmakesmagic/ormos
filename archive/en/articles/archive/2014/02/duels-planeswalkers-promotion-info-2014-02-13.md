Duels of the Planeswalkers Promotion Info
=========================================



 Posted in [NEWS](/en/articles)
 on June 6, 2011 










**This promotion ended on December 15, 2011.**


Looking for the alternate-art Liliana Vess or alternate-art Garruk Wildspeaker? We're sorry, but the original promotion has ended. See the terms and conditions for the PlayStation速 3 [here](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/digital/duelsoftheplaneswalkers.aspx?x=mtg/digital/dotpps3/terms), for the XBox [here](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/digital/duelsoftheplaneswalkers.aspx?x=mtg/digital/dotpxbox/terms), and for Steam [here](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/digital/duelsoftheplaneswalkers.aspx?x=mtg/digital/dotpsteam/terms).


However, there will be a new opportunity to get a foil **Magic: The Gathering** card! **Duels of the Planeswalkers** 2012 will be available on June 15\*. And with it, a new crop of promo cards!


If you purchase [**Duels of the Planeswalkers** 2012](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/digital/duelsoftheplaneswalkers.aspx?x=mtg/digital/dotp/d12) when it comes out this summer (and we're hoping you do!), if eligible, you'll get an in-game code for a voucher you can redeem at your local participating game store for a physical promo card. There are three different cards, depending on which platform you're using. \*


\* Release date may vary by platform and region. Cards are available while supplies last. Void where prohibited. See the [official terms](http://archive.wizards.com/magic/digital/duelsoftheplaneswalkers.aspx?x=mtg/digital/dotp/terms).


People who buy the game via Steam for their PC will get Frost Titan, people on Xbox LIVE速 Arcade will get Grave Titan, and PlayStation速 3 users will get Inferno Titan!
