Sam is England's top pro player with over 30 pro point. Stefano has been to a number of pro tours ### Game 1


Sam leads with a [Leaden Myr](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leaden+Myr) and is able to make a [Cathodion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cathodion) desipite not finding a 3rd land. Stefano makes a few 2/2s in Tel-Jihad Wolf and Krark Clan Stoker. Sam is held off my the two creatures and is only able ot make two pieces of equipment [Leonin Bola](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leonin+Bola) and Banshes Blade. Stefano however fails to apply any real pressure with a Tel-Jihad Archers and Sam draws an artifact land and has an explosive turn, [Myr Enforcer](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Myr+Enforcer) Qumolox. Stefano has no comeback and the 5/4 flyer is Banshe Bladed up and starts the clock. A Sam then makes another huge affinty guy in Quicksliver Behmoth and uses his Leonini Bola to fore through enough damage to end the game in two swings, even Stefano's [Tornado Elemental](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tornado+Elemental) doess help.


Sam brings in two counters in Condersend and [Last Word](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Last+Word) for Stefano's Savage beating and Tonado Elemental


### Game 2


Stefano starts the game with a qucik three damage of a turn 3 Oxidia Golem. Whiel Sam starts with a Banshes Blade and a Yotain Soldier. Stefano answers this with [Thunderstaff](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thunderstaff) which will prevent the blade from gaining counters. Both players make random 2/2s and the board starts to fill up. Once again Sam is able to make a cheap Enforcer and soon it is swinging in. Chromshell Drake continues the affinty theme and Stefan is under a lot of pressure. Sam backs his creatures up with a Condersend on Stefano's next creature, a [Fangren Pathcutter](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fangren+Pathcutter). Stefano trys to stablize with a *Darksteel* Gargol, but Sam is able to use the [Banshee's Blade](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Banshee%27s+Blade) to force though damage each turn. The [Thunderstaff](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thunderstaff) reduces the damge but still after a few turns Stefano is reduced to 5 and Sam ends it with a Sharpnel Blast


Final Result 2-0 to Sam
