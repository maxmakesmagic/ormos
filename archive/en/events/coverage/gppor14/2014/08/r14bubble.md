Round 14 featured trios of familiar faces squaring off against each other for the fabled win-and-in match. In the last round of Swiss, only four teams would proceed to the Top 4 Team Draft.


On one side, No. 13 Ranked Player Samuel Black, Matt Severa, and Gaudenis Vidugiris. On the other side, the No. 3, 4, and 5 Ranked Players of the world respectively, Owen Turtenwald, William Jensen, Reid Duke.


Only one of these teams will advance. Which will it be?


**Severa vs. Jensen**


With both Severa and Jensen armed with aggressive red decks – Severa sporting some black and Jensen splashing green for [Kird Chieftain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kird+Chieftain)'s ability – it was no surprise to see these two finish up with ample time on the clock in three games.

The two traded blows in record time in the match, but the third game quickly became a lopsided affair when Severa's [Chandra, Pyromaster](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chandra%2C+Pyromaster) was outclassed by the hard-hitting [Scuttling Doom Engine](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scuttling+Doom+Engine) from Jensen. Aside from having one of the coolest names to shout in a crowded room full of *Magic* players, the Doom Engine made quick work of Severa's Planeswalker, and then Severa himself over a couple of turns.



**Black vs. Turtenwald**


Black's [Soul of Zendikar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soul+of+Zendikar) after both players cleared through each others' cards in hands gave him the upper hand, and Turtenwald was unable to catch up in the first game.


The second game was a particularly interesting affair, as Black had a slew of high-powered threats. [Soul of Zendikar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Soul+of+Zendikar), [Genesis Hydra](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Genesis+Hydra), multiple [Illusory Angel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Illusory+Angel)s, along with some [Void Snare](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Void+Snare)s to keep Turtenwald off of [Avacyn, Guardian Angel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Avacyn%2C+Guardian+Angel) looked like it would be enough. However, Black was unable to push through on those key turns, and Turtenwald's Avacyn did a fine job of holding back all of Black's forces.


However, before their match was able to finish...


**Vidugiris vs. Duke**


Vidugiris and Duke were into their third game while Black and Turtenwald were neck-deep into the second game. While the two were 1-1 going into the round, it was Duke who pulled out ahead in the third game. While [Paragon of New Dawns](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Paragon+of+New+Dawns) bolstered Vidugiris's [Raise the Alarm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Raise+the+Alarm) tokens, [Triplicate Spirits](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Triplicate+Spirits) proved to be too much of a commitment, as Duke aimed [Stab Wound](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stab+Wound) at the Paragon so that [Festergloom](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Festergloom) could leave Vidugiris with an empty board.

After that, Vidugiris had little chance to get back into the game, as Duke's Nightfire Ghoul and grip full of spells made things elementary.
