The *Ravnica* card **[Darkblast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Darkblast)** is a subtly tricky card. As the only instant with the Dredge mechanic, it is the only card you can cast, dredge and cast again in the same turn (without help from other effects).

Say there's a 2/2 [Boros Guildmage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Boros+Guildmage) making your life hard. During your upkeep, before you draw your card for the turn, [Darkblast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Darkblast) it to give it -1/-1. During your draw step, instead of drawing your card for the turn, dredge [Darkblast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Darkblast) back into your hand. The [Boros Guildmage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Boros+Guildmage) is still 1/1. During your main phase, [Darkblast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Darkblast) it again and wave bye-bye.

If you have a way to draw multiple cards per turn, a single copy of [Darkblast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Darkblast) can take down creatures even bigger than 2/2, if you're willing to dredge away hunks of your library!
