![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/digital/magiconline/MOCS2011winner.jpg)Think you have the skill to be one of the best **Magic Online** players around and earn your share of a $100,000 USD prize pool? Find out by earning your chance to go head-to-head against the defending 2011 **Magic Online** champion, Reid Duke, and fifteen other competitors in the 2012 **Magic Online** Championship Series. 

 Increased to a field of sixteen finalists for 2012, the **Magic Online** Championship Series (MOCS) features more chances than ever for players to earn an invitation to the **Magic Online** Championship to be held in 2013. The sixteen 2012 **Magic Online** Championship finalists will include: 

* The defending 2011 **Magic Online** champion, Reid Duke
* 12 individual **Magic Online** Championship Series season winners
* The MOCS Player-of-the-Year Championship winner
* 2 MOCS Last Chance Qualifier winners

  
 Also new for 2012, Qualifier Points (QPs) will be represented by digital objects that will be added to your collection at the completion of the event in which you earned them! This lets you track your QPs in your collection as you earn them right in **Magic Online**! 

In addition, you will use the Qualifier Points added to your collection each season to join the End-of-Season Championships (which now include prizes for twice as many players!). Take a peek at what the Season 1 Qualifier Point looks like.

**MAGIC ONLINE CHAMPIONSHIP SERIES ELIGIBILITY** 



* All **Magic Online** players who meet the eligibility requirements set forth herein are eligible to compete in this online tournament series. All **Magic Online** players are eligible to compete in the 2012 **Magic Online** Championship Series except (a) players who are otherwise ineligible to engage in tournament play pursuant to the [**Magic Online** User Agreement](http://wizards.custhelp.com/cgi-bin/wizards.cfg/php/enduser/std_adp.php?p_faqid=1358)  and (b) employees or contractors of Wizards of the Coast LLC (“Wizards”), Hasbro or each of their respective subsidiaries or affiliates or their advertising or promotion agencies, or those who are domiciled with any such person, or those who have been disqualified for other reasons (see below). This is a skill-based tournament based on a player's ability to defeat other players.
* Players will be disqualified if they are suspended from **Magic Online** for any reason, including without limitation a violation of the [**Magic Online** User Agreement](http://wizards.custhelp.com/cgi-bin/wizards.cfg/php/enduser/std_adp.php?p_faqid=1358) .
* Although players may have multiple accounts qualified for an End-of-Season Championship or the Player of the Year Championship, players are not permitted to have more than one of their accounts entered in any single event at one time. Players are not permitted to have any accounts entered in events played by other players for any reason. If a player is discovered to have more than one account playing in any End-of-Season Championship or championship event before, during, or after the event, Wizards may take action against that player's account(s), up to and including disqualification with no refund of product and/or event tickets, suspension of the offending account(s), and/or termination of the offending account(s). Using an account other than your own, allowing any other player to use your account, selling your account, and other similar actions are all violations of the [**Magic Online** User Agreement](http://wizards.custhelp.com/cgi-bin/wizards.cfg/php/enduser/std_adp.php?p_faqid=1358) . If you play in **Magic Online** events, win, and expect to get your prize, be very, very sure you are playing on your own account. We do not recognize excuses, such as "I and a friend jointly own the account," "It's my brother's account but he gave it to me," or similar. The only exception is an adult may authorize a single dependent child age 13-18 to play on an account that the adult has established.
* Wizards of the Coast reserves the right to reschedule and/or restart games and matches as needed. Such decisions will be announced on the **Magic Online** website and/or within the **Magic Online** client as needed.
* To be eligible to participate in the **Magic Online** Championship Series, the following requirements must be met:
	+ All **Magic Online** players must be at least 13 or older. A championship player between the ages of 13 and 18 will be required to get a parent or guardian's signature on the required waiver and consent forms as explained below.
	+ Players must have Internet access.
	+ Players must have access to a personal computer.
	+ Players must be **Magic Online** account holders in good standing and in compliance with the [**Magic Online** User Agreement](http://wizards.custhelp.com/cgi-bin/wizards.cfg/php/enduser/std_adp.php?p_faqid=1358) .


**2012 MAGIC ONLINE CHAMPIONSHIP SERIES STRUCTURE**  
 The 2012 **Magic Online** Championship Series will use the following structure: 

* Seasons: The 2012 **Magic Online** Championship Series will be divided into twelve (12) separate seasons. Each season's duration is four (4) weeks. Each season's start and end date are listed in the schedule below.
* Qualifier Points: During each season, a number of **Magic Online** events will offer the opportunity to earn Qualifier Points (QPs). These MOCS qualifying events are restricted to scheduled events and queues that have successfully completed with at least eight (8) players and include Qualifier Points (QPs) listed as part of their prize structure. The number of Qualifier Points (QPs) offered will vary by event. Points earned in a season do not carry over to any other season. See the table below for more information about Qualifier Points (QPs).
* Earning Qualifier Points (QPs): At the end of each specified tournament, all participants may earn Qualifier Points (QPs) based upon their final rank or points standing in the tournament.
* End-of-Season Championships: At the end of each season, all players who have earned sufficient QPs may join and participate in the corresponding End-of-Season Championship. The winner of each End-of-Season Championship will earn an invitation to participate in the 2012 **Magic Online** Championship to be held in 2013. Qualifier Points (QPs) earned towards End-of-Season Championships are season specific and cannot be used to join any other End-of-Season Championship.
* Player of the Year: Wizards of the Coast will track the cumulative Qualifier Points (QPs) of each player and maintain the following [Player of the Year leaderboards](/en/articles/archive/building-budget/2011-magic-online-player-year-standings-2009-04-09): Constructed and Limited. After the end of the twelfth season, players who are ranked in the top 150 of each leaderboard will be invited to play in the 2012 **Magic Online** Player of the Year Championship tournament held on December 15, 2012. The winner of the Player of the Year Championship will be invited to participate in the 2012 **Magic Online** Championship.
* Last-Chance Qualifiers: **Magic Online** will host two 2012 **Magic Online** Championship Series Last-Chance Qualifier tournaments (MOCS LCQ) on December 22 and December 29, 2012. These tournaments will be open to all eligible players not already invited to the 2012 **Magic Online** Championship. The winner of each MOCS LCQ will be invited to participate in the 2012 **Magic Online** Championship to be held in 2013.


**CONNECTIVITY**  
 Due to the nature of computers and the Internet, Wizards of the Coast is not responsible for the results of any disconnection or network problems experienced by players. 


**QUALIFIER POINTS**
  
 In addition to the normal prizes for tournaments, high finishing players in MOCS qualifying events can earn Qualifier Points (QPs) as well. QPs will vary by event, but some common examples are listed in the table below. 






|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Tournament Type** | **Finish** | **QPs** |
| Premier Event with Top 8 Playoff  | 1st Place | 6 |
| Premier Event with Top 8 Playoff  | 2nd Place | 5 |
| Premier Event with Top 8 Playoff  | 3rd-4th Place | 4 |
| Premier Event with Top 8 Playoff  | 5th-8th Place | 3 |

| 6-Round Event (scheduled or queue) | 5-1 Record | 2 |
| 6-Round Event (scheduled or queue) | 4-2 Record | 1 |
| 4-Round Event (scheduled or queue) | 4-0 Record | 3 |
| 4-Round Event (scheduled or queue) | 3-1 Record | 1 |
| 3-Round Event (scheduled or queue) | 3-0Record | 1 |

 Full details of an event's prize structure and the QPs offered can be found in the [Wizards of the Coast Knowledge Base](http://wizards.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/489) or when an event is announced on the [**Magic Online** What's Happening page](/en/articles/archive/2009-06-29) . Individual events may vary from the examples listed above. 

Different tournaments or formats may be called out and offer increased or reduced amounts of QPs each season. This adjusted QP schedule will be announced a minimum of one week prior to the start of a season. 

In addition, Wizards of the Coast reserves the right to add/remove qualifying formats, alter events that award Qualifier Points (QPs), and/or adjust the number of QPs offered by any event with a minimum of 24 hours notice. 


**Note:** Tournaments that are part of the MOCS (such as End-of-Season Championships) do not award QPs. 


**END-OF-SEASON CHAMPIONSHIP STRUCTURE**
  
 The End-of-Season Championships are open only to players who earned sufficient Qualifier Points in the appropriate season. Players must use fifteen (15) QPs to join the End-of-Season Championship. 

Each MOCS season begins after the scheduled maintenance on its Start Date and ends with the scheduled maintenance on its End Date. If for any reason there is no scheduled maintenance on those dates, the start and stop time will be 8:00 AM PST (or PDT when appropriate). 

 Qualifier Points are season specific and can only be used for the season in which they are earned. QPs earned in previous season cannot used to enter or applied towards later End-of-Season Championships. Qualifier Points are not tradable and are for the sole use of the player who has earned them. Unused QPs in each player's collection will be removed at the conclusion of the 2012 **Magic Online** Championship Series. 


**END-OF-SEASON CHAMPIONSHIP PARTICIPATION**
  
 A player must have earned at least 15 Qualifier Points to be eligible to join that season's End-of-Season Championships. In addition, players can earn byes in the championship based on the following QP total: 






|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **QPs** | **Benefit** |
| 15-24 | Qualified for End-of-Season Championship |
| 25-34 | Qualified for End-of-Season Championship with one awarded bye |
| 35+ | Qualified for End-of-Season Championship with two awarded byes  |

It is the player's responsibility to verify that they have the correct number of QPs required to enter and join the End-of-Season Championship PRIOR to its start time. If a player believes he or she should be qualified and is unable to join the End-of-Season Championship, they will need to contact customer service prior to the start of the event. 

All players who qualify for the End-of-Season Championship will automatically receive a copy of that season's promo card awarded to their qualifying account during the scheduled maintenance period prior to the End-of-Season Championship. If for any reason there is no scheduled maintenance on that date, the promo card will be awarded during the next scheduled maintenance period.
