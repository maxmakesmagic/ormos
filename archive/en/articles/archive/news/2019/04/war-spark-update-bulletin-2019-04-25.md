Hello everyone!


We're coming to you live this time from Tolaria on Dominaria. No, not Ravnica. Have you *seen* what's going on there? Zombie Hippos, battalions of Angels, and a giant Boar God that won't even answer one simple prayer for some bacon? And guilds *working together*? Brrr. No, Tolaria is quite nice this time of year.


There's not so much to say this time around, since most of the smaller incidental "Wouldn't this be nice" changes are coming with *Core Set 2020* in a few months. Read on for the rules and Oracle updates, and I'll see you all again in July!


As usual, you'll be able to find the [Comprehensive Rules here](http://magic.wizards.com/en/game-info/gameplay/rules-and-formats/rules) on our website, and Oracle text updated in [Gatherer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/)â€”at this time, one or both of those might not be updated just yet, so I'm describing a general truth here. Keep in mind that this article was written before the rules changes were finalized in editing, so there may be minor deviations from what I describe below.
