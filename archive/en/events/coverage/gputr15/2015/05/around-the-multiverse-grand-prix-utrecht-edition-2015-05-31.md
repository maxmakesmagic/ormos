This may be the grandest of all Grand Prix weekends, but it is also a special occasion to celebrate and commemorate all things *Magic*, the game's heritage and its players. For over two decades now, *Magic*: The Gathering has remained the most popular trading card game of the world, with more than 20 million fans and active players across all ages and nationalities.



The coverage team as well as our friends from the community team have gathered impressions from the vibrant and diverse culture of the game, the friendships formed, the most cherished moments, the shared histories of as many people as possible, but of course the following can only be a snapshot …
