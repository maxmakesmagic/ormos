![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gpham02/962.jpg)Round 4 is normally when the pro giants enter the arena but most of them are in Pro Tour Boston. It still isn’t that easy for those remaining as a very successful trial season in the host nation had produced a lot of players with 3 byes. Local Hamburg player Georg Sheljasov was one such recipient. His Belgian opponent Geoffrey Siron finished ninth at Pro Tour Osaka and has played on the Masters.

Sheljasov didn’t really have a quick start, laying island, forest, island while Siron’s White Weenie deck got very aggro with two [Patrol Hound](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Patrol+Hound)s and two [Tireless Tribe](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tireless+Tribe) on the table at the end of turn 3. An end step [Cunning Wish](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cunning+Wish) for a [Moment's Peace](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Moment%27s+Peace) showed Sheljasov was not playing a usual Blue-Green beatdown deck. This was confirmed when his fourth land was a [Krosan Verge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Krosan+Verge). Siron dumped two [Deep Analysis](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deep+Analysis) and a [Battle Screech](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Battle+Screech) into the graveyard with [Quiet Speculation](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Quiet+Speculation).

Sheljasov was happy to fog the next attack and the Verge found the plains he needed to Wrath away Siron’s force. The Belgian flashed back a second analysis to restock his forces, but only a non-too impressive [Tireless Tribe](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tireless+Tribe).

Siron had been keeping his mana open though and this meant he could Logic the Wake and the Tribe suddenly became a lot more threatening with a [Divine Sacrament](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Divine+Sacrament) on the board and more than seven cards in the graveyard.

Sheljasov wasn’t finished busting out power cards and a [Mirari](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mirari) looked very ominous. The German flashed back [Moment's Peace](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Moment%27s+Peace) to prevent lethal damage and then cast a second [Cunning Wish](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cunning+Wish) and forked it with [Mirari](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mirari). At this point Siron scooped as Sheljasov had unlimited access to [Cunning Wish](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cunning+Wish) and [Moment's Peace](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Moment%27s+Peace).

Sheljasov 1-0 Siron

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gpham02/965.jpg)Siron started game two with a turn 1 [Confessor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Confessor), proving the lengths white has to go to find creatures in this format. The Belgian developed his hand with a [Quiet Speculation](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Quiet+Speculation) for two [Deep Analysis](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deep+Analysis) and a [Battle Screech](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Battle+Screech). His side of the table then started to resemble a horrific draft accident as a [Phantatog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phantatog) joined the [Confessor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Confessor) and a [Tireless Tribe](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tireless+Tribe). He tapped all his white creatures to flash back the Screech.

Meanwhile Sheljasov was happy to slowly develop his mana base with a Verge and [Far Wanderings](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Far+Wanderings). [Moment's Peace](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Moment%27s+Peace) slowed down some damage but his [Kirtar's Wrath](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kirtar%27s+Wrath) failed to get past Siron’s [Envelop](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Envelop).

The next turn was absolutely savage as Siron dropped [Divine Sacrament](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Divine+Sacrament), pitched the remainder of his hand to [Phantatog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phantatog), making it a 6/7, gaining five life off the [Confessor](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Confessor), and also gaining threshold for the Sacrament. Siron’s “bad draft deck” had suddenly put Georg Sheljasov on the receiving end of a 21 point kick in the nuts.

Not exactly how the format is expected to go.

Sheljasov 1-1 Siron.

After such excitement game three was very much an anti-climax as Siron mulliganed to five and stuck on one island. He found a plains to make a [Patrol Hound](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Patrol+Hound) just after Sheljasov had made [Mirari’s Wake](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mirari%E2%80%99s+Wake). [Mirari](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mirari) followed and a second [Krosan Verge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Krosan+Verge) gave the German a ridiculous 14 points of available mana.

The abuse began. [Quiet Speculation](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Quiet+Speculation) fetched [Deep Analysis](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deep+Analysis). This was flashed back and forked to give the German four cards. He then cast [Far Wanderings](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Far+Wanderings) thinking he had threshold but a quick count revealed he could only fetch one land.

Siron dropped [Divine Sacrament](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Divine+Sacrament) but it was a little late as Sheljasov annihilated his team with [Kirtar's Wrath](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kirtar%27s+Wrath), gaining two spirit tokens to rub salt into the wound. Siron’s own Sacrament was against him as it boosted the spirit tokens to 3/3. When the Wish engine started rolling it seemed no way the German player could lose.

The game then got a little controversial. Sheljasov discarded, passed the turn and then realized he still had more than seven cards in his hand. A judge was called and after some thought and consultation with the head judge it was decided that the German couldn’t have got enough of an advantage and was only awarded a warning for major procedural error. The game was allowed to continue and Sheljasov Synced Siron’s last hope in a flashed back [Battle Screech](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Battle+Screech).

Georg Sheljasov beat Geoffrey Siron 2-1
