R&D's creative team plus a **Magic** artist is a powerful and sometimes *subtle* combination. Once design and development construct a card's mechanic, the creative team weaves it conceptually into the setting, and the artist realizes that vision in paint and pixels. In the course of all this collaboration, the **Magic** card gets flooded in rich detail, which all gets tucked into a few square inches of cardboard. We'd like to take a moment to zoom in on a few of the more subtle *Coldsnap* art pieces so you can appreciate some of that detail.

  
*[Krovikan Scoundrel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Krovikan+Scoundrel) art by Ralph Horsley*Krovikan Scoundrel depicts a petty criminal from the plague-stricken city of Krov, fingering some coins he has recently plundered. In the upper left you can see the victim of his crime—and the victim's sliced-open coin purse.

  
*[Mystic Melting](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mystic+Melting) art by Chippy*Green has an answer to the Ice-Phyrexian war machines animated by Heidar—a quick thaw and those machines grind to a halt. In the art of [Mystic Melting](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mystic+Melting), you can see two travelers who have journeyed to see the ruined Phyrexian carcass.

  
*[Disciple of Tevesh Szat](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Disciple+of+Tevesh+Szat) art by Pete Venters*This creepy disciple to the dark lord Tevesh Szat performs a bloodletting ritual in his lair. Note how, in the disciple's scrying pool, you can see a barbarian suffering the effects of the ritual.
