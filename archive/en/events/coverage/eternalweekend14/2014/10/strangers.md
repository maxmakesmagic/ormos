 "So you'll draw three and I'll put two back?" Coming into The Legacy Championship, people expected a lot of [Treasure Cruise](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treasure+Cruise), White Weenie variants, Elves, and control strategies, but Legacy is a crazy format where virtually anything is possible. Let's talk about some of the strangest cards and interactions we've seen today.




 Time and time again we've seen [Notion Thief](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Notion+Thief) create veritable blowouts against [Brainstorm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brainstorm), [Treasure Cruise](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treasure+Cruise), and [Jace, the Mind Sculptor](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Jace%2C+the+Mind+Sculptor).
