*Magic Online* Super Qualifiers
-------------------------------


As part of our initiatives to give you [more ways to play at home](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/news/FNM_at_Home), we wanted to provide options for you to play at the highest levels for competitive stakes. Therefore, in light of the [changes to the tabletop Players Tour Qualifiers announced earlier](https://magic.gg/news/changes-to-qualifiers-for-players-tour-series-2-events-and-schedule), we're adding a new series of qualifiers to [*Magic Online*](https://magic.wizards.com/en/content/what-magic-online-magic-online-products-game-info) to provide additional ways for players to compete and qualify for upcoming Players Tour events: *Magic Online* Super Qualifiers. This is the final week of Super Qualifiers feeding into the [Players Tour events on *MTG Arena* in mid-June](https://magic.gg/news/whats-next-for-the-magic-esports-2020-partial-season).


Get event info [here](https://magic.wizards.com/en/mtgo/premier-play-2020#sq), read more about MTGO Super Qualifiers [here](https://magic.gg/news/announcing-magic-online-super-qualifiers), or check out the schedule below:


**Note**: The companion mechanic update is launching on *Magic Online* the morning of Wednesday, June 3. To prevent this change from occurring in the middle of a major event, we're are moving the Pioneer Super Qualifier from 6 a.m. PT Wednesday, June 3, to 6 a.m. PT on Saturday, June 6. We appreciate your understanding.

Showcase Challenge Weekend
--------------------------


Players looking to prove their mettle against the best players in *Magic Online* will want to use their QPs to enter *Magic Online* Champions Showcase (MOCS) events such as the returning Showcase Challenges this weekend. These MOCS events are a set of linked events designed to highlight the best players on *Magic Online* each season, culminating in the Champions Showcase and its prize pool of $70,000 and a Players Tour Finals invitation.


First up on Saturday, June 6, we have the Standard (6 a.m. PT), Modern (8 a.m. PT), and Vintage (10 a.m. PT) Showcase Challenges. Then on Sunday, June 7, we finish off with the Pioneer (6 a.m. PT), Legacy (8 a.m. PT), and *Ikoria: Lair of Behemoths* Sealed (9 a.m. PT) Showcase Challenges. Each of these events requires 40 QPs to enter. The Top 8 finishers from each event will earn a qualification token to enter the appropriate Showcase Qualifier in August.

Build Notes
-----------


General | The rules for *Ikoria*'s companion mechanic have changed. Please see the [announcement article](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/news/june-1-2020-banned-and-restricted-announcement) for more information.


Duel Scene | [Tawnos, Urza's Apprentice](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tawnos%2C+Urza%27s+Apprentice) can once again activate his ability.


Duel Scene | Creating a copy of a creature that enters with a number of +1/+1 counters related to a value of X in its mana cost will no longer cause the copy to enter with those counters as well. Sorry, Hydras. You're cool, but you're not supposed to be that cool.


Duel Scene | [Selvala, Explorer Returned](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Selvala%2C+Explorer%C2%A0Returned) has returned to a state in which she can use her activated ability without restarting the game.


Duel Scene | [Thief of Blood](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thief+of+Blood) once again gets +1/+1 counters from its ability when it enters the battlefield even without being cast.


Duel Scene | [Trinisphere](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Trinisphere) has been taught a lesson around how much X spells actually cost. It will no longer ask players to pay extra mana, and it's sorry that it did.


Duel Scene | Changelings will now correctly count as having the appropriate creature type for [Kaheera, the Orphanguard](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kaheera%2C+the+Orphanguard)'s companion ability.


Duel Scene | [Crypt of Agadeem](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crypt+of+Agadeem)'s second mana ability has been fully excavated and will produce the correct amount of mana again.


Duel Scene | [Aether Gust](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Aether+Gust) will now produce a game log entry regardless of the choices made on resolution.


Duel Scene | Several menus that were difficult to read are now easier to read.
