During the Ironroot Challenge, The Wizard wandered the floor and asked the competitors to justify some of their choices.


In between the 2nd, and 3rd round â€“ The Wizard found Sam Stoddard and asked him to explain why [Lingering Souls](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lingering+Souls) was included in his [Angelic Accord](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Angelic+Accord) + [Strionic Resonator](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Strionic+Resonator) deck.
