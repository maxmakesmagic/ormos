Brad Nelson usually gets extremely nervous before a Pro Tour. The 2010 Player of the Year is known for the energy he brings to every event, and he's the first to wear his emotions on his sleeve, which is why Nelson surprised even himself that he was so calm on Thursday as he registered for the Pro Tour that would begin the next morning.


It's easy to be calm when you're as confident in the format as Nelson is. 


While most other players in the room were finding the best version of Abzan Midrange or tweaking Jeskai Aggro, Nelson went his own way, building a unique red-white deck and eschewing a third color entirely. It led him to a 1-0 start to the Standard portion of the tournament after a 2-1 draft finish, and a Round 5 feature match against Seth Manfield.


Manfield, a Grand Prix Top 8 competitor last year in Dallas and Toronto, was one of those players who perfected Abzan midrange as part of Team TCGPlayer. He also finished the draft 2-1 before picking up a win in Standard.



The Games
=========



 Nelson won the roll to go first, something that his aggressive red-white deck certainly enjoyed, and the first exchange of the game was a [Magma Jet](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Magma+Jet) taking out Manfield's [Elvish Mystic](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elvish+Mystic).




 Next came a card that could reasonably be expected during the draft rounds of the tournament but was a complete shock to see during the Constructed portion: [Hordeling Outburst](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hordeling+Outburst).




 Nelson was determined to prove its worth, and after a combination of [Searing Blood](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Searing+Blood) and [Lightning Strike](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Strike) cleared away a [Siege Rhino](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Siege+Rhino), the tokens began to charge through. A [Stoke the Flames](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stoke+the+Flames) on [Courser of Kruphix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Courser+of+Kruphix) kept the path clear, and Manfield suddenly found himself in danger of dying to the angry goblins.




 A [Thoughtseize](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thoughtseize) cleared out another [Stoke the Flames](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stoke+the+Flames), but then came the words no one playing against a red deck wants to hear.




 "[Magma Jet](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Magma+Jet) you."





*Nelson's red spells go to work, all with the same general goal in mind.*
