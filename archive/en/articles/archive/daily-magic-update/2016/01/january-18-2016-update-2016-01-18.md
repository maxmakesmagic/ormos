The January 18, 2016 Update

The Daily *Magic* Update is a roundup of everything *Magic* you should know for today, January 18, 2016. Today's Update is brought to you by the [weekend, Prereleases, and premature B&R announcements](#whatpeople).


Today's Must See
================


1. [Banned List Announcement: January 2016](https://paste.ee/r/GZpYC) | MTG: Commander

[*Note: The site mtgcommander.net was down this morning. The link above is to the full text of the announcement off-site.*]


At least one group waited till Monday to reveal their banned and restricted list update, and this one might even garner more discussion than that other one. As someone who has used and abused Prophet of Kruphix since it was printed, I can't really argue with this. But since this is the internet, I'm sure someone will find a way to do just that.


After Those, Read, Watch, or Listen to These
============================================


1. [My 12-year-old son's first Prerelease](https://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/41em2q/my_12_year_old_sons_first_prerelease/) | Reddit | Cysec

Short and sweet almost beyond words, one Reddit user tells the heartwarming tale of his son's first Prerelease, and the way the community made him feel welcome.


I'm not even going to make a joke. This is just so...nice.


1. [Bloom and Twin Banned in Modern: What Now?](http://www.channelfireball.com/articles/bloom-and-twin-banned-in-modern-what-now/) | ChannelFireball | Neal Oliver

Neal Oliver was one of the first on the board with an examination of what the bannings mean for Modern. If your first thought wasn't "BURN DOWN EVERYTHING THIS IS THE WORST," and instead leaned toward "Okay, what now?" then this article is for you.


1. [The Girlfriend Bracket #42—Raging Tapeworms](http://www.gatheringmagic.com/erincampbell-011515-the-girlfriend-bracket-42-raging-tapeworms/) | The Girlfriend Bracket | Gathering Magic

One day is today, as The Girlfriend Bracket discussed a host of topics in their podcast that went up on Friday, including judge calls, taking their own oaths, Two-Headed Giant, *Oath of the Gatewatch*, and how much they like the new changes we've made to DailyMTG. Remember kids, flattery will get you everywhere.


What People Were Talking About This Weekend

Prereleases are great, and these tweets show just a sliver of why. Friendships are forged, gaming is had, and one of the best players on the planet claims to have been lucky to 4-0 a Prerelease.


For more tweets on Prerelease action, check out the [#MTGOGW](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23MTGOGW&src=tyah) hashtag.

So, as you might have heard, we moved up the [Banned and Restricted](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/news/january-18-2016-banned-and-restricted-announcement-2016-01-18) announcement by a couple days to counter speculation associated with a *Magic Online*-related leak. The community spent the weekend reacting to the news in different ways. Tons of people chimed in, including [Luis Scott-Vargas](https://twitter.com/lsv/status/688225321250762756), [Sam Black](https://twitter.com/SamuelHBlack/status/688325940217262081), [Paulo Vitor Damo da Rosa](https://twitter.com/PVDDR/status/688226967087218689), and [Nate Holt](https://twitter.com/WalkThePlanes/status/688410899196063744), among many, many others—[including basically everyone who has ever had a Reddit account](https://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/416yju/jan_18_banned_and_restricted_lists_update/).

Community Spotlight
===================


1. [InResponseConcede.com](http://inresponseconcede.com/)

Dominating the [*Legacy Cube* on *Magic Online*](http://magic.wizards.com/en/MTGO/articles/archive/magic-online/legacy-cube-updates-2015-01-04), but looking for more ways to challenge yourself? How about these [*Legacy Cube* achievements](http://inresponseconcede.com/2016/01/13/legacy-cube-achievements/), care of InResponseConcede.com. The site itself doesn't have a ton of content (read: two posts), but with the attention this one got over the weekend, I'd be shocked if it was the last thing to show up on this site.


Other Corners of the Internet Write About *Magic*
=================================================


1. [A *Magic* Developer Talks *Oath of the Gatewatch* and More](http://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2016/01/a-magic-developer-talks-oath-of-the-gatewatch-and.html)| Paste | Cameron Kunzelman

Paste, an online arts and lifestyle website, spoke with Ian Duke, lead developer of *Oath of the Gatewatch*, about, well, *Oath of the Gatewatch*. Ian Duke, fortunately for their reporter, spoke back.


Deck of the Day
===============


1. The Future of Jeskai in Modern?

With the banning of Splinter Twin, Jeskai-flavored decks are going to start looking elsewhere for inspiration. While Jeskai Ascendancy still exists as a viable combo option, that deck hasn't really proven itself a player on the Modern scene. But maybe LORDMORPETH has the answer? The *Magic Online* player recently finished [5-0 in a Modern League](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/mtgo-standings/modern-constructed-league-2016-01-17) with a pretty pure control deck featuring cards such as Tidings, Ajani Vengeant, and Supreme Verdict. Now able to better tap out with impunity from turn four on, could decks like this go further? Jace, Architect of Thought? Chandra, Pyromaster? Mulldrifter?!
