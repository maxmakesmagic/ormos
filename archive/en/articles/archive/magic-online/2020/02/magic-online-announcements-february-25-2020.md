Something Bugging You? Raise Your Voice with UserVoice.
-------------------------------------------------------


Since the beginning, *Magic Online*'s bug tracking has been based on reports sent into Customer Service that were then transferred to our Bug Blog. This is changing with our newly launched UserVoice system. This system allows you to publicly post issues you encounter, review issues that others have encountered, and vote to help clarify the relative importance of each issue. You can check it out at the *Magic Online* Customer Support page ([mtgo-support.wizards.com](https://mtgo-support.wizards.com/)) by clicking "Report a Bug."


This new system has several advantages over the old. For starters, this crowdsourced format will be a better real-time tracker of our known issues, and it will replace our Bug Blog. It also lets us respond directly to reported issues and lets you know what's being worked on, what needs more information, or what is fixed. The UserVoice structure makes it easier to ask follow-up questions if need be, though it's still important to give as much information as possible when reporting a bug so we can prioritize issues quickly. Most importantly, the ability for players to vote on the issues that are impacting them improves our team's ability to identify which issues are most important to players without relying on data from reimbursement requests.


Please note that this new bug tracking system doesn't change the way that reimbursement requests work. For those, you'll go to the same page ([mtgo-support.wizards.com](https://mtgo-support.wizards.com/)) and click "Request Reimbursement," just like you do now. Reports we gather in this manner will be added to UserVoice as well so that list stays accurate.


Since it is new, the system is still sparsely populated. You won't see every known issue right now. We'll move items from the Bug Blog or add other known issues over time, but UserVoice is open and ready for you now. As issues crop up while you're playing, please check to see if they're in UserVoice. If you find them, upvote them! If it's not there, go ahead and post them, providing as much detail as you can. By doing this, you're helping us make *Magic Online* the best it can be.

Showcase Challenge Weekend
--------------------------


Players looking to prove their mettle against the best players in *Magic Online* will want to use their QPs to enter *Magic Online* Champions Showcase (MOCS) events, starting with the Showcase Challenges this weekend. These MOCS events are a set of linked events designed to highlight the best players on *Magic Online* each season, culminating in the Champions Showcase and its prize pool of $70,000 and a Players Tour Finals invitation.


First up on Saturday, we have the Standard (6 a.m. PT), Modern (8 a.m. PT), and *Theros Beyond Death* Sealed (9 a.m. PT) Showcase Challenges.

Build Notes
-----------


General | If a player is unable to lose the game through effects such as the emblem created by [Gideon of the Trials](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Gideon+of+the+Trials) and another player resolves an effect that would cause them to win the game such as the triggered ability of [Thassa's Oracle](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thassa%27s+Oracle), the game now correctly plays on.


General | Certain effects that target creatures that are enchanted, such as the triggered ability of [Nyx Herald](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nyx+Herald), are correctly no longer able to target creatures that are equipped.


Client | Various links, graphics, and text throughout the client have been updated.


Collection | An issue with saving and importing multiple decks during a Sealed scheduled event has been corrected.
