GRAND PRIX DAYTONA BEACH 2007
-----------------------------


Manfield Triumphs in Daytona Beach
==================================











 
![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gpday07/topseth.jpg) Congratulations to Seth Manfield, Grand Prix Daytona Champion!


The Philadelphia player was recently identified by one Magic columnist as a rising star and he lived up to the advance billing. His treefolk deck splintered the competition which included Grand Prix Minneapolis Champion Alex Lieberman and two-time pro Tour Top 8 competitor Paulo Vitor Damo da Rosa. In the finals Seth's Cloudcrown Oaks, Bog-Strider Ash, and Doran, the Siege Tower proved to be be too tough for Paulo's speedy black-red removal.


This was the last event of the 2007 season before Worlds and players came here hoping to level up and jockey for position in the Player of the Year race. The two big winners on that front were Tomoharu Saito who picked up three more points with a Top 16 finish and Top 8 competitor Steven Wolansky who inched closer to the lead in the Rookie of the Year race. Don't forget Paulo who came into the event with 30 points and left more than halfway toward Level 5.


Tune into the Tournament Center in less than three weeks for the World Championships when those races -- and much, much more -- will be settled once and for all!
