The Release Notes include information concerning the release of a new *Magic: The Gathering* set, as well as a collection of clarifications and rulings involving that set’s cards. It’s intended to make playing with the new cards more fun by clearing up the common misconceptions and confusion inevitably caused by new mechanics and interactions. As future sets are released, updates to the *Magic* rules may cause some of this information to become outdated. If you can’t find the answer you’re looking for here, please contact us at [**Wizards.com/CustomerService**](http://www.wizards.com/CustomerService).


The “General Notes” section includes release information and explains the mechanics and concepts in the set.


The “Card-Specific Notes” section contains answers to the most important, most common, and most confusing questions players might ask about cards in the set. Items in the “Card-Specific Notes” section include full card text for your reference. Not all cards in the set are listed.

**Masterpiece Series: *Kaladesh Inventions***


The best and brightest of Kaladesh have gathered at the Inventors’ Fair to show off their innovations—only to have them confiscated by the Consulate and turned against their makers. These *Kaladesh Inventions* are sure to command attention, featuring exciting artifacts from *Magic* history in a unique filigree frame.


* There are 54 cards in the *Kaladesh Inventions* set. The first 30 of these cards appear in *Kaladesh* booster packs. The remaining 24 cards appear in *Aether Revolt* booster packs. *Kaladesh Inventions* cards have their own expansion symbol.
* *Kaladesh Inventions* cards appearing in booster packs are playable in any Limited event using those booster packs. In a Sealed Deck tournament, those cards are part of your card pool. In a Booster Draft tournament, you must draft those cards for them to be included in your card pool.
* However, *Kaladesh Inventions* cards are not legal in any Constructed format the cards weren’t legal in before. Appearing in *Kaladesh* or *Aether Revolt* booster packs does not make them legal in Standard.
* Premium foil English *Kaladesh Inventions* cards appear in booster packs of all languages.
* *Kaladesh Inventions* cards are extremely rare. If you happen to open one, consider yourself quite fortunate!



---

**New Keyword Ability: Improvise**


The artificers of Kaladesh once worked without a care in the world other than making brilliant inventions. Now, they’ve been mobilized for the revolution. The improvise keyword shows off these inventors’ ability to craft increasingly powerful weapons and gadgets using whatever artifacts they have around.


![](https://media.wizards.com/2016/c1lRLirbrl_AER/en_UJy7SBBy4F.png)


Reverse Engineer  

3UU  

Sorcery  

Improvise *(Your artifacts can help cast this spell. Each artifact you tap after you’re done activating mana abilities pays for 1.)*  

Draw three cards.


The official rules for improvise are as follows:


702.125. Improvise


702.125a Improvise is a static ability that functions while the spell with improvise is on the stack. “Improvise” means “For each generic mana in this spell’s total cost, you may tap an untapped artifact you control rather than pay that mana.”


702.125b The improvise ability isn’t an additional or alternative cost and applies only after the total cost of the spell with improvise is determined.


702.125c Multiple instances of improvise on the same spell are redundant.


* Improvise doesn’t change a spell’s mana cost or converted mana cost.
* When calculating a spell’s total cost, include any alternative costs, additional costs, or anything else that increases or reduces the cost to cast the spell. Improvise applies after the total cost is calculated.
* Because improvise isn’t an alternative cost, it can be used in conjunction with alternative costs.
* Improvise can’t pay for W, U, B, R, G, or C mana symbols in a spell’s total cost.
* Improvise can’t be used to pay for anything other than the cost of casting the spell. For example, it can’t be used during the resolution of an ability that says “Counter target spell unless its controller pays 3.”
* If an artifact you control has a mana ability with T in the cost, activating that ability while casting a spell with improvise will result in the artifact being tapped when you pay the spell’s costs. You won’t be able to tap it again for improvise. Similarly, if you sacrifice an artifact to activate a mana ability while casting a spell with improvise, that artifact won’t be on the battlefield when you pay the spell’s costs, so you won’t be able to tap it for improvise.
* When using improvise to cast a spell with X in its mana cost, first choose the value for X. That choice, plus any cost increases or decreases, will determine the spell’s total cost. Then you can tap artifacts you control to help pay that cost. For example, if you cast Whir of Invention (a spell with improvise and mana cost XUUU) and choose X to be 3, the total cost is 3UUU. If you tap two artifacts, you’ll have to pay 1UUU.
* Tapping an artifact won’t cause its abilities to stop applying unless those abilities say so.
* Equipment attached to a creature doesn’t become tapped when that creature becomes tapped, and tapping that Equipment doesn’t cause the creature to become tapped.



---

**New Ability Word: Revolt**


Abilities that begin with the “revolt” ability word check whether if a permanent you controlled left the battlefield this turn. An ability word appears in italics and has no rules meaning. Cards with revolt abilities represent the people of Kaladesh joining the revolution: if you take or break their inventions and imprison their friends and family, they will grow stronger and more determined.


![](https://media.wizards.com/2016/c1lRLirbrl_AER/en_bE5a6J7tNU.png)


Call for Unity  

3WW  

Enchantment  
*Revolt* — At the beginning of your end step, if a permanent you controlled left the battlefield this turn, put a unity counter on Call for Unity.  

Creatures you control get +1/+1 for each unity counter on Call for Unity.


* Revolt abilities check only whether a permanent you controlled left the battlefield this turn or not. They don’t apply multiple times if more than one permanent you controlled left the battlefield. They don’t check whether the permanent that left the battlefield is still in the zone it moved to.
* Revolt abilities don’t care why the permanent left the battlefield, who caused it to move, or where it moved to. They’re equally satisfied by an artifact you sacrificed to pay a cost, a creature you controlled that was destroyed by Murder, or an enchantment you returned to your hand with Leave in the Dust.
* Tokens that leave the battlefield will satisfy a revolt ability.
* Energy counters aren’t permanents. Paying E won’t satisfy a revolt ability.
* All cards in the *Aether Revolt* set with triggered revolt abilities use an intervening “if” clause. A permanent you controlled must have left the battlefield earlier in the turn in order for these abilities to trigger; otherwise they do nothing. In other words, there’s no way to have the ability trigger if no permanent you controlled has left the battlefield that turn, even if you intend to have one do so in response to the triggered ability.



---

**Cycle: Expertise**


The Expertise cycle consists of five sorcery spells named after legendary creature cards in the set. Each has an effect and then lets you cast a card from your hand for free.


![](https://media.wizards.com/2016/c1lRLirbrl_AER/en_ahsrUA2fwL.png)


Kari Zev’s Expertise  

1RR  

Sorcery  

Gain control of target creature or Vehicle until end of turn. Untap it. It gains haste until end of turn.  

You may cast a card with converted mana cost 2 or less from your hand without paying its mana cost.


* If the Expertise spell you cast has any targets, and those targets become illegal before the spell resolves, the spell is countered and none of its effects happen. You won’t get to cast a free spell.
* A card’s converted mana cost is determined solely by the mana symbols printed in its upper right corner. The converted mana cost is the total amount of mana in that cost, regardless of color. For example, a card with mana cost 1UU has converted mana cost 3. Ignore any alternative costs, additional costs, cost increases, or cost reductions that could apply to it. A card with no mana cost has a converted mana cost of 0.
* If the card has X in its mana cost, you must choose 0 as the value of X when casting it without paying its mana cost.
* Effects that allow you to “cast” a card don’t allow you to play a land card.
* If you cast a card “without paying its mana cost,” you can’t pay any alternative costs, such as emerge costs. You can, however, pay additional costs. If the card has any mandatory additional costs, such as that of Cathartic Reunion, you must pay those to cast the card.
* While you’re casting your free spell, the Expertise spell is still on the stack. It will be put into its owner’s graveyard after the free spell is cast. The free spell can’t target the Expertise card in your graveyard. It can target the Expertise spell on the stack, but the Expertise spell will become an illegal target before the free spell resolves.
* Any triggered abilities that trigger while performing the Expertise spell’s first effect won’t be put onto the stack until after you’re done casting your free spell. They’re put onto the stack at the same time as any abilities that triggered while casting that spell regardless of the order in which those abilities triggered.



---

**Cycle: Implements**


What would an engineer do without a selection of finely-crafted tools? The *Aether Revolt* set provides you with a cycle of five artifacts with colored mana in their activation costs, and you get a new card to replace them when they break.


![](https://media.wizards.com/2016/c1lRLirbrl_AER/en_LQk8qNDhAv.png)


Implement of Combustion  

1  

Artifact  

R, Sacrifice Implement of Combustion: It deals 1 damage to target player.  

When Implement of Combustion is put into a graveyard from the battlefield, draw a card.


* An Implement’s last ability triggers no matter why it’s put into a graveyard from the battlefield. You don’t have to activate its first ability.
* If you activate an Implement’s first ability, you’ll draw a card from its second ability before the first ability resolves. If the first ability has a target, you need a legal target to activate that ability, and you choose that target before seeing what card you’ll draw.

***Aether Revolt*** **Story Spotlight Cards**


There are many important moments in the *Aether Revolt* story, but the five most crucial—called “story spotlights”—are shown on cards. You can read more about these events in the official *Magic* fiction at **[mtgstory.com](http://mtgstory.com/)**.


Story spotlight 1: Consulate Crackdown


Story spotlight 2: Pia’s Revolution


Story spotlight 3: Disallow


Story spotlight 4: Battle at the Bridge


Story spotlight 5: Dark Intimations


The story spotlight cards in this set feature a Planeswalker symbol icon in their text boxes. The icon has no effect on game play. The printed cards also include the **[mtgstory.com](http://mtgstory.com/)** URL and a number indicating the sequence of the cards in the story.

**Returning *Kaladesh* Themes and Mechanics**


*Aether Revolt* features a number of returning mechanics from the *Kaladesh* set. For more information on energy, Vehicles, and crew, please see the [*Kaladesh* Release Notes](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/feature/kaladesh-release-notes-2016-09-16).

Enchant creature or Vehicle  

As long as enchanted permanent is a Vehicle, it’s a creature in addition to its other types.  

Enchanted creature gets +2/+2 and has flying.


* If Aerial Modification becomes unattached from a Vehicle that’s attacking or blocking, that Vehicle will be removed from combat unless another effect (such as its crew ability) is also making it a creature.

* The triggered ability triggers both when Aetherwind Basker enters the battlefield and whenever it attacks. You don’t have to choose only one.

---

![](https://media.wizards.com/2016/c1lRLirbrl_AER/en_WOsIQJEGF3.png)


Aid from the Cowl  

3GG  

Enchantment  
*Revolt* — At the beginning of your end step, if a permanent you controlled left the battlefield this turn, reveal the top card of your library. If it’s a permanent card, you may put it onto the battlefield. Otherwise, you may put it on the bottom of your library.


* If the revealed card is not a permanent card or if you choose not to put it onto the battlefield, you may put it on the bottom of your library. If you don’t, it remains on top of your library.
* A permanent card is an artifact, creature, enchantment, land, or planeswalker card.
* If a permanent put onto the battlefield this way has an ability that triggers at the beginning of your end step, it won’t trigger during this end step.



---

![](https://media.wizards.com/2016/c1lRLirbrl_AER/en_SDQw1NFdZl.png)


Ajani Unyielding  

4GW

−2: Exile target creature. Its controller gains life equal to its power.  

−9: Put five +1/+1 counters on each creature you control and five loyalty counters on each other planeswalker you control.


* A nonland permanent card is an artifact, creature, enchantment, or planeswalker card.
* The amount of life gained from Ajani’s second ability is equal to power of the creature as it last existed on the battlefield.



---

![](https://media.wizards.com/2016/c1lRLirbrl_AER/en_7xxmuTIsqj.png)


Ajani, Valiant Protector *(Planeswalker Deck only)*  

4GW  

Planeswalker — Ajani  

4  

+2: Put two +1/+1 counters on up to one target creature.  

+1: Reveal cards from the top of your library until you reveal a creature card. Put that card into your hand and the rest on the bottom of your library in a random order.  

−11: Put X +1/+1 counters on target creature, where X is your life total. That creature gains trample until end of turn.


* If you don’t have a creature card in your library while resolving Ajani’s second ability, you’ll reveal your library and then randomize it.
* The value of X for Ajani’s third ability is determined only as it resolves. The number of +1/+1 counters on the creature won’t change later if your life total changes.



---

![](https://media.wizards.com/2016/c1lRLirbrl_AER/en_ZHnUtsPBjw.png)


Ajani’s Aid *(Planeswalker Deck only)*  

2GW  

Enchantment  

When Ajani’s Aid enters the battlefield, you may search your library and/or graveyard for a card named Ajani, Valiant Protector, reveal it, and put it into your hand. If you search your library this way, shuffle it.  

Sacrifice Ajani’s Aid: Prevent all combat damage a creature of your choice would deal this turn.


* The last ability of Ajani’s Aid doesn’t target anything. You choose a source of damage as the ability resolves.
* You can activate the last ability even if there is no creature about to deal combat damage, or even no creature at all. No damage will be prevented, but it will enable your revolt abilities.



---

![](https://media.wizards.com/2016/c1lRLirbrl_AER/en_36vMwLrEcg.png)


Baral, Chief of Compliance  

1U  

Legendary Creature — Human Wizard  

1/3  

Instant and sorcery spells you cast cost 1 less to cast.  

Whenever a spell or ability you control counters a spell, you may draw a card. If you do, discard a card.


* Baral’s first ability doesn’t affect the colored mana requirements of instant and sorcery spells.
* If there are additional costs to cast a spell, such as a kicker cost or a cost imposed by another effect (such as Thalia, Guardian of Thraben’s ability, for example), apply those increases before applying cost reductions.
* A spell or ability counters a spell only if it specifically contains the word “counter” in its text. If a spell or ability you control causes all the targets of a spell to become illegal, that spell is considered to be countered by the game rules, not by the spell or ability you control, and Baral’s ability won’t trigger.



---

![](https://media.wizards.com/2016/c1lRLirbrl_AER/en_zlQbvSEoNO.png)


Baral’s Expertise  

3UU  

Sorcery  

Return up to three target artifacts and/or creatures to their owners’ hands.

![](https://media.wizards.com/2016/c1lRLirbrl_AER/en_OhaJDoTiwF.png)


Barricade Breaker  

7  

Artifact Creature — Juggernaut  

7/5  

Improvise *(Your artifacts can help cast this spell. Each artifact you tap after you’re done activating mana abilities pays for 1.)*  

Barricade Breaker attacks each combat if able.


* If, during your declare attackers step, Barricade Breaker is tapped or is affected by a spell or ability that says it can’t attack, then it doesn’t attack. If there’s a cost associated with having it attack, you aren’t forced to pay that cost, so it doesn’t have to attack in that case either.



---

![](https://media.wizards.com/2016/c1lRLirbrl_AER/en_Vpqudk1sYo.png)


Battle at the Bridge  

XB  

Sorcery  

Improvise *(Your artifacts can help cast this spell. Each artifact you tap after you’re done activating mana abilities pays for 1.)*  

Target creature gets -X/-X until end of turn. You gain X life.


* If the target creature becomes an illegal target, Battle at the Bridge is countered and none of its effects happen. You won’t gain life.



---

![](https://media.wizards.com/2016/c1lRLirbrl_AER/en_W5QVyh4hkJ.png)


Caught in the Brights  

2W  

Enchantment — Aura  

Enchant creature  

Enchanted creature can’t attack or block.  

When a Vehicle you control attacks, exile enchanted creature.


* After the enchanted creature is exiled, Caught in the Brights is put into its owner’s graveyard.
* If Caught in the Brights leaves the battlefield in response to its triggered ability, the resolving ability will exile the creature Caught in the Brights was enchanting as it left the battlefield.



---

![](https://media.wizards.com/2016/c1lRLirbrl_AER/en_p5pjSWtNMo.png)


Chandra’s Revolution  

3R  

Sorcery  

Chandra’s Revolution deals 4 damage to target creature. Tap target land. That land doesn’t untap during its controller’s next untap step.


* Chandra’s Revolution can target a land that’s already tapped. That land won’t untap during its controller’s next untap step.



---

![](https://media.wizards.com/2016/c1lRLirbrl_AER/en_EkJrrbC4Mr.png)


Cogwork Assembler  

3  

Artifact Creature — Assembly-Worker  

2/3  

7: Create a token that’s a copy of target artifact. That token gains haste. Exile it at the beginning of the next end step.


* The token copies exactly what was printed on the original artifact and nothing else (unless that artifact is copying something else or is a token; see below). It doesn’t copy whether that artifact is tapped or untapped, whether it has any counters on it or Auras and Equipment attached to it, or any non-copy effects that have changed its power, toughness, types, color, or so on.
* If the copied artifact has X in its mana cost, X is considered to be 0.
* If the copied artifact is copying something else (for example, if the copied artifact is a Sculpting Steel), then the token enters the battlefield as whatever that artifact copied.
* If the copied artifact is a token, the token created with Cogwork Assembler copies the original characteristics of that token as stated by the effect that that created that token.
* Any enters-the-battlefield abilities of the copied artifact will trigger when the token enters the battlefield. Any “as [this artifact] enters the battlefield” or “[this artifact] enters the battlefield with” abilities of the chosen artifact will also work.



---

![](https://media.wizards.com/2016/c1lRLirbrl_AER/en_zrkXEiLR0R.png)


Consulate Crackdown  

3WW  

Enchantment  

When Consulate Crackdown enters the battlefield, exile all artifacts your opponents control until Consulate Crackdown leaves the battlefield.


* If Consulate Crackdown leaves the battlefield before its triggered ability resolves, no artifacts will be exiled.
* Auras attached to the exiled artifacts will be put into their owners’ graveyards. Any counters on the exiled artifacts will cease to exist.
* If an artifact token is exiled, it ceases to exist. It won’t be returned to the battlefield.
* The exiled cards return to the battlefield immediately after Consulate Crackdown leaves the battlefield. Nothing happens between the two events, including state-based actions. If Consulate Crackdown exiles multiple artifacts, those cards all return to the battlefield at the same time.
* In a multiplayer game, if Consulate Crackdown’s owner leaves the game, the exiled cards will return to the battlefield. Because the one-shot effect that returns the cards isn’t an ability that goes on the stack, it won’t cease to exist along with the leaving player’s spells and abilities on the stack.



---

![](https://media.wizards.com/2016/c1lRLirbrl_AER/en_jeL19mmQfn.png)


Conviction  

1W  

Enchantment — Aura  

Enchant creature  

Enchanted creature gets +1/+3.  

W: Return Conviction to its owner’s hand.


* Players don’t have priority to cast spells and activate abilities between combat damage being assigned and being dealt. This means that if you want to return Conviction to its owner’s hand before combat damage is dealt, you must do so before combat damage is assigned (and the creature will no longer get +1/+3).



---

![](https://media.wizards.com/2016/c1lRLirbrl_AER/en_50506d5iUZ.png)


Crackdown Construct  

4  

Artifact Creature — Construct  

2/2  

Whenever you activate an ability of an artifact or creature that isn’t a mana ability, Crackdown Construct gets +1/+1 until end of turn.


* Activated abilities are written in the form “Cost: Effect.” Some keyword abilities, such as equip and crew, are activated abilities and will have colons in their reminder texts.
* An activated mana ability is one that adds mana to a player’s mana pool as it resolves, doesn’t have a target, and isn’t a loyalty ability.
* Crackdown Construct’s ability doesn’t trigger if you activate an ability of an artifact or creature card not on the battlefield.
* An ability whose cost is simply 0 can be activated as many times as you’d like. Each activation causes Crackdown Construct’s ability to trigger.



---

![](https://media.wizards.com/2016/c1lRLirbrl_AER/en_f59gfWPZjj.png)


Cruel Finality  

2B  

Instant  

Target creature gets -2/-2 until end of turn. Scry 1. *(Look at the top card of your library. You may put that card on the bottom of your library.)*


* If the target creature becomes an illegal target, Cruel Finality is countered and none of its effects happen. You won’t scry 1.



---

![](https://media.wizards.com/2016/c1lRLirbrl_AER/en_lvsZxH5pgu.png)


Daredevil Dragster  

3  

Artifact — Vehicle  

4/4  

At end of combat, if Daredevil Dragster attacked or blocked this combat, put a velocity counter on it. Then if it has two or more velocity counters on it, sacrifice it and draw two cards.

* If Daredevil Dragster somehow has two velocity counters on it and leaves the battlefield while its triggered ability is on the stack, you’ll draw two cards even though you can’t sacrifice it.

Dark Intimations  

2UBR  

Sorcery  

Each opponent sacrifices a creature or planeswalker, then discards a card. You return a creature or planeswalker card from your graveyard to your hand, then draw a card.  

When you cast a Bolas planeswalker spell, exile Dark Intimations from your graveyard. That planeswalker enters the battlefield with an additional loyalty counter on it.


* When Dark Intimations resolves, first the player whose turn it is (if that player is an opponent) chooses which creature or planeswalker he or she will sacrifice, then each other opponent in turn order does the same, then all chosen permanents are sacrificed at the same time. Then each opponent in the same order chooses a card in his or her hand without revealing it, then all chosen cards are discarded at the same time.
* Each opponent chooses a permanent to sacrifice from among the creatures and planeswalkers that player controls. You don’t choose which type of permanent the player has to sacrifice.
* If an opponent can’t sacrifice a creature or planeswalker, that player still discards a card if able. You still return a creature or planeswalker card to your hand if able, even if no opponent sacrifices a permanent and/or discards a card. You still draw a card even if you can’t return a card to your hand.
* You choose the creature or planeswalker card to return to your hand while Dark Intimations is resolving. No player may take actions between the time you choose one and the time you put it into your hand.
* If two or more Dark Intimations are in your graveyard when you cast a Bolas planeswalker spell, you’ll exile each of them and that planeswalker will enter the battlefield with that many additional loyalty counters.
* The draconic Planeswalker Nicol Bolas is not featured in the *Aether Revolt* set. He must be up to something nefarious elsewhere.

• Creatures without flying can’t block this turn.


* You choose which mode you’re using as you cast Destructive Tampering. Once this choice is made, it can’t be changed.

Disallow  

1UU  

Instant  

Counter target spell, activated ability, or triggered ability. *(Mana abilities can’t be targeted.)*


* Activated abilities are written in the form “Cost: Effect.” Some keyword abilities, such as equip and crew, are activated abilities and will have colons in their reminder texts.
* Triggered abilities use the word “when,” “whenever,” or “at.” They’re often written as “[Trigger condition], [effect].” Some abilities, such as prowess and fabricate, are triggered abilities and will have “when,” “whenever,” or “at” in their reminder text.
* If you counter a delayed triggered ability that triggers at the beginning of the “next” occurrence of a specified step or phase, that ability won’t trigger again the following time that phase or step occurs.
* An activated mana ability is one that adds mana to a player’s mana pool as it resolves, doesn’t have a target, and isn’t a loyalty ability. A triggered mana ability is one that adds mana to a player’s mana pool and triggers on an activated mana ability.
* Abilities that create replacement effects, such as a permanent entering the battlefield tapped or with counters on it, can’t be targeted. Abilities that apply “as [this creature] enters the battlefield” are also replacement effects and can’t be targeted.

Exquisite Archangel  

5WW  

Creature — Angel  

5/5  

Flying  

If you would lose the game, instead exile Exquisite Archangel and your life total becomes equal to your starting life total.


* If Exquisite Archangel is dealt lethal damage at the same time that you’re dealt damage that brings your life total to 0 or less, its effect applies and your life total becomes equal to your starting life total. You choose whether Exquisite Archangel is moved to exile or to your graveyard.
* If an effect says that you can’t lose the game, Exquisite Archangel’s effect doesn’t apply.
* If you control two Exquisite Archangels, you choose which one’s effect applies. The other’s effect won’t be applicable after that.
* Exquisite Archangel’s effect applies any time you would lose the game, even if you’re not losing due to your life total being 0 or less. If you would have lost the game because you tried to draw from an empty library, you won’t lose again until you try to draw again and still can’t do so.
* Exquisite Archangel’s effect does nothing if you concede the game. A player who concedes leaves the game.
* For your life total to become your starting life total (normally 20), you gain or lose the appropriate amount of life. For example, if your life total is -4 when Exquisite Archangel’s ability applies, it will cause you to gain 24 life; alternatively, if your life total is 40 when it applies, it will cause you to lose 20 life. Other cards that interact with life gain or life loss will interact with this effect accordingly.
* In a game with two players or two teams, if an effect states that an opponent wins the game, Exquisite Archangel’s ability doesn’t apply.
* In a multiplayer game that isn’t between two teams, if an effect states that an opponent wins the game, each player other than that opponent loses the game instead, and Exquisite Archangel’s ability does apply.
* In a Two-Headed Giant game, Exquisite Archangel’s ability causes the team’s life total to become the team’s starting life total (normally 30), but only you actually gain or lose life.

Creature — Insect

Flying  

When Foundry Hornet enters the battlefield, if you control a creature with a +1/+1 counter on it, creatures your opponents control get -1/-1 until end of turn.


* The set of creatures affected by Foundry Hornet’s triggered ability is determined as the ability resolves. Creatures opponents begin to control later in the turn and permanents opponents control that become creatures later in the turn won’t get -1/-1. The effect continues until end of turn even if you stop controlling a creature with a +1/+1 counter on it.
* If you don’t control a creature with a +1/+1 counter as Foundry Hornet enters the battlefield, its ability doesn’t trigger, even if you can give a +1/+1 counter to a creature right away. If you control no creatures with a +1/+1 counter as the ability resolves, nothing happens.
* If an effect causes Foundry Hornet to enter the battlefield with a +1/+1 counter on it, it satisfies its own triggered ability.

Whenever you lose life for the first time each turn, you get E. *(You get an energy counter. Damage causes loss of life.)*  

Pay EE, Sacrifice Gonti’s Machinations: Each opponent loses 3 life. You gain life equal to the life lost this way.


* The triggered ability gives you at most one energy counter each turn, regardless of how much life you lost.
* In a Two-Headed Giant game, damage and life loss happen to individual players, and the result affects the team’s life total. Combat damage is assigned and dealt to specific players. If your teammate is dealt damage or otherwise loses life, Gonti’s Machinations doesn’t trigger, even though your life total went down.
* In a Two-Headed Giant game, Gonti’s Machinations’s second ability causes the opposing team to lose a total of 6 life.

* The affected player won’t be able to cast any noncreature spells until after the time that your “beginning of upkeep” triggered abilities are put onto the stack on your next turn.
* The affected player may still activate abilities, play lands, and cast creature spells.
* The target player (and any other player) may cast spells in response to the activated ability of Hope of Ghirapur. The ability won’t affect those spells and it won’t affect spells that the target player cast before you activated it. (In other words, the ability can’t be used to counter a spell.)
* If you skip your turn, the affected player will be unable to cast noncreature spells until you actually start a turn.
* When a player leaves a multiplayer game, any continuous effects with durations that last until that player’s next turn will last until that turn would have begun. They neither expire immediately nor last indefinitely.

Destroy X target artifacts and/or creatures. For each permanent destroyed this way, its controller reveals cards from the top of his or her library until an artifact or creature card is revealed and exiles that card. Those players put the exiled cards onto the battlefield, then shuffle their libraries.


* If a player controls no permanents destroyed this way, that player reveals no cards from his or her library and doesn’t shuffle it.
* If an artifact or creature is targeted but not destroyed (perhaps because it gained indestructible or became an illegal target), it doesn’t count as one of the artifacts or creatures destroyed this way. An artifact or creature that’s destroyed but put into a zone other than a graveyard (such as a player’s commander in the Commander variant) does count.
* While revealing cards, a player stops as soon as he or she reveals a card that’s an artifact or a creature (or both). That player doesn’t choose one type.
* If a player’s library no longer contains an artifact or creature card when instructed to reveal cards, that player reveals the entire library, exiles no cards, and then shuffles it.
* All of the exiled cards are put onto the battlefield at the same time.

When Maulfist Revolutionary enters the battlefield or dies, for each kind of counter on target permanent or player, give that permanent or player another counter of that kind.


* The triggered ability triggers both when Maulfist Revolutionary enters the battlefield and when it dies. You don’t have to choose only one.
* Maulfist Revolutionary’s triggered ability gives only one counter of each kind. It doesn’t double the number of each kind of counter. For example, if a creature has two +1/+1 counters and a charge counter on it, it gets one +1/+1 counter and one charge counter.
* To give a counter is to put a counter on a permanent or to have a player get a counter. Effects that interact with a player getting counters or counters being placed on permanents interact with Maulfist Revolutionary’s triggered ability.

* The eight artifacts with the same name don’t have to have the same name as the enchanted artifact. For example, you win the game if you control eight Thopter artifact creature tokens as Mechanized Production’s ability resolves, even if Mechanized Production isn’t attached to a Thopter.
* All eight of the permanents sharing a name must be artifacts. If you control only seven artifacts with the same name and a nonartifact permanent with that same name, you won’t win the game.
* If you control eight or more artifacts that share a name while you control Mechanized Production, you won’t win the game yet. You’ll win the game while resolving its triggered ability during your upkeep.
* The token copies exactly what was printed on the original artifact and nothing else (unless that artifact is copying something else or is a token; see below). It doesn’t copy whether that artifact is tapped or untapped, whether it has any counters on it or Auras attached to it, or any non-copy effects that have changed its types, color, or so on.
* If the copied artifact has X in its mana cost, X is considered to be zero.
* If the copied artifact is copying something else (for example, if the copied artifact is a Sculpting Steel), then the token enters the battlefield as whatever that artifact copied.
* If the copied artifact is a token, the token that’s created copies the original characteristics of that token as stated by the effect that created it.
* Any enters-the-battlefield abilities of the copied artifact trigger when the artifact token enters the battlefield. The artifact token also has any “this enters the battlefield with” or “as this enters the battlefield” abilities that the copied artifact has.
* If Mechanized Production and the enchanted artifact leave the battlefield simultaneously in response to the triggered ability, then the effect creates a token that’s a copy of the artifact as it last existed on the battlefield.
* If the enchanted artifact leaves the battlefield in response to Mechanized Production’s triggered ability but Mechanized Production does not, Mechanized Production is put into its owner’s graveyard as a state-based action with no enchanted artifact. The triggered ability creates no token, but you can still win the game if you control enough artifacts with the same name.

Metallic Mimic  

2  

Artifact Creature — Shapeshifter  

2/1  

As Metallic Mimic enters the battlefield, choose a creature type.  

Metallic Mimic is the chosen type in addition to its other types.  

Each other creature you control of the chosen type enters the battlefield with an additional +1/+1 counter on it.


* The choice of creature type is made as Metallic Mimic enters the battlefield. Players can’t respond to this choice. Metallic Mimic’s second ability starts applying immediately.
* You must choose an existing creature type. “Artifact” and “Vehicle” aren’t creature types.
* Even though Metallic Mimic is a Shapeshifter, other Shapeshifter creatures you control won’t get a +1/+1 counter (unless you chose Shapeshifter as Metallic Mimic entered the battlefield).
* Creatures of the chosen type that enter the battlefield at the same time as Metallic Mimic won’t enter with an additional +1/+1 counter.
* If a creature entering the battlefield won’t have the chosen type until another card’s effect gives it that type after it has entered the battlefield, it won’t enter with a +1/+1 counter. Creatures that have the chosen type due to their own abilities, such as a second Metallic Mimic with the same creature type chosen, will enter with a +1/+1 counter.

3/3  

Other Aetherborn you control get +1/+1.

* Midnight Entourage’s triggered ability is mandatory. You draw a card and lose 1 life even if you don’t want to.
* If Midnight Entourage and another Aetherborn you control die at the same time, its ability triggers once for each of them.
* If a creature has been dealt damage, that damage remains marked on it until the cleanup step. If Midnight Entourage leaves the battlefield and another Aetherborn creature you control has been dealt damage, that creature will be destroyed if the damage is now lethal. The same is true if an Aetherborn’s toughness becomes 0 this way.

Monstrous Onslaught

Sorcery  

Monstrous Onslaught deals X damage divided as you choose among any number of target creatures, where X is the greatest power among creatures you control as you cast Monstrous Onslaught.


* You divide the damage among the target creatures as you cast Monstrous Onslaught. Each target must be assigned at least 1 damage.
* The value of X is determined at the time you divide damage. It won’t change later, even if the highest power among creatures you control changes.
* If some (but not all) of the targets become illegal, the original division of damage still applies, but no damage is dealt to illegal targets. If all targets become illegal, Monstrous Onslaught will be countered.
* The damage is dealt by Monstrous Onslaught, not by the creature with the greatest power among creatures you control.

Pacification Array

Artifact  

2, T: Tap target artifact or creature.


* Players may respond to Pacification Array’s ability by activating an ability of the target permanent if that ability’s timing permissions allow it. Players may also respond by activating abilities or casting spells whose costs include tapping the target permanent.
* Once a player has activated an ability with T in its cost, Pacification Array can’t be used to prevent or counter that ability.
* If you want to stop someone from attacking with a creature by using Pacification Array’s ability, you must do so before attackers are declared. You can’t wait until after attackers are declared and then try to use it to make a creature stop attacking. Note that your opponent can’t start declaring attackers without letting you use your Pacification Array.

Peema Aether-Seer  

3G  

Creature — Elf Druid  

3/2  

When Peema Aether-Seer enters the battlefield, you get an amount of E *(energy counters)* equal to the greatest power among creatures you control.  

Pay EEE: Target creature blocks this turn if able.


* The amount of E you get is determined as Peema Aether-Seer’s first ability resolves. If the greatest power among creatures you control is somehow negative, you don’t get or lose any E.
* The target creature blocks only if it’s able to do so as the declare blockers step begins. If, at that time, the creature is tapped, it’s affected by a spell or ability that says it can’t block, or no creatures are attacking its controller or a planeswalker controlled by that player, then it doesn’t block. If there’s a cost associated with having the creature block, the player isn’t forced to pay that cost. If that cost isn’t paid, the creature won’t block.
* The controller of the target creature chooses which attacking creature that creature blocks.
* If there are multiple combat phases in a turn, the target creature must block only in the first one in which it’s able to.

Instant  

Each opponent sacrifices an artifact creature and a nonartifact creature.


* When Perilous Predicament resolves, first the player whose turn it is (if that player is an opponent) chooses which creatures he or she will sacrifice, then each other opponent in turn order does the same, then all chosen creatures are sacrificed at the same time.
* If each creature an opponent controls is an artifact creature, that player sacrifices only one creature. Similarly, if each creature an opponent controls is a nonartifact creature, that player sacrifices only one creature. If an opponent controls no creatures, that player doesn’t sacrifice anything.

Enchantment  

Whenever a nontoken artifact is put into your graveyard from the battlefield, return that card to your hand unless target opponent has Pia’s Revolution deal 3 damage to him or her.


* If a nontoken artifact is put into your graveyard at the same time as Pia’s Revolution, Pia’s Revolution’s ability triggers.
* It doesn’t matter who controlled the artifact when it was put into your graveyard. Pia’s Revolution’s ability will trigger if you own that artifact.
* The target opponent chooses whether to have Pia’s Revolution deal 3 damage to him or her as its ability resolves. You won’t return the card to your hand if that player chooses to be dealt damage or if the card leaves the graveyard before the ability resolves.
* If there are no legal targets for Pia’s Revolution’s ability (perhaps because each of your opponents has hexproof), it will be removed from the stack with no effect. No one may choose to be dealt damage and you won’t return the artifact card to your hand.

First strike  

Whenever Reckless Racer becomes tapped, you may discard a card. If you do, draw a card.


* This is a triggered ability, not an activated ability. It doesn’t allow you to tap Reckless Racer whenever you want; rather, you need some other way of tapping it, such as by attacking or crewing a Vehicle.
* For the ability to trigger, Reckless Racer has to actually change from untapped to tapped. If an effect attempts to tap it, but it was already tapped at the time, this ability won’t trigger.

Creature — Human Warrior  

3/2  
*Revolt* — When Renegade Rallier enters the battlefield, if a permanent you controlled left the battlefield this turn, return target permanent card with converted mana cost 2 or less from your graveyard to the battlefield.


* A permanent card is an artifact, creature, enchantment, land, or planeswalker card.
* The converted mana cost of a card in your graveyard is determined solely by the mana symbols printed in its upper right corner. The converted mana cost is the total amount of mana in that cost, regardless of color. For example, a card with mana cost 1UU has converted mana cost 3.
* If a card in your graveyard has no mana symbols in its upper right corner (because it’s a land card, for example), its converted mana cost is 0.
* If the mana cost of a card in your graveyard includes X, X is considered to be 0.
* You can target any permanent card in your graveyard with converted mana cost 2 or less, not just one that was put there from the battlefield this turn.

Whenever Scrap Trawler or another artifact you control is put into a graveyard from the battlefield, return to your hand target artifact card in your graveyard with lesser converted mana cost.


* If Scrap Trawler and another artifact you control are put into a graveyard at the same time, Scrap Trawler’s ability triggers for each of them.
* The target artifact card must have a lesser converted mana cost than the artifact that caused Scrap Trawler’s ability to trigger by being put into a graveyard. Use the artifact’s converted mana cost as it last existed on the battlefield to determine what may be returned.
* While on the battlefield or in a graveyard, X in an object’s mana cost is 0.
* If an artifact is a copy of another artifact with greater converted mana cost, such as Sculpting Steel copying an artifact with converted mana cost 4, Scrap Trawler’s ability can target that artifact card in your graveyard when that artifact is put into your graveyard.

* To move a counter from one creature to another, the counter is removed from the first creature and put on the second. Any abilities that care about a counter being removed from or placed on a creature will apply.

* Skyship Plunderer’s triggered ability can target any permanent or player, regardless of which player was dealt combat damage.
* Skyship Plunderer’s triggered ability gives only one counter of each kind. It doesn’t double the number of each kind of counter. For example, if a creature has two +1/+1 counters and a charge counter on it, it gets one +1/+1 counter and one charge counter.
* To give a counter is to put a counter on a permanent or to have a player get a counter. Effects that interact with a player getting counters or counters being placed on permanents interact with Skyship Plunderer’s triggered ability.

When enchanted artifact is put into a graveyard, return that card to its owner’s hand.


* An artifact that becomes a creature due to Tezzeret’s Touch can’t attack unless you’ve controlled it continuously since your turn began. It doesn’t matter whether or not it was a creature at that time.
* An artifact creature enchanted by Tezzeret’s Touch becomes 5/5 instead of its normal power and toughness.
* A Vehicle enchanted by Tezzeret’s Touch becomes a 5/5 creature. Crewing it won’t change its power and toughness.
* If the enchanted artifact is an Equipment, it becomes unattached and it can’t be attached to anything for as long as it remains a creature.
* If Tezzeret’s Touch becomes unattached from an artifact that’s attacking or blocking, that artifact will be removed from combat unless it’s normally a creature or another effect such as a crew ability is also making it a creature.

Thopter Arrest  

2W  

Enchantment  

When Thopter Arrest enters the battlefield, exile target artifact or creature an opponent controls until Thopter Arrest leaves the battlefield.


* If Thopter Arrest leaves the battlefield before its triggered ability resolves, the target permanent won’t be exiled.
* Auras attached to the exiled permanent will be put into their owners’ graveyards. Any Equipment will become unattached and remain on the battlefield. Any counters on the exiled permanent will cease to exist.
* If a token is exiled this way, it will cease to exist and won’t return to the battlefield.
* The exiled card returns to the battlefield immediately after Thopter Arrest leaves the battlefield. Nothing happens between the two events, including state-based actions.
* In a multiplayer game, if Thopter Arrest’s owner leaves the game, the exiled card will return to the battlefield. Because the one-shot effect that returns the card isn’t an ability that goes on the stack, it won’t cease to exist along with the leaving player’s spells and abilities on the stack.

Treasure Keeper  

4  

Artifact Creature — Construct  

3/3  

When Treasure Keeper dies, reveal cards from the top of your library until you reveal a nonland card with converted mana cost 3 or less. You may cast that card without paying its mana cost. Put all revealed cards not cast this way on the bottom of your library in a random order.


* If you don’t cast the nonland card with converted mana cost 3 or less, it’ll be put on the bottom of your library in a random order with the other cards.
* If you cast a card “without paying its mana cost,” you can’t pay any alternative costs, such as emerge costs. You can, however, pay additional costs. If the card has any mandatory additional costs, such as that of Cathartic Reunion, those must be paid to cast the card.
* If the card has X in its mana cost, you must choose 0 as the value of X when casting it without paying its mana cost.

Untethered Express  

4  

Artifact — Vehicle  

4/4  

Trample  

Whenever Untethered Express attacks, put a +1/+1 counter on it.  

Crew 1 *(Tap any number of creatures you control with total power 1 or more: This Vehicle becomes an artifact creature until end of turn.)*


* Any +1/+1 counters on Untethered Express remain on it when it stops being a creature.

Walking Ballista  

XX  

Artifact Creature — Construct  

0/0  

Walking Ballista enters the battlefield with X +1/+1 counters on it.  

4: Put a +1/+1 counter on Walking Ballista.  

Remove a +1/+1 counter from Walking Ballista: It deals 1 damage to target creature or player.


* The value of each X in Walking Ballista’s mana cost must be equal. For example, if X is 2, you’ll pay 4 to cast Walking Ballista and it will enter the battlefield with two +1/+1 counters on it.
* If Walking Ballista has been dealt damage or had its toughness reduced by an effect, this limits how many times you’ll be able to remove +1/+1 counters from it in a single turn. For example, if it has three +1/+1 counters on it and has been dealt 1 damage this turn, it will be destroyed immediately after you activate the ability a second time and you won’t be able to activate it a third time.

* If you activate Watchful Automaton’s ability more than once, you’ll scry 1 each time. You won’t be able to look at multiple cards at once.

Winding Constrictor  

BG  

Creature — Snake  

2/3  

If one or more counters would be placed on an artifact or creature you control, that many plus one of each of those kinds of counters are placed on that permanent instead.  

If you would get one or more counters, you get that many plus one of each of those kinds of counters instead.


* Winding Constrictor has received minor errata to clarify its functionality. The corrected Oracle wording appears above.
* If an artifact or creature you control would enter the battlefield with a number of any kind of counters on it, it enters with that many plus one instead.
* If an effect includes multiple instructions to put one or more counters on an artifact or creature, such as Lifecrafter’s Gift does, Winding Constrictor’s effect applies to each of those instructions.
* If you control two Winding Constrictors, the number of counters placed on the artifact or creature is the original number plus two. Three Winding Constrictors adds three to the original number, and so on.
* If you would get counters of multiple kinds at the same time, Winding Constrictor increases the number of each of those kinds of counters by one. The same is true if counters of multiple kinds would be placed on an artifact or creature you control.
* Winding Constrictor’s effect can’t apply to itself as it’s entering the battlefield or to any other permanent entering the battlefield at the same time as it.
* If a nonartifact, noncreature permanent (such as a planeswalker) would enter the battlefield with counters on it and become an artifact or a creature on the battlefield due to another card’s effect (such as that of Mycosynth Lattice), Winding Constrictor’s effect doesn’t apply to that permanent.

Wrangle  

1R  

Sorcery  

Gain control of target creature with power 4 or less until end of turn. Untap that creature. It gains haste until end of turn.


* Wrangle can target any creature with power 4 or less, even one that you already control or that is already untapped.
* If the target creature’s power becomes 5 or greater as you gain control of it (perhaps because an enchantment gives creatures you control +1/+1), Wrangle will continue to resolve as normal. The creature will still be untapped and gain haste until end of turn, and you’ll still control it until end of turn.

Yahenni, Undying Partisan  

2B  

Legendary Creature — Aetherborn Vampire  

2/2  

Haste  

Whenever a creature an opponent controls dies, put a +1/+1 counter on Yahenni, Undying Partisan.  

Sacrifice another creature: Yahenni gains indestructible until end of turn.


* If Yahenni and a creature an opponent controls die simultaneously (perhaps because they fought or were in combat together), Yahenni won’t be on the battlefield as its triggered ability resolves. It can’t be saved by the +1/+1 counter that would have been put on it.

Yahenni’s Expertise  

2BB  

Sorcery  

All creatures get -3/-3 until end of turn.  

You may cast a card with converted mana cost 3 or less from your hand without paying its mana cost.


* If a creature’s toughness is reduced to 0 or less by Yahenni’s Expertise, that creature is still on the battlefield as you cast your free spell. It can be the target of that spell, although it will become an illegal target before that spell resolves. If it has any abilities that trigger on the spell being cast, those abilities will trigger.
