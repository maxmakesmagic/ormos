 After 10 rounds of *Khans of Tarkir* Limited, two players had climbed to the top of the heap and stood alone as the sole remaining undefeated players at Grand Prix Baltimore: No. 5 Reid Duke and David Foster. They sat down across from each other with the knowledge that only one would escape with an unblemished record and a clear view of the Top 8.




**The Decks**




 Duke had centered his draft around both the Sultai wedge's graveyard mechanics and a powerful rare in [Trail of Mystery](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Trail+of+Mystery). He had strong morphs to grind out advantage from the Trail in the form of [Hooded Hydra](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hooded+Hydra) and multiple [Abomination of Gudul](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Abomination+of+Gudul), as well as a variety of delve creatures such as [Necropolis Fiend](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Necropolis+Fiend) and Hooting Mandrils that he would try to get into play ahead of schedule by extracting value from his graveyard.




 Sporting a colorful five-color build, Foster seemed to have drafted every tri-land and rare that had come his way. His deck featured three copies of [Sandsteppe Citadel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sandsteppe+Citadel) and a [Nomad Outpost](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nomad+Outpost), along with a variety of other dual lands to help him cast his wide array of multicolored bombs. His greatest hits included [Flying Crane Technique](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flying+Crane+Technique), [Crackling Doom](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crackling+Doom), and [High Sentinels of Arashin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=High+Sentinels+of+Arashin), along with a sideboard [Villainous Wealth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Villainous+Wealth) that he planned to bring in for slower match-ups.




**The Games**




 After a long think, Duke decided he had to send his first seven back, and ended up starting the game down a card. Foster kept a hand featuring the full spectrum his deck had to offer, with [Abzan Guide](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Abzan+Guide), [Bellowing Saddlebrute](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bellowing+Saddlebrute), [Crackling Doom](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crackling+Doom) and [Flying Crane Technique](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flying+Crane+Technique) to go along with three lands.




 Foster applied early pressure, attacking with a face-down [Abzan Guide](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Abzan+Guide) and [Bellowing Saddlebrute](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bellowing+Saddlebrute), while Duke had only a [Trail of Mystery](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Trail+of+Mystery) in play. After casting a morph to fetch an Island on his turn five, Duke passed back. When Foster attacked with his now face-up [Abzan Guide](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Abzan+Guide) and Saddlebrute, Duke unmorphed to reveal a [Monastery Flock](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Monastery+Flock) and block the Guide, falling to 7 life while Foster climbed to hearty 29.






*[Flying Crane Technique](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flying+Crane+Technique) took Foster's creatures to the air and Duke's life total to the ground.*
