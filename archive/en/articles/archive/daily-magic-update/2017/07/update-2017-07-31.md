The July 31, 2017 Update
========================



 Posted in **Daily Magic Update**

 Nicholas Wolfram fell promptly in love with tabletop and video games when he was only two years old, and he has been writing about them since he figured out how words worked. Now he puts together words about Magic, which he started playing way back in 2000. 






The Daily *Magic* Update is a roundup of everything *Magic* you should know on July 31, 2017. Today's Update is brought to you by Paulo Vitor Damo da Rosa and his second Pro Tour victory!


Today's Must
============


1. [Pro Tour *Hour of Devastation*](https://www.twitch.tv/magic) | Twitch

If you missed the live action over the weekend for whatever reason, make sure you catch up on all the outstanding coverage today! Witness Paulo once again claim the title of Pro Tour Champion as he pilots his Ramunap Red brew expertly to the top with truly pro-level play.


After That, Read, Watch, or Listen to These
===========================================


1. [Brewing to Beat Ramunap Red](http://www.starcitygames.com/article/35553_Brewing-To-Beat-Ramunap-Red.html) | StarCityGames.com | Chris Lansdell

Now that Ramunap Red has proven itself beyond a doubt as the deck to beat, the discussion is shifting to just that: what is the best way to beat it? Chris has some pretty fresh ideas that just might work out in the long run, so make sure to give this a read.


1. [Pro Tour *Hour of Devastation*: By the Numbers](https://www.mtggoldfish.com/articles/pro-tour-hour-of-devastation-by-the-numbers?src=wizards) | MTG Goldfish | SaffronOlive

Seth (better known as SaffronOlive) begins dissecting the information collected over the weekend from the Pro Tour. If you're looking for data-driven solutions on solving the metagame, this is the place to start.


1. [Turning the Corner](http://www.hipstersofthecoast.com/2017/07/turning-the-corner/) | Hipsters of the Coast | Sandro Rajalin

Every deck goes into a game with a plan, but players also need to be ready to adapt their plan to the board state, even if it means a shift in how their deck is played on the base level. But how do you know when to make this shift? Sandro shifts the discussion away from the Pro Tour to answer this essential question.


1. [Going Greenless](https://www.channelfireball.com/articles/going-greenless/) | ChannelFireball | Rachel Agnes

Four-color Commander decks are still a very new option for brewers, and looking at them in the context of 1v1 Commander is an even newer concept. But Rachel does just that, advocating that a not-green deck led by [Breya, Etherium Shaper](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Breya%2C+Etherium+Shaper) or a pair of properly colored partners may just be the best avenue to take when trying to conquer the format. As ridiculous as it may sound to not play green, I suppose we should at least hear herÂ out.


1. [Mining Modern Monuments](http://magic.tcgplayer.com/db/article.asp?ID=14075&writer=Corbin+Hosler&articledate=7-31-2017) | TCGplayer | Corbin Hosler

White-Blue Monument is already a well-known competitive archetype in the current Standard metagame, but how well can it be adapted to Modern? The answer is, surprisingly, pretty well!

1. [The Top 5 Reasons to Watch Worlds 2017](https://www.channelfireball.com/articles/the-top-5-reasons-to-watch-worlds-2017/) | ChannelFireball | Matt Sperling

The 2017 *Magic* World Championship is just over two months away, and all 24 player slots are now locked in thanks to the weekend's Pro Tour. Matt is already on top of starting the conversation surrounding the event with the first inklings of hype-building.


What People Are Talking About
=============================


1. [Great Pro Tour coverage over the weekend](https://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/6qgj6s/great_coverage_for_pthou/)

There were some fantastic moments to see over the weekend, and thanks to our excellent coverage team, people all over the world were able to see them! Congratulations to [everyone involved on the coverage team](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/organized-play/pro-tour-hour-devastation-faq-2017-07-27)! [Maria Bartholdi](https://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/6qgx8c/maria_bartholdi_appreciation_thread/) and [Paul Cheon](https://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/6qgb82/paul_cheon_appreciation_thread/) each even got their own appreciation topics on Reddit. Well done, guys.


Deck of the Day
===============


1. [Pro Tour *Hour of Devastation* Champion PVDDR's Ramunap Red](http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/pthou/top-8-decklists-2017-07-29)

With five versions of Ramunap Red entering the Top 8 over the weekend, the odds certainly favored one of them rising to the top, but what set Paulo's brew apart from the rest? Two things immediately jump out.


For one, he was one of only two to slot [Chandra, Torch of Defiance](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chandra%2C+Torch+of+Defiance) into the main deck instead of relegating her to the sideboard. And two, he was the only deck that ran none of the sorcery-based removal offered by [Collective Defiance](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Collective+Defiance) and [Incendiary Flow](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Incendiary+Flow), opting instead for full playsets of both [Shock](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shock) and [Abrade](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Abrade).


Are those the differences that managed to clench the title for him? Perhaps, but more likely it was that this was the only deck piloted with his expert decision-making during the Top 8.


Congratulations, Paulo!
