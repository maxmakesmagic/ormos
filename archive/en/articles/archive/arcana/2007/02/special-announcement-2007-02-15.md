There's a new feature coming to the core set this July.

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/mtgcom/arcana/1271_BlackBorder.jpg)That's right.

As a special celebration of the core set hitting the big One-Oh and **Magic: The Gathering** hitting its 15th anniversary in 2008, *Tenth Edition* will be printed entirely in **black borders**. This includes all *Tenth Edition* products, including booster packs, theme decks, and starter products, in all languages.

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/magic/images/mtgcom/arcana/1271_10ELogo.jpg)Think of this as a little "thank you" for enjoying **Magic** with us for all these years and a cool way to ring in the *next* ten core sets.

Besides, what we're doing with *Eleventh* is anyone's guess. **Magic** doesn't get to celebrate milestones like this very often. So get ready for July 13, 2007-celebrate *Tenth Edition* with us.
