Team MTG Mint Card's Huang Hao-Shan has four Grand Prix Top 8s, twice in Singapore and twice in Australia, but never in his home country. Also, it is rare for Huang to be paired against anyone with more Grand Prix Top 8s as him, especially in the Asia Pacific region.


At an identical 9-2-1 record, Tobey Tamber's had five lifetime Grand Prix Top 8s (Grand Prix Kuala Lumpur 2002: 7th,Grand Prix Kaohsiung 2000: 1st, Grand Prix Kyoto 2000: 8th, Grand Prix Taipei 2000: 8th, Grand Prix Taipei 1999: 3rd), one of them even achieved during the last century. Three of them were in Taiwan and his Champion title comes from defeating Kuo Tzu Ching more than 10 years ago at Grand Prix Kaohsiung.



 Both players are 2-0 for Draft 1 and looking for the clean-sweep that would keep the hopes of a Top 8 berth alive. Huang Hao-Shan has put together a Black Red aggro deck with cheap creatures and removal, while Tobey Tamber has decided to take to the skies with his quadruple [Welkin Tern](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Welkin+Tern)s, double [Dauntless River Marshal](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dauntless+River+Marshal) and [Avacyn, Guardian Angel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Avacyn%2C+Guardian+Angel).



Game 1



 Huang was forced to mulligan his initial seven but he was able to cough up [Black Cat](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Black+Cat) and [Xathrid Slyblade](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Xathrid+Slyblade) on turns 2 and 3. Sadly, they won't be able to the block triple [Welkin Tern](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Welkin+Tern) presented by Tamber.




 "Don't do that. Don't do that all nonblack creatures get -1/-1 thing," prayed Tamber. He was visibly pleased to see [Scrapyard Mongrel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scrapyard+Mongrel) instead of the [Festergloom](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Festergloom) he was fearing.




 The backbreaker came in the next turn, when Huang presented [Burning Anger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Burning+Anger). Usually, a bounce spell would do the trick but not this time. Huang smartly chose to place it onto [Xathrid Slyblade](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Xathrid+Slyblade), which conveniently has hexproof.





 When Huang tried to shoot down one of the three [Welkin Tern](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Welkin+Tern)s, Tamber used [Peel from Reality](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Peel+from+Reality) to return his own [Welkin Tern](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Welkin+Tern) and Huang's [Scrapyard Mongrel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scrapyard+Mongrel), while pushing 4 damage from the other two [Welkin Tern](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Welkin+Tern)s. He redeployed the bounced copy and Huang was reduced to just 10 life.




 When [Paragon of Gathering Mists](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Paragon+of+Gathering+Mists) entered the battlefield, it boosted the trio of [Welkin Tern](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Welkin+Tern)s to 3/2s. With [Selfless Cathar](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Selfless+Cathar) as a backup, Tamber could effectively save his [Welkin Tern](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Welkin+Tern) for yet another turn. Huang could only shoot down one and drop to 4 life.




 "[Cone of Flame](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cone+of+Flame)?", asked Tamber.



"Nope, next game."




*Tamber wins Game 1 with 3 [Welkin Tern](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Welkin+Tern) and [Paragon of Gathering Mists](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Paragon+of+Gathering+Mists).*
