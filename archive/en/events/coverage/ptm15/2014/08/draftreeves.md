Richard Neil Reeves has long been considered one of the best Limited players in the history of the game. Way back in 2002, Pro Tours were exclusively Limited or Constructed. There were two Limited Pro Tours that year. Neil Reeves Top 8ed both of them. Neil Reeves has been silently putting together a comeback over the last few months. With a pair of PTQ wins and a 5-0 start here this weekend, it's clear that he still has what it takes to compete at the highest levels. I watched Reeves draft at the beginning of Day 2 and sat down with him afterward to discuss his thoughts on the draft. 





*Rich Neil Reeves is no stranger to the Pro Tour lights. Back in the early 2000s, he was considered one of the great Limited specialists.*
