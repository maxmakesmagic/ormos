Let's take a look at [Baloth Cage Trap](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Baloth+Cage+Trap).

That was fun. Let's look even closer!

Now, here's some trivia about this card. As we've [mentioned before](/en/articles/archive/alara-reborn-slideshow-2008-11-05), **Magic** R&D looks at each set as a card-by-card slideshow when it's ready to be seen. When this card came up in the *Zendikar* slideshow, somebody asked how the art related to the mechanics of the card. Monty Ashley promptly drew this diagram (which we want to make absolutely clear is not an official Creative-approved explanation):

Nice sketch, Monty! The goblin fell through the floor of the room above. See the floorboards at the top of the art? It's a Trap that drops you into a Baloth Cage!
