 The secrets to be found in *Khans of Tarkir* have been discovered. There's no secret technology or insider information left for explore. The power and potential synergies of cards is well documented. What began a couple months ago as a new frontier is now a mapped world crisscrossed by worn paths and signposts.



Are you ready to tell us where we're going?



 Below is a sample *Khans of Tarkir* Sealed Deck pool. It's six packs at random, and from the same types of jumbled messes where players in Grand Prix Baltimore will make their stand on Day 1. Our pool here features a few interesting facts:



* Three copies each of [Bring Low](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bring+Low) and [Force Away](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Force+Away)
* Eight nonbasic lands covering the spectrum of colors, but plenty of red and white.
* [Ashcloud Phoenix](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ashcloud+Phoenix), [Temur Ascendancy](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Temur+Ascendancy), [Savage Knuckleblade](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Savage+Knuckleblade), [Ivorytusk Fortress](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ivorytusk+Fortress), [Grim Haruspex](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Grim+Haruspex), [Utter End](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Utter+End), and a bonus premium foil version of [Kheru Spellsnatcher](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kheru+Spellsnatcher) round out the rares.
