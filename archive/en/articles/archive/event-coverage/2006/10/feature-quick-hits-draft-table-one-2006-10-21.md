| *(Use the [draft viewer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/magic/draftools/draftviewer.asp?draftid=10_21_2006) to get a player's eye view of how the draft went from each seat at Table One.)* | "This was the hardest draft in the whole tournament. This is my weakest deck ever." | "The draft went quite well although it is quite difficult to tell if you don't know the other decks at the table. Generally I would say my deck is quite good." |
|  |  |  |
| **Bastien Perez:** | **Tiago Chan:** | **Andre Coimbra:** |
| "I think my deck is really good. I think I can get at least one win with it for my first Top 8…which will be very good." | "Wily Edel was to my left and he always forces blue-red so I tried to go into green-black because it was underdrafted in the other drafts. After the draft Wily said, 'No, where did you hear that?' Anyway….I like my deck." | "I usually like to draft black-green but I passed a booster with four or five green cards and none of them came back so I guess there were a lot of people drafting green. In next pack there was a lot of white coming so I switched into that." |
|  |  |  |
| **Jan-Moritz Merkel:** | **Wily Edel:** | **Masami Ibamoto:** |
| "It wasn't so great. I am green-white and that is not my favorite color combination." | "I tried to force blue-red because that is my favorite, but there were no blue cards passed to me so I went black - red-black. It's a solid deck." | "In the last four drafts I was able to get blue. In this draft..."
 (shows off an array of green cards) "... so this draft was not good." |
