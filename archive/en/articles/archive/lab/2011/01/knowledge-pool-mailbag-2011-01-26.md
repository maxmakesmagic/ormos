Hello everyone, and welcome back to the first From the Lab since a small internet-based explosion hit my mailbox [last week](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/ftl/126). This explosion resulted due to a massive tidal wave of emails, which flooded my inbox. Apparently the synapse-shattering sickness that is Knowledge Pool cannot be contained to just one column.
