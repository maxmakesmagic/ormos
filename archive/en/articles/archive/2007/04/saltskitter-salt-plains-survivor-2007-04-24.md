While*Future Sight* timeshifted cards tell the story of **Magic's** possible futures, the set's other cards tell the continuing story of a plane in recovery. Dominaria is not yet flourishing, by any means; its plains are still dusty wastes continually eroded by salt-spiked winds. But in the years since the departure of the false god Karona, some creatures have found ways to adapt, and even thrive, in these harsh conditions.

*Saltskitter art by Chippy*
The saltskitter is a creature that can flatten itself against the contours of its desolate environment. It slides along the dunes like a sidewinder snake or an undersea skate. Then, when danger threatens, it churns up the loose earth and buries itself under a layer of dust and salt, perfectly camouflaged.


Note the broken-down structures and pitted landscapes in the background. Compare to Justin Sweet's [Plains](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plains) illustration from *Time Spiral*.
