Think these are your average faeries? As if! While most faeries flutter about, only these faeries are totally fly. Boasting a '90s-tacular rainbow palette, each foil faerie features hella awesome art by Maria Abagnale, Jen Bartel, Rian Gonzales, and Maria Poliakova. Have a problem with the way they do things? You can talk to their hands, because these antennae are not listening.

We are *Secret Lair*, and we are here to teach you the true meaning of brutality. You think creatures are brutal? Creatures are nothing. You think kill spells are brutal? Removal is a child's plaything. Only one type of card is truly brutal and truly metal. And that card is the basic land. Look at these full-art basic lands by Mark Riddick and understand that you know nothing of brutality. Mark knows everything. With these lands in your possession, your education will begin. Prepare to be born anew . . .

The forests of Littjara are typically still and peaceful, but today, they jump and shudder like a drying machine set to max. It is no shapeshifter that causes the trees to do their best impression of an airport massage chair—it's an army of giants unlike Kaldheim has ever seen. Stomp your opponents with these green and blue Titans that feature *Kaldheim*'s unique showcase frame and art by WolfSkullJack, Christopher Lovell, and Richard Luong. They're large, in charge, and everybody else better watch out!

The burning tar oceans of Immersturm are restless. They pop and bubble like, uh, well exactly like hot tar, but like, *way* more than usual. Three massive figures emerge from the depths, capsizing a boat of demons into the scorching sea (don't worry, they were all jerks). Kaldheim has giants, but none like this. Stomp your opponents with these black and red Titans that feature *Kaldheim*'s unique showcase frame and art by DZO, GodMachine, and Dibujante Nocturno. They're large, in charge, and everybody else better watch out!
