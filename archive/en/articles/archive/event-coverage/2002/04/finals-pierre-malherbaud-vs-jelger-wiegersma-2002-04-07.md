![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gpnap02/a871.jpg)Only one match left to decide the champion of Grand Prix-Naples. On one side is an in form Dutch player – Jelger Wiegersma, with a Top 8 in Grand Prix-Heidelberg already in this format. On the other is the two-time French Champion Pierre Malherbaud, who has already completed the difficult task of knocking Kai Budde out of a Top 8.

"You like the matchup?" Wiegersma asked.  

"Yep," Malherbaud replied.  

"I thought you would," Wiegersma said.

Malherbaud has a green-black deck with lots of fast creatures, three [Cabal Torturer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cabal+Torturer)s and [Squirrel Nest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Squirrel+Nest). Wiegersma has a blue-green deck splashing black for [Afflict](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Afflict) and two [Waste Away](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Waste+Away). Unfortunately a lot of his creatures have only one toughness.

Malherbaud won the coin flip and opted to go first. A [Filthy Cur](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Filthy+Cur) jumped out of his deck and a [Peek](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Peek) from Wiegersma revealed two [Frightcrawler](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Frightcrawler), [Crashing Centaur](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crashing+Centaur) and [Dirty Wererat](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dirty+Wererat).

Turn three and Malherbaud still found a Torturer. Wiegersma summoned a [Skywing Aven](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skywing+Aven) to give the Torturer something to do.

Wiegersma dropped a [Dreamwinder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dreamwinder) to force the Cur to stay at home but a [Frightcrawler](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Frightcrawler) started to slip through. A second joined it as Wiegersma dropped a Looter and a Farmhand to try and over-work the deadly Torturer.

Looter died in pain...   

Farmhand bravely threw itself in the way of a Wererat...  
[Skywing Aven](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Skywing+Aven) kept running away...

It wasn't pretty.

"I think my best plan is to run you out of sleeves," Wiegersma said as Malherbaud replaced a couple that broke during the Torturer's exertions.

[Dreamwinder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dreamwinder) got nobbled by the Torturer after blocking the Wererat...

Wiegersma did manage to attack with a [Leaf Dancer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leaf+Dancer) and the Aven and then some explanation was provided for the senseless slaughter as [Springing Tiger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Springing+Tiger) hit the table all angry over the number of dead in the Dutchman's graveyard.

There were a few random Squirrels and other menagerie to get through before the Tiger could even think about getting close to Malherbaud and then the Frenchman played a [Squirrel Nest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Squirrel+Nest) to give him a never-ending supply.

A Disciple came out on Wiegersma's side and Malherbaud decided it was time to unleash the menagerie. Wiegersma's Disciple got eaten by a Mongrel in defense and the Tiger smashed the [Filthy Cur](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Filthy+Cur) straight back into Malherbaud's life total.

Wiegersma survived on one life and Malherbaud was at nine. This was unfortunately two higher than the damage Wiegersma could do with a Phantom Winged Tiger and [Leaf Dancer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leaf+Dancer) and the Squirrels surged forward again.

Malherbaud 1-0 Wiegersma

### Game 2

Wiegersma went first and they both dropped forms of mana acceleration – a [Millikin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Millikin) from Wiegersma and a [Diligent Farmhand](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Diligent+Farmhand) from Malherbaud. Wiegersma used the [Millikin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Millikin) to accelerate up to a [Dreamwinder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dreamwinder) while Malherbaud used the Farmhand to hunt for a second swamp for his Torturer, backing it up with a [Chatter of the Squirrel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chatter+of+the+Squirrel).

This time Wiegersma had an [Afflict](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Afflict) but Malherbaud also had a second Torturer and a [Wild Mongrel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Mongrel) to follow at its heels.

[Millikin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Millikin) was first on the rack and a Farmhand went hunting for land before it was its turn.

Malherbaud summoned a [Crashing Centaur](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Crashing+Centaur) and now Wiegersma had only one nervous looking [Dreamwinder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dreamwinder) to hold off that, a [Wild Mongrel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Mongrel) and two chattering Squirrels.

![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/sideboard/images/gpnap02/a866.jpg)Wiegersma wasn't afraid to use massive overkill as [Waste Away](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Waste+Away) sent the annoying Torturer to the graveyard and also gave Wiegersma Threshold to improve a [Seton's Scout](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seton%27s+Scout) that galloped out of his hand.

Malherbaud cast [Tainted Pact](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Tainted+Pact) and took the first card it turned over – a [Famished Ghoul](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Famished+Ghoul).

Mongrel and [Dreamwinder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dreamwinder) tussled in the Red Zone for mutually assured destruction and then a second [Waste Away](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Waste+Away) took down the Centaur with Malherbaud just one card away from reaching threshold.

The Frenchman sent in the Ghoul and flashed back an [Acorn Harvest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Acorn+Harvest) to give himself a few more Squirrels that decided to stay at home in the face of Wiegersma's Scout.

Wiegersma used [Obsessive Search](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Obsessive+Search) to look for an answer and Malherbaud cast [Elephant Ambush](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elephant+Ambush) in response just in case. A [Ghostly Wings](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ghostly+Wings) made the [Seton's Scout](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Seton%27s+Scout) a much tougher blocker but it was one and Malherbaud's Squirrels were many. A full frontal assault lost the Elephant token and dropped the Dutchman down to three.

A [Leaf Dancer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Leaf+Dancer) gave Wiegersma another blocker but Malherbaud had five creatures, six when he flashed back the Ambush. Too many when you're only on 3 life.

**Final Result:** Pierre Malherbaud beat Jelger Wiegersma 2-0 and becomes Champion of Grand Prix-Naples 2002.
