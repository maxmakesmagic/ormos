*"... Oh yeah, well, you're so stupid you didn't even know what Burn Week was."*


It's Burn Week and things are really heating up here on **magicthegathering.com**.


Is it hot in here, or is it just Burn Week?


Alright, I guess that's strike three on Burn Week jokes. Looks like someone's throwing some real heat.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/li/li117_arc.jpg)But fortunately for those of us who like it when our opponents are a bit crispy even if my jokes this week are ice cold, there's still plenty to talk about. Burning stuff has always been an awesome thing to do in Limited. From the [Fireball](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fireball)s and [Lightning Bolt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt)s that people were playing in the mid 90s, to the [Fireball](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fireball)s and [Lightning Bolt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lightning+Bolt)s that people started playing again this summer, to the [Arc Trail](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arc+Trail)s and [Galvanic Blast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Galvanic+Blast)s that people started playing a handful of weeks ago.


And, as those of you who've been playing the format at home know, the latest burn spells to come out of the oven have excelled beyond even the high expectations that people had for them.


Let's take a look at them!


### Burn Today


In many formats, a card like [Arc Trail](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arc+Trail) would be good—but it wouldn't be all that hot.


Why wouldn't it be that great?


Well, it would certainly be good at pretty much any point in **Magic**'s history, allowing you to kill a small evasion creature, or a mana producer that would otherwise give you a lot of trouble. And heck, sometimes you would even be able to kill a second creature with it—putting you up a card for the low, low price of two mana.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/li/li117_burntCards1.jpg)But if games are being dominated by big threats and powerful spells, then being able to scorch little critters won't always be too important. For example, [Forked Bolt](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Forked+Bolt) was a decent card in *Rise of the Eldrazi* drafts—but there were plenty of more attractive options to choose from in the set.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/li/li117_burntCards2.jpg)While in a slower format, you would commonly have to use your [Arc Trail](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arc+Trail) to trade one-for-one with a low-end creature; in *Scars of Mirrodin*, when everyone's deck is full of 1- and 2-toughness creatures, it becomes pretty amazing.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/li/li117_burntCards3.jpg)[Arc Trail](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arc+Trail) is one of the best cards in the format. Everyone plays with an abundance of 1- and 2-toughness creatures—so killing a [Silver Myr](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Silver+Myr) and a [Chrome Steed](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chrome+Steed), or a [Plague Stinger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plague+Stinger) and a [Contagious Nim](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Contagious+Nim), or a [Goblin Gaveleer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Goblin+Gaveleer) and a [Sunspear Shikari](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sunspear+Shikari), or even a [Spikeshot Elder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spikeshot+Elder) and an [Embersmith](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Embersmith) on your third turn is a pretty common occurrence.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/li/li117_burntCards4.jpg)So a card like [Arrest](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arrest), which can deal with pretty much anything for a reasonable—but not altogether cheap—price, would be a stronger pick than [Arc Trail](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arc+Trail) in a slower format, like *Rise of the Eldrazi* Limited. But in *Scars of Mirrodin*, I will take [Arc Trail](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arc+Trail) over pretty much anything but the bombiest of bombs, like [Carnifex Demon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Carnifex+Demon).


It just does so much for so little mana.


While [Galvanic Blast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Galvanic+Blast) isn't quite up to [Arc Trail](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arc+Trail)'s level in *Scars of Mirrodin* Limited, it's still an excellent card to start your draft with.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/li/li117_blast.jpg)For only one mana, you get an answer to:



> 
> * Mana Myr. If you are on the draw, will mean that you will prevent your opponent from playing a four-drop before you even get a chance to play your third land. Additionally, because many players skimp on lands in order to jam more artifacts (notably mana Myr) into their decks, then you have a good chance of mana-screwing or color-screwing your opponent. That can leave him or her floundering around without casting spells for turns holding a hand full of very strong cards that are uncastable because you killed that mana Myr.
> * Infect creatures. If you can stop your opponent's poisonous onslaught early, then you stand a very good chance of taking over the game later. But if you let your opponent hammer you with [Plague Stinger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Plague+Stinger)s and [Contagious Nim](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Contagious+Nim)s, then you probably aren't going to live long enough to cast your most powerful spells.
> * Evasion creatures. Cards like [Glint Hawk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glint+Hawk), [Glint Hawk Idol](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glint+Hawk+Idol), and [Neurok Invisimancer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Neurok+Invisimancer) can grind away at your life total pretty rapidly. If you don't have a lot of pressure, and you don't find answers for your opponent's evasion creatures, then you are probably going to lose. So go ahead and [Galvanic Blast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Galvanic+Blast) that [Neurok Invisimancer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Neurok+Invisimancer) before you're on 8 life (then 6 life, then 4 life, then 2 life, then reaching for your sideboard).
> * Powerful utility creatures like [Myrsmith](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Myrsmith) and [Spikeshot Elder](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spikeshot+Elder) will also meet their end at the hands of a [Galvanic Blast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Galvanic+Blast).
> 


You can use a well-timed [Galvanic Blast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Galvanic+Blast) to break up your opponent's metalcraft at instant speed, often leading to disastrous results for your opponent, from which you will, of course, be able to reap benefits. (It's a lot easier to take out a 2/2 [Chrome Steed](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Chrome+Steed) in combat than a 4/4 one).



![Galvanic Blast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Galvanic+Blast)

  

 And that's just if you are using [Galvanic Blast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Galvanic+Blast) to shock things for 2 damage!


If you end up with a bunch of artifacts allowing you to reliably turn on metalcraft, then that's gravy (and gravy does go quite well with a crispy opponent ...). This makes it that much more likely that you will be able to burn your opponent, who foolishly thinks that he or she is safe at 4 life with a locked down board, right out of the game.


Throw a [Necrogen Censer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Necrogen+Censer) or another [Galvanic Blast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Galvanic+Blast) into the equation and all of a sudden you have more reach than even the tallest boxers—allowing you to take down opponents who are sitting at a very healthy 8 life without breaking a sweat.


### Flexibility


Burn spells that can target either creatures or players (such as the aforementioned [Galvanic Blast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Galvanic+Blast)) tend to be amongst the most flexible removal spells that you can find. The [Galvanic Blast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Galvanic+Blast)s of the world that can not only take out your opponent's best creatures, but also deliver that finishing blow to your opponent who mistakenly thought that he or she would be safe at 4 life against your metalcraft deck—tend to be really special.


But the ability to kill creatures tends to be the much more important part of burn spells.

Flame Slash

Turn to Slag

This is why cards like [Flame Slash](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Flame+Slash), or [Turn to Slag](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Turn+to+Slag), that can only target creatures are still great while cards like [Necrogen Censer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Necrogen+Censer) have pretty limited applications.


### Putting Your Burn to Good Use


You don't really need to do anything special to make [Arc Trail](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Arc+Trail) and [Galvanic Blast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Galvanic+Blast) work other than running a few [Mountain](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Mountain)s (and of course [Galvanic Blast](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Galvanic+Blast) gets better if you are playing a metalcraft deck, but that's beside the point), but burn spells that can only target opponents require a certain set of conditions to be good for you.



![Necrogen Censer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Necrogen+Censer)

  

 [Necrogen Censer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Necrogen+Censer) is really good in aggressive white metalcraft decks that have a [Glint Hawk](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Glint+Hawk) or two to reset it, or fast black-red decks that happen to have a [Contagion Clasp](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Contagion+Clasp)—and a [Throne of Geth](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Throne+of+Geth) to toss some extra counters on it. But even if you don't have any ways to abuse [Necrogen Censer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Necrogen+Censer), you still might want to include it in hyper-aggressive decks, particularly ones that have a metalcraft subtheme ([Necrogen Censer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Necrogen+Censer)s and [Bleak Coven Vampires](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Bleak+Coven+Vampires) are a fine way to kill people).


Next let's look at [Exsanguinate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Exsanguinate) (okay, this, unlike [Necrogen Censer](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Necrogen+Censer), actually drains—but I'm hoping you will give me a pass).


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/li/li117_ex.jpg)Have you ever drafted a [Fireball](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fireball), or a [Blaze](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blaze), or a [Demonfire,](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Demonfire%2C) or a [Consume Spirit,](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Consume+Spirit%2C) or some other ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20160829100442im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/x.gif) spell and then felt extremely reluctant to ever use it to kill a creature?


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/li/li117_3Cards1.jpg)Maybe you break down and [Fireball](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fireball) that [Spined Wurm](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spined+Wurm) because you don't want to get hammered for 5 damage a turn ... but you aren't happy about doing it because you really wanted to save that [Fireball](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fireball) to finish your opponent off—with a giant ball of fire!


Yet you probably have no problem passing around an [Exsanguinate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Exsanguinate) late, or even leaving it in the sideboard of your black deck.


See the problem?


The reason why [Exsanguinate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Exsanguinate) is an okay card is because it's only a finisher. And investing a card in your deck that can only be used to kill opponents who are already at a reasonably low life total just isn't always worth it—especially if you are trying to win by attrition, or with powerful bombs.



![Exsanguinate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Exsanguinate)

  

 The reason why cards like [Fireball](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fireball) or [Blaze](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blaze) are so good is because of how flexible they are, and how much potential is embodied within them. Yes, you will frequently use your [Fireball](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fireball) to kill your opponent. But you will also use it to kill that 5/4, or that flyer, that is giving you fits. And if you're having mana problems, you might even use it to off one of your opponent's aggressive creatures.


But [Exsanguinate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Exsanguinate) can do one thing and one thing only.


Sure if you have an [Exsanguinate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Exsanguinate) in your deck, you are going to be able to kill a lot of your opponents with it—but you are also going to have a lot of games where it just kind of sits in your hand while your opponent ends up playing one more threat than you can deal with. Eventually you drain your opponent for 5 to get an extra turn, but it doesn't matter, because you don't end up drawing what you need.


The lesson here is twofold:


**One:** Don't take [Exsanguinate](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Exsanguinate)s too early.


**Two:** You are probably playing your [Fireball](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fireball)s and [Blaze](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blaze)s wrong. Unless you have a deck that desperately needs a way to win, you should not think of your [Fireball](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fireball)s and [Blaze](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Blaze)s as finishers that occasionally can be used as removal spells (but only under desperate circumstances). Instead think of them as multi-purpose cards that can be used to fit whatever your needs are that game.


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/images/magic/daily/li/li117_fireball.jpg)Need a finisher? Then hold onto your ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20160829100442im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/x.gif) spell until you can torch your opponent out of the room.


Need a removal spell? Poof, your opponent's creature is gone.


Need some insurance for later? Then hold onto your [Fireball](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fireball) until your opponent casts a [Baneslayer Angel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Baneslayer+Angel) or falls low enough on life for you to be able to burn him or her out with a single spell.
