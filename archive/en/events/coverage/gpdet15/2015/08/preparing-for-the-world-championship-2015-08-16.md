Grand Prix Detroit features of number of the game’s top players competing for a berth in the Top 4, and undoubtedly some of them will make it to the final table and leave their mark on the motor city.


But for a few, there’s a little more on their plates than making a run at the Top 4.


The 2015 *Magic* World Championship kicks off on Aug. 27 at PAX Prime in Seattle, WA, and there’s no bigger event on the calendar. Twenty-four of the best players in the world will be on hand to compete, and the winner will earn a spot in *Magic* history.


Given that, it’s easy to understand why some of the pros in Detroit have spent a little more time preparing for the multi-format event than anything else.

“I’ve taken a little time to relax after the Pro Tour, but this week (11th-ranked and also qualified for Worlds) Jacob Wilson is coming to my house and we’re going to test in-person and collaborate with some others online, doing some *Modern Masters 2015* drafts and working on Standard and Modern. Modern is a little unexplored because people haven’t really had the chance to test the new cards for it. Standard is about metagaming. There’s 24 people, and if you can find a good metagame deck, it’s really, really big, even if it’s not a good deck in a vacuum.


“I’m definitely going to do more preparation than last time I was qualified. I didn’t prepare very much, and I very much regret it. Hopefully I can put up a good performance.”


**(6) Seth Manfield**

“I feel good about *Modern Masters 2015* draft. I’ve done a good amount of drafts and I’ve been playing the *Magic Origins* Limited format so I feel good about that. The last Pro Tour was Standard format, so I’ve really been focusing on Modern. I don’t know what everyone is going to play, but for the most part I think people will be playing normal decks — if you consider Goryo’s Vengeance normal — so I want to be prepared for that.


“My whole goal was to make Worlds, it’s such an exclusive event and it’s great. I’m nervous because every round is against someone really good obviously, but I’m really looking forward to it.”

“I’m doing a lot of drafting to get ready. I’m skipping the World *Magic* Cup qualifier to lock myself in a room with (seventh-ranked and also-qualified) Brad Nelson next week to prepare and go hard.


“One of the huge things about it is the Pro Points you can get. It really gives you a leg up for the year, and I want to have the best finish I can. And hey, if you just win you get Platinum.”
