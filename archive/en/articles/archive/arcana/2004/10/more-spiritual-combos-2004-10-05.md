The mortals of the plane of Kamigawa are at war with its kami -- and there are kami everywhere and in everything! That's of course bad for Kamigawa's mortals, but good for you: it means there are more **spirit-involving casual combos** for your next deck (even though [Combo Week](http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/feature/232) is over).


![He Who Hungers](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=He+Who+Hungers)Combine [He Who Hungers](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=He+Who+Hungers) with [Spirit Cairn](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spirit+Cairn). Every time someone cycles a [Lonely Sandbar](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lonely+Sandbar) or pumps a [Wild Mongrel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wild+Mongrel), you can make another Spirit token that [He Who Hungers](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=He+Who+Hungers) can munch for a tasty [Coercion](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Coercion) effect. Or cycle [Eternal Dragon](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Eternal+Dragon) (also a spirit) yourself... 
 ![Karmic Guide](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Karmic+Guide)Combine [Karmic Guide](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Karmic+Guide) with [Sire of the Storm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Sire+of+the+Storm) or [Thief of Hope](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Thief+of+Hope). You'll get a card or a 1-point [Drain Life](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Drain+Life) when [Karmic Guide](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Karmic+Guide) comes into play, plus bring back a creature due to the Guide's ability. Then next turn, don't pay the echo on [Karmic Guide](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Karmic+Guide), and sacrifice a Soulshift creature like [Kami of Lunacy](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kami+of+Lunacy) or [Vine Kami](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Vine+Kami) to get the Guide back for another round.
 ![Earthshaker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Earthshaker)Combine [Earthshaker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Earthshaker) with [Phantom Tiger](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phantom+Tiger) or [other "phantom" creatures](http://gatherer.wizards.com/default.asp?term=phantom&fields=%7Cname&format=Judgment&color=All&output=summary&sort=cost&first=1). The [Earthshaker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Earthshaker) triggers when you play the Tiger, since the Tiger is a Spirit. [Earthshaker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Earthshaker)'s effect won't damage the Tiger since it's still on the stack, but any other phantom creatures in play at the time will just have a counter removed and keep them from dying.
 ![Revenant](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Revenant)Combine [Revenant](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Revenant) with [Iname, Death Aspect](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Iname%2C+Death+Aspect). The black Iname pumps up your graveyard with dead Spirits to make [Revenant](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Revenant) an unholily large flyer. (Yes, unholily!)
 ![Lavaborn Muse](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Lavaborn+Muse)Combine [Nezumi Bone-Reader](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nezumi+Bone-Reader) with [Nuisance Engine](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nuisance+Engine) and [Lavaborn Muse](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lavaborn+Muse). The [Nuisance Engine](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Nuisance+Engine) gives you an endless source of creatures to sacrifice to the Bone-Reader, which then keeps your opponent's hand small so that the Spirit [Lavaborn Muse](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Lavaborn+Muse) can kick round after round of free damage.
