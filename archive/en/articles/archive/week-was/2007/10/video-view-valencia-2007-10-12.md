We are trying something a little different this week at TWTW. I am typing this from Valencia, Spain on the cusp of the final Pro Tour before the 2007 **Magic** World Championships. Normally I would wander around, trying to get a sense of what people are playing, and interview players about the Extended format. Then I noticed my editor was sitting about five feet from me and the video crew that we use for the Tournament Center was separated from us by a precarious divider of pipe and drape. Sounds like the perfect formula for a pregame show...


The format is Extended and nobody seems quite sure what to expect. The talk for the past few weeks has been about the absurd speed and power of a Dredge-based deck capable of killing on turn two, but on the floor of the Pro Tour during player registration the talk has been about everything else—and I mean everything. While 280 players were fighting in the Last Chance Qualifier for the final remaining slots Thursday night, it seemed like just as many people already invited were grappling with what deck to play. 


According the Kenji Tsumura, there are eight viable archetypes this weekend: Dredge, Goblins, Affinity, Counterbalance, Balancing Tings, Enduring Ideal, TEPS, and of course whatever unnamed archetype he is playing. Other players put the number as high as 20 when discussing playable deck choices. If you go by the dealers' tables for the scouting report on sold-out cards, you will learn that [Kami of Ancient Law](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Kami+of+Ancient+Law), [Ghostly Prison](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ghostly+Prison), and [Delusions of Mediocrity](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Delusions+of+Mediocrity) are all out of stock. Discuss among yourselves...

### Firestarter: Your Questions Answered...


So like I said, we have this camera crew here and these forums seem to work fine...what would you like to ask the Pros this weekend about playing on the Pro Tour, preparing for events, or for their opinions about the new set? Post your questions in the forums and I will do a segment where I get selected questions answered in a special Tournament Center.
