Day 2 Coverage



1960 players took part in this weekend’s Standard Grand Prix here in Shizuoka. In the end, it was Atsushi Nakashima who outlasted the competition to remain the final man standing!


Piloting Golgari Midrange to perfection, Nakashima used Doom Whisperer to find Find // Finality in the very final game of the weekend. His finals opponent Takuya Natsume was playing Selesnya Tokens and had an overwhelming board position. However, the army was entirely wiped out with Finality. All Nakashima had to do was to seal the deal with an 8/8 flying, trampling monstrosity which Natsume had no answer to.


The Top 8 consisted of seven first-timers, namely Atsushi Nakashima, Toshihiro Saida, Takuya Natsume, Hiroaki Nuruki, Ryota Shimazaki, Kazuya Yokota, Masayasu Tanahashi, and Yoshitsugu Aoki. The only player to boast any Top 8 experience was Pro Tour Kyoto 2009 Top 8 competitor, Masayasu Tanahashi, who also had three other Grand Prix Top 8s to his name.


Nonetheless, all the battles were hard-fought, and all the victories were well-deserved! Once again, congratulations to Atsushi Nakashima once again for winning Grand Prix Shizuoka (Standard) 2018!
