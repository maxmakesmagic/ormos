*Onslaught*'s [Festering Goblin](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Festering+Goblin) gets some attention because it is a color that normally isn't associated with its creature type -- a black Goblin. But is it the first black goblin? No.


There were two multicolored goblins in *The Dark*, [Scarwood Goblins](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Scarwood+Goblins) and [Marsh Goblins](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Marsh+Goblins). These cards are significant for several reason.


* They were the first multicolored creatures printed that were not creature type Legend.
* They were the first black and green Goblins. To date, there is still no other green Goblin in Magic (so much for the Spider-Man deck).
* For some reason, unlike gold cards before and after them, they have "reminder text" regarding how to handle their two-colored nature.
* They were not part of a five-card cycle. They, along with the ![](https://web.archive.org/web/20161227195556im_/http://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/black.gif)![](https://web.archive.org/web/20220123123600im_/https://magic.wizards.com/sites/all/modules/custom/wiz_autocard/wiz_manacost/manasymbols/green.gif) enchantment [Dark Heart of the Wood](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dark+Heart+of+the+Wood), were the only multicolored cards in the set. To make room for them, there was one fewer black, green, and red common in *The Dark*.

Nowadays these cards pale beside more recent two-mana gold creatures like [Spined Sliver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spined+Sliver) and [Shivan Zombie](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Shivan+Zombie), but they're still fun to throw into your Goblin deck for old times' sake!
