Mike started playing Magic with Ice Age and became the copy editor for DailyMTG.com in December, 2011. He is steward for both Card of the Day and Decks of the Week. Before DailyMTG, he was an editor on D&D's Dragon magazine for a few years. He lives in Renton with his wife and a handful of chickens. 





You've probably heard about [*Modern Masters* (2015 Edition)](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/arcana/announcing-modern-masters-2015-edition-2014-12-08) by now. But lost in all the excitement of both Worlds Week and the well-publicized announcement was a cool little teaser trailer created by our video editor, Garth. Check it out!
