From the [*Dark Ascension* FAQ](/en/node/633946): *Playing a card exiled with Fiend of the Shadows follows all the normal rules for playing that card. You must pay its costs, and you must follow all timing restrictions, for example. You may only play the card, meaning play it as a land or cast it as a spell. It's not in your hand. You can't discard it, activate its cycling abilities, and so on.* 
![262860](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&multiverseid=262860)**[Drogskol Reaver](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=262860)** – *Dark Ascension* mythic rare. From the [*Dark Ascension* FAQ](/en/node/633946): *The ability triggers just once for each life-gaining event, no matter how much life was gained. If a creature with lifelink you control deals damage to multiple creatures, players, and/or planeswalkers at the same time, the ability will trigger just once. The damage dealt by that creature is a single life-gaining event.*

![Elvish House Party](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Elvish+House+Party)**[Elvish House Party](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Elvish+House+Party)** – *Unhinged* uncommon. Remember, even when you're playing with *Un-* cards, it's unsporting to wait several hours before you attack.
 ![175134](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&multiverseid=175134)**[Steward of Valeron](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=175134)** – *Shards of Alara* common. The [Steward of Valeron](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Steward+of+Valeron) wears armor that is characteristic of Bant knights. It's mostly defensive, hampering the wearers offensive attacks. It's very showy, designed to reflect the sun in its metallic curves to signal honor to the angels above. And it doesn't protect the back, because on Bant, all attacks come head-on.
 ![Phyrexian Dreadnought](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Phyrexian+Dreadnought)**[Phyrexian Dreadnought](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phyrexian+Dreadnought)** – *Mirage* rare. When *Mirage* came out, [Phyrexian Dreadnought](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Phyrexian+Dreadnought) was the biggest creature that **Magic** had ever seen. Since then, the 12/12 has been surpassed, bit by bit. Not counting [silver-bordered creatures](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=9844), the current champ is the 15/15 [Emrakul, the Aeons Torn](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Emrakul%2C+the+Aeons+Torn).
 ![It That Betrays](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=It+That+Betrays)**[It That Betrays](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=It+That+Betrays)** – *Rise of the Eldrazi* rare. Doesn't it seem like a bad idea to have something called "[It That Betrays](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=It+That+Betrays)" on your team? That's just asking for some kind of, well, betrayal.
 ![26733](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&multiverseid=26733)**[Dodecapod](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=26733)** – *Apocalypse* uncommon. In the days of yore (around 2001), [Dodecapod](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Dodecapod) was a great card to sideboard in against discard decks. It wasn't clever, but it got the job done.
