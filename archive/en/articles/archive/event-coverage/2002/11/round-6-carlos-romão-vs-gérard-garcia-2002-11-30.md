![Psychatog](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Psychatog)Carlos Romão is the current World Champion. The Brazilian player is currently visiting France before moving onto Spain. He's playing the same archetype that brought him success at World's – [Psychatog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psychatog). His opponent, Gérard Garcia, has performed well at GP's this year with a top 8 at London. He brought the Rock to the table.The disadvantage of being known for a specific archetype became apparent quickly as Garcia opened with turn 1 [Cabal Therapy](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cabal+Therapy) and correctly guessed [Psychatog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psychatog). A barrage of Therapies left the Brazilian down to a [Force Spike](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Force+Spike) and some land. An [Intuition](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Intuition) followed by [Accumulated Knowledge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Accumulated+Knowledge) for 4 cards soon repaired the damage. Garcia hadn't really been able to capitalize, only being able to attack with a lone [Treetop Village](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treetop+Village).

The Frenchman Tutored then summoned a [Genesis](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Genesis) that went through unopposed. Romão built up his hand a bit more with an end of turn [Fact or Fiction](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fact+or+Fiction). Strangely Garcia chose to split it land and spells.

[Treetop Village](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treetop+Village) and [Genesis](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Genesis) crashed in to leave the World Champion at 2. He countered a first flashback Therapy and Garcia chose not to flashback the second, keeping a Bird of Paradise to soak up any edicts.

In his turn Romão thought for a long time before laying a land and then discarding [Wonder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Wonder) in his end step. Garcia attacked for the kill only for Romão to wish for [Hibernation](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hibernation) and return all his creatures back to his hand. Romão then chose to counter the [Birds](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Birds). In his turn he drew a card and passed the turn.

Garcia laid a second [Treetop Village](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Treetop+Village) and again tried to attack for the game. With only one Edict in hand Romão couldn't stop the first village.

Garcia 1-0 Romão

![Fact or Fiction](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Fact+or+Fiction)Game 2 started badly for Garcia. He mulliganed and then stuck at two land. He summoned a Bird of Paradise that Romão let onto the table. An end of turn [Fact or Fiction](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fact+or+Fiction) couldn't have looked good for Garcia as he was forced to split it [Diabolic Edict](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Diabolic+Edict), [Diabolic Edict](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Diabolic+Edict), or [Counterspell](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterspell) and two land. Romão already had an Edict so he took the second pile, then [Duress](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress)ed away a deed and killed the bird in his turn.Finally Garcia found a third land and started dropping [Spike Feeder](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Spike+Feeder)s. They team blocked one of Romão's two tog's and bumped up Garcia's life total. Then the Frenchman started a war of attrition on Romão's graveyard and hand, throwing an Elder in the way on the next turn.

A 4th Edict from Romão disposed of a second Elder and in the same end of turn step Romão [Intuition](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Intuition)ed for two knowledges and a [Deep Analysis](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deep+Analysis) to bulk his hand up. The Tog's swung then the big Up's reset the board. A bird kept it at bay for a turn but the next saw a [Psychatog](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Psychatog) rampage through for lethal damage with [Counterspell](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterspell) at the ready for a last-ditch [Diabolic Edict](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Diabolic+Edict) from Garcia.

Garcia 1-1 Romão

![Upheaval](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?type=card&name=Upheaval)Garcia opened again with [Cabal Therapy](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Cabal+Therapy), naming [Counterspell](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Counterspell) this time and missing as Romão was holding land and card drawing in the form of two [Deep Analysis](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deep+Analysis), [Brainstorm](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Brainstorm) and [Accumulated Knowledge](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Accumulated+Knowledge). He followed with a [Duress](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Duress) and Bird of Paradise while Romão cast the knowledge.Garcia was again having land problems. The reasoning on not sacrificing the bird to Therapy Romão became clear when he failed to make a land the next turn, summoning [Pernicious Deed](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Pernicious+Deed). An Elder followed to give Garcia hope. Romão pecked away with a Tog while Garcia came back at him with an Elder.

While Garcia built up his mana base Romão built up his hand with [Deep Analysis](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Deep+Analysis).

Time was called with the game in Stalemate. Garcia couldn't really win but his opponent had a deck easily capable of ending the game in one turn. Garcia had to sit on the Deed with 3 mana open and hope Romão didn't have another tog and [Upheaval](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Upheaval) in hand.

In extra turns Garcia went for a [Ravenous Baloth](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ravenous+Baloth) to try and put his life total out of danger. A [Fact or Fiction](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Fact+or+Fiction) netted Romão 4 cards at the expense of a 'tog. He wished at end of turn for a [Hibernation](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Hibernation). The World Champion was running out of turns. He Hibernated in the third extra turn. Garcia sacrificed the Baloth for 4 life and blew the deed to take down the tog. Romão laid another Tog to make things nervy for the Frenchman. He cast another deed. Romão didn't have a counter so the game ended in a draw.

**Final Result:** Gérard Garcia 1-1 Carlos Romão
