Ah, new sets. A fertile ground of Arcana topics, you might think. And you'd be right, too!


Since it's Domain Week, let's start with [Worldly Counsel](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Worldly+Counsel), shall we?


![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/arcana/122_WCfull.jpg)Nice work by Matt Cavotta, right? But there's more than meets the eye. [Start your journey of discovery](javascript:void(0);)!



![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/arcana/122_WCclouds.jpg)We're going to start with these clouds up here. Notice anything odd about them? [Isolate the chunk on the left](javascript:void(0);)! (or [go back](javascript:void(0);))



![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/arcana/122_WCgreen.jpg)Interesting. Those protrusions on the bottom look kind of like trunks. So these clouds are kind of... treelike. A symbol of green mana, one might say. [How about that castle](javascript:void(0);)? (or [go back](javascript:void(0);))



![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/arcana/122_WCwhite.jpg)Yep, that's the sort of castle you get with white mana, all right. [Show the thing in front of it](javascript:void(0);). (or [go back](javascript:void(0);))



![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/arcana/122_WCblue.jpg)Waterfalls? Reminiscent of blue mana? The theme is becoming clear here. [Rush to the right](javascript:void(0);). (or [go back](javascript:void(0);))



![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/arcana/122_WCblack.jpg)Yikes! A black-aligned fire swamp! I suppose these last things [are going to be mountains?](javascript:void(0);). (or [go back](javascript:void(0);))



![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/arcana/122_WCred.jpg)Yes, Mountains. So we've got five sections of clouds, representing the five types of basic land. Very Domain-y. But [what's with the three middle sections](javascript:void(0);)? (or [go back](javascript:void(0);))



![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/arcana/122_WCesper.jpg)It looks like there's the *possibility* of five different colors here, but the mage is only fully accessing White, Blue, and Black. What sort of [mage would be restricted like that](javascript:void(0);)? (or [go back](javascript:void(0);))



![](https://media.magic.wizards.com/image_legacy_migration/mtg/images/daily/arcana/122_WCfull.jpg)Of course! It's a Domain Spell being cast by an Esper mage! [Start over](javascript:void(0);). (or [go back](javascript:void(0);))
