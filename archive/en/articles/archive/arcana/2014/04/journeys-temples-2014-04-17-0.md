 Mike first played with Ice Age and became the copy editor for DailyMTG.com in December 2011. Before DailyMTG, he was an editor on D&D's Dragon magazine for four years. 







Trick asked me to write today's Arcana and I knew exactly what I wanted to do. [I've established before](/en/articles/archive/heading-temple-2014-02-17) that I'm a big fan of the [Temples](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?output=spoiler&method=visual&action=advanced&format=+%5B%22Theros+Block%22%5D&type=+%5B%22Land%22%5D&name=+%5BTemple%5D) of *Theros* block, and *Journey into Nyx* completes our cycle of ten. Huzzah! 


 Since they went into the [Card Image Gallery](https://www.wizards.com/Magic/tcg/article.aspx?x=mtg/tcg/journeyintonyx/cig#)  without much fanfare, I will give these two the attention you probably figured I eventually would, anyway. Here they are again as cards:
