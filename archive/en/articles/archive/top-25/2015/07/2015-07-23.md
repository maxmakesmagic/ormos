All is quiet on the *Magic* Top 25 Pro Rankings front for another week as players gird their loins for the end of the year push for Pro Points. *Magic Origins* is the new kid on the block, and even the best of the best have been Releasing and Prereleasing over the past few weeks, leading to no changes in this week's rankings once again.



But that may be the last time we can say that before the end of the 2014–15 Premier Play season, which concludes with [Pro Tour *Magic Origins*](http://magic.wizards.com/en/protour/ori/pro-tour-magic-origins-event-information) July 31–August 2. At that time we'll know all of the various awards players earned for their performances over the past year, from Rookie of the Year all the way up to Player of the Year. You won't want to miss the shifts that happen that weekend, as Pro Tours offer truly momentous swings that rock the rankings from 1 to 25.



One race, however, that will be decided prior to the Pro Tour is the World Championship slot for the player with the most points earned from Grand Prix. No. 25 Alexander Hayne leads fellow countryman Pascal Maynard by only a few points. It wouldn't be surprising to see both in attendance at [Grand Prix Dallas/Fort Worth](http://magic.wizards.com/en/content/fact-sheet-grand-prix-dallasfort-worth-2015) this weekend, each trying to eke out their last few Grand Prix points of the season to secure a spot in the World Championship.



Join us next week for one final look before the Pro Tour sets all the pieces in their place.
