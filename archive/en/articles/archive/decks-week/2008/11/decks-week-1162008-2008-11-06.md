What a week! Luis Scott-Vargas beat all the odds to take Pro Tour-Berlin in stunning fashion! You can read all about it on [the official event coverage page](/en/node/502416). Of course, we've got the Top 8 and Day 2 decklists (and stay tuned for next week when Decks of the Week will have all Day 1 decklists too!).

The Legion Events' Cruise Qualifier season is also chugging right along, and we've got two more events to add for this week. You can read more about The Magic Cruise on the official [Legion Events Cruise page](/en/events/coverage/magic-cruise-qualifying-season-top-8-decklists). It's a pretty awesome opportunity to enjoy a tropical cruise *and* **Magic** all at the same time! As if that's not all, the decks from the Top 8s this week serve as excellent warmups for the State Championships, happening this upcoming weekend (Nov. 7). For more information on those and how to find an event near you, visit [MTGChamps.com](http://mtgchamps.com/).

But wait, there's more! PTQ decklists from last week's events qualifying players for Pro Tour–Kyoto are in, *and* we've got Premier Event decklists from **Magic Online**! So what are you waiting for? These lists aren't going to read themselves!
