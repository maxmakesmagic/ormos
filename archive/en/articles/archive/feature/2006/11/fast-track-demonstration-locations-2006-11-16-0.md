*Updated 2006-11-16*

Come to one of the participating Magic: The Gathering retailers to receive a game-play demo and to collect your FREE Fast Track Starter Packs\*.

One of the best and fun ways to learn Magic: The Gathering is to learn from someone who knows how to play. If you don’t have a friend who can teach you how to play, why don’t you come to one of these stores to receive a personal game-play demo and also to collect FREE Fast Track Starter Game\*?

Don’t forget – If you don’t have a friend who knows Magic: The Gathering or can’t visit one of the stores below, you can still learn through the online demo site ([www.PlayMagic.com](http://www.PlayMagic.com)) or from the Core Game Starter which can be bought at most Magic: The Gathering retailers.

Here’s a list of participating Magic: The Gathering retailers you can visit for a demo. Please give them a call or send an email to check their availability or opening hours to make sure you can get the best demo possible when you get down there.

Don’t forget to collect your FREE Fast Track Starter Pack\*!!!
