With all the color-shifting going on, it's easy to miss *Planar Chaos's Time-Spiral*-like art references. Although *Planar Chaos* is built around Dominaria's alternate past, nostalgia still plays a strong part in the set as it showcases twists on familiar abilities in the guises of other colors.

The [Magus cycle](http://ww2.wizards.com/gatherer/index.aspx?term=magus&Field_Name=on&Field_Rules=on&Field_Type=on&setfilter=Planar%20Chaos) recalls powerful lands from the past. [Ana Battlemage](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Ana+Battlemage) and [Auramancer's Guise](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Auramancer%27s+Guise) add new cards to cycles that have gone before. Slivers recreate the effects of powerful enemy-colored gold cards of old.

The powerful red creature [Stingscourger](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=Stingscourger) shows off red's alternate-reality "bounce opponents' creatures" theme, alongside [Dead](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?&name=Dead). Note that its art gives a nod to the 2/2's scyphozoan heritage.
