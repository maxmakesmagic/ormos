In*Lorwyn*, giants were reclusive and aloof, but still recognizable. They could, as this image from the *Lorwyn* Style Guide suggests, occasionally have a conversation with a kithkin:

> *The towering giants have slept for so long that they have melded with the world itself. They now lumber across Shadowmoor in a state of feral half-consciousness. Shadowmoor’s giants are like bears whose hibernation has been interrupted. They act according to the basest of urges, and when those urges can’t be sated, they grow angry.*

These giants have merged with the land itself:
